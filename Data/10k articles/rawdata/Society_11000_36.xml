The '''Areni-1 shoe''' is a 5,500-year-old [[leather]] shoe that was found in 2008 in excellent condition in the [[Areni-1 cave]] located in the [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/09/worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-found-in-armenia-2/ |title=World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved |last=Dindar |first=Shereen |work=National Post |location=Canada  |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a one-piece leather-hide shoe, the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world known to contemporary researchers.&lt;!-- the range of accuracy in dating methods may have quite a large variable, depending upon what is stated for this dating, it could make little difference that a few hundred years difference is claimed and make the find merely contemporary with that found in Germany --&gt; The discovery was made by an international team led by  [[Boris Gasparyan]], an archaeologist from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]] (co-directors of the project are [[Ron Pinhasi]] from [[University College Cork]] in [[Ireland]], and [[Gregory Areshian]] from [[UCLA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient shoe steps out of cave and into limelight |author=Bruce Bower |newspaper=Science News |date=July 3, 2010 |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60099/title/Ancient_shoe_steps_out_of_cave_and_into_limelight |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
An Armenian post-graduate student, [[Diana Zardaryan]], discovered the leather shoe in the course of excavations by a team of archeologists from Armenia’s [[Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography]], Ireland and the United States.&lt;ref name="ArmLib-June12-2010"&gt;[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2069047.html ''Oldest Leather Shoe A ‘Dream’ Find For Armenian Scientist''], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), June 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The shoe was found upside down at the base of a shallow, rounded, and plastered pit that was {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|44|–|48|cm|abbr=on}} wide, beneath an overturned broken [[Chalcolithic]] ceramic bowl.&lt;ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010984 |title=First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands |work=PLOS One |first1=Ron |last1=Pinhasi |first2=Boris |last2=Gasparian |first3=Gregory |last3=Areshian |first4=Diana |last4=Zardaryan |first5=Alexia |last5=Smith |first6=Guy |last6=Bar-Oz |first7=Thomas |last7=Higham |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broken pot and goat horns also were found nearby. Excavations in the same area also found [[Areni-1 winery|the world's oldest wine-making site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12158341 |title='Oldest known wine-making facility' found in Armenia. |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |work=BBC |date=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research was funded by the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[Chitjian Foundation]], the [[Gfoeller Foundation]], the [[Steinmetz Family Foundation]], the [[Boochever Foundation]] and the [[Cotsen Institute of Archaeology]] at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/10/oldest-leather-shoe-steps_n_607264.html |title=Oldest Leather Shoe Steps Out After 5,500 Years |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's findings were published on June 9, 2010, in the journal ''[[PLOS One]]''.

==Analysis==
The shoe was found in near-perfect condition due to the cool and dry conditions in the cave and a thick layer of sheep dung which acted as a solid seal. Large storage containers were found in the same cave, many of which held well-preserved wheat, barley, and [[apricot]]s, as well as other edible plants.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; The shoe contained grass and the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was because the grass was used as insulation to keep the foot warm, or used to preserve the shape of the shoe while not being worn. Lead archaeologist Ron Pinhasi could not determine whether the shoe belonged to a man or a woman. While small, approximately a woman's U.S. and Canada size 7, European size 37, or UK size 6, he stated that "the shoe could well have fitted a man from that era".&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; The [[shoe laces]] were preserved as well.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;

Major similarities exist between the manufacturing technique and style of one-piece leather-hide shoes discovered across Europe and the one reported from Areni-1 Cave, suggesting that shoes of this type were worn for millennia across a large and environmentally diverse geographic region.&lt;ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands"/&gt; According to Pinhasi, the Areni-1 shoe is similar to the Irish ''[[pampooties]]'', a shoe style worn in the [[Aran Islands]] up to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8KRXbqACR1CdoIW6YN9-GE4GjxQ | title = 5,500-year leather mocassin world's oldest shoe |agency=AFP | date = June 10, 2010 | accessdate = June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoes are very similar to the traditional shoes of the Balkans, still seen today in festivals, known as [[Opanci]] (''Opanke'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100609-worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-armenia-science/ National Geographic: ''World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When the material was dated by the two radiocarbon laboratories in [[Oxford]] and California, it was established that the shoe dates back to 3,500&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;!-- the variable should be given as =/- xxx years --&gt;  This date is a few hundred years older than the date given for the leather shoe found on [[Ötzi the Iceman]], 400 years older than those found at [[Stonehenge]], and 1,000 years older than those found at the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/09/oldest-leather-shoe-archaeology/ |title=What's Older Than the Pyramids and Smells Worse Than a Mummy? |publisher=Fox News |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having been treated for preservation, the Areni-1 shoe is on display at the [[History Museum of Armenia]], Yerevan.&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNow.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://armenianow.com/arts_and_culture/23683/ancient_shoe_found_armenia/ |title=Do You Have that in a Size 38?: World’s oldest shoe to go on display in Yerevan |last=Gevorgyan |first=Siranuysh |work=ArmeniaNow.com |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant '''Argentine diaspora in Mexico'''.

The Argentine-Mexican community is sometimes known as '''ArgenMex'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los argenmex y la fiesta patria argentina en México|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/entretenimiento/2014/07/06/argenmex-fiesta-patria-argentina-mexico|publisher=El Economista|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentines have been in Mexico since at least the 1895 census, and periodic migration has continued following the ebb and flow of the [[Argentine economy]]. Both countries share the [[Spanish language]]; their historical origins are common (part of the [[Spanish Empire]]). With two main emigrant waves; during the [[Dirty War|1970s Dirty War]] and after the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|2001 economic crisis]].

The largest Argentine community is in [[Mexico City]] (with a sizeable congregation in the [[Condesa]] neighborhood) and there are smaller communities in Leon, Guadalajara, Puebla, Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Mérida, Monterrey and Tampico. Most Argentines established in Mexico come from the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Cordoba and Tucuman. The Argentine community has participated in the opening of establishments such as restaurants, bars, boutiques, modeling consultants, foreign exchange interbank markets, among other lines of business.

Argentine actors have an important presence in Mexico's [[Television in Mexico|television industry]]. Frequently, actors arrive in Mexico to learn [[neutral Spanish]] (based on Mexican Spanish and used for mass media distributed across Latin America, such as dubbed foreign films,) and remain as they find work with one of the country's major television networks. Notable among these actors are the telenovela ''galanes'' (male leads) [[Juan Soler]] and [[Sebastian Rulli]]. In the music industry, prominent Argentine-Mexicans include [[Amanda Miguel]], [[Fey (singer)|Fey]] and [[Noel Schajris]].

There has been controversy in Mexico over the inclusion of naturalized Mexicans (especially Argentine-Mexicans) on [[Mexico national football team|Mexico's national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naturalizados asaltan el Tri|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/notas-online/deportes/2009/01/20/tri-las-selecciones-mas-naturalizadas-planeta|publisher=El Economista|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments range from [[xenophobic]] ideas to the belief that Argentines have been granted citizenship in order to be eligible players on the team. Nonetheless, Argentines wanting to attain Mexican citizenship have to do so through meeting naturalization and residency requirements.

Estimates of the Arab population of Darfur range from 30 per cent, based on the census of 1956, to the 70 per cent claimed by Arab tribal leaders in a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in September 2007. Given that many Arabs from Chad have settled in Darfur in the last several decades, and that the rate of migration to Sudan’s more developed centre is higher among non-Arabs, who are less dependent on pastoralism, a figure of 40 per cent is probably closer to the mark."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource1911Enc|Baggāra}}
The '''Baggāra''' are a grouping of [[Arab]] ethnic groups inhabiting the portion of Africa's [[Sahel]] mainly between [[Lake Chad]] and southern [[Kordofan]], numbering over one million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.createspace.com/3937136 ''Baggara of Sudan: Culture and Environment - Culture, Traditions and Livelihood''] by Biraima M Adam&lt;/ref&gt; They are known as Baggara in [[Sudan]],{{sfn|Adam, Biraima M.|2012|p=17}} and as Shuwa/Diffa Arabs in [[Chad]] and [[ Nigeria]]. Their name derives from the Arabic word ({{lang-ar|'''بقارة'''}}) literally meaning "cattle herder".{{sfn|Owens|1993|p=11}} 

They have a common language, [[Shuwa Arabic]], which is one of the regional [[varieties of Arabic]]. They also have a common traditional mode of subsistence, nomadic cattle herding, although nowadays many lead a settled existence. Nevertheless, collectively they do not all necessarily consider themselves one people, i.e., a single ethnic group. The term "baggara culture" was introduced in 1994 by Braukämper.{{sfn|Owens|1993|p=11}} 

The political use of the term "baggara" in Sudan denoting a particular set of tribes is limited to Sudan. It often means a coalition of majority Arabs and a few indigenous African tribes (mainly [[Fur (people)|Fur]], [[Nuba]] and [[Fulani|Fallata]]) with other Arab tribes of western Sudan (mainly [[Guhayna]]), as opposed to Bedouin [[Abbala]] Arab tribes. The bulk of "baggara Arabs" live in [[Chad]], the rest live, or seasonally migrate to, southwest [[Sudan]] (specifically the southern portions of [[Darfur]] and [[Kordofan]]), and slivers of the [[Central African Republic]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Niger]]. Those who are still nomads migrate seasonally between grazing lands in the wet season and river areas in the dry season.

Their common language is known to academics by various names, such as [[Chadian Arabic]], taken from the regions where the language is spoken. For much of the 20th century, this language was known to academics as "Shuwa Arabic", but "Shuwa" is a geographically and socially parochial term that has fallen into disuse among linguists specializing in the language, who instead refer to it as  "Chadian Arabic" depending on the origin of the native speakers being consulted for a given academic project.

== Origins and divisions ==
The origin of the Baggara is undetermined. According to a 1994 research paper, the group arose in Chad from 1635 onwards through the fusion of an Arabic speaking population. Like other Arabic speaking tribes in the [[Sahara]] and the Sahel, Baggara tribes have origin ancestry from the [[Juhaynah]] Arab tribes who migrated directly from the Arabian peninsula or from other parts of [[north Africa]]. {{sfn|deWaal and Flint|2006|pp=9}}

Baggara tribes in [[Sudan]] include the [[Gawamaa tribe|Gawamaa]], [[Rizeigat]], [[Ta’isha]], [[Beni Halba]], and [[Habbaniya people|Habbaniya]] in [[Darfur]], and the [[Messiria]] Zurug, Messiria Humur, [[Hawazma]], and [[Awlad Himayd]] in [[Kordofan]], and the Beni Selam on the [[White Nile]]. For complete and accurate account about Baggara tribes, see: [https://www.createspace.com/3937136 ''Baggara of Sudan: Culture and Environment'']. The Misseiria of Jebel Mun speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]], [[Miisiirii language|Miisiirii]], related to the [[Tama language|Tama]] of their traditional neighbors.

The small community of "Baggara Arabs" in the southeastern corner of Niger is known as [[Diffa Arabs]] for the [[Diffa Region]]. They occupy the shore of [[Lake Chad]] and migrated from Nigeria since World War II. Most of the Diffa Arabs claim descent from the [[Mahamid]] clan of Sudan and Chad.{{sfn|DeCalco|1979|pp=31, 179}}

==History==
[[Image:Baggara Arabs Belt.svg|thumb|right|300px|Baggara belt]]
[[Image:Cavalier arabe du Dékakiré sur un cheval caparaçonné.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Arab horseman photographed by French Colonials, at Dékakiré, Chad. c.1910s. From ''L'Afrique Équatoriale Française: le pays, les habitants, la colonisation, les pouvoirs publics''. Préf. de M. Merlin. (published 1918).]] The Baggara of Darfur and [[Kordofan]] were the backbone of the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist]] revolt against Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan in the 1880s. The Mahdi's second-in-command, the Khalifa [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], was himself a Baggara of the Ta'aisha tribe. During the Mahdist period (1883–98) tens of thousands of Baggara migrated to Omdurman and central Sudan where they provided many of the troops for the Mahdist armies. 

After their defeat at the [[Battle of Karari]] in 1898, the remnants returned home to Darfur and Kordofan. Under the British system of indirect rule, each of the major Baggara tribes was ruled by its own paramount chief (''nazir''). Most of them were loyal members of the Umma Party, headed since the 1960s by Sadiq el Mahdi.

The main Baggara tribes of [[Darfur]] were awarded "hawakir" (land grants) by the Fur Sultans in the 1750s. As a result, the four largest Baggara tribes of Darfur—the [[Rizeigat]], [[Habbaniya tribe|Habbaniya]], [[Beni Halba]] and [[Ta’isha]]—have been only marginally involved in the [[Darfur conflict]]. However, the Baggara have been deeply involved in other conflicts in both Sudan and Chad. Starting in 1985, the Government of Sudan armed many of the local tribes among them the [[Rizeigat]] of south Darfur and the [[Messiria]] and [[Hawazma]] of neighboring Kordofan as militia to fight  a proxy war against the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] in their areas.  They formed frontline units as well as ''Murahleen'', mounted raiders that attacked southern villages to loot valuables and slaves.
{{sfn|International Crisis Group|2007|p=2}}

The Baggara people (and subgroups) were armed by the Sudanese government to participate in the counterinsurgency against the [[Sudanese People’s Liberation Army]]. The first attacks against villages by the Baggara were staged in the Nuba Mountains. The Sudanese government promoted attacks by promising the Baggara people no interference so they could seize animals and land. They formed the precursors to the [[Janjaweed]] - an  infamous para-military.&lt;ref name="crest"&gt;Flint, J. and Alex de Waal, 2008 (2nd Edn), Darfur: A new History of a Long War, Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently enslaved by members of the Missiriya and Rezeigat tribes. An unknown number of children from the Nuba tribe were similarly abducted and enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of State, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In Darfur, a Beni Halba militia force was organized by the government to defeat an SPLA force led by [[Daud Bolad]] in 1990-91. However, by the mid-1990s the various Baggara groups had mostly negotiated local truces with the SPLA forces. The leaders of the major Baggara tribes declared that they had no interest in joining the fighting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4937">In [[precolumbian]] [[Aztec society]], a '''calpulli''' (from [[Classical Nahuatl language|Classical Nahuatl]] ''[[wiktionary:calpolli|calpōlli]]'', {{IPA-nah|kaɬˈpoːlːi}}, meaning "large house") was the designation of an organizational unit below the level of the [[altepetl]] "city-state". A Nahua city-state was divided into a number of calpullis, whose inhabitants were collectively responsible for different organizational and religious tasks in relation to the larger altepetl. Calpullis controlled land which was available for calpulli members to cultivate and also operated the [[Tēlpochcalli]] schools for young men of commoner descent. In Aztec culture, as in most other civilizations, the family unit was very important. There were several levels of organization in Aztec family life beginning with the base family unit. The base family unit consisted of two parents and their unmarried children. The main functions of the base family unit were education of the children and food preparation. Many base family units, however, banded together to form extended families. The households of extended families were usually composed of several brothers and their families. The primary functions of the extended families were to coordinate land use and food production (such as growing crops). In most cases, extended families contained just a few base family units. In large cities, however, they often grew to many more.

Although extended families farmed the land, they usually did not own it. They were allowed to use it by the calpulli to which they belonged. Calpulli were groups of families that controlled the use of the land and performed other territorial functions, as well as social ones. The majority of calpulli had a telpuchcalli, a school for young men. Another function of the calpulli was a taxation unit. The empire collected taxes from each calpulli, which in turn collected taxes from its member families.

Most rural calpulli were based on lineage. In other words, the members of a rural calpulli believed that they were descended from a common ancestor. In the cities, the calpulli were based more on geographical, political, and occupational similarities than lineage. In both cases, calpulli were tightly knit and sometimes were even somewhat isolated from other calpulli, both politically and physically.
The nature of the interrelatedness between the members of the calpulli is a matter of debate. Traditionally it has been argued that the calpulli was firstly a family unit in which the inhabitants were related through blood and intermarriage. Other scholars such as Van Zantwijk (1985) deny that this was necessarily the case. Van Zantwijk demonstrates that at least in some altepetl the family-based nature of the calpulli was replaced with a hierarchical structure based on wealth and prestige. Newcomers from other altepetl were allowed to settle down and become part of the calpulli. Michael Smith (2003) shows that in some Nahua cities, notably Otumba, each calpulli specialised in a trade and took almost the form of a trade guild.

==Calpullis of Tenochtitlan==

The wards of [[Tenochtitlan]], the Aztec capital, were also known as ''calpulli''. The exact number of calpullis within the city is not known but Van Zantwijk (1985) based his calculations on a wide array of ethnohistorical sources. Van Zantwijk reached a number of 20 calpullis, 7 of which represented the original founding groups of Tenochtitlan and the remaining 13 being composed by groups coming to the city at later points in its development. Van Zantwijk assumed that each calpulli was ritually connected to one of the twenty day names. Below is a list of the twenty calpullis of Tenochtitlan based on the data from Van Zantwijk (1985):

'''Central Atlas Tamazight''' (also known as Central Morocco Tamazight, Middle Atlas Tamazight, Tamazight, Central Shilha and, rarely, Beraber or Braber; native name: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ ''Tamazight'' {{IPA-tam|tæmæˈzɪɣt], [θæmæˈzɪɣθ|}}) is a [[Berber language]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Central Atlas Tamazight may be referred to as either a Berber language or a Berber dialect. As Berber languages have a some degree of mutual intelligibility, there is little consensus on what is considered a "[[language]]" and what a "[[dialect]]". Additionally, Berber activists like to consider all Berber dialects to be a language to emphasize unity, though this is not entirely linguistically sound (e.g. geographically non-proximate "dialects" may be mutually unintelligible), see {{Harvcoltxt|Brenzinger|2007|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Afroasiatic language family]] spoken by 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;million people in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of Central [[Morocco]] as well as by smaller emigrant communities in [[France]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="eth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt;

Central Atlas Tamazight is one of the most-spoken Berber languages, along with [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], [[Shilha language|Shilha]], [[Riffian language|Riff]], [[Shawiya language|Shawiya]] and [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]. In Morocco, it rivals Shilha as the most-spoken. All five languages may be referred to as "Tamazight", but Central Atlas speakers are the only ones who use the term exclusively. As is typical of Afroasiatic languages, Tamazight has a series of "[[emphatic consonant]]s" (realized as [[pharyngealized]]), [[uvulars]], [[pharyngeals]] and lacks the phoneme /[[Voiceless bilabial plosive|p]]/. Tamazight has a phonemic three-vowel system but also has numerous words without vowels.

Central Atlas Tamazight (unlike neighbouring [[Tashelhit]]) had no known significant writing tradition until the 20th century. It is now officially written in the [[Tifinagh]] script for instruction in Moroccan schools,&lt;ref name="omniglot"&gt;{{cite web

The standard word order is [[verb–subject–object]] but sometimes [[subject–verb–object]].&lt;ref name="am295" /&gt; Words [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender, number and state, using prefixes, suffixes and [[circumfix]]es. [[Verb]]s are heavily inflected, being marked for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[aspect (grammar)|aspect]], [[grammatical mode|mode]], [[voice (grammar)|voice]], [[grammatical person|person]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[grammatical polarity|polarity]], sometimes undergoing [[ablaut]]. Pervasive borrowing from [[Arabic]] extends to all major word classes, including verbs; borrowed verbs, however, are conjugated according to native patterns, including [[ablaut]].&lt;ref name="sadiqi25-26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="am153" /&gt;

== Classification ==
Central Atlas Tamazight is one of the four most-spoken Berber languages, in addition to [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], [[Shilha language|Shilha]], and [[Riffian language|Riff]],&lt;ref name="looklex/berber_l" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EA5-6" /&gt; and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco.&lt;ref name="ethrep" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ross20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ciemen14" /&gt; Differentiating these dialects is complicated by the fact that speakers of other languages may also refer to their language as 'Tamazight'.&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt; The differences between all three groups are largely [[phonology|phonological]] and [[lexicon|lexical]], rather than [[syntax|syntactic]].&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=2" /&gt; Tamazight itself has a relatively large degree of internal diversity, including whether [[spirantization]] occurs.&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stroomer1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kossmann|Stroomer|1997|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Atlas Tamazight speakers refer to themselves as ''Amazigh'' (pl. ''Imazighen''), an [[endonym]]ic [[ethnonym]] whose etymology is uncertain, but may translate as "free people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brenzinger|2007|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Both words are also used self-referentially by other Berber groups to replace local terms such as [[Chleuh|ašəlḥi]] or [[Riffian people|rifi]], although Central Atlas Tamazight speakers use them regularly and exclusively.&lt;ref name="inalco"&gt;{{harvnb|Chaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Using {{angle bracket|gh}} for {{IPA|[ɣ]}} when embedding Berber words in English text follows the tradition set by French-language publications, even those written by Berbers {{Harvcoltxt|Goodman|2005|p=xii}}. The name "Tamazirt" results from French transcription of Tamazight {{IPA|/ɣ/}} with the letter {{angle bracket|r}}, which in French represents the similar-sounding phoneme {{IPA|/ʁ/}}.  Cf. {{Harvcoltxt|Souag|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older studies, Central Atlas Tamazight is sometimes referred to as "Braber" / "Beraber", a dialetical Arabic term, or its Tamazight equivalent "Taberbrit".&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the Standard Arabic and English term "Berber", used to refer to all Berber dialects/languages, though eschewed by many Berbers because its etymology is pejorative.&lt;ref name="multi" /&gt;

Tamazight belongs to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family; Afroasiatic subsumes a number of languages in [[North Africa]] and [[Southwest Asia]] including the [[Semitic languages]], the [[Egyptian language]], and the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] and [[Cushitic languages]]. Along with most other Berber languages, Tamazight has retained a number of widespread Afroasiatic features, including a two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] system, [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO) [[linguistic typology|typology]], emphatic consonants (realized in Tamazight as pharyngealized), a [[templatic morphology]], and a [[causative]] morpheme /s/ (the latter also found in other macrofamilies, such as the [[Niger–Congo languages]].) Within Berber, Central Atlas Tamazight belongs, along with neighbouring [[Tashelhiyt]], to the [[Atlas languages|Atlas]] branch of the [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] subgroup.

Tamazight is in the middle of a [[dialect continuum]] between Riff to its north-east and Shilha to its south-west.&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt; The basic lexicon of Tamazight differs markedly from Shilha, and its verbal system is more similar to Riff or Kabyle.&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt; Moreover, Tamazight has a greater amount of internal diversity than Shilha.&lt;ref name="stroomer1"/&gt;

Tamazight's dialects are divided into three distinct subgroups and geographic regions: those spoken in the [[Middle Atlas]] mountains; those spoken in the [[High Atlas]] mountains; and those spoken in [[Jbel Saghro]] and its foothills.&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt; Although the characteristic spirantization of {{IPA|/b/}} &gt; {{IPA|[β]}}; {{IPA|/t/}} &gt; {{IPA|[θ]}} or {{IPA|[h]}}; {{IPA|/d/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ð]}}; {{IPA|/k/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ç]}} or {{IPA|[ʃ]}}; and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[j]}} is apparent in Berber languages in central and northern Morocco and Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in many Middle Atlas dialects, it is more rare in High Atlas Tamazight speakers, and is absent in Tamazight speakers from the foothills of [[Jbel Saghro]].&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern dialects (e.g. [[Ayt Atta]]) may also be differentiated syntactically: while other dialects predicate with the auxiliary /d/ (e.g. /d argaz/ "it's a man"), Southern dialects use the typically (High Atlas, Souss-Basin rural country, Jbel Atlas Saghro) auxiliary verb /g/ (e.g. /iga argaz/ "it's a man").&lt;ref name="inalco" /&gt; The differences between each of the three groups are primarily phonological.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=2" /&gt;

Groups speaking Tamazight include: Ait Ayache, Ait Morghi, Ait Alaham, Ait Youb, Marmoucha, Ait Youssi, Beni Mguild, [[Zayanes|Zayane]], Zemmour, Ait Rbaa, Ait Seri, Guerouane, Ait Segougou, [[Ait Yafelman]], Ait Sikhmane, Ayt Ndhir (Beni Mtir).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971a|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;({{IPA|/ajt~/}} literally means "children of ~", see {{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some ambiguity as to the eastern boundary of Central Atlas Tamazight. The dialect of the [[Ait Seghrouchen Berber|Ait Seghrouchen]] and [[Ait Ouarain]] tribes are commonly classed as Central Atlas Tamazight, and Ait Seghrouchen is reported to be mutually intelligible with the neighbouring Tamazight dialect of Ait Ayache.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetically, however, they belong to the [[Zenati languages|Zenati]] subgroup of Northern Berber, rather than to the Atlas subgroup to which the rest of Central Atlas Tamazight belongs,&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond Destaing]], "Essai de classification des dialectes berbères du Maroc", ''Études et Documents Berbère'', 19-20, 2001-2002 (1915)&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore excluded by some sources from Central Atlas Tamazight.&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Bernard and Paul Moussard, Arabophones et berbérophones au Maroc, ''[[Annales de Géographie]]'' 1924, Volume 33 Numéro 183, pp. 267-282.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ethnologue]] lists another group of Zenati dialects, [[South Oran Berber]] (''ksours sud-oranais''), as a dialect of Central Atlas Tamazight,&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{cite web

However, along with other high mountainous regions of North Africa, the Middle Atlas continued to speak Berber.

[[File:Almoravids1120.png|thumb|200px|alt=Map of the Almoravid dynasty in green at its greatest extent, circa 1120. The territory covered most of the Northern reaches of Northern Africa, as well as Southern Iberia.|The Almoravid dynasty (green) at its greatest extent, c. 1120.]]

Between the 12th and 15th centuries, the Central Atlas, along with the rest of Morocco, successively fell within the domain of the Berber [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]], [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]], and [[Marinid dynasty|Marinid]] dynasties. Since the 17th century the region has acknowledged the rule of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]], the current Moroccan royal family. However, effective control of the region was limited; until the 20th century much of the Central Atlas was in a condition of ''siba'', recognising the spiritual legitimacy of royal authority but rejecting its political claims.&lt;ref&gt;David Hart, ''Qabila: tribal profiles and tribe-state relations in Morocco and on the Afghanistan-Pakistan frontier'', 2001, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the [[Ait Atta]] starting from the 16th century brought Tamazight back into the already Arabised [[Tafilalt]] region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Larbi |last=Mezzine |title=Le Tafilalt, Contribution à l'histoire du Maroc aux XVIIè et XVIIIè siècles | journal=Publications de la FLSH, [[Mohammed V University]] |location= Rabat |year= 1987 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put other regional tribes on the defensive, leading to the formation of the [[Ait Yafelman]] alliance.

The 1912 [[Treaty of Fez]] made most of Morocco a French-Spanish protectorate (under French and Spanish military occupation), leaving the Alaouite monarchy but establishing a French military presence in the Atlas region and installing a French commissioner-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After Morocco's independence in 1956, a strong emphasis was laid on the country's [[Arab]] identity,&lt;ref name="textiles"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Becker|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a national [[Arabic language]] educational system was instituted, in which Berber languages, including Middle Atlas Tamazight, had no place. However, in 1994 the government responded to Berber demands for recognition by decreeing that Berber should be taught and establishing television broadcasts in three Berber languages, including Central Atlas Tamazight.&lt;ref&gt;Joël Donnet, APRÈS DEUX MILLE ANS DE MÉPRIS: Renaissance berbère au Maroc, ''Le Monde diplomatique'' Jan. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; For the promotion of Tamazight and other Berber languages and cultures, the government created the [[Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture]] (IRCAM) in 2001.&lt;ref name="oblivion"&gt;{{cite web

== Status ==

Tamazight, along with other Berber languages of Morocco, has a low sociolinguistic status, used mainly in the home, and rarely in official or formal contexts. Media broadcasts and music are available in it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|El Aissati|1993|p=8,10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a policy of teaching it in schools.

Of the Central Atlas Tamazight speakers, 40–45% are monolingual, while the others use Arabic as a second language.&lt;ref name="eth" /&gt; Monolingual speakers consist mostly of older generations and children.&lt;ref name="multi"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ennaji|2005|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are more likely to be monolingual than men, since they typically stay in the village while the men go to work in the cities.&lt;ref name="textiles" /&gt; Since Tamazight is the language of the home, girls grow up speaking Berber languages and pass them on to their children — this gender stratification helps to preserve the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual Berber speakers have learned [[Moroccan Arabic]] via schooling, migration, media, or through the government.&lt;ref name="multi" /&gt; Most rural Berber children are monolingual. They struggle to succeed in schools where the teachers do not speak Berber, and require them to learn both Arabic and French.&lt;ref name="multi" /&gt;

Rural Morocco, including the Central Atlas area, suffers from poverty. Tamazight along with its relative Shilha are undergoing "contraction" as rural families, motivated by economic necessity,&lt;ref name="wdm" /&gt; move to cities and stop speaking Tamazight, leading many intellectuals to fear Berber language shift or regression.&lt;ref name="multi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hoffman|2006|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tamazight speakers are reported to immigrate less than many other Berber groups.&lt;ref name="ea7"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|El Aissati|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Tamazight has a large enough body of native speakers not to be considered under risk of endangerment,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brenzinger|2007|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Tamazight speakers reportedly have a lower birth rate than the country of Morocco as a whole.&lt;ref name="ea7" /&gt;

[[File:Central Morocco Tamazight in Tifinagh.svg|thumb|150px|alt=The word ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ.|''Tamaziɣt'' in [[Tifinagh]]]]
Until the 20th century Tamazight, like many other Berber languages but in contrast with neighbouring [[Tashelhiyt]], was basically unwritten&lt;ref name="amviii"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971a|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sec14"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ben-Layashi|2007|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although sporadic cases, using Arabic script, are attested.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Touderti, Une prophétie berbère en tamazight (Maroc central), ''Etudes et Documents Berbères'', 15-16, 1998 : pp. 101-113&lt;/ref&gt;) It was preserved through oral use in rural areas, isolated from urban hubs.&lt;ref name="sec14" /&gt; Scholars from the Middle Atlas, as elsewhere in North Africa, usually wrote in the more prestigious Arabic language, rather than their vernacular.&lt;ref name="sec14" /&gt;

At present three writing systems exist for Berber languages, including Tamazight: [[Neo-Tifinagh]], the [[Latin alphabet]] and the [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt; To some extent, the choice of writing system is a political one, with various subgroups expressing preference based on ideology and politics.&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt; The orthography used for government services including schooling is Neo-Tifinagh, rendered official by a [[Moroccan Dahir|Dahir]] of King Mohammed VI based on the recommendation of IRCAM.&lt;ref name="choice" /&gt; However, various Latin transcriptions have been used in a number of linguistic works describing Central Atlas Tamazight, notably the dictionary of Taïfi (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Miloud Taïfi, Dictionnaire tamazight-français (parlers du Maroc central), Paris, L'Harmattan-Awal, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Central Atlas Tamazight has a contrastive set of "flat" consonants, manifested in two ways:

* For front segments, [[pharyngealization]]: {{IPA|/tˤ dˤ sˤ zˤ lˤ nˤ rˤ/}})
* For back segments, [[labialization]]: {{IPA|/xʷ ɣʷ qʷ χʷ ʁʷ/}})

Note that pharyngealization may spread to a syllable or even a whole word.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=7"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically [[Proto-Berber language|Proto-Berber]] only had two pharyngealized phonemes ({{IPA|/dˤ, zˤ/}}), but modern Berber languages have borrowed others from Arabic and developed new ones through sound shifts.&lt;ref name="ks464"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kossman|Stroomer|1997|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition Tamazight has uvular and pharyngeal consonants, as well as a conspicuous lack of {{IPA|/p/}} in its plosive inventory.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{IPA|[p]}} is missing from about 10% of languages that have a {{IPA|[b]}}. (See [[voiced velar plosive]] for another such gap.) This is an [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal feature]] of the "circum-Saharan zone" (Africa north of the equator plus the [[Arabian peninsula]]). It is not known how old this areal feature is, and whether it might be a recent phenomenon due to Arabic as a prestige language (Arabic lost its {{IPA|/p/}} in prehistoric times), or whether Arabic was itself affected by a more ancient areal pattern. It is found in other areas as well; for example, in Europe, [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] is reconstructed as having {{IPA|[b]}} but no {{IPA|[p]}}. Nonetheless, the {{IPA|[p]}} sound is very common cross-linguistically.&lt;/ref&gt;

All segments may be [[geminate consonant|geminated]] except for the pharyngeals {{IPA|/ʕ ħ/}}. In Ayt Ndhir, which is a dialect of Tamazight with spirantization, the spirantizeable consonants appear in their stop forms when geminated, and additionally the geminate correspondents of {{IPA|/ʁ, dˤ, ʃ, ʒ, w, j/}} are usually {{IPA|/qː, tˤː, t͡ʃː, d͡ʒː, ɣʷː, ɣː/}} respectively. However some native Berber words have {{IPA|/ʁː/}} (not {{IPA|/qː/}}) where other dialects have singleton {{IPA|/ʁ/}}, and similarly for {{IPA|/ʃː, ʒː/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|pp=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in Arabic loans singleton non-spirantized {{IPA|[b, t, tˤ, d, k, ɡ, q]}} occur (though {{IPA|[b t d]}} and to an extent {{IPA|[tˤ]}} often alternate with their spirantized versions in loans), giving this alternation marginal phonemic status.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=7" /&gt;

In the table below, when consonants appear in pairs, the one on the left is voiceless.

=== Vowels ===

Tamazight has a typical phonemic [[Vowel#Use of vowels in languages|three-vowel system]]:

These phonemes have numerous allophones, conditioned by the following environments:

'''Phonetic Schwa'''

There is a predictable non-phonemic vowel inserted into consonant clusters, realized as {{IPAblink|ɪ̈}} before front consonants (e.g. {{IPA|/b t d .../}}) and {{IPAblink|ə}} before back consonants (e.g. {{IPA|/k χ .../)}}.&lt;ref name="am15"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is voiced before voiced consonants and voiceless before voiceless consonants, or alternatively it can be realized as a voiced or unvoiced consonant release.&lt;ref name="am15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=10"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also may be realized as the syllabicity of a nasal, lateral, or /r/.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=10" /&gt;

The occurrence of schwa [[epenthesis]] is governed morphophonemically.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=10"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are some of the rules governing the occurrence of {{IPA|[ə]}}:

*{{IPA|/datːħadˤar/}} &gt; {{IPA|[datːəħadˤar]}} ('she is present')
*{{IPA|/ʕadˤːrˤ/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ʕadˤːərˤ]}} ('to meet')

However note that word-initial initial {{IPA|/j, w/}} are realized as {{IPA|/i, u/}} before consonants. In word-medial or -final position {{IPA|[əj]}}, {{IPA|[əʝ]}}, and {{IPA|[əw]}} are realized as {{IPA|[ij]}}, {{IPA|[ij]}}, and {{IPA|[uw]}} respectively, and may become {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} in rapid speech.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=10" /&gt;

Tamazight in fact has numerous [[words without vowels|words without phonemic vowels]], and those consisting entirely of voiceless consonants will not phonetically contain voiced vowels.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Audio recordings of selected words without vowels in [[Shilha language|Shilha]] can be downloaded from {{cite web|url=http://ed268.univ-paris3.fr/lpp/pages/EQUIPE/ridouane/audio.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320021843/http://ed268.univ-paris3.fr/lpp/pages/EQUIPE/ridouane/audio.doc |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|[ə]}} is written as {{angle bracket|ⴻ}} in [[neo-Tifinagh]] and as {{angle bracket|e}} in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]]. French publications tended to include {{IPA|[ə]}} in their transcriptions of Berber forms despite their predictability, perhaps due to the [[French phonology|French vowel system]]. This can cause problems because alternations such as {{IPA|/iʁ(ə)rs/}} 'he slaughtered' – {{IPA|/uriʁris/}} 'he did not slaughter' would then have to conditioned morphologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1968|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stress ===

[[Stress (linguistics)|Word stress]] is non-contrastive and predictable — it falls on the last vowel in a word (including schwa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
*{{IPA|/sal/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈsal]}} ('to ask')
*{{IPA|/dajtːħadˤarˤ/}} &gt; {{IPA|[dajtːəħaˈdˤarˤ]}} ('he is present')
*{{IPA|/fsːr/}} &gt; {{IPA|[fəsːˈər]}} ('to explain')
*{{IPA|/tfsːrnt/}} &gt; {{IPA|[təfəsːəˈrənt]}} ('you (fp) explained')

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Central Atlas Tamazight grammar}}

Central Atlas Tamazight grammar has many features typical of [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], including extensive [[apophony]] in both the derivational and inflectional morphology, [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[possessive suffix]]es, [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] typology, the causative morpheme /s/, and use of the [[status constructus]].

=== Morphology ===

Tamazight [[noun]]s are inflected for gender, number, and state. Singular masculine nouns usually have the prefix /a-/, and singular feminines the [[circumfix]] {{IPA|/t...t}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plurals may either involve a regular change ("sound plurals"), internal vowel change ("broken plurals"), or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculine plurals usually take the prefix {{IPA|/i-/}}, feminines {{IPA|/ti-/}}, and sound plurals also take the suffix {{IPA|/-n/}} in masculine and {{IPA|/-in/}}} in feminine, although many other plural patterns are found too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=88–89, 93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{IPA|/'''a'''xam/ → /'''i'''xam'''n'''/}} 'big tent(s)' (m)
: {{IPA|/'''a'''maziɣ/ → /'''i'''maziɣ'''n'''/}} 'Berber(s)' (m)
: {{IPA|/'''a'''daʃu/ → /'''i'''d'''u'''ʃ'''a'''/}} 'sandal(s)' (m)
: {{IPA|/'''a'''srdun/ → /'''i'''srd'''a'''n/}} 'mule(s)' (m)
: {{IPA|/'''ta'''xam'''t'''/ → /'''ti'''xam'''in'''/}} 'tent(s)' (f)
: {{IPA|/'''ta'''funas'''t'''/ → /'''ti'''funas'''in'''/}} 'cow(s)' (f)
: {{IPA|/'''ta'''ɡrtil'''t'''/ → /'''ti'''ɡrt'''a'''l/}} 'mat(s)' (f)
: {{IPA|/'''ta'''mazir'''t'''/ → /'''ti'''m'''i'''z'''a'''r/}} 'property(ies)' (f)

Nouns may be put into the [[construct state]] (contrasting with free state) to indicate possession, or when the subject of a verb follows the verb. This is also used for nouns following numerals and some prepositions, as well as the conjunction {{IPA|/d-/}} ('and').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construct state is formed as follows: in masculines, initial {{IPA|/a/}} becomes {{IPA|/u, wː, wa/}}, initial {{IPA|/i/}} becomes {{IPA|/i, j, ji/}}, and initial {{IPA|/u/}} becomes {{IPA|/wu/}}. In feminines, initial {{IPA|/ta/}} usually becomes {{IPA|/t/}}, initial {{IPA|/ti/}} usually becomes {{IPA|/t/}}, and initial {{IPA|/tu/}} remains unchanged.&lt;ref name="am119-121"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples (in Ayt Ayache):&lt;ref name="am119-121" /&gt;
: {{IPA|/babuxam/}} ( ← {{IPA|/axam/}}) 'head of the house'
: {{IPA|/ijːs ntslit/}} ( ← {{IPA|/tislit/}}) 'the horse of the bride'

Central Atlas Tamazight's personal [[pronoun]]s distinguish three persons, and two genders. Pronouns appear in three forms: an independent form used in the subject position, a [[possessive suffix]] (and a derived independent possessive pronoun), and an object form affixed&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;prefixed or suffixed depending on multiple factors&lt;/ref&gt; to the controlling verb.

Demonstrative pronouns distinguish between proximate and remote. When they occur independently, they inflect for number. They may also be suffixed to nouns, e.g. /tabardaja/ 'this pack-saddle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=69, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Atlas Tamazight verbs are heavily inflected, being marked for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[aspect (grammar)|aspect]], [[grammatical mode|mode]], [[voice (grammar)|voice]], [[grammatical person|person]], and [[grammatical polarity|polarity]]. Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, modified by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and [[ablaut]]. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the verb, while object marking and [[satellite framing]] are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=154–159, 216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some verb forms are accompanied by [[ablaut]], and sometimes [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=161–166, 218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronominal complement markers cliticize to the verb, with the indirect object preceding the direct object, e.g. /iznz-as-t/ "he sold it to him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Word order is usually [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] (with the subject in construct state) but sometimes is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] (with the subject in free state), e.g. ({{IPA|/ifːɣ umaziɣ/}} vs. {{IPA|/amaziɣ ifːɣ/}} 'the Berber went out').&lt;ref name="am295"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamazight also exhibits [[pro-drop]] behavior.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Stoyanova|2004|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamazight may use a [[null copula]],&lt;ref name="inalco_syntax"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaker |first=Salem |title=La Syntaxe de la Langue Berbere |publisher=[[INALCO]] |location=Paris |date=n.d. |url=http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_thema/berbere_syntaxe.htm |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130154407/http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_thema/berbere_syntaxe.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the word {{IPA|/ɡ/}} 'to be, to do' can function as a copula in Ayt Ayache, especially in structures preceded by /aj/ 'who, which, what'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971a|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

wh- questions are always [[cleft sentence|cleft]]s, and multiple wh-questions&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;such as the English "who saw what?", see {{Harvcoltxt|Stoyanova|2004|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not occur.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Stoyanova|2008|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Tamazight's clefting, relativisation, and wh-interrogation contribute to anti-agreement effects,&lt;ref group=
"nb"&gt;when the verb does not agree with, or agrees in a relative manner with wh-words, see {{Harvcoltxt|Richards|2004|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Shilha,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; and causes deletion of the verbal person marker in certain situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Richards|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==

As a result of relatively intense [[language contact]], Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=25"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contact was unequal, as [[Moroccan Arabic]] has not borrowed as much from [[Berber languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Berber has contributed to [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]] and [[Algerian Arabic]]s' very reduced vowel systems.&lt;ref name="prasse"&gt;{{cite web
|title=Interview met Karl-G. Prasse
|url=http://www.tawiza.nl/content/awid.php?id=465&amp;sid=2&amp;andra=artikel
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503140413/http://www.tawiza.nl/content/awid.php?id=465&amp;sid=2&amp;andra=artikel
|archivedate= May 3, 2008
|accessdate=December 20, 2009
|ref=harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic loans span a wide range of [[lexical class]]es. Many nouns begin with /l-/, from the Arabic definite prefix, and some Arabic feminines may acquire the native Berber feminine ending /-t/, e.g. /lʕafit/ for /lʕafia/ 'fire'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Arabic loans have been integrated into the Tamazight verb lexicon. They adhere fully to inflectional patterns of native stems, and may even undergo ablaut.&lt;ref name="sadiqi25-26"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="am153"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[function word]]s are borrowed, e.g. /blli/ or /billa/ 'that', /waxxa/ 'although', /ɣir/ 'just', etc.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=25" /&gt;

The first few (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) cardinal numerals have native Berber and borrowed [[Arabic language|Arabic]] forms.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Ayt Ayache the Arabic numerals are only used for counting in order and for production of higher numbers when combined with the tens, see {{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penchoen|1973|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic, consistent with the linguistic universals that the numbers 1–3 are much more likely to be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Souag|2007|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Atlas Tamazight uses a bipartate negative construction (e.g. /uriffiɣ ʃa/ 'he did not go out') which apparently was modeled after proximate [[Arabic language|Arabic]] varieties, in a common development known as [[Jespersen's Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lucas|2007a|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is present in multiple Berber varieties, and is argued to have originated in neighboring Arabic and been adopted by contact.&lt;ref name="jespersen"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lucas|2007b|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climate change adaptation''' is a response to [[global warming]] (also known as "climate change" or "anthropogenic climate change"), that seeks to reduce the [[vulnerability]] of social and biological systems to relatively sudden change and thus offset the [[effects of global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php "UNFCCC Glossary of Climate Change Acronyms"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429220912/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php |date=29 April 2010 }}.  Accessed 24 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Even if emissions are stabilized relatively soon, global warming and its effects should last many years, and adaptation would be necessary to the resulting changes in climate.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Daniel A.

L. 1, 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptation is especially important in [[developing countries]] since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Daniel A. "Climate Change, Adaptation, and Development", 26 UCLA J. ENVTL. L. &amp; POL'Y 1, 3 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt (called [[adaptive capacity]]) is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-es.html |title=Executive summary.

==Effects of global warming==
{{Main|Effects of global warming}}
The projected effects for the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and for [[civilization]] are numerous and varied. The main effect is an increasing global average temperature. The average surface temperature could increase by 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 1.67 to 5.56 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century if carbon emissions aren't reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change Impacts|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/threats-impacts/higher-temperatures.xml|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes a variety of secondary effects, namely, changes in patterns of precipitation, rising sea levels, [[climate change and agriculture|altered patterns of agriculture]], increased [[extreme weather]] events, the expansion of the range of tropical diseases, and the opening of new marine trade routes.

Potential effects include [[sea level rise]] of {{Nowrap|110 to 770 mm}} {{Nowrap|(0.36 to 2.5 feet)}} between 1990 and 2100, [[Climate change and agriculture|repercussions to agriculture]], [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|possible slowing of the thermohaline circulation]], reductions in the [[ozone layer]], increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, [[Ocean acidification|lowering]] of ocean [[pH]], and the spread of [[tropical disease]]s such as [[malaria]] and [[dengue fever]].

A summary of probable effects and recent understanding can be found in the report made for the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] by Working Group II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

The IPCC group points out that the world's ability to mitigate global warming is an economic and political challenge.  Given that greenhouse gas levels are already elevated, the lag of decades between emissions and some impacts, and the significant economic and political challenges of success, the IPCC group points out that it is uncertain how much climate change ''will'' be mitigated.&lt;ref name="wg2" /&gt;

[[Developing countries]] are the least able to adapt to climate change.  Doing so depends on such factors as wealth, technology, education, infrastructure, access to resources, management capabilities, acceptance of the existence of climate change and the consequent need for action, and sociopolitical will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distribution Impacts of Climate Change and Disasters: Concepts and Cases|last=Ruth|first=M.|last2=Ibarrarian|first2=M.

After assessing the literature on [[sustainability]] and climate change scientists concluded with high confidence that up to the year 2050, an effort to cap GHG emissions at 550&amp;nbsp;ppm would benefit developing countries significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch20s20-es.html|title=Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

By 2100, however, it was still judged likely that there would be significant climate change impacts. This was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced adaptive capacity.

The IPCC group also pointed out that climate change adaptation measures can reinforce and be reinforced by efforts to promote [[sustainable development]] and reduce poverty.&lt;ref name="wg2" /&gt;

===Cost of adaptation vs. mitigation===
{{See also|Economics of global warming#Trade offs}}

Adaptation and mitigation can be viewed as two competing policy responses, with tradeoffs between the two. The other tradeoff is with climate change impacts. In practice, however, the actual tradeoffs are debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the people who bear emission reduction costs or benefits are often different from those who pay or benefit from adaptation measures.

Another type of analysis is based on a [[risk]]-based approach to the problem. It has been argued that adaptation could play an important role in [[climate policy]], but not in an explicit trade-off against mitigation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Cost estimates and international aid===
Many scientists, policy makers, and the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] have agreed that disadvantaged nations need to do more to adapt to climate change, especially highly populated regions of developing countries with low [[adaptive capacity]].

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimated that an additional USD $86 billion per year would be needed{{where|date=August 2016}} in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Page 26 [http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_Summary_English.pdf Human Development Report 2007/08] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821073604/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_Summary_English.pdf |date=21 August 2010 }} United Nations Development Programme&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[UNFCCC]] estimates in 2007, costs of adaptation to climate change would cost $49–171 billion per year globally by 2030,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/11501IIED.pdf|title=Assessing the Costs of Adaptation to Climate Change|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which a significant share of the additional investment and financial flows, USD $28–67 billion would be needed in 2030 in [[non-Annex I Parties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/financial_flows.pdf|title=UNFCCC: INVESTMENT AND FINANCIAL FLOWS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE|last=|first=|date=2007|website=UNFCCC|access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Point 26 [http://unfccc.int/files/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/application/pdf/executive_summary.pdf INVESTMENT AND FINANCIAL FLOWS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511110710/http://unfccc.int/files/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/application/pdf/executive_summary.pdf |date=11 May 2012 }} UNFCCC&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents a doubling of current [[official development assistance]] (ODA).

This estimate has been critiqued by some scientists who argues that the UNFCCC estimate underestimates the cost of adaptation to climate change by a factor of 2 or 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/73760/ |title=Assessing the costs of adaptation to climate change: a review of the UNFCCC and other recent estimates |publisher=ePrints Soton |date=27 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, sectors such as tourism, mining, energy, and retail were not included in the UNFCCC estimate.

The more recent World Bank Study, "Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change", found that the costs of adaptation would be in the range of $75–100 billion per year between 2010 and 2050; with higher estimates under the wetter global scenario than the drier scenario, assuming that warming will be about 2 degrees by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The benefits of strong, early action on [[mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] considerably outweigh the costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/Documents/Background_Paper.pdf Note from the UN Secretary General regarding the Summit on Climate Change] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026104605/http://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/Documents/Background_Paper.pdf |date=26 October 2012 }} 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Accord]] was agreed on in order to create a commitment by developed countries to provide:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
{{quote|text=new and additional resources...approaching USD $30 billion for the period 2010- 2012 with balanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation... [and] in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, developed countries commit to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD$100 billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries.|sign=[[Copenhagen Accord]]}}
However, a key point of contention between states at the [[UNFCC]] [[Copenhagen Climate Summit]] was who was to foot the bill and if aid is to be given, how is it to affect other levels of [[development aid]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&amp;title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803075037/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&amp;title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications |date=3 August 2012 }} [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of '''additionality''' has thus arisen and the [[European Union|EU]] has asked its member states to come up with definitions of what they understand additionality to mean, the four main definitions are:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Controversy over funding of 0.7% of GNI|0.7% ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the OECD states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; This is important, because international development through the sustainable (or millennium) development goals may be essential for a long-term solution to climate change &lt;ref name=Webster2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=A.J.Webster|title=A global consumer-led strategy to tackle climate change|date=July 2018|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03364}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


===International aid mechanisms===

{{As of|2010}}, the aggregate of current climate change adaptation programs will not raise enough money to fund adaptation to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:GtE3kdqAqg0J:unfccc.int/files/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/application/pdf/executive_summary.pdf+unfccc+executive+summary&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShLpkr2HfiGDHpdJbmhVg8A1aPzMbnVQ-2qUKpKDFowHH5CWdLkipNvuEsNM_5Gmsw0H6qGyQlz6wLIVd6HQByvaNdmnazays1SKNkupFVZKvRZRMUY8W98Wa1xnUPfDkZ0h8OM&amp;sig=AHIEtbRGW-W5dh6NF-k3M9gGPciHwWHHCg |title=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Investment and Financial Flows to Address Climate Change, Executive Summary ¶ 11 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are, however, several programs and proposals to finance adaptation to climate change in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) runs a program called the [[Global Environmental Facility]], which provides some funding for adaptation to [[least developed countries]] and [[Small Island Developing States|small island states]].&lt;ref name="UNFCCC Adaptation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/adaptation/items/4159.php |title=UNFCCC Adaptation |accessdate=2010-04-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214010/http://unfccc.int/adaptation/items/4159.php| archivedate= 29 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the GEF umbrella, the GEF Trust Fund, the [http://www.thegef.org/gef/LDCF Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)], and the [http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/special_climate_change_fund/items/3657.php Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF)] operate to carry out the climate change adaptation financing goals of the GEF.&lt;ref name="UNFCCC Adaptation"/&gt;

Another UNFCCC mechanism is [[The Adaptation Fund]], as a result of negotiations during [[COP15]] and [[COP16]], which provides funds for projects that prove to have additional benefits for adaptation to climate change. The [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM), set up as part of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the Framework Convention, is the main source of income for the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund. This fund was established in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDM is subject to a 2% levy, which could raise between $300 million and $600 million over the 2008-12 period. The actual amount raised will depend on the carbon price. {{as of|2010|August|}}, The Adaptation Fund has not yet disbursed any funding;{{update inline|date=August 2016}} a call for proposals was issued in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adaptation-fund.org/howtoapply |title=How to Apply |publisher=Adaptation Fund |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727030703/http://www.adaptation-fund.org/howtoapply |archivedate=27 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNFCCC funding for Least Developed Countries includes development of a [[National Adaptation Programme of Action]], which prioritizes requests to fund specific adaptation projects.

There are several other climate change adaptation finance proposals, most of which employ [[official development assistance]] or ODA.&lt;ref name="International_Adaptation_Finance"/&gt; These proposals range from a World Bank program, to proposals involving auctioning of carbon allowances, to a global carbon or transportation tax, to compensation-based funding.&lt;ref name="International_Adaptation_Finance"/&gt;
Other proposals suggest using market-based mechanisms, rather than ODA, such as the Higher Ground Foundation's vulnerability reduction credit (VRC™)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehighergroundfoundation.org/ |title=Financing Climate Adaptation Measures Using a Credit Trading Mechanism: Initial Considerations |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a program similar to the [[Clean Development Mechanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |ssrn=1685027 |title=Call for a Pilot Program for Market-Based Adaptation Funding |author=Matthew Baca |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise private money for climate change adaptation.
The [[Copenhagen Accord]], the most recent global climate change agreement, commits developed countries to goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries in assistance for climate change mitigation and adaptation through 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_15/items/5257.php |title=Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change|location=[[Copenhagen]]|date= 7–18 December 2009 |id=un document= FCCC/CP/2009/L.7 |accessdate=2010-10-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101018074452/http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_15/items/5257.php| archivedate= 18 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This agreement, while not binding, would dwarf current amounts dedicated to adaptation in developing countries.  This climate change fund is called the [[Green Climate Fund]] from the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/green_climate_fund/items/5869.php |title=Transitional Committee for the design of the Green Climate Fund |publisher=Unfccc.int |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration with development aid===
Many [[Developing country|developing countries]] prioritize economic development over addressing the issue of climate change, as they are more concerned about pre-existing problems such as poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4671e/y4671e06.htm |title=Chapter 2. Food security: concepts and measurement[21&amp;#93; |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2010-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826025404/http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4671e/y4671e06.htm| archivedate= 26 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; availability of drinking water, indebtedness, illiteracy, unemployment, local resource conflicts, and lower technological development. It has even been argued that international development through the sustainable development goals, is essential for a long-term solution to climate change &lt;ref name=Webster2018 /&gt;. On the other hand, climate change threatens to exacerbate or stall progress on fixing some of these pre-existing problems. Advocates have thus proposed integrating climate change adaptation into poverty reduction programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/bookshop/ids-bulletin/ids-bulletin-39-2008 Poverty in a Changing Climate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513222525/http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/bookshop/ids-bulletin/ids-bulletin-39-2008 |date=13 May 2012 }} [[Institute of Development Studies]] Bulletin 39(4), September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Considerations and general recommendations==
{{very long|date=August 2016}}

===Principles for effective policy===
Adaptive [[Public policy|policy]] can occur at the global, national, or local scale, with outcomes dependent on the political will in that area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-02-01|title=Does public policy support or undermine climate change adaptation? Exploring policy interplay across different scales of governance|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378007000611|journal=Global Environmental Change|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=180–191|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2007.08.002|issn=0959-3780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheraga and Grambsch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/eims/global/clim_res.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910233126/http://www.epa.gov/eims/global/clim_res.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; identify 9 fundamental principles to be considered when designing adaptation policy.

# The effects of climate change vary by region.
# The effects of climate change may vary across demographic groups.
# Climate change poses both risks and opportunities.
# The effects of climate change must be considered in the context of multiple stressors and factors, which may be as important to the design of adaptive responses as the sensitivity of the change.
# Adaptation comes at a cost.
# Adaptive responses vary in effectiveness, as demonstrated by current efforts to cope with climate variability.
# The systemic nature of climate impacts complicates the development of adaptation policy.
# Maladaptation can result in negative effects that are as serious as the climate-induced effects that are being avoided.
# Many opportunities for adaptation make sense whether or not the effects of climate change are realized.

Scheraga and Grambsch make it clear that climate change policy is impeded by the high level of variance surrounding climate change impacts as well as the diverse nature of the problems they face.

Adaptation can mitigate the adverse impacts of [[climate change]], but it will incur costs and will not prevent all damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2011/06/06/economics-adaptation-climate-change|title=Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPCC points out that many adverse effects of climate change are not changes in the average conditions, but changes in the variation or the extremes of conditions.&lt;ref name="wg2" /&gt;  For example, the average sea level in a port might not be as important as the height of water during a storm surge (which causes flooding); the average rainfall in an area might not be as important as how frequent and severe [[Drought|droughts]] and extreme precipitation events become.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/resource-collections/climate-change-impacts|title=Climate change impacts {{!}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|website=www.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, effective adaptive policy can be difficult to implement because policymakers are rewarded more for enacting short-term change, rather than long-term planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Politics and Policy|last=Rosenbaum|first=Walter A.|publisher=CQ Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4522-3996-5|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the impacts of climate change are generally not seen in the short-term, this means that policymakers have less incentive to act upon those potential outcomes. Furthermore, these problems (both the causes and effects of climate change) are occurring on a global scale, which has caused the United Nations to lead global policy efforts such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and [[Paris Agreement]], in addition to creating a body of research through the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], in order to create a global framework for adapting to and combatting climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/|title=Climate Change|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vast majority of climate change adaptation and [[Mitigation of climate change|mitigation]] policies are being implemented on a more local scale due to the fact that different regions must adapt differently to climate change and because national and global policies are often more challenging to enact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert|last2=Hultquist|first2=Andy|last3=Romsdahl|first3=Rebecca|date=2014-11-01|title=An Examination of Local Climate Change Policies in the Great Plains|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267396181_An_Examination_of_Local_Climate_Change_Policies_in_the_Great_Plains|journal=Review of Policy Research|volume=31|doi=10.1111/ropr.12103}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Criteria for assessing responses===
James Titus, project manager for sea level rise at the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], identifies the following criteria that policy makers should use in assessing responses to global warming:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Titus |title=Strategies for Adaptation to Global Warming |url=http://epa.gov/climatechange/effects/downloads/adapting_japa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Economic [[Efficiency]]: Will the initiative yield benefits substantially greater than if the resources were applied elsewhere?
* Flexibility: Is the strategy reasonable for the entire range of possible changes in temperatures, precipitation, and sea level?
* Urgency: Would the strategy be successful if implementation were delayed ten or twenty years?
* [[Low cost|Low Cost]]: Does the strategy require minimal resources?
* Equity: Does the strategy unfairly benefit some at the expense of other regions, generations, or economic classes?
* Institutional feasibility: Is the strategy acceptable to the public? Can it be implemented with existing institutions under existing laws?
* Unique or Critical Resources: Would the strategy decrease the risk of losing unique environmental or cultural resources?
* Health and Safety: Would the proposed strategy increase or decrease the risk of disease or injury?
* Consistency: Does the policy support other national state, community, or private goals?
* Private v. Public Sector: Does the strategy minimize governmental interference with decisions best made by the private sector?

===Differing time scales===

Adaptation can either occur in anticipation of change (anticipatory adaptation), or be a response to those changes (reactive adaptation).&lt;ref name="uea.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/people/adgerwn/Adgeretal2005GEC.pdf |title=Successful adaptation to climate change across scales |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.12.005 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402025816/http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/people/adgerwn/Adgeretal2005GEC.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most adaptation being implemented at present is responding to current climate trends and variability, for example increased use of [[Snowmaking|artificial snow-making]] in the European Alps. Some adaptation measures, however, are anticipating future climate change, such as the construction of the Confederation Bridge in Canada at a higher elevation to take into account the effect of future sea-level rise on ship clearance under the bridge.&lt;ref name="ipcc.ch" /&gt;

Much adaptation takes place in relation to short-term climate variability, however this may cause [[maladaptation]] to longer-term climatic trends. For example, the expansion of irrigation in Egypt into the Western Sinai desert due to a period of higher river flows is a maladaptation when viewed in relation to the longer term projections of drying in the region&lt;ref name="iied.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iied.org/CC/documents/adapt_to_cc.pdf |title=Adaptation to Climate Change in the Developing World |publisher=Iied.org |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922205501/http://www.iied.org/CC/documents/adapt_to_cc.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Adaptations at one scale can also create externalities at another by reducing the adaptive capacity of other actors. This is often the case when broad assessments of the costs and benefits of adaptation are examined at smaller scales and it is possible to see that whilst the adaptation may benefit some actors, it has a negative effect on others.&lt;ref name="uea.ac.uk" /&gt;

===Traditional coping strategies===

People have always adapted to climatic changes and some community coping strategies already exist, for example changing sowing times or adopting new water-saving techniques.&lt;ref name="iied.org" /&gt; Traditional knowledge and coping strategies must be maintained and strengthened, otherwise adaptive capacity may be weakened as local knowledge of the environment is lost. Strengthening these local techniques and building upon them also makes it more likely that adaptation strategies will be adopted, as it creates more community ownership and involvement in the process.&lt;ref name="ipcc.ch" /&gt;  In many cases however this will not be enough to adapt to new conditions which are outside the range of those previously experienced, and new techniques will be needed.&lt;ref name="geog.psu.edu" /&gt; The incremental adaptations which were being implemented are now insufficient as the vulnerabilities and risks of climate change have increased, this causes a need for transformational adaptations which are much larger and costlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kates|first1=Robert W.|last2=Travis|first2=William R.|last3=Wilbanks|first3=Thomas J.|title=Transformational adaptation when incremental adaptations to climate change are insufficient|journal=PNAS|date=14 March 2012|volume=109|pages=7156–7161|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/19/7156.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.1115521109|pmc=3358899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current development efforts are increasingly focusing on community-based climate change adaptation, seeking to enhance local knowledge, participation and ownership of adaptation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McNamara |first1=Karen Elizabeth |last2=Buggy |first2=Lisa |title=Community-based climate change adaptation: a review of academic literature |journal=Local Environment: The International Journal of Justice and Sustainability |date=5 August 2016 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1080/13549839.2016.1216954 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13549839.2016.1216954?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of adaptation==

===Local adaptation efforts===

Cities, states, and provinces often have considerable responsibility in land use planning, public health, and disaster management.

Dealing with more frequent drenching rains may required increasing the capacity of [[stormwater]] systems, and separating stormwater from [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], so that overflows in peak periods do not contaminate rivers.  One example is the [[SMART Tunnel]] in Kuala Lumpur.

According to [[English Nature]], gardeners can help mitigate the effects of climate change by providing habitats for the most threatened species, and/or saving water by changing gardens to use plants which require less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1795001,00.html | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | title=Gardeners can slow climate change | first=Juliette | last=Jowit | date=11 June 2006 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City produced a comprehensive report for its Rebuilding and Resiliency initiative after [[Hurricane Sandy]].  Its efforts include not only making buildings less prone flooding, but taking steps to reduce the future recurrence of specific problems encountered during and after the storm: weeks-long fuel shortages even in unaffected areas due to legal and transportation problems, flooded health care facilities, insurance premium increases, damage to electricity and steam generation in addition to distribution networks, and flooding of subway and roadway tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/sirr/html/report/report.shtml NYC Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency: A Stronger, More Resilient New York] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201150442/http://www.nyc.gov/html/sirr/html/report/report.shtml |date=1 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhancing adaptive capacity===

Adaptation can be defined as adjustments of a system to reduce [[vulnerability]] and to increase the resilience of a system to change,&lt;ref name="ipcc.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter17.pdf |title=Assessment of adaptation practices, options, constraints and capacity |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100827182247/http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter17.pdf| archivedate= 27 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[adaptive capacity]].  Those societies that can respond to change quickly and successfully have a high adaptive capacity.&lt;ref name="geog.psu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.psu.edu/pdf/Smit_Wandel_GEC.pdf |title=Adaptation, adaptive capacity and vulnerability |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.03.008 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624132408/http://www.geog.psu.edu/pdf/Smit_Wandel_GEC.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High adaptive capacity does not necessarily translate into successful adaptation. For example, the adaptive capacity in Western Europe is high, and the risks of warmer winters increasing the range of livestock diseases was well documented, but many parts of Europe were still badly affected by outbreaks of the [[Bluetongue disease|Bluetongue virus]] in livestock in 2007.

Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system (human, natural or managed) to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/annexessglossary-a-d.html|title=Adaptive capacity|chapter=Appendix I. Glossary|ref=harv}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unmitigated climate change (i.e., future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions) would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains6-3.html|title=Sec 6.3 Responses to climate change: Robust findings]|chapter=Synthesis report|ref=harv}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}

===Agricultural production===
A significant effect of global climate change is the altering of global rainfall patterns, with certain effects on agriculture.&lt;ref name="cep-jennings"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfed agriculture constitutes 80% of global agriculture. Many of the 852 million poor people in the world live in parts of Asia and Africa that depend on rainfall to cultivate food crops. Climate change will modify [[rainfall]], [[evaporation]], [[Surface runoff|runoff]], and [[soil moisture]] storage. Extended drought can cause the failure of small and marginal farms with resultant economic, political and social disruption, more so than this currently occurs.

Agriculture of any kind is strongly influenced by the availability of water.  Changes in total [[seasonal precipitation]] or in its pattern of variability are both important. The occurrence of [[moisture stress]] during [[flowering]], [[pollination]], and [[grain-filling]] is harmful to most crops and particularly so to [[Maize|corn]], [[soybeans]], and [[wheat]]. Increased [[evaporation]] from the soil and accelerated [[transpiration]] in the plants themselves will cause moisture stress.

Adaptive ideas include:
* Taking advantage of global transportation systems to delivering surplus food to where it is needed&lt;ref name="cep-jennings" /&gt; (though this does not help subsistence farmers unless aid is given).
* Developing crop varieties with greater [[drought tolerance]].
* Rainwater storage. For example, according to the [[International Water Management Institute]], using small planting basins to 'harvest' water in Zimbabwe has been shown to boost maize yields, whether rainfall is abundant or scarce. And in Niger, they have led to three or fourfold increases in millet yields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/06/us-climate-water-idUSTRE68500820100906 ''Diverse water sources key to food security: report''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901190215/https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/06/us-climate-water-idUSTRE68500820100906 |date=1 September 2013 }}, Reuters, 5 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Falling back from crops to wild edible fruits, roots and leaves.  Promoting the growth of forests can provide these backup food supplies, and also provide watershed conservation, carbon sequestration, and aesthetic value.

====More spending on irrigation====
The [[demand for water]] for [[irrigation]] is projected to rise in a warmer climate, bringing increased competition between agriculture—already the largest consumer of water resources in [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid regions]]—and urban as well as industrial users. Falling [[water table]]s and the resulting increase in the energy needed to pump water will make the practice of irrigation more expensive, particularly when with drier conditions more water will be required per [[acre]]. Other strategies will be needed to make the most efficient use of water resources. For example, the [[International Water Management Institute]] has suggested five strategies that could help Asia feed its growing population in light of climate change. These are:
* Modernising existing irrigation schemes to suit modern methods of farming
* Supporting farmers' efforts to find their own water supplies, by tapping into groundwater in a sustainable way
* Looking beyond conventional "Participatory Irrigation Management" schemes, by engaging the private sector
* Expanding capacity and knowledge
* Investing outside the irrigation sector&lt;ref&gt;Mukherji, A. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071102102545/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Other/index.aspx Revitalising Asia's Irrigation: To sustainably meet tomorrow's food needs] 2009, [[IWMI]] and [[FAO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather control===
Russian and American scientists have in the past tried to control the weather, for example by [[cloud seeding|seeding clouds]] with chemicals to try to produce rain when and where it is needed. A new method being developed involves replicating the [[urban heat island]] effect, where cities are slightly hotter than the countryside because they are darker and absorb more heat. This creates 28% more rain 20–40 miles [[Windward and leeward#mediaviewer/File:Upwind downwind example.png|downwind]] from cities compared to upwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/weather/Story/0,2763,1516375,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Spain goes hi-tech to beat drought | first=Dale | last=Fuchs | date=28 June 2005 | accessdate=2010-04-23 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104170020/http://www.guardian.co.uk/weather/Story/0%2C2763%2C1516375%2C00.html | archivedate=4 November 2007 | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the timescale of several decades, new [[weather control]] techniques may become feasible which would allow control of extreme weather such as hurricanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lloyd de Vries |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/29/tech/main652303.shtml |title=Sapping A Hurricane's Strength, Research Under Way, But Actual Applications Still Decades Away |publisher=CBS News |date=29 October 2004 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damming glacial lakes===
[[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s may become a bigger concern due to the retreat of glaciers, leaving behind numerous lakes that are impounded by often weak [[terminal moraine]] dams. In the past, the sudden failure of these dams has resulted in localized property damage, injury and deaths. [[Glacial lake]]s in danger of bursting can have their [[moraine]]s replaced with concrete dams (which may also provide hydroelectric power).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/66280|title=Many hydroelectric plants in Himalayas are at risk from glacial lakes - environmentalresearchweb|website=environmentalresearchweb.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists such as [[Ken Caldeira]] and [[Paul Crutzen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=geoengineering-how-to-cool-earth |title=Geoengineering: How to Cool Earth--At a Price |publisher=Scientific American |date=October 2008 |accessdate=15 January 2009 |author=Robert Kunzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest techniques such as:
*[[Solar radiation management]] may be seen as an adaptation to global warming.{{According to whom|date=May 2010}}  Techniques such as [[space sunshade]], creating [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]] and painting roofing and paving materials white all fall into this category.
*[[Hydrological geoengineering]] - typically seeking to preserve [[sea ice]] or adjust [[thermohaline circulation]] by using methods such as diverting rivers to keep warm water away from [[sea ice]], or tethering [[icebergs]] to prevent them drifting into warmer waters and melting.  Though this is an adaptation technique, if it prevents [[Arctic methane release]] it would also be classified as mitigation.

===Migration===
Migration frequently requires would-be migrants to have access to social and financial capital, such as support networks in the chosen destination, and the funds or physical resources to be able to move. It is frequently the last adaptive response households will take when confronted with environmental factors that threaten their livelihoods, and mostly resorted to when other mechanisms to cope have proven unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Migration and Climate Change"&gt;{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/sv/news/migration_and_climate_change_a_unesco_publication_on_one_of_the_greatest_challenges_facing_our_time/ |title="Migration and Climate Change" A UNESCO publication on one of the greatest challenges facing our time &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetoric of migration being related to climate change is complex and disputed. However, It is widely accepted that the results of migration events are multi-causal, with the environment being just a factor amongst many. Outside of policy, human rights organizations, expert demographers and environmental  climate scientists dominate this debate.

It is helpful to provide an intersectional approach to this discussion and understand that focusing on climate change as the issue frames the debate in terms of projections, causing the research to be speculative. Migration as tool for climate change adaptation is projected to be a more pressing issue in the decade to come.&lt;ref&gt;Adamo, S. (2008).

Migration events are often seen as a failure of the governments or policy making bodies that could not contain or effectively manage environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = A. | last2 = Fornalé | first2 = E. | year = 2017 | title = Adaptive migration: pluralising the debate on climate change and migration | url = | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 183 | issue = 4| pages = 322–328 | doi = 10.1111/geoj.12242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, extreme drought events in the Caribbean proliferate movement of peoples because of the lack of water.{{cn|date=August 2018}} This is often seen as a failure on the local governments to provide structural and independent resources.

National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, Gold Coast, 99 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; A study identified key equity issues for policy considerations:&lt;ref&gt;McAneney, et al. 2013, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

* transferring risk to the public purse does not reduce overall risk 
* governments can spread the cost of losses across time rather than space 
* governments can force home-owners in low risk areas to cross-subsidize the insurance premiums of those in high risk areas 
* cross-subsidization is increasingly difficult for private sector insurers operating in a competitive market
* governments can tax people to pay for tomorrow's disaster

Government-subsidized insurance, such as the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, is criticized for providing a [[perverse incentive]] to develop properties in hazardous areas, thereby increasing overall risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holloway | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Burby | first2 = R.J. | year = 1990 | title = The effects of floodplain development controls on residential land values | url = | journal = Land Economics | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 259–271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also suggested that insurance can undermine other efforts to increase adaptation, for instance through property level protection and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Hare|first=Paul|last2=White|first2=Iain|last3=Connelly|first3=Angela|date=1 September 2015|title=Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the 'business as usual' paradox|url=http://epc.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/09/01/0263774X15602022|journal=Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|language=en|pages=0263774X15602022|doi=10.1177/0263774X15602022|issn=0263-774X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavioral effect may be countered with appropriate land-use policies that limit new construction where current or future climate risks are perceived and/or encourage the adoption of resilient building codes to mitigate potential damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bagstad | first1 = Kenneth J. | last2 = Stapleton | first2 = K. | last3 = D'Agostino | first3 = J.R. | year = 2007 | title = Taxes, subsidies, and insurance as drivers of United States coastal development | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 285–298 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.09.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate adaptation denial ===
According to a [[report]]&lt;ref name=GreenPeace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/Greenpeace_Dealing%20in%20Doubt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021162125/http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/Greenpeace_Dealing%20in%20Doubt.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; released by Greenpeace USA in September 2013, climate change denial and the campaigns designed to block adaptation measures grew mainly out of the 1990s negotiations slated to develop a global agreement.  During these talks, a number of lobby groups were established with an objective of developing doubt within policymakers and the media through the use of publications in the guise of true science.  This tactic, similar to those of large tobacco companies, was utilized by the lobby groups in the hopes of delaying action and blurring the lines between the valid scientific efforts to challenge climate change findings and those designed to merely undermine the credibility of the scientific community.  This strategy feeds into the "uncertainty argument" and develops an impression of debate through references to the uncertainty of scientific findings that exist in any research model.  Additional tactics that the lobbyist groups have used include releasing non-stories manufactured from stolen emails and communications plans to develop more media coverage of the uncertainty argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climateaccess.org/resource/dealing-doubt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801101600/http://www.climateaccess.org/resource/dealing-doubt |archivedate=1 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict-sensitive adaptation ==
A book by the Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag on 'conflict-sensitive adaptation' sheds light on unintended damaging effects of climate adaptation measures.&lt;ref&gt;''Bob, Urmilla and Salomé Bronkhorst (Eds.): Conflict-sensitive adaptation to climate change in Africa. Climate Diplomacy Series. Berlin: Berliner Wissenschafts-Verlag.''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when disadvantaged groups are left out of the planning process, adaptation methods such as agricultural or water programmes may increase vulnerabilities. The book draws on findings from Africa and outlines how conflict-sensitive adaptation activities should look that are cognizant of the conflict-effects adaptation may have. The authors provide a "Memorandum for Action on Adaptation for Peace and Stability" that outlines principles to support processes for adaptation and peace such as the establishment of peace and conflict assessments for adaptation programmes, mainstreaming climate change adaptation in conflict-prone contexts, applying conflict sensitive approaches or provisions to ensure participatory processes to design and implement adaptation measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taenzler|first1=Dennis|title=Adaptation as Pillar of a New Climate Diplomacy|url=https://www.climate-diplomacy.org/news/adaptation-pillar-new-climate-diplomacy|website=Climate Diplomacy|publisher=adelphi|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14862">The '''Corpo della nobiltà italiana''' (English: Body of the Italian Nobility), sometimes indicated with the [[acronym]] '''CNI''', is a private association established in 1957 in order to protect [[heraldry|heraldic]] and [[nobility]] rights of [[Italy|Italian]] nobles after the [[republic of Italy|republican]] [[constitution]] (in force since 1948) ended the public recognition and safeguard of nobility titles (including the condition of noble without title).

== Italian nobility ==
{{Further|Nobility of Italy}}
Italy became a single [[State (polity)|State]] only in 1861, when during the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]] the [[Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] – elected for the first time with representatives of all territories already conquered or otherwise annexed – adopted its first law stating: &lt;&lt;The king [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]] adopts for himself and his successors the title of King of Italy&gt;&gt;.
Sardinian constitution, the so-called [[Statuto albertino|Albertine Statute]], remained in force for the whole Italy&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;At that date, Italy was including all the [[peninsula]] except the [[Latium]] (present provinces of [[Viterbo]], [[Rome]], [[Latina]] and [[Frosinone]], which were the remaining [[Pope|Papal State]]) and present regions of [[Trentino-Alto Adige]], [[Veneto]] and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], the so-called “Venices”, which were part of the [[Austrian Empire]].  The Veneto and the [[Friuli]] were annexed in 1866, the Latium in 1870, the Trentino- Alto Adige and the Venezia Giulia in 1918−1919 after [[World War I]], together with [[Istria]], passed afterwards to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1945 after [[World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; stating that “Nobility titles are maintained to those who have right to them.&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;Article 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus unified Italy had several Nobility laws, one for each pre-unitarian State: that is why its [[College of Arms]], called ''Consulta araldica'' (''heraldic council'') was organised in several “regional” commissions, each corresponding – more or less – to a pre-unitarian State in order to apply the latter nobility law.  A single nobility law started only in 1926 when the female succession, still valid up to then in the former kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] (only the island of Sardinia), was abolished.
Titles could be granted to the eldest male (as in [[Franks|Frankish]] tradition), to all males (as in [[Langobard]] tradition) or to all family members; in all cases, all family members are noble, the condition of “Noble” being the title which pertained to all members of families with or without other titles.  Members of family where only the eldest male hold titles are indicated with &lt;&lt;Noble of the [title of the eldest male] (plural)&gt;&gt;: for example, if Mr Rossi is granted with the title [[Baron]] of Nothing whose succession is for the eldest male, all his issue will be Mr Antonio Rossi Noble of the Barons of Nothing and Miss Valentina Rossi Noble of the Barons of Nothing, and the same will apply to all of his descent by male line.
Official lists of all Italian families and noble people were published in 1921 and 1933.

== Nobility under the republic ==
Following the establishment of the Italian republic in June 1946, a new constitution entered in force in 1948, stating that &lt;&lt;Nobility tiles are not recognized&gt;&gt;.  As a consequence, they are “out of the world of law”: administrative powers may not use them and judges cannot appreciate their existence.&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;According to a 1967 sentence by the supreme Constitutional Court.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their use is not forbidden, but there is no public safeguard against misuse.

== The association ==
In order to overcome this lack of safeguard, some Italian aristocrats founded in 1955−1957 the Corpo della Nobiltà Italiana, with the aim of protect historical and heraldic rights of Italian nobles.&lt;ref&gt;The CNI articles of association can be found [http://www.araldicasardegna.org/index.htm in the Sardinia association website] (by clicking on ''Statuto e Elenco Nobiliare Sardo'', then on ''Statuto del Corpo della Nobiltà Italiana'') {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; We can note that the word “heraldic” is always used by the CNI ''lato sensu'', [[i.e.]] considering all functions of [[herald]]s, not only relating to [[heraldry]] but also to all nobility issues. CNI bodies called “heraldic” are related to whole nobility issues and not only heraldic ones ''stricto sensu''.
The first offices were:&lt;ref&gt;L. Michelini, ''CILANE et CNI'', p. 17, n. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Prince]] Emilio Guasco Gallarati, [[Marquis]] of Bisio, chairman;
* [[Marquis]] Don Annibale Brivio Sforza, Marquis of Santa Maria in Prato, vice-chairman;
* Don Enrico Amat of the [[Marquess of Saint Philip|Marquesses of St. Philip]], vice-chairman;
* [[Prince]] and [[Marquis]] Don Alerame Pallavicino, chancellor;
* [[Baron]] Alessandro Monti della Corte, treasurer.
Some years later, the association merged with the previous '''Unione della Noblità Italiana''' (UNI, Union of Italian Nobility), founded beforehand on the example of the French ''[[Association d'entraide de la noblesse française]]'' (ANF).

=== Tasks ===
The CNI aims to keep up to date the official lists of Italian Nobles, by applying rigorously the rules stated about the matter, the last ones being the ''Ordinamento dello stato nobiliare italiano'' (organisation of the Italian nobility) in 1943 (which of course has never been modified and will never be by the republican Italian institutions).&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;Approved through Royal [[Decree]] N.  651 dated 7 June 1943. Its text can be found [http://www.cnicg.net/osn43.asp here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017235805/http://www.cnicg.net/osn43.asp |date=2013-10-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
People entitled to be inscribed are: 
1 – those already inscribed in the official registrars;
2 – those who had a grant of a nobility title (including the mere title of Noble) after the publication of the lists;
3 – legitimate and natural issue of the latters, meaning issue that is both legitimate, thus excluding children born out of a lawful wedlock, and natural, thus excluding adopted children; children whose parents married after their birth are considered as fully legitimate as for the scope;
4 – illegitimate born children in whose act of legitimacy the succession in nobility titles is expressly provided (this could only happen during the kingdom);
5 – those who prove their descent by a man who had not been included in the lists at that time but whose right is proven according to the applicable rules.

Other aims are the mutual assistance among Nobles, deriving from UNI tasks, and social events for young noble people.

=== Membership ===
Only Nobles can be part of the CNI.  Some regional associations allow also wives of Nobles, not Noble themselves by birth, according to the fact that wife follows husband's nobility condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Ordinamento dello stato nobiliare italiano'', art. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the same rule, CNI states that noblewomen by birth cannot be elected to any office while married to a non-noble man.&lt;ref&gt;''Massimario del CNI'', N.  6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organisation ===

==== At local level ====
The CNI is composed by 14 regional Nobility associations, reflecting the organisation of the ''Heraldic Council'' (''consulta araldica'') in the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Each one is autonomous and has a proper statute.
They are:
# [[Piedmont]] (including [[Aosta Valley]])
# [[Liguria]]
# [[Lombardy]]
# [[Veneto]] (including [[Friuli]])
# [[Trentino]] (presently not operating)
# [[Julian March]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]
# [[Duchy of Parma and Piacenza|Parma and Piacenza]]
# [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena and Reggio]]
# [[Tuscany]]
# Romagne ([[Papal States|Papal]] [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] and the whole [[Romagna]])
# [[Lazio|Latium]], [[Umbria]] and [[Marche]]s
# Neapolitan provinces: they include [[Campania]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Apulia]], [[Basilicata]] and [[Calabria]]
# [[Sardinia]]&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;The association of Sardinia seceded from the CNI in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Sicily]]

Each association elect a “heraldic-genealogical commission” composed by 6 to 21 members for compiling the regional nobility registrar and assessing requests of inscriptions.  Each commission elect within its members a chairman, a vice-chairman, a secretary, a delegate to the ''Central heraldic body'' (see below) and a vice-delegate.

Each association can be governed by a council, composed by a president, a vice-president, a chancellor, a treasurer, some counsellors and the representative of the ''youth club'', but there is actually no difference between council and commission in all regional associations.

==== At central level ====
The CNI itself is governed by a '''National heraldic council''' (''Consiglio araldico nazionale'', sometimes referred to as CAN), composed by all members of regional commissions and the president of the youth club. This body elect the offices and decide main issues both as far as organisation and nobility matters are concerned.
The CAN elect a chairman, six vice-chairmen, a chancellor, a treasurer and the representative in the ''[[CILANE]]''.

Nobility issues, and chiefly the rights to titles (including the mere title of Noble) are decided by a '''Central heraldic body''' (''Giunta araldica centrale'', sometimes referred to as GAC), composed by the 14 delegates of the regional commissions.  They elect a chairman among all members of regional commissions and one (or two) of them as vice-chairman.

All CNI members aged less than 35 years are part of the '''CNI Youth club''' (''Corpo della nobiltà italiana - circolo giovanile'', also called referred to as CNI-CG),&lt;ref&gt;Whose [http://www.cnicg.net website] contains plenty of sources about the italian nobility {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that organise social events at national and international level.  They elect a president, a vice-president, a secretary, a treasurer and the CILANE youth delegate and appoint a delegate in each regional association among the its young members.

In case of problems between associates, the CAN elect a '''Court of honour''' (meaning it judges on matters relating to honour and reputation; in Italian, ''Corte d'onore'', always referred to as “Corte d'onore”), composed by three ordinary members and two deputies,  expert in law. Ordinary members elect one of them as chairman.

The main CNI ruling body is actually the '''Board of directors''' (''ufficio di presidenza'', sometimes referred to as UP), composed by:
:CAN chairman;
:CAN 6 vice-chairmen;
:CAN chancellor;
:CAN treasurer;
:CAN delegate to the CILANE;
:GAC chairman;
:Chairman of the Court of honour;
:President of the youth club, whenever youth issues are discussed.

=== A unique role ===
CNI consider themselves not to be one nobility association among the several ones existing in Italy, but as ''the'' nobility association ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;L. Michelini, ''CILANE et CNI'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; This self-esteem depend on different facts:
* the [[king]] in exile, H.M. [[Umberto II of Italy|Humbert II]], considered to be still ''[[fons honorum]]'' depending on his being a non-defeated monarch (or, according to other authors, due to the illegitimate establishment of the Italian Republic with respect to agreed-upon rules), gave the association his high appreciation in the task of recognizing nobility titles;&lt;ref&gt;L. Michelini, ''CILANE et CNI'', p. 12−16&lt;/ref&gt;
* most Italian nobles recognize its role and task;
* in recognitions of titles, they strictly apply the existing rules of the Italian State (which the Italian Republic simply chose not to apply, but that were never declared as illegittimate), meaning that, should the State ever restart to recognize nobility titles, rules application would lead exactly to the same recognitions made by the CNI.
Not all observers share this view,&lt;ref&gt;L. Michelini, ''CILANE et CNI'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; with various arguments.
Nevertheless, the important role played by the CNI as a representative of Italian Nobles is recognized by the CILANE, that recognize the ''Corpo della nobiltà italiana'' as their only Italian member.  A tight cooperation with the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]] is operating, too, reaffirming the CNI authority in nobility questions.  Lastly, in case of doubts titles are used as CNI officially state them by the ''Union of Italian clubs'', most of which still use nobility titles for social purposes.

=== List of chairmen&lt;ref&gt;L. Michelini, ''CILANE et CNI'', p. 17, n. 15&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* [[Prince]] Don Emilio Guasco Gallarati,&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;Emilio being the first name and Guasco Gallarati a double surname.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marquis]] of Bisio, Noble of [[Alessandria]];
* [[Marquis]] Don Annibale Brivio Sforza,&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;Annibale being the first name and Brivio Sforza a double surname.&lt;/ref&gt; Marquis of Santa Maria in Prato, [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of [[Milan]];
* Don Giovan Pietro of [[Duke]]s Caffarelli, [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of [[Rome]] (until 1997);
* Don Gabrio Visconti, [[Marquis]] of San Vito, [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of [[Milan]] (1997);
* [[Count]] Don Gaetano Barbiano, count and lord of Belgiojoso, [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of [[Milan]]&lt;ref&gt;Although the actual surname is Barbiano, this house is usually called Belgiojoso.&lt;/ref&gt; (since 1998);
* [[Marquis]] Doimo Frangipane di Strassoldo,&lt;ref group=”Notes”&gt;Doimo being the first name and Frangipane and Strassoldo a double surname.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord of Castel Porpetto, [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of [[Rome]] (until 2007);
* Luigi Michelini of [[Count]]s of San Martino with Rivalta (2007−2012).

'''Crime in Bolivia''' is investigated by the [[Law enforcement in Bolivia|Bolivian police]].

== Crime by type ==

=== Murder ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Bolivia had a murder rate of 12.1 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 1,270 murders in Bolivia in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegal drug trade ===
{{Further|Illegal drug trade in Bolivia}}

The Bolivian government has since 2004 implemented a policy of voluntary participation of farmers from all coca-growing regions in Bolivia. For instance, farmers in Chapare are allowed to grow one cato of coca per year.&lt;ref name=Ledebur&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ledebur | first1 = K. | last2 = Youngers | first2 = C. | year = 2013 | title = From Conflict to Collaboration: An Innovative Approach to Reducing Coca Cultivation in Bolivia | url = | journal = Stability: International Journal of Security and Development | volume = 2 | issue = 1| page = 9 | doi = 10.5334/sta.aw }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any coca grown beyond that limit, or any cultivation outside of approved coca-cultivation regions such as Chapare, is subject to elimination. The strategy relies on coca growers federations’ ability to enforce the agreement. Such federations are influential, and penalties for violations by farmers or lax enforcement by federations can be stern (including seizure of lands). As a result, coca cultivation in Bolivia fell to 27,200 hectares in 2011 from 31,000 hectares in 2010 - a 12 per cent decrease.&lt;ref name=Ledebur /&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Further|Domestic violence in Bolivia}}
[[Domestic violence]] is a serious and underreported problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#section6|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Center for the Women’s Information and Development (CIDEM) and Emancipation Fund study, the number of reported domestic violence cases increased by 37% between 2007 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#section6women|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[Pan American Health Organization]] conducted in 12 Latin American countries found the highest prevalence of domestic violence against women to be in Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/violence-against-women-lac.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], the power to establish [[criminal law]] and rules of investigation is vested in the federal Parliament. The provinces share responsibility for law enforcement (although provincial policing in many jurisdictions is contracted to the federal [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]), and while the power to prosecute criminal offences is assigned to the federal government, responsibility for prosecutions is delegated to the provinces for most types of criminal offences. Laws and sentencing guidelines are uniform throughout the country, but provinces vary in their level of enforcement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Crime since the 1980s==
Canada's growing multi-ethnic society in the 1980s introduced new organized crime groups that competed with the Mafia, marking a growth in crimes such as drug trafficking, gambling, loansharking, migrant smuggling, cigarette smuggling, liquor smuggling and prostitution. The Rizzuto-Caruana-Cuntrera Italian Mafia families lost ground in cocaine and heroin smuggling to Iranian and Chinese gangs, Colombian cartels and outlaw biker gangs starting in the mid-1970s. Chinese gangs smuggled heroin through airports in the 1970s and shifted toward cargo containers entering Vancouver around 1985. By 2001, the RCMP estimated up to 15 metric tons of cocaine reaching Canada annually. 

Illegal immigrants from Asia to the US frequently enter through Canada and lower criminal penalties tended to favor drug smuggling. In particular, Canada did not criminalize the possession of precursor chemicals for drugs like methamphetamine. After the 1970s, synthetic drugs overtook liquor as the main item smuggled into the US and by the 1990s Canada supplied large amounts of high-grade marijuana, ecstasy and methamphetamine. Quebec mobsters, relocated to Florida, maintained two large pill making operations in Quebec from 1981 to 1986, shipping 13.5 million methaqualone tablets to the US. By the early 2000s, Canada was a net exporter of marijuana to US, although comprised only one-fifth the amount coming from Mexico. A pound valued at $2000 in Vancouver would sell for as much as $6000 in California. 

Gerald Matticks, a major leader in the Irish West End Gang in Quebec was suspected by police as the smuggler behind two large hashish shipments captured in 2000, but an investigation of the Quebec Hells Angels uncovered his name in documents. Spreadsheets indicated that the Hells Angels owed $7 million to Matticks for cocaine and hashish, leading to his arrest and conviction. 

Legalized gambling shrank the illegal gambling market in Canada after the 1970s. However, a 1996 report found that illegal gambling in Ontario was a $10 billion industry and in 1999 the Illegal Gaming Enforcement Unit was created by the province, bringing 941 gambling charges against 623 people. Video lottery machines are often used illegally by the Italian mafia, Chinese and Russian gangs, as well as the Hells Angels. As many as 25,000 machines were believed to be distributed in Southern Ontario in 1996.

Tobacco smuggling grew rapidly after the Canadian government increased the excise tax on cigarettes 140 percent. By 1993, there were as many as 100 million contraband cartons circulating in the country. However, the government did not impose penalties on cigarettes for export and many exported cigarettes were brought back into the country. A joint sting operation netted Larry Miller, who had earned $687 million between 1992 and 1996, enough to afford a Learjet to go between Las Vegas and [[Massena, New York]], where cigarettes were smuggled through the Akwasasne reservation—which because of its cross-border nature, lacked border security. The Mohawk Warrior Society, famous for the 1990 Oka standoff had launched into tobacco and migrant smuggling beginning around 1988. Due to smuggling, the government lowered cigarette taxes in 1994. However, high liquor duties—at 80 percent of the price, rather than 40 in the US—led to significant liquor smuggling. 

Smuggling demands drove corruption among baggage handlers at Toronto Pearson airport, prompting an audit of 131,000 airport workers after 4500 were found to have ties to bikers gangs and organized crime, in 2004. 

After 1983, migrant smuggling increased rapidly. Cheng Chui Ping, a Chinese grandmother from Fujian province orchestrated a major "Snakehead" smuggler gang, transporting thousands of people in the 1990s. Between 1994 and 2003, 15,000 Chinese people entered Canada illegally. In March, 2000 the RCMP infiltrated a large prostitution ring that had smuggled in 280 Korean women to work as forced laborers in massage parlors. The federal government in 1998 opted to exempt exotic dancers from restrictions on working in Canada, helping to drive prostitution. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schneider, Stephen|year=2009|title=Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada |publisher=Springer|p=343-370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics Canada data==
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian Criminal Cases collection]]

The province with the lowest crime rate in 2006 for the third straight year was [[Ontario]] with 5,689 per 100,000, followed by [[Quebec]] with 5,909 per 100,000.  The province with the highest crime rate for the 9th straight year was [[Saskatchewan]] with 13,711 per 100,000.   [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] is the city with the highest crime rate followed by its provincial counterpart [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]].  [[Quebec City]], [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]], and [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] have the lowest crime rates of any city and are all located in [[Quebec]].

For years [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|native Canadian women]] have been victims of sexual assault and murder disproportionately often and there have been complaints that the police paid insufficient attention to the problem.

In contrast, first nations peoples in Canada represent a disproportionate number of victims of the criminal justice system, in some provinces representing up to 85% of the incarcerated inmates.  Recent Canadian legislation instigating mandatory minimums could result in increasing those statistics (and federal and provincial penal and punishment budgets), radically.  Similar legislation in the United States quadrupled the inmate population over a 20-year span. Australia`s prison budget grew so rapidly it repealed its mandatory minimums legislation within ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-dc75304f-e77c-4125-aacf-83e7714a5840|title=Red River Women|website=BBC News|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The three northern territories have higher per capita crime rates than any province.  As evidenced by the crime map above right, Saskatchewan has a higher crime rate than the other Canadian provinces, but lower than the territories.

The number of murders dropped to 594 in 2007, 12 fewer than the previous year. One-third of the 2007 murders were stabbings and another third were by firearm. In 2007, there were 190 stabbings and 188 shootings. Handguns were used in two-thirds of all firearm murders. Seventy-four youths were accused of murder, down 11 from the previous year. About eighty-four percent of murders were done by someone known to the victim. Male victims of homicide were most likely to be killed by an acquaintance, someone known to them through a criminal relationship, or a stranger. Female victims of homicide were most frequently killed by a current or former intimate partner, or another [[family]] member. The province with the highest crime rate was [[Manitoba]] while the lowest crime rates occurred in [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].

Police reported criminal violence is thought to be an undercount of actual violence rates.  Thus, approximately every five years, Statistics Canada conducts a survey of victimization in Canada.  The last General Social Survey conducted was in 2004, where 24,000 people were contacted by telephone: 106 reported incidents of violence per 1,000 polled, which is slightly lower than in 1999 when it was 111 per 1,000 polled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-630-x/2008001/article/10643-eng.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66DcS2CgG?url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-630-x/2008001/article/10643-eng.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-17 |deadurl=no |format=PDF |title=Violent victimization in Canada |first1=Robyn |last1=Brazeau |first2=Jodi-Anne |last2=Brzozowski |page=1 |website=Statcan.ca|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime statistics by province and territory===
Crime statistics vary considerably through different parts of Canada.  In general, the eastern provinces have the lowest violent crime rates while the western provinces have higher rates and the territories higher still.  Of the provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan have the highest violent crime rates.  The chart below also shows that Saskatchewan has the highest provincial assault rate, and that Manitoba has the highest provincial sexual assault rate, robbery rate and homicide rate of any Canadian province. In many instances the crime rates in the Yukon, North West Territories and Nunavut are the highest in the country and can be up to ten times the national average.

2016 crime statistics for the provinces and territories are given below, as reported by [[Statistics Canada]].&lt;ref name="MULTI3"/&gt;

==Police==
{{Main article|Law enforcement in Canada}}
[[Image:Police rate in Canada.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Police per 100,000 population across Canada, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-225-x/2012000/t002-eng.pdf |title=Police officers by level of policing, by province and territory, 2012 |publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{legend|#d5e5ff|&lt; 176}}

In 2005, there were 61,050 police officers in Canada which equates to one police officer per 528.6 persons, but with significant regional variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal15.htm |title= Police personnel |accessdate= 2006-10-09 |publisher = Statistics Canada |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060926101202/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal15.htm |archivedate = September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] have the fewest police per capita with 664.9 and 648.4 persons per police officer, respectively. Conversely, the highest ratio of police to population is found in Canada's northern territories; [[Nunavut]] has 247.9 persons per police officer, the [[Northwest Territories]] has 248.5 persons per officer and the [[Yukon]] has 258.2 persons for each police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal05c.htm |title=Police officers, by province and territory |accessdate= 2006-10-09 |publisher = Statistics Canada |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060909143734/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/legal05c.htm |archivedate = 2006-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That is a substantially lower rate than most developed countries with only [[Japan]] and [[Sweden]] having so few police officers. The United States has one officer per 411.5 persons, and Germany 344.8.

Canada's national police force is the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) which is the main police force in Canada's north, and in rural areas except in [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Those three provinces have their own provincial police forces, although the RCMP still operate throughout rural Newfoundland and also provide specific federal policing services in Ontario and Quebec. Many cities and districts have their own municipal police forces, while others have contracts with the provincial police or RCMP to police their communities.

=== Report rates of crimes ===
A publication posted on [[Statistics Canada]] reported that in 2009, only a small portion of crimes that happen are reported to the police (31% of all crimes), and this figure has been lowering from 1999 (37%) and 2004 (34%).&lt;ref name="MULTI2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2010002/article/11340/tbl/tbl10-eng.htm|title=Table 10 Self-reported victimizations reported to police, 1999, 2004 and 2009|website=Statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 54% of break and enters, 43% of robberies, and 34% of assaults are reported to the police.&lt;ref name=MULTI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2010002/article/11340-eng.htm#a18|title=Criminal victimization in Canada, 2009|website=Statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common reason for not reporting a crime was the victim thought it was not important enough (68%). Other common reasons include; they think the police cannot do anything about it (59%), or they dealt with it another way (42%). Multiple reasons are given so the percentages do not sum to 100%.

==Punishment==
{{See also|Criminal sentencing in Canada}}
Canada abolished the [[death penalty]] for murder in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Executions in Canada from 1860 to abolition. | url = http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/canada.html|website=Capitalpunishmentuk.org| accessdate = 14 May 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; instituting a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for murder. {{See|Life imprisonment in Canada}}

In 2001, Canada had about 32,000 people in prison or about 0.13% of the total population. Globally, the United States was the country with the highest percentage of inmate population (about 0.7% of the total population). The European average is 0.2% of the total population, with [[France]] and [[Germany]] having lower rates than Canada, but with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]] and most of Eastern Europe having higher ones.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Comparisons==
Comparing crime rates between countries is difficult due to the differences in jurisprudence, reporting and crime classifications.  National crime statistics are in reality statistics of only selected crime types. Data are collected through various surveying methods that have previously ranged between 15% and 100% coverage of the data.  A 2001 Statistics Canada study concluded that comparisons with the U.S. on homicide rates were the most reliable.  Comparison of rates for six lesser incident crimes was considered possible but subject to more difficulty of interpretation.  For example, types of assaults receive different classifications and laws in Canada and the U.S., making comparisons more difficult than homicides.  At the time, the U.S. crime of aggravated assault could be compared to the sum of three Canadian crimes (aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, and attempted murder). This comparison had a predicted bias that would inflate the Canadian numbers by only 0.1%.  The study also concluded that directly comparing the two countries' reported total crime rate (i.e. total selected crimes) was "inappropriate" since the totals include the problem data sets as well as the usable sets.&lt;ref name=statcan2001comp&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0035x/85f0035x2001000-eng.pdf Feasibility Study on Crime Comparisons Between Canada and the United States] Maire Gannon, Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Statistics Canada, Cat. no. 85F0035XIE. Retrieved June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons like these, homicides have been favored in international studies looking for predictors of crime rates (predictors like [[Economic inequality#Effects of inequality|economic inequality]]).

===United States===
Much study has been done of the comparative experience and policies of [[Canada]] with its southern neighbour the [[United States]], and this is a topic of intense discussion within Canada.

Historically, the violent crime rate in Canada is far lower than that of the U.S. and this continues to be the case.  For example, in 2000 the United States' rate for robberies was 65 percent higher, its rate for aggravated assault was more than double, and its murder rate was triple that of Canada. However, the rate of some property crime types is lower in the U.S. than in Canada. For example, in 2006, the rates of vehicle theft were 22% higher in Canada than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=United States Crime Rates 1960 - 2008 |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in recent years,{{When|date=July 2012}} the gap in violent crime rates between the United States and Canada has narrowed due to a precipitous drop in the violent crime rate in the U.S.  For example, while the aggravated assault rate declined for most of the 1990s in the U.S. and was 324 per 100,000 in 2000, the aggravated assault rate in Canada remained relatively steady throughout and was 143 per 100,000 in 2000.  In other areas, the U.S. had a faster decline.  For instance, whereas the murder rate in Canada declined by 36% between 1991 and 2004, the U.S. murder rate declined by 44%.

The homicide rate in Canada peaked in 1975 at 3.03 per 100,000 and has dropped since then; it reached lower peaks in 1985 (2.72) and 1991 (2.69).  It reached a post-1970 low of 1.73 in 2003. The average murder rate between 1970 and 1976 was 2.52, between 1977 and 1983 it was 2.67, between 1984 and 1990 it was 2.41, between 1991 and 1997 it was 2.23 and between 1998 and 2004 it was 1.82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/85-002-XIE/85-002-XIE2006006.pdf|title=85-002-XIE2006006.indd|website=Statcan.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attempted homicide rate has fallen at a faster rate than the homicide rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonpolice.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/4B12A796-B0C9-436C-9F64-840D3EBEE09F/0/CrimeStatisticsinCanada2004.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411090006/http://www.hamiltonpolice.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/4B12A796-B0C9-436C-9F64-840D3EBEE09F/0/CrimeStatisticsinCanada2004.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 April 2008|title=Wayback Machine|date=11 April 2008|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, the homicide rate in the U.S. reached 10.1 per 100,000 in 1974, peaked in 1980 at 10.7 and reached a lower peak in 1991 (10.5).  The average murder rate between 1970 and 1976 was 9.4, between 1977 and 1983 it was 9.6, between 1984 and 1990 it was 9, between 1991 and 1997 it was 9.2 and between 1998 and 2004 it was 6.3.  In 2004, the murder rate in the U.S. dipped below 6 per 100,000, for the first time since 1966, and as of 2010 stood at 4.8 per 100,000 &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In more recent years, the U.S. as a country still typically has higher violent crimes rates. In 2012, the homicide rate in the U.S. was 4.7 per 100,000 residents,&lt;ref name="USA crime 2012"&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1993-2012.xls Crime in the United States 2012]. By Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1993–2012. FBI.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's was 3 times lower at 1.6.&lt;ref name="Canada Crime"/&gt; However the chances of being murdered at random are extremely low in both countries. In Canada, only 15% of murders are committed by strangers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2012001/article/11738-eng.htm#a5|title=Homicide in Canada, 2011|website=Statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. this number is very similar at 14%,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_10_murder_circumstances_by_relationship_2012.xls Expanded Homicide Data Table 10 (FBI)]. Note that I did not include gang homicides as "stranger killings" as there is some affiliation between rival gangs, it's not necessarily random like being killed in an attempted robbery. Retrieved May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; meaning in 50 years your chance of being murdered at random is 0.000128% in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;1.6*50=80, meaning 80 people of every 100,000 are murdered in 50 years. 80/100,000*0.16=0.000128%. The same formula is used for the U.S. rate&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. it is 0.000329% (of course these numbers would vary by neighborhoods within each country). Certain methods of homicide are used more frequently in each country; in Canada (0.59),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2012001/article/11738/c-g/desc/desc03-eng.htm|title=Homicides, by most common type of method, Canada, 1961 to 2011|website=Statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; stabbing homicides occur 51.3% more often than in the U.S. (0.39),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2008-2012.xls|format=XLS|title=Expanded Homicide Data Table 8: Murder Victims by Weapon, 2008–2012|website=Fbi.gov|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however firearm homicides occur 440% more in the U.S. (2.7) than in Canada (0.5). In the U.S., you are 3 times more likely to die being shot (17.4%) than being stabbed (5.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/archive/knives/msg00000.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034717/http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/guns/archive/knives/msg00000.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 November 2014|title=Are stab wounds as dangerous as gun shot wounds?|date=16 November 2014|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond homicides, the U.S. (112.9) has a higher robbery rate - 42.2% higher than Canada (79.4). Other violent crimes such as physical assaults or sexual assaults are not very comparable between the countries because of different definitions of the crimes. The disparity in property crime is not as large, however it still exists. The burglary/break-in rate in the U.S. (670.2) is 33.1% higher than in Canada (503.7), the theft rate in the U.S. (1959.3) is 33.4% higher than in Canada (1468.4), and the auto-theft rate in the U.S. (229.7) is slightly higher than the rate in Canada (223.5).

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-54121-0003, Berlin, Waldlaufmeisterschaften.jpg|thumb|left|people running in 1958]]

The city responded to the 1685 revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. Thanks to its role as the capital of rising Prussia, the population grew steadily: it surpassed the 100,000 mark in 1747 and the one-million mark in 1877.

Growth accelerated in the 19th century with the industrialisation after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Prussian Reforms]]. Only about 40% of Berliners in the last quarter of the 19th century were natives of the city. Nevertheless, Berlin's population remained ethnically and even regionally very homogeneous: In 1895, over 98% of inhabitants spoke [[German language|German]] as their native language. Among the rest were 12,000 [[Polish language|Polish]] speakers, 700 [[Russian language|Russophones]] and about 2,000 other Slavs. In 1900, most of the 1.9 million Berliners originated from the [[East Elbia|eastern provinces]] of Prussia. A fifth hailed from the surrounding province of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], 9% from the provinces of [[West Prussia|West]] and [[East Prussia]], 7% from [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]], 6% from [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], 5% from [[Province of Posen|Posen]], 4% from [[Province of Saxony|Saxony]]. Only about 3 to 4% had come to the city from other German regions and only about 1,5% from abroad, mostly from [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Rounded numbers, compiled from: Wolfgang Ribbe (ed.): Geschichte Berlins. Vol. II. Von der Märzrevolution bis zur Gegenwart. C. H. Beck, München 1987, pp. 692–697; Otto-Friedrich Gandert, Berthold Schulze, Ernst Kaeber and others (eds.): Heimatchronik Berlin. Archiv für deutsche Heimatpflege, Köln 1962, p. 427; Max Mechow: Die Ost- und Westpreußen in Berlin. Ein Beitrag zur Bevölkerungsgeschichte der Stadt. Haude &amp; Spener, Berlin 1975, pp. 112-113; Königliches statistisches Bureau [Royal Statistical Bureau] (ed.): Statistisches Handbuch für den preußischen Staat. Verlag des königlichen statistischen Bureaus, Berlin 1898, concerning the native language pp. 128-129, concerning the percentage of foreigners pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1913 and 1917, the population fell by about 16% down to 1.744 million people, mostly due to men serving in [[World War I]], but recovered somewhat after the [[Armistice of Compiegne|armistice]], reaching 1.928 million people in December 1919. In December 1917, during the latter part of the war, there were 58,152 military personnel and 4,017 prisoners-of-war in the city.

The [[Industrial Revolution|industrialisation]] had brought about a rapid expansion of the suburbs, many of them developed explicitly for workers of specific factories, e.g. [[Siemensstadt]] and [[Borsigwalde]]. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] of 1920 (''Groß-Berlin-Gesetz'') boosted the population by incorporating many hitherto autonomous towns and cities, e.g. [[Spandau]] and [[Köpenick]] at the margins of the modern metropolis, but also [[Charlottenburg]], nowadays almost in the heart of the city. The city approximately reached its modern extent, growing from {{convert|66|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This expansion made Berlin the most populous city proper of Continental Europe in the interwar period (though not the largest agglomeration&lt;ref&gt;[[Paris]] had a more populous agglomeration although the city proper was much smaller, cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris#/media/File:Paris_Historical_Population_(1801-2008).png&lt;/ref&gt;) and the third-largest in the world behind [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]. 

The four-million mark was surpassed in the 1920s, and in 1942, the officially registered population reached its maximum of 4.48 million, although because of the war conditions, this was an overestimation. More likely estimates based on food rationing data show lower numbers of 3.95 million people in February 1942 and only 3.11 million people in February 1944 (incl. 177,000 foreigners) when [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|aerial attacks]] approached its most intense phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Statistisches Bundesamt|title=Statistische Berichte, Arb.-Nr. VIII/19/1. Die Zivilbevölkerung des Deutschen Reiches 1940-1945. Ergebnisse der Verbrauchergruppen-Statistik|date=1953|location=Wiesbaden|pages=13, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the more general huge [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|population movements]] in immediately post-war Germany, a significant part of Berlin's pre-war population permanently resettled to other parts of Germany or abroad. A 1946 census counted 436,600 Berliners in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|western occupation zones]] and 306,823 in the [[Soviet Zone of Germany|Soviet zone]]. In 1950, this number had risen to 518,218 in what had now become the [[West Germany|Federal Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Statistisches Bundesamt|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland 1953|pages=XXXII, 41, 561|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of [[World War II]], the city population has been fluctuating between 3 and 3.5 million, with a low of less than 3.1 million from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2011|date=2011|page=32|url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/PRODUKTE/jahrbuch/jb2011/JB_2011_BE.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1961, so between the establishment of the Soviet-backed [[German Democratic Republic]] and the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]], most of the losses were incurred by [[East Berlin]], while [[West Berlin]] showed modest growth of 2.3%.

Moving to West Berlin was attractive for those from [[West Germany]] who wished to [[Draft dodger|avoid the draft]] from 1957 to 1990, because the [[West Berlin#Legal status|special administrative status]] of the city meant that the draft could not be enforced there.

Asylum policies in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration during the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to about 250,000 [[Turks in Germany|Turks]] (especially in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Neukölln]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], a locality in the borough of [[Mitte]]),&lt;ref name="250k Turks"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-shish-and-sauerkraut-to-go-448678.html|title=Berlin: Shish And Sauerkraut To Go|first=Andrew|last=Spooner|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=13 May 2007|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.

During the 1990s, the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of residents of the former [[Soviet Union]]. Ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from countries from the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 Berlin is speaking Russians' language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406142034/http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 |date=2013-04-06 }}. The Russia Journal. 10 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration continues from a number of Western countries, particularly by young people from Germany and other parts of Europe.

An '''engagement party''' is a party held to celebrate a couple's recent [[engagement]] and to help future wedding guests to get to know one another.{{cn|date=September 2014}} Traditionally, the [[bride]]'s parents host the engagement party, but many modern couples host their own celebration.

==History==
Originally, engagement parties had the appearance of normal parties at which the [[father]] of the bride-to-be made a surprise announcement of the engagement to his guests.  The engagement party had the purpose of sharing the [[engagement]] news with family members and friends. Therefore, it was not a traditional gift-giving occasion, as none of the guests were supposed to be aware of the engagement until after their arrival.

In [[ancient Greece]], an engagement party was a [[commercial transaction]]. It was essentially an [[oral contract]], made between the man who gave the woman in marriage (usually her father) and the [[Bridegroom|groom]].&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://www.courant.com/technology/chi-0402290253feb29,0,3051196.story A perfect union?

A [[Jewish culture|Jewish]] engagement party is known as a ''vort'' ({{lang-yi|word}}). Breaking a ceramic [[Plate (dishware)|plate]] at a ''vort'' is customary, symbolizing the permanence of marriage and mirroring the [[Jewish wedding#Breaking the glass|breaking of a glass]] at a Jewish wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/180/Q4/ |title=A Smashing Engagement |website=Ask the Rabbi |publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach]] |access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Scottish Gaelic tradition, a [[rèiteach]] was a betrothal ritual which typically ended in a dance party for the whole community.

===Modern times===
In modern times, an engagement party may celebrate a previously publicized engagement.  It is a party like any other, except that usually toasts or speeches are made to announce the upcoming [[wedding]].

While it varies, an engagement party takes place at the beginning of the process of planning a wedding. It is often thrown at the couple's home or at the home of a close friend or relative of the couple.  Gifts are never obligatory, and if one is brought, it should be small and less expensive than a typical [[wedding anniversary#Celebration and gifts|wedding gift]].&lt;ref name="MartinMartin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacobina Martin|author2=Judith Martin|title= Miss Manners' Guide to a Surprisingly Dignified Wedding|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gSggUrFCgNsC&amp;pg=PA50|date= 11 January 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-07715-5|pages= 50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], engagement parties are currently a more common practice in the [[Northeastern United States | Northeast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reasons Why Engagement Parties are common in NY than Bachelor Parties|url = http://www.thebachelorscode.com/why-engagement-parties-are-common-in-ny-than-bachelor-parties/|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York area]], though they are becoming more common in the [[Southeastern United States | Southeast]] as well.{{cn|date=November 2014}} In most other parts of the country relatively few couples have them.  Unlike publishing the [[banns of marriage]], an engagement party has never been required.

In [[Africa]], what is now known as an ''engagement party'' may in fact be the last remnant of the traditional, pre-colonial marriage ceremony itself. Such is the case with the [[Yoruba people]] and their [[bride-price]] [[Yoruba culture#Wedding|rites]] and the [[Nguni people]] and their [[lobola]] practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1709">[[Image:Nicolas Lancret 001.jpg|thumb|right|18th century courtiers in [[fancy dress]], at a fête champêtre in a landscaped park]]
[[Image:Fiesta campestre.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Pastoral Concert]]'']]
A '''Fête champêtre''' was a popular form of [[entertainment]] in the 18th century, taking the form of a [[garden party]].  This form of entertainment was particularly popular at the French [[court]] where at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] areas of the [[park]] were landscaped with [[folly|follies]], [[pavilion]]s and [[temple]]s to accommodate such festivities.

While the term is derived from the French expression for a "pastoral festival" or "country feast" and in theory was a simple form of entertainment, in practice (especially in the 18th century), a fête champêtre was often a very elegant form of entertainment involving on occasions whole [[orchestra]]s hidden in trees, with guests sometimes in [[fancy dress]].  Thus the simplicity of the event was often contrived.  A fête champêtre is very similar to a [[Fête galante]] although this term is generally more confined to the idealistic fête champêtre as depicted in art.

A famous painting, the ''[[Pastoral Concert]]'' (as the Louvre now call it) dated to ca. 1509 and variously attributed to [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], and [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], was named ''Fête champêtre'' when it first became part of the [[Louvre]] collection. The title is somewhat misleading, as the painting most likely represents some mythological subject, whose precise identification has posed difficulties for art historians.

'''''Gook''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|uː|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ʊ|k}}) is a derogatory term for certain people of [[East Asians|East]] and [[Southeast Asian]] descent. The slur is frequently directed toward foreigners, especially people of Filipino, Korean, or Vietnamese descent.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/gook Oxford Dictionares]''&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally predominantly used by the U.S. military during wartime, especially during the [[Korean War|Korean War]], and more so during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=roegook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidroediger.org/articles/gook-the-short-history-of-americanism.html |title=Gook: The Short History of an Americanism |work=[[Monthly Review]] |date=March 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030111334/http://www.davidroediger.org/articles/gook-the-short-history-of-americanism.html |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gook?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and use ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that the origin of the current usage is unknown.&lt;ref name=roegook /&gt; There are three suggested possible origins:
* An earlier usage of ''gook'', meaning "[[prostitute]]", recorded in a slang dictionary published in 1893, which defined ''gook'' as "a low prostitute";&lt;ref name=farmer&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farmer |first=John S. |last2=Henley |first2=W. E. |url=https://archive.org/stream/slangitsanalogue03farmuoft#page/181/mode/1up |title=Slang and its Analogues, Past and Present |publisher=Printed for subscribers only |date=1893 |volume=III - Fla. to Hyps. |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar meaning was recorded for ''gooh'' in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lighter |first=Jonathan E. |title=Random Historical Dictionary of American Slang  |publisher=[[Random House]] |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later came to imply a foolish or peculiar person.&lt;ref name=enswear /&gt; The ''goo-goo'' term, whose origins are similarly uncertain, was first used in 1842 by U.S. troops in the [[Second Opium War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paterson |first=Thomas |last2=Merrill |first2=Dennis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spA88Rt23soC&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Major Problems in American Foreign Relations, Volume I |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |date=2009 |page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to Koreans living in China at the time, although ''slanty [[nigger]]'' was more prevalent to distinguish Koreans from the Chinese, who were referred to as ''chinky'' or ''chinks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Unoki |first=Ko |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UaeL64p-ukC&amp;ots=0oYh99XlTQ&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mergers, Acquisitions and Global Empires |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That when American servicemen heard the term during the [[Korean War]], they heard the word as 'gook" instead of k(g)uk which means "national" (maybe, thus, interpreted as [[nationalist]]) ''goo-goo'' (also ''gugu''), a term used by the U.S. military to describe Koreans.&lt;ref name=enswear&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Geoffrey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2lHwkWMXaxwC&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=An Encyclopedia of Swearing |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2006 |pages=207–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That "gook" comes from the [[Korean language|Korean]] word "국" (''guk''), meaning "country",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cao |first1=Lan |last2=Novas |first2=Himilce |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1tskNgsz3wC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=gook |title=Everything You Need to Know About Asian-American History |publisher=[[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] |date=1996 |page=250 |quote=Gook, the American racial epithet for all Asian Americans, is actually the Korean word for 'country.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "한국" (''hanguk''), meaning "Korea", or "미국" (''miguk''), meaning "America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Robert G. |title=Orientals: Asian Americans in Popular Culture |publisher=[[Temple University Press]] |date=1999 |quote=A bastardization of the Korean "Hanguk" (Korean), or Miguk (American)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, U.S. soldiers might have heard locals saying ''miguk,'' referring to Americans, and misinterpreted this as "Me gook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcf_4T-nPuoC&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century |publisher=[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] |page=117 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mỹ Quốc"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mỹ Quốc in English|url=https://en.glosbe.com/vi/en/M%E1%BB%B9%20Qu%E1%BB%91c|website=Glosbe|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an archaism in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] that died out due to a [[History of writing in Vietnam|language shift]], starting from just before the [[Indochina Wars]] and culminating with the end of that period often referred to as the [[Vietnam War]], which has the same root and similar pronunciation to Korean "미국" (''miguk'') both stemming from [[Chinese characters]] "美國"(''Měiguó'') also meaning "America."

[[H. L. Mencken|Mencken]] reported the earliest use of the word ''gook'': he wrote that [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|U.S. Marines occupying Nicaragua]] in 1912 took to calling the natives ''gooks'' and that it had previously been a term for Filipinos.&lt;ref name=warslang&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickson |first=Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGNMBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=War Slang |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |year=2011 |page=29 |quote=Dickson cites Mencken's ''The American Language,'' Supplement 1 (1945)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further mentions that the natives of [[Costa Rica]] are sometimes called ''goo-goos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mencken |first=H.

Crowell Co.]] |date=1960 |quote=''gook'': Generically, a native of the Pacific islands, Africa, Japan, China, Korea or any European country except England; usually a brown-skinned or Oriental non-Christian.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Italians]] in 1944, [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] in the '70s, and [[Arabs]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=enswear /&gt; This dual usage is similar to the offensive word [[wog]] in [[British English]].

In modern U.S. usage, "gook" refers particularly to [[Communism|communist]] soldiers during the Vietnam War and has also been used towards all Vietnamese and at other times to all East Asians in general.  It is considered to be highly offensive. In a highly publicized incident, Senator [[John McCain]] used the word during the [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]] to refer to his former captors: "I hate the gooks. I will hate them as long as I live… I was referring to my [[prison guard]]s and I will continue to refer to them in language that might offend." He later apologized to the Vietnamese community at large.&lt;ref name=awapol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2000_02_24/feature_mccainapology.html |title=McCain Apologizes for 'Gook' Comment |work=[[Asiaweek]] |date=24 February 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001102101856/http://www.asianweek.com/2000_02_24/feature_mccainapology.html |archivedate=November 2, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used by non-U.S. militaries, notably the Rhodesian forces during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], where it was used interchangeably with ''terr'' and ''terrorist'' to describe the guerrillas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1980/feb/09/zimbabwe.simonhoggart |title=Ironing the lawn in Salisbury, Rhodesia |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 February 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyslop |first=Angus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtJh00OCBA8C&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Jaws of the Lion: Rhodesia Before Zimbabwe |publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu.com]] |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Australian forces during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=enswear /&gt;

The 1960 single "Yogi" by [[The Ivy Three]] contains ''gook'' in the lyrics to describe an Indian [[Yogi]]. The harmless usage of the term in the lyrics indicates that it had become a playful word used to describe certain Asian ethnic groups before its usage Vietnam War redefined the term as an offensive racial epithet.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Humans in Buddhism''' (Sanskrit {{IAST|'''manuṣya'''}}, Pali {{IAST|'''manussa'''}}) are the subjects of an extensive commentarial literature that examines the nature and qualities of a human life from the point of view of humans' ability to achieve [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. In Buddhism, humans  are just one type of [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient being]], that is a being with a [[mindstream]]. In Sanskrit Manushya means an Animal with a mind. In Sanskrit the word Manusmriti associated with Manushya was used to describe knowledge through memory. The word Muun or Maan means mind. Mind is collection of past experience with an ability of memory or smriti. Mind is considered as a animal with a disease that departs a soul from its universal enlightened infinitesimal behavior to the finite miserable fearful behavior that fluctuates between the state of heaven and hell before it is extinguished back to its infinitesimal behavior. 

In Buddhism, humans have a very special status: only a human can attain enlightenment as a fully enlightened [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].  Enlightenment as an [[arhat]] can be attained from the realms of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|Śuddhāvāsa deities]].  A [[bodhisattva]] can appear in many different types of lives, for instance as an [[Animals in Buddhism|animal]] or as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]].  Buddhas, however, are always human.&lt;ref&gt;JOL 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualities of human life ==
The status of life as a human, at first is seen as very important.  In the hierarchy of [[Buddhist cosmology]] it is low but not entirely at the bottom.  It is not intrinsically marked by extremes of happiness or [[dukkha|suffering]], but all the states of consciousness in the universe, from hellish suffering to divine joy to serene tranquility can be experienced within the human world.

Humans can be seen as highly favored, in that they have an immediate reason to seek out the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and yet also have the means to listen to it and follow it.  Among the lower realms, [[Pretas]] (aka hungry ghosts), and dwellers in the [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Narakas]] (Buddhist hell(s)) are gripped by pain and fear, and can only endure their lot but cannot better themselves. Animals are intellectually unable to understand the Dharma in full.  The way of life of the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asuras]] is dominated by violence and antithetical to the teachings of the Dharma. Most of the Brahmas and Devas simply enjoy reaping the fruits of their past [[Karma in Buddhism|actions]] and think that they are immortal and forever to be happy and so they don't try to practice the Dharma.  When their past karmas have all had their result, these devas will fall into lower worlds and suffer again.  The lowest sorts of devas deal with strife, love, and loss just as humans do, but even so they lack the spur of imminent mortality that can lead humans to seek, not merely a better future life, but an escape from [[Samsara (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]] altogether. However, there are stories of beings in these realms deciding to practice and reaching enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Pali Canon (Samyutta Nikaya, Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya, Kuddaka NIkaya)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JOL:14-15, BOTV:63&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, life in the world of humans is known as "the precious human rebirth".  Born close to the pivot point of happiness and suffering, humans have a unique capacity for moral choices with long-term significance.&lt;ref&gt;JOL:18&lt;/ref&gt;

The human rebirth is said to be extremely rare. The Majjhima Nikaya (129 Balapandita Sutta) compares it to a wooden cattle-yoke floating on the waves of the sea, tossed this way and that by the winds and currents.  The likelihood of a blind turtle, rising from the depths of the ocean to the surface once in a hundred years, putting its head through the hole in the yoke is considered greater than that of a being in the animal realm, hungry ghost realm or hell realm achieving rebirth as a human. This is because, according to the sutta, in these realms there is no Dhamma (Sanskrit Dharma), no practicing what is right, no doing what is wholesome, and no performing of merit. However it is generally implied that if one is already living as a human they will continue to be reborn in the human world based on good works and so they will be one again and again as long as they are moral and good in the ways described in Buddhist rules regardless of whether or not they are Buddhist themselves. The idea is that one must be good and moral because falling below the human realm is dangerous as the odds of one becoming a human again with any great frequency is slim.&lt;ref&gt;Majjhima Nikaya 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Among humans there are also better and worse conditions for attaining enlightenment.  Besides being born as a human, the favorable conditions for obtaining enlightenment are:
* Being born a human at a time when a Buddha has arisen, has taught the Dharma, and has left a [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Saṅgha]] that carries on the teachings; at such times there is a chance to learn the Dharma.
* Being born a human in countries where the Dharma is known.  Buddhist commentaries contrast the "central lands" where Buddhism is known and can be practiced (originally just northern India, but now including a much larger portion of the globe) with "border countries" where Buddhism is unknown or cannot be practiced due to legal or practical impediments, for instance, a lack of qualified teachers. Technically a "central land" is one which possesses any one of the Buddhist {{IAST|saṅghas}} of [[Bhikkhu|{{IAST|bhikṣus}}]], [[Bhikkhuni|{{IAST|bhikṣuṇīs}}]], [[Upasaka|upāsakas or upāsikās]].
* Being born a human who has the physical and intellectual capacity to grasp the basic message of the Dharma.
* Accepting the relationship between good or evil actions and their consequences, believing that good actions will lead to a happier life, a better rebirth or to enlightenment.
* Confidence in the moral teachings conveyed in the [[Vinaya]].
* Avoiding crimes against people and against the Dharma.
* Having sincere compassion for other people.&lt;ref&gt;JOL:15-16, BOTV:59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as it is difficult to obtain birth as a human, it is also difficult to be born at the time when a Buddha's teaching is still available.  Out of the infinite ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]'' (incredibly long periods) in time, most have no Buddhas appearing in them at all.  The present kalpa is called "Fortunate" because it is said that 1,000 Buddhas will appear in it, something that is very unusual.&lt;ref&gt;BOTV:61&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, Buddhist teachers say that one's present condition as a human should be valued very highly, and not allowed to slide by, as the combination of existence as a human and the presence of a Buddha's teaching may not come again for a very long time. Any human, in this view, who finds himself or herself in a position to learn the Dharma, would be remiss if he or she did not take advantage of it.  This view also stands in contrast to those who would claim that, if one is to be reborn multiple times, there is no need to worry about one's actions in this life as they can always be amended in the future; rather, there is no assurance that in a long series of lives one will ever obtain the right circumstances for enlightenment, so it is important to seize the day.

With regard to a fortunate human life, [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]] said: "Instead of feeling so much regret when we lose our money, we should develop regret when we waste our human life." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tharpa.com/us/book-Joyful.Path.of.Good.Fortune-587.html ''Joyful Path of Good Fortune''], by Geshe [[Kelsang Gyatso]], Page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myth of human origins==
According to the [[Aggañña Sutta]] (DN.27), humans originated at the beginning of the current kalpa as deva-like beings reborn from the [[Buddhist cosmology#Ābhāsvara worlds|Ābhāsvara]] deva-realm.  They were then beings shining in their own light, capable of moving through the air without mechanical aid, living for a very long time, and not requiring sustenance.

Over time, they acquired a taste for physical nutriment, and as they consumed it, their bodies became heavier and more like human bodies; they lost their ability to shine, and began to acquire differences in their appearance.  Their length of life decreased, they differentiated into two sexes and became sexually active.  Following this, greed, theft and violence arose among them, and they consequently established social distinctions and government and elected a king to rule them, called [[Mahāsammata]], "the great appointed one". Some of the kings of India in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha´s]] day claimed descent from him.

== Nature of the human realm ==
In the visionary picture of the human realm presented in [[Buddhist cosmology]], humans live on four continents which are, relatively speaking, small islands in a vast ocean that surrounds the axial world-mountain of [[Sumeru]], and fills most of the Earth's surface.  The ocean is in turn surrounded by a circular mountain wall called {{IAST|Cakravāḍa}} ([[Sanskrit]]) or {{IAST|Cakkavāḷa}} ([[Pāli]]) which marks the horizontal limit of the earth. Because of the immenseness of the ocean, the continents cannot be reached from each other by ordinary sailing vessels, although in the past, when the cakravartin kings ruled, communication between the continents was possible by means of the treasure called the '''cakraratna''' (Pāli '''cakkaratana'''), which a cakravartin and his retinue could use to fly through the air between the continents.

The four continents are:

* '''[[Jambudvipa|Jambudvīpa]]''' (Sanskrit) or '''Jambudīpa''' (Pāli) or 南阎浮提洲 (阎浮提 is also translated as 赡部 in Chinese) is located in the south.
* '''Pūrvavideha''' or '''Pubbavideha'''  or 东毗提诃洲 (毗提诃 is also translated as 胜身) is located in the east.
* '''Aparagodānīya''' or '''Aparagoyāna''' or 西瞿陀尼洲 (瞿陀尼 is also translated as 牛货) is located in the west.
* '''Uttarakuru''' or 北俱卢洲 is located in the north.

The history of '''[[Indian people|Indian]]s in [[Bahrain]]''' dates back to the time of the [[Dilmun|Dilmun civilisation]] in 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE when the civilisation served as a trade link between [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley civilisation]].&lt;ref name=Embassy&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Indian Community|url=http://www.indianembassybahrain.com/indian_community.html|publisher=Indian Embassy, Bahrain|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper immigration of Indians to Bahrain first started in the late quarter of the 19th century, with [[Banyan merchants]] arriving from the [[British Raj]]. Today, Indians number at an estimated 400,000 people out of the country's total population of 1.3 million, making them the largest expatriate group in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=India Bahrain Bilateral Relations |url=http://www.indianembassybahrain.com/india_bahrain_bilateral_relations.html |accessdate=8 February 2013 | publisher=Indian Embassy, Bahrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Initially, Indian merchants in Bahrain traded dates, though most later entered the [[Pearl hunting|pearling]] business and helped to export [[pearl]]s to the world market. These merchant families originated from the [[Sindh]] province and the [[Kathiawad]] region of [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt; By 1925, it was estimated that there were 2,500 Indian families settled in the country, most of whom were involved in the [[retail]] sector. With the [[First Oil Well, Bahrain|discovery and refinement]] of [[oil]] in Bahrain in 1932&amp;ndash;1945, there was a demand for [[manpower]] in the oil sector, which led to greater number of Indian workers to immigrate to the country. Following the [[Second World War]] and the subsequent expansion of [[Economy of Bahrain|Bahrain's economy]] as a result of the oil boom, greater number of Indians emigrated to the country to set up their own businesses and to fill in manpower demands as workers, managers and salesmen.&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt; By the 1950s, the [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]], which was the country's sole oil company, had employed more than 600 Indians. A rough estimate suggested that the number of [[migrant worker]]s, from the state of [[Kerala]], in Bahrain increased from 1,000 in 1958 to almost 5,000 in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zachariah, Matthew, Rajan|first=Kunniparampil, Elangikal, Sebastian|title=Dynamics of Migration in Kerala: Dimensions, Differentials, and Consequences|year=2003|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788125025047|pages=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D497alRZPcoC&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=Indians%20in%20Bahrain&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q=Indians%20in%20Bahrain&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indians in the country have predominantly [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] jobs; 70% of the Indian community work in the [[construction]] sector of the country, with others working as [[barber]]s and [[carpenter]]s. Around 15,000 more Indians work as [[domestic worker]]s; these are almost exclusively women.&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt; Most Indian women in the country work as [[teacher]]s in the country's [[List of educational institutions in Bahrain|private schools]]. Despite the vast number of Indians working as blue-collar workers, [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] Indian workers are present in the country, often working as [[pharmacists]], [[physician]]s and [[accountant]]s.&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt; In recent years, a large number of Indians have committed [[suicide]], leading to a public outcry in Bahrain and India, with community leaders asking for greater reach of counselling and support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indians in Bahrain worried over rising suicides|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indians-in-bahrain-worried-over-rising-suicides_763701.html|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=Zee News|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian embassy in the country was first opened in January 1973. Prior to that, India's Ambassador to [[Kuwait]] was concurrently accredited to Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embassy in Bahrain|url=http://www.indianembassybahrain.com/embassy_bahrain.html|publisher=Indian Embassy, Bahrain|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
There are 32 registered Indian cultural organisations, with a further 68 unregistered socio-cultural organisations and clubs.&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt; There are multiple non-Muslim religious places of worship present in the country including a 60-year-old [[Hindu temple]], five churches and six [[Gurudwara]]s.&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt; The country's oldest and largest Indian social club is the [[Indian Club]] with over 4,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.indianclubbahrain.com/profile.html|publisher=Indian Club|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was first established in 1915 as the ''Bahrain Sports Club'' to serve the country's native and non-native inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.indianclubbahrain.com/history.html|publisher=Indian Club|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahrain Keraleeya Samajam]] was established in 1947. Many of the Indian associations are under the [[umbrella group]] of the Co-ordination Committee of Indian Associations (CCIA), which coordinates events for the Indian community such as the [[Republic Day (India)|Indian Republic Day]].&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt; The CCIA also helped to provide relief for Indian workers in tragedies such as the [[Bahrain boat disaster]], which killed 17 Indians.&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt;

===Education===
There are multiple schools that were established in the country in the 20th century that offer the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] curriculum, the oldest of which is [[Indian School, Bahrain|The Indian School]] which was first established in 1950.&lt;ref name=Embassy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Indian School|url=http://www.indianschool.bh/index.php|publisher=Indian School|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of CBSE curriculum schools in Bahrain are:-
*[[Al Noor International School|Al-Noor International School]]
*Asian School
*Ibn Al-Hytham Islamic School
*New Horizon School 
*New Millennium School (DPS School) 
*[[Indian School, Bahrain]]

The '''Jahai''' or '''Jehai''' people are an indigenous [[Orang Asli]] of the [[Semang]] people group found in [[Perak]] and [[Kelantan]], [[Malaysia]] and parts of [[Thailand]]. They have the appearance of [[Negroid]] with dark skin, Afro hair and stockily built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Oon|title=Malaysia|year=2008|contribution=|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=18-453-7971-3|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are [[hunter-gatherer]] and they practice [[swidden agriculture]] occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Richardson|title=International Encyclopedia of Geography, 15 Volume Set: People, the Earth, Environment and Technology|year=2017|contribution=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=04-706-5963-7|page=2240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jahai people believe in a religious system with Karei (pronounced as "Karεy") as a supernatural force that overseas their actions and behaviours. In order to avoid attracting Karei's attention negatively, there are taboos and avoidance rules to follow. They believe Karei can be scared away or attracted to by various odors depending on Karei's preferences, for example, the unpleasant smell of a burnt crayfish.&lt;ref name="SAITDOF23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Diederich|title=Sensory Adjectives in the Discourse of Food: A frame-semantic approach to language and perception|year=2015|contribution=|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=90-272-6880-0|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore this led to a rich odor lexicon in the [[Jahai language]],&lt;ref name="SAITDOF23"/&gt; a trait also shared among the [[Maniq people]] in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/the-vocabulary-of-smell/414618/ |title=Why Do Most Languages Have So Few Words for Smells? |author=Ed Yong |publisher=The Atlantic |date=6 November 2015 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jahai people who are traditionally nomadic were forced by the government to live in permanent settlements in parts of the [[Belum-Temengor|Royal Belum State Park]] as part of the tourist attraction. They live in isolation, lacking infrastructures such as roads, schools, health post and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic-hckm.org/files/PROCEEDINGS_of_ICHCKM_2015.pdf |title=Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Human Capital and Knowledge Management |author= |publisher=ICHCKM |page=168 |date=2015 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in exhaustion of resources. Mortality rate of the Jahai people in villages along the Kejar River with up to 50% of children due to ''[[Oral candidiasis|Serawan]]'' has cause the population there to dwindle from 600 to 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rage.com.my/dead-and-forgotten/ |title=The Curse of Serawan |author=Shanjeev Reddy |publisher=R.AGE |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aippnet.org/situation-of-the-right-to-health-of-indigenous-peoples-in-asia/ |title=Situation of the right to health of indigenous peoples in Asia |author= |publisher=Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeff Adachi''' (born 1959 in [[Sacramento, California]]) is the elected Public Defender of [[San Francisco]], pension reform advocate, and a former candidate for Mayor of [[San Francisco]].

==Early life and education==
Adachi is the son of a Sacramento auto mechanic and a laboratory assistant. His parents and grandparents spent part of [[World War II]] in the [[Rohwer War Relocation Center]] in Arkansas.&lt;ref name="pbs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kqed/presumedguilty/1.1.0.html|title=Presumed Guilty. Defenders. Adachi – PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adachi was a notably poor student at [[C.K. McClatchy High School]] with numerous absences due to the many hours he spent on his part-time jobs. He attended [[Sacramento City College]] before transferring.  Adachi received his B.A. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1981 and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of California, [[Hastings College of the Law]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="pbs1"/&gt;

== Legal career ==
Adachi began his career as a deputy public defender for fifteen years with the [[San Francisco Public Defender's Office]]. He ultimately rose to the rank of chief attorney of the office and served in that capacity for three years. Adachi has tried over 100 jury trials and handled 3,000 criminal matters during his career.&lt;ref name="sfpublicdefender"&gt;[http://sfpublicdefender.org/about/leadership/ Leadership &amp;#124; San Francisco Public Defender's Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417153319/http://sfpublicdefender.org/about/leadership/ |date=2011-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Kimiko Burton-Cruz, the daughter of then State Senator John Burton, was appointed Public Defender by Mayor Willie Brown. After taking office, Burton-Cruz forced Adachi out on her first day on the job, apparently for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030612012020/http://asianweek.com/2003_01_10/bay_adachi.html AsianWeek.com: Bay News: Adachi Sworn Into Public Defender’s Office]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Adachi ran against Burton-Cruz for her position and defeated her by a 55%–45% margin. Since then Adachi has been re-elected twice, both times running unopposed.

Adachi was featured in the 2002 [[PBS]] documentary ''Presumed Guilty'', a film about the [[San Francisco Public Defender's Office]], its difficult cases and complex defense strategies.

Adachi is the only elected Public Defender in the state of California and runs an office of more than 100 attorneys and 60 staff members. The office's 2018-19 budget is $37.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sfmayor.org/sites/default/files/CSF_Budget_Book_2017_Final_CMYK_LowRes.pdf|title=Mayor's Proposed Budget 2017-18 and 2018-2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to estimates, the office represents over 23,000 people each year who are charged with misdemeanor and felony offenses.

He is a Certified Specialist in Criminal Law (the State Bar of California Board of Legal Specialization) and a former Certified Specialist in Criminal Trial Advocacy (National Board of Trial Advocacy).

==Pension reform advocacy==
In 2010, Adachi placed "Proposition B" on the ballot, which would have required employees to increase the level of their contribution to defray the cost of both their pension and health care benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/San_Francisco_Pension_Reform,_Proposition_B_(November_2010) San Francisco Pension Reform, Proposition B (November 2010) – Ballotpedia]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929134837/http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/San_Francisco_Pension_Reform%2C_Proposition_B_%28November_2010%29 |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition B was defeated, having faced significant opposition from unions and elected officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/us/05bcelection.html?pagewanted=all Defeat of Proposition B Cements Labor’s Power – NYTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkeiwest.com/index.php/the-news/archived-article-list/158-sf-public-defenders-name-becomes-synonymous-with-pension-reform-measure|title=S.F.

In 2011, Adachi has again placed a charter amendment on the ballot – "Proposition D"—which would require all employees to pay a base contribution rate towards their pension costs, require higher-earning employees to contribute an additional amount based on their salary level, cap the maximum size of pensions, and eliminate abusive and wasteful practices such as "pension spiking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-10-02/opinion/30237214_1_pension-reform-pension-formulas-retiree-health|title=Pass SF Prop. C for down payment on pension reform|work=SFGate|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms leveled at Proposition B, Adachi's new plan exempts the lowest-paid workers from any cost increases, uses a progressive income scale to determine contributions, and does not require any health care contributions. According to the City Controller, Proposition D would save San Francisco as much as $142 million a year, and $1.6 billion over the next ten years.[3] Mayor Ed Lee has offered a competing plan – "Proposition C"—which would similarly require employees to contribute at a higher level to their pensions, but also requires contributions to cover health care costs. Proposition C is projected to save the city an estimated $1.29 billion over the next ten years.

His campaign has been opposed by the police and firefighter unions, as his pension reform plan would require them to contribute more to their own retirement pensions. When Adachi went to pay his respects at the June, 2011 funeral services honoring San Francisco firefighters, Lt. Vincent Perez and Anthony Valerio who were killed in a house fire in San Francisco's [[Diamond Heights, San Francisco|Diamond Heights]] neighborhood, he was asked to leave by a firefighter.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/06/11/BAVG1JSIEB.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first1=Phillip | last1=Matier | first2=Andrew | last2=Ross | title=Jeff Adachi persona non grata at funeral | date=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fire Chief was unaware that Adachi had been asked to leave and stated that everyone had the right to show their support and respect, and that she did not support the request to leave.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"/&gt;

==San Francisco mayoral candidacy==
In August 2011, Adachi formally entered the race for [[Mayor of San Francisco]].

After filing his papers Adachi stated, "I've decided to run for Mayor of San Francisco to restore integrity and financial accountability to the city." He then added, "It wasn't until I really listened to what the candidates were saying in the last few debates about pension reform that I became convinced that either the candidates don't get it or they don't want to get it, and I want to make sure that there's a voice in there talking about the fiscal realities of this city."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Rachel (August 13, 2011). "Jeff Adachi jumps into S.F. mayor's race". The San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt; Adachi added, "This debate needs to be about what is best for the city, not about what is best for City Hall".&lt;ref&gt;Matier, Phillip; Ross, Andrew (August 14, 2011). "Jeff Adachi could upend S.F. mayor's race". The San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adachi declined public financing under the City's new [[public financing]] law, stating that although he believes in public financing, he did not feel it was right to take the $900,000 that each candidate could receive "at a time that we are cutting summer school for 10,000 kids because we don't have $1 million to pay for it." However, Adachi has agreed to abide by the voluntary spending limits contained in the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|f2Nebdea-1Q|Jeff Adachi on why he won&amp;#39;t take public financing for mayor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to restoring fiscal integrity to San Francisco through saving the City $1.7 billion over the next decade, Adachi has proposed a [[job creation program]] by investing $40 million in micro-loans to small businesses, creating up to 15,000 new jobs and $1 billion of new economic activity. Adachi is also proposing reforming the business tax through elimination of the current payroll tax system, which discourages hiring of new workers, and replacing it with a new business tax based upon net business revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adachi2011.com/an-innovative-job-plan-that-actually-works/ |title=adachi2011.com |work=adachi2011.com |accessdate=19 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117234927/http://www.adachi2011.com/an-innovative-job-plan-that-actually-works/ |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cornerstone of Adachi's plan is improving education by providing additional funding from the City's reserve funds to restore summer school, which has been eliminated for the last two years because of the City's fiscal crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adachi2011.com/supporting-education/ |title=adachi2011.com |work=adachi2011.com |accessdate=19 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117014721/http://www.adachi2011.com/supporting-education/ |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/kalw/2011/10/06/web-exclusive-sf-mayoral-candidate-jeff-adachi/|title=Web Exclusive: SF mayoral candidate Jeff Adachi|work=KALW|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2011, the San Francisco Chronicle named Adachi one of the "3 S.F. Mayoral Candidates to Consider," stating: "Talk about courage. One of the city's most liberal politicians took on labor over the bedrock issue of pensions. He lost in his first attempt last year, but is back with a revised version after he wouldn't back a compromise measure also on the ballot. He's been unfairly vilified by much of the city's political establishment for daring to raise the pension problem that others preferred to ignore. His campaign shows he's more than a one-issue candidate. He has a clear grasp of a variety of issues ranging from homeless policies to taxes. His independence is unassailable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/10/12/EDG41LG6RC.DTL|title=3 S.F. mayoral candidates to consider|work=SFGate|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed 6th out of 16 candidates.

'''[[Karbi language]]''' is officially written in Roman script in [[Karbi Anglong district|Karbi Anglong]] and Dima Hasao districts of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. However, in Kamrup district of Assam prefer mostly East nagari (Assamese) script. The written form Karbi language has been developing since the time of [[British raj|British rule]] in India and since then Karbi language is being written in both [[Eastern Nagari script|East Nagari]] and Roman script. The Karbi Lammet Amei (Appex body of [[Karbi language]]) earlier adopted East Nagari to write Karbi language, but later changed to [[Latin script|Roman script]].

==Research on Karbi script and language==
Since the old days [[Karbi people]] has no written form. Karbis have passed their tradition orally from generations  to generations. The new generations are trying to preserve them in written form. Also new generations are coining new words to compensate the missing word the new generations have come across in new age. i.e.-Bus, Train etc. Media house has been forefront at this.

In recent trend, a section of [[Karbi people]] think that [[Karbi language]] should have its own script. In one case, Sarthe Teron Milik, Writer, introduced a new series of Karbi alphabets and numerals in his book, ''Arleng''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arlengalam.wordpress.com|title=arlengalam|website=arlengalam.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Sarthe Teron Milik| url=https://pothi.com/pothi/book/sarthe-teron-milik-arleng|title=Review of ARLENG|website=pothi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thekararnivang.com/2011/12/20/karbi-alam-ketok-kejoi-pen-kapangcho-aphan-amek-script-kangvai-pen-kapithir-kenangsotlo/|title=Karbi alam ketok kejoi pen kapangcho aphan amek (Script) kangvai pen kapithir kenangsotlo - Thekar|website=thekararnivang.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://karbialam.webs.com| author=Sarthe Teron| title=Karbi Alam|website=karbialam.webs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurdish population is estimated at 15-20 million in Turkey, 10-12 million in Iran, 8-8.5 million in Iraq, 3-3.6 million in Syria, 1.2-1.5 million in the European diaspora, and 400k-500k in the former USSR - for a total of 36.4 million to 45.6 million globally, with the majority living in the region they regard as [[Greater Kurdistan]]. However, there are significant Kurdish diaspora communities in the cities of western Turkey, in particular in [[Istanbul]]. A recent [[Kurdish diaspora]] has also developed in Western countries, primarily [[Kurds in Germany|in Germany]]. The Kurds are the majority population in the [[Kurdish Autonomous Region|autonomous region]] of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], and form a significant minority group in the neighboring countries of [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict|Turkey]], [[Iran–PJAK conflict|Iran]], and [[Rojava conflict|Syria]], where [[Kurdish nationalist]] movements continue to pursue greater [[Self-governance|autonomy]] and [[cultural rights]].

Kurdish (Kurdish: ''Kurdî'' or کوردی) is a collection of related dialects spoken by the Kurds.&lt;ref name="Iranica-KurdLang" /&gt; It is mainly spoken in those parts of [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]] which comprise [[Kurdistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://modersmal.skolutveckling.se/nordkurdiska/kurdmap/pages/Geographic%20Distribution%20of%20Kurdish%20and%20other%20Iranic%20Languages_jpg_gif.htm Geographic distribution of Kurdish and other Iranic languages] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018024743/http://modersmal.skolutveckling.se/nordkurdiska/kurdmap/pages/Geographic%20Distribution%20of%20Kurdish%20and%20other%20Iranic%20Languages_jpg_gif.htm |date=18 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurdish holds official status in Iraq as a national language alongside [[Arabic language|Arabic]], is recognized in Iran as a regional language, and in [[Armenia]] as a minority language.

The [[Kurdish languages]] belong to the northwestern sub‑group of the [[Iranian languages]], which in turn belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family.

Most Kurds are either [[bilingual]] or [[multilingual]], speaking the language of their respective nation of origin, such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as a [[second language]] alongside their native Kurdish, while those in diaspora communities often speak three or more languages.

According to Mackenzie, there are few linguistic features that all Kurdish dialects have in common and that are not at the same time found in other [[Iranian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;"Kurdish Nationalism and Competing Ethnic Loyalties", Original English version of: "Nationalisme kurde et ethnicités intra-kurdes", Peuples Méditerranéens no. 68–69 (1994), 11–37. Excerpt: "This view was criticised by the linguist D.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;MacKenzie, according to whom there are but few linguistic features that all Kurdish dialects have in common and that are not at the same time found in other Iranian languages."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurdish dialects according to Mackenzie are classified as:&lt;ref name="AsatrianLinguisticClassification"&gt;G. Asatrian, Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds, Iran and the Caucasus, Vol.13, pp. 1–58, 2009: "The classification of the Kurdish dialects is not an easy task, despite the fact that there have been numerous attempts mostly by Kurdish authors to put them into a system. However, for the time being the commonly accepted classification of the Kurdish dialects is that of the late Prof. D.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Mackenzie, the author of fundamental works in Kurdish dialectology (see Mackenzie 1961; idem 1961–1962; idem 1963a; idem 1981), who distinguished three groups of dialects: Northern, Central, and Southern."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Northern group (the [[Kurmanji]] dialect group)
*Central group (part of the [[Sorani]] dialect group)
*Southern group (part of the [[Sorani]] dialect group)  including [[Kermanshahi]], Ardalani and [[Laki language|Laki]]

The Zaza and Gorani are ethnic Kurds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nodar Mosaki|title=The zazas: a kurdish sub-ethnic group or separate people?|url=http://www.zazaki.net/haber/the-zazas-a-kurdish-sub-ethnic-group-or-separate-people-1131.htm|accessdate=11 August 2015|agency=Zazaki.net|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Zaza–Gorani languages]] are not classified as Kurdish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Iranian-languages|title=Iranian languages|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the differences between the dialects of Kurdish, Kreyenbroek clarifies that in some ways, Kurmanji and Sorani are as different from each other as is English from German, giving the example that Kurmanji has grammatical gender and case endings, but Sorani does not, and observing that referring to Sorani and Kurmanji as "dialects" of one language is supported only by "their common origin ... and the fact that this usage reflects the sense of ethnic identity and unity of the Kurds."&lt;ref name="krey"&gt;Kreyenbroek, Philip (1992).

"The land of Karda" is mentioned on a Sumerian clay-tablet dated to the 3rd millennium B.C.

Qarti or Qartas, who were originally settled on the mountains north of [[Mesopotamia]], are considered as a probable ancestor of the Kurds. [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]] were attacked by nomads coming through Qartas territory at the end of 3rd millennium B.C. Akkadians distinguished them as [[Gutian people|Guti]]. They conquered [[Mesopotamia]] in 2150 B.C. and ruled with 21 kings until defeated by the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Utu-hengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fabbri|first=Giampietro|date=2017|title=SUPARSTHAS and SWAGWAUTAS Colonisers of the Ancient World.

During the [[Sassanid era]], in  ''[[Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan]]'', a short prose work written in Middle Persian, [[Ardashir I]] is depicted as having battled the Kurds and their leader, [[Madig]]. After initially sustaining a heavy defeat, Ardashir I was successful in subjugating the Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;''Kârnâmag î Ardashîr î Babagân.'' Trans. D. D. P.

Similarly, in AD 360, the Sassanid king [[Shapur II]] marched into the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] province [[Zabdicene]], to conquer its chief city, Bezabde, present-day [[Cizre]].

There is also a 7th-century text by an unidentified author, written about the legendary [[Christian martyr]] [[Mar Qardagh]]. He lived in the 4th century, during the reign of Shapur II, and during his travels is said to have encountered [[Abdisho|Mar Abdisho]], a deacon and martyr, who, after having been questioned of his origins by Mar Qardagh and his [[Marzoban]]s, stated that his parents were originally from an Assyrian village called Hazza, but were driven out and subsequently settled in Tamanon, a village in ''the land of the Kurds'', identified as being in the region of [[Mount Judi]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J.

===Medieval period===
[[File:Saladin the Victorious.jpg|thumb|Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb, or [[Saladin]], founder of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] in the Middle East]]
Early Syriac sources use the terms ''Hurdanaye, Kurdanaye, Kurdaye'' to refer to the Kurds. According to [[Michael the Syrian]], Hurdanaye separated from Tayaye Arabs and sought refuge with the Byzantine Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilus]]. He also mentions the [[Persian people|Persian]] troops who fought against Musa chief of Hurdanaye in the region of Qardu in 841. According to [[Bar Hebraeus|Barhebreaus]], a king appeared to the Kurdanaye and they rebelled against the Arabs in 829. Michael the Syrian considered them as [[Paganism|pagan]], followers of [[mahdi]] and adepts of [[Magi]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;anism. Their mahdi called himself Christ and the [[Holy Ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouawad|first=R.J.|date=1992|title=The Kurds and Their Christian Neighbors: The Case of the Orthodox Syriacs|url=|journal=Parole de l'Orient|volume=XVII|pages=127–141|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early [[Middle Ages]], the Kurds sporadically appear in Arabic sources, though the term was still not being used for a specific people; instead it referred to an amalgam of nomadic western Iranic tribes, who were distinct from [[Persian people|Persians]]. However, in the [[High Middle Ages]], the Kurdish ethnic identity gradually materialized, as one can find clear evidence of the Kurdish ethnic identity and solidarity in texts of the 12th and 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;James, Boris. (2006). Uses and Values of the Term Kurd in Arabic Medieval Literary Sources.

In 838, a Kurdish leader based in Mosul, named [[Mir Jafar Dasni|Mir Jafar]], revolted against the Caliph [[Al-Mu'tasim]] who sent the commander Itakh to combat him. Itakh won this war and executed many of the Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;T. Bois. (1966). ''The Kurds''. Beirut: Khayat Book &amp; Publishing Company S.A.L., p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Brook. (2009).

In 934 the [[Daylamite]] [[Buyid]] dynasty was founded, and subsequently conquered most of present-day Iran and Iraq. During the time of rule of this dynasty, Kurdish chief and ruler, Badr ibn Hasanwaih, established himself as one of the most important emirs of the time.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Ahmed. (2012).

In the 10th-12th centuries, a number of [[Kurdish principalities]] and dynasties were founded, ruling Kurdistan and neighbouring areas:

[[File:piranshahr2014.jpg|thumb|The [[Piranshahr|city of Piranshahr]], center of Mokrian district,  northwestern Iran]]

Due to the Turkic invasion of Anatolia, the 11th century Kurdish dynasties crumbled and became incorporated into the Seljuk Dynasty. Kurds would hereafter be used in great numbers in the armies of the [[Zengid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;F. Robinson. (1996). ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Succeeding the Zengids, the Kurdish [[Ayyubid]]s established themselves in 1171, first under the leadership of [[Saladin]]. Saladin led the Muslims to recapture the city of [[Jerusalem]] from the [[Crusaders]] at the [[Battle of Hattin]]; also frequently clashing with the [[Hashashin]]s. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted until 1341 when the Ayyubid sultanate fell to [[Mongols|Mongolian]] invasions.

===Safavid period===
{{further|Safavid dynasty}}
The [[Safavid]] Dynasty, established in 1501, also established its rule over Kurdish-inhabited territories. The paternal line of this family actually had Kurdish roots, tracing back to [[Firuz-Shah Zarrin-Kolah]], a dignitary who moved from Kurdistan to Ardabil in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Daftary"&gt;F. Daftary, "Intellectual Traditions in Islam", I.B. Tauris, 2001. pg 147: "But the origins of the family of Shaykh Safi al-Din go back not to Hijaz but to [[Kurdistan Province|Kurdistan]], from where, seven generations before him, Firuz Shah Zarin-kulah had migrated to Adharbayjan"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry D.

For the next 300 years, many of the Kurds found themselves living in territories that frequently changed hands between Ottoman Turkey and Iran during the protracted series of Ottoman-Persian Wars.

The Safavid king [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501-1524) put down a Yezidi rebellion which went on from 1506-1510. A century later, the year-long [[Battle of Dimdim]] took place, wherein the Safavid king [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588-1629) succeeded in putting down the rebellion led by the Kurdish ruler [[Amir Khan Lepzerin]]. Thereafter, a large number of Kurds were deported to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], not only to weaken the Kurds, but also to protect the eastern border from invading [[Afghan]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;''A People Without a Country: The Kurds and Kurdistan'' By Gérard Chaliand, Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, and Marco Pallis, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forced movements and deportations of other groups were also implemented by Abbas I and his successors, most notably of the [[Armenians]], the [[Abbas I's Kakhetian and Kartlian campaigns|Georgians]], and the [[Circassians]], who were moved en masse to and from other districts within the Persian empire.{{sfn|Blow|2009|page=66}}{{sfn|Aslanian|2011|page=1}}{{sfn|Bournoutian|2002|page=208}}{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|pages=291, 536}}{{sfn|Floor|Herzig|2012|page=479}}

===Zand period===
{{further|Zand dynasty}}
[[File:کریم خان زند.JPG|thumb|[[Karim Khan]], the Laki ruler of the Zand Dynasty]]

After the fall of the Safavids, Iran fell under the control of the [[Afsharid Empire]] ruled by [[Nader Shah]] at its peak. After Nader's death, Iran fell into civil war, with multiple leaders trying to gain control over the country. Ultimately, it was [[Karim Khan]], a Laki general of the [[Zand tribe]] who would come to power.&lt;ref&gt;A fourth pretender was Karim Khan, son of Aymak of the Zand, a section of [[Lak people (Iran)|Lak]] tribe {{cite book |author= Sir Percy Molesworth Sykes |title=A History of Persia |publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited |year= 1930 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22A+fourth+pretender+was+Karim+Khan,+son+of+Aymak+of+the+Zand%22 |page= 277}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The country would flourish during Karim Khan's reign; a strong resurgence of the arts would take place, and international ties were strengthened.&lt;ref name="Iranica Zand"&gt;J. R. Perry (2011) [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/karim-khan-zand "Karim Khan Zand"]. Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Karim Khan was portrayed as being a ruler who truly cared about his subjects, thereby gaining the title Vakil e-Ra'aayaa (meaning Representative of the People in [[Persian language|Persian]]).&lt;ref name="Iranica Zand" /&gt; Though not as powerful in its geo-political and military reach as the preceding Safavids and Afsharids or even the early Qajars, he managed to reassert Iranian hegemony over its integral territories in the [[Caucasus]], and presided over an era of relative peace, prosperity, and tranquility. In [[Ottoman Iraq]], following the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1775–76)]], Karim Khan managed to seize [[Basra]] for several years.&lt;ref&gt;'' 'Abd al-Hamid I'', M. Cavid Baysun, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. I, ed. H.A.R. Gibb, J.H. Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal and J. Schacht, (Brill, 1986), 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dionisius A. Agius, ''In the Wake of the Dhow: The Arabian Gulf and Oman'', (Ithaca Press, 2010), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Karim Khan's death, the dynasty would decline in favour of the rival [[Qajar]]s due to infighting between the Khan's incompetent offspring. It wasn't until [[Lotf Ali Khan]], 10 years later, that the dynasty would once again be led by an adept ruler. By this time however, the Qajars had already progressed greatly, having taken a number of Zand territories. Lotf Ali Khan made multiple successes before ultimately succumbing to the rivaling faction. Iran and all its Kurdish territories would hereby be incorporated in the [[Qajar Dynasty]].

The Kurdish tribes present in [[Baluchistan]] and some of those in [[Fars Province|Fars]] are believed to be remnants of those that assisted and accompanied Lotf Ali Khan and Karim Khan, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;P.

===Ottoman period===
{{further|Ottoman Empire|Sheik Ubeydullah}}
When Sultan [[Selim I]], after defeating Shah [[Ismail I]] in [[Battle of Chaldiran|1514]], annexed [[Western Armenia]] and Kurdistan, he entrusted the organisation of the conquered territories to [[Idris Bitlisi|Idris]], the historian, who was a Kurd of [[Bitlis]]. He divided the territory into ''sanjaks'' or districts, and, making no attempt to interfere with the principle of heredity, installed the local chiefs as governors. He also resettled the rich pastoral country between [[Erzerum]] and [[Erivan]], which had lain in waste since the passage of [[Timur]], with Kurds from the [[Hakkari]] and Bohtan districts. For the next centuries, from the [[Peace of Amasya]] until the first half of the 19th century, several regions of the wide Kurdish homelands would be contested as well between the Ottomans and the neighbouring rival successive [[Iran|Iranian dynasties]] (Safavids, [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharids]], [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]]) in the frequent [[Ottoman-Persian Wars]].

The Ottoman centralist policies in the beginning of the 19th century aimed to remove power from the principalities and localities, which directly affected the Kurdish emirs. [[Bedirhan Bey]] was the last emir of the [[Cizre|Cizre Bohtan]] [[Emirate]] after initiating an uprising in 1847 against the Ottomans to protect the current structures of the Kurdish principalities. Although his uprising is not classified as a nationalist one, his children played significant roles in the emergence and the development of Kurdish nationalism through the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Ozoglu, Hakan. Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries. February 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5993-5}}. Pg 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern Kurdish nationalist movement emerged in 1880 with an uprising led by a Kurdish landowner and head of the powerful Shemdinan family, [[Sheik Ubeydullah]], who demanded political autonomy or outright independence for Kurds as well as the recognition of a Kurdistan state without interference from Turkish or Persian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Ozoglu, Hakan.

===Kurdish nationalism of the 20th century===
{{further|Kurdish nationalism|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|Iraqi Kurdistan}}
[[File:Kurdistan1920.png|thumb|Provisions of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] for an independent [[Kurdistan]] (in 1920).]]

Kurdish nationalism emerged after World War I with the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]] which had historically successfully integrated (but not assimilated) the Kurds, through use of forced repression of Kurdish movements to gain independence. Revolts did occur sporadically but only in 1880 with the uprising led by [[Sheik Ubeydullah]] did the Kurds as an ethnic group or nation make demands. Ottoman sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdul Hamid]] responded with a campaign of integration by co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents to strengthen Ottoman power with offers of prestigious positions in his government. This strategy appears to have been successful given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]] regiments during World War I.&lt;ref name="laciner"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Ideological and Historical Roots of Kurdist Movements in Turkey: Ethnicity Demography, Politics |journal=Nationalism and Ethnic Politics |first=Bal |last=Laçiner |author2=Bal, Ihsan |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=473–504 |doi=10.1080/13537110490518282 |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15 |format= |accessdate=19 October 2007 |date=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011225529/http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15 |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurdish ethno-nationalist movement that emerged following World War I and the end of the Ottoman Empire was largely a reaction to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily to the radical [[secularization]], which the strongly [[Muslim]] Kurds abhorred, to the centralization of authority, which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy, and to rampant [[Turkish nationalism]] in the new Turkish Republic, which obviously threatened to marginalize them.&lt;ref name="natali"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ottoman Kurds and emergent Kurdish nationalism|journal=Critique: Critical Middle Eastern Studies|first=Denise|last=Natali|volume=13|issue=3|pages=383–387|doi=10.1080/1066992042000300701|url=|format=|date=2004}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 October 2007--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jakob Künzler]], head of a missionary hospital in [[Urfa]], has documented the large scale [[ethnic cleansing]] of both [[Armenian people|Armenians]] and Kurds by the [[Young Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, R. ''The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East'', p.322. Vintage. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-7517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has given a detailed account of the deportation of Kurds from [[Erzurum]] and [[Bitlis]] in the winter of 1916. The Kurds were perceived to be subversive elements that would take the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] side in the war. In order to eliminate this threat, Young Turks embarked on a large scale deportation of Kurds from the regions of ''Djabachdjur'', ''Palu'', ''Musch'', ''Erzurum'' and ''Bitlis''. Around 300,000 Kurds were forced to move southwards to Urfa and then westwards to [[Gaziantep|Aintab]] and [[Kahramanmaraş|Marasch]]. In the summer of 1917, Kurds were moved to [[Konya]] in [[central Anatolia]]. Through these measures, the Young Turk leaders aimed at weakening the political influence of the Kurds by deporting them from their ancestral lands and by dispersing them in small pockets of exiled communities. By the end of World War I, up to 700,000 Kurds had been forcibly deported and almost half of the displaced perished.&lt;ref&gt;Dominik J. Schaller, Jürgen Zimmerer, ''Late Ottoman genocides: the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and Young Turkish population and extermination policies—introduction'', Journal of Genocide Research, Vol.10, No.1, p.8, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Kurdish groups sought self-determination and the confirmation of Kurdish autonomy in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], but in the [[aftermath of World War I]], Kemal Atatürk prevented such a result. Kurds backed by the United Kingdom declared independence in 1927 and established the [[Republic of Ararat]]. [[Turkey]] suppressed Kurdist revolts in 1925, 1930, and 1937–1938, while Iran in the 1920s suppressed [[Simko Shikak]] at [[Lake Urmia]] and Jaafar Sultan of the Hewraman region, who controlled the region between [[Marivan]] and north of [[Halabja]]. A short-lived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-sponsored Kurdish [[Republic of Mahabad]] in Iran did not long outlast World War II.

From 1922–1924 in Iraq a [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] existed. When [[Ba'ath]]ist administrators thwarted Kurdish nationalist ambitions in [[Iraq]], war broke out in the 1960s. In 1970 the Kurds rejected limited territorial self-rule within Iraq, demanding larger areas including the oil-rich [[Kirkuk]] region.

During the 1920s and 1930s, several large scale Kurdish revolts took place in Kurdistan. Following these rebellions, the area of Turkish Kurdistan was put under [[martial law]] and a large number of the Kurds were displaced. The Turkish government also encouraged resettlement of [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians from Kosovo]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in the region to change the make-up of the population. These events and measures led to a long-lasting mutual distrust between Ankara and the Kurds .&lt;ref&gt;C. Dahlman, "The Political Geography of Kurdistan," ''Eurasian Geography and Economics'', Vol. 43, No. 4, 2002, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; During the relatively open government of the 1950s, Kurds gained political office and started working within the framework of the Turkish Republic to further their interests, but this move towards integration was halted with the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="laciner" /&gt; The 1970s saw an evolution in Kurdish nationalism as [[Marxist]] political thought influenced some in the new generation of Kurdish nationalists opposed to the local [[feudal]] authorities who had been a traditional source of opposition to authority; eventually they would form the militant separatist organization [[Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan|PKK]], also known as the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] in English. The [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] later abandoned [[Marxism-Leninism]].&lt;ref name="Abdullah Öcalan 2007, pp. 243-277"&gt;Abdullah Öcalan, ''Prison Writings: The Roots of Civilisation'', 2007, Pluto Press, pp. 243-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, dissenting views, which do not derive the name of the Kurds from ''Qardu'' and ''Corduene'' but opt for derivation from ''[[Cyrtian|Cyrtii]]'' (''Cyrtaei'') instead.&lt;ref&gt;G. Asatrian, Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds, Iran and the Caucasus, Vol.13, pp. 1–58, 2009: "Evidently, the most reasonable explanation of this ethnonym must be sought for in its possible connections with the Cyrtii (Cyrtaei) of the Classical authors."&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of its possible roots in ancient toponymy, the [[ethnonym]] ''Kurd'' might be derived from a term ''kwrt-'' used in [[Middle Persian]] as a common noun to refer to "[[nomad]]s" or "tent-dwellers," which could be applied as an attribute to any [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] group with such a lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;''Karnamak Ardashir Papakan and the Matadakan i Hazar Dastan''. G. Asatrian, Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds, Iran and the Caucasus, Vol.13, pp. 1–58, 2009. Excerpt 1: "Generally, the etymons and primary meanings of tribal names or ethnonyms, as well as place names, are often irrecoverable; Kurd is also an obscurity."
"It is clear that ''kurt'' in all the contexts has a distinct social sense, 'nomad, tent-dweller.' It could equally be an attribute for any Iranian ethnic group having similar characteristics. To look for a particular ethnic sense here would be a futile exercise."  P. 24: "The Pahlavi materials clearly show that ''kurd'' in pre-Islamic Iran was a social label, still a long way from becoming an ethnonym or a term denoting a distinct group of people."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term gained the characteristic of an ethnonym following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], as it was adopted into Arabic and gradually became associated with an amalgamation of Iranian and Iranicised tribes and groups in the region.&lt;ref name="McDowall 2000"&gt;McDowall, David. 2000. ''A Modern History of the Kurds''. Second Edition. London: I.B. Tauris. p. 9.&lt;!--Replace with page number in current edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Asatrian, Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds, Iran and the Caucasus, Vol.13, pp. 1–58, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also hypothesized that ''Kurd'' could derive from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''gord'' {{crossref|selfref=n|(see [[Shahrekord]])}}, because the Arabic script lacks a symbol corresponding uniquely to ''g'' (گ).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Sherefxan Bidlisi]] in the 16th century states that there are four division of "Kurds": ''[[Kurmanji dialect|Kurmanj]]'', ''[[Lurs|Lur]]'', ''[[Kalhor (tribe)|Kalhor]]'' and ''[[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Guran]]'', each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. Paul (2008) notes that the 16th-century usage of the term ''Kurd'' as recorded by Bidlisi, regardless of linguistic grouping, might still reflect an incipient Northwestern Iranian "Kurdish" ethnic identity uniting the [[Kurmanj]], [[Kalhor (Kurdish tribe)|Kalhur]], and [[Guran]].&lt;ref name="Iranica-KurdLang"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ludwig|last=Paul |title=Kurdish Language |work=Encyclopædia Iranica |date=2008 |url= http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i |accessdate=2 December 2011}} Writes about the problem of attaining a coherent definition of "Kurdish language" within the Northwestern Iranian dialect continuum. 
There is no unambiguous evolution of Kurdish from Middle Iranian, as "from Old and Middle Iranian times, no predecessors of the Kurdish language are yet known; the extant Kurdish texts may be traced back to no earlier than the 16th century CE." Ludwig Paul further states: "Linguistics itself, or dialectology, does not provide any general or straightforward definition of at which point a language becomes a dialect (or vice versa). To attain a fuller understanding of the difficulties and questions that are raised by the issue of the 'Kurdish language,' it is therefore necessary to consider also non-linguistic factors."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[CIA Factbook]], Kurds formed approximately 18% of the population in Turkey (approximately 14 million) in 2008. One Western source estimates that up to 25% of the Turkish population is Kurdish (approximately 18-19 million people).&lt;ref name="Mackey" /&gt; Kurdish sources claim there are as many as 20 or 25 million Kurds in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2008/3/turkeykurdistan1755.htm |title=Thousands of Kurds celebrate New Kurdish Year Newroz in southeastern Turkey |website=[[Ekurd.net]] |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several large scale Kurdish revolts in 1925, 1930 and 1938 were suppressed by the Turkish government and more than one million Kurds were forcibly relocated between 1925 and 1938.

By the 1970s, Kurdish leftist organizations such as ''Kurdistan Socialist Party-Turkey'' (KSP-T) emerged in Turkey which were against violence and supported civil activities and participation in elections. In 1977, ''Mehdi Zana'' a supporter of KSP-T won the mayoralty of [[Diyarbakir]] in the local elections. At about the same time, generational fissures gave birth to two new organizations: the ''National Liberation of Kurdistan'' and the ''Kurdistan Workers Party''.&lt;ref&gt;Reşat Kasaba, ''The Cambridge History of Turkey'', 600 pp., Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-521-62096-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-62096-3}}

Although militarily successful, the evacuations have caused great hardship to the villagers. The government was accused of harassment, destruction of villages, and the slaying of Kurds believed to be sympathetic to the PKK. Its tactics resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and turned thousands into refugees, who then crowded into major Turkish cities. The insurgents, in turn, targeted villages known to be sympathetic to the government, murdering state officials, teachers, government collaborators, and paramilitary village guards.

| quote       = The local gendarmerie (soldiers who police rural areas) required villages to show their loyalty by forming platoons of "provisional village guards," armed, paid, and supervised by the local gendarmerie post. Villagers were faced with a frightening dilemma. They could become village guards and risk being attacked by the PKK or refuse and be forcibly evacuated from their communities. Evacuations were unlawful and violent. Security forces would surround a village using helicopters, armored vehicles, troops, and village guards, and burn stored produce, agricultural equipment, crops, orchards, forests, and livestock. They set fire to houses, often giving the inhabitants no opportunity to retrieve their possessions. During the course of such operations, security forces frequently abused and humiliated villagers, stole their property and cash, and ill-treated or tortured them before herding them onto the roads and away from their former homes. The operations were marked by scores of "disappearances" and extrajudicial executions. By the mid-1990s, more than 3,000 villages had been virtually wiped from the map, and, according to official figures, 378,335 Kurdish villagers had been displaced and left homeless.

[[Leyla Zana]], the first Kurdish female MP from Diyarbakir, caused an uproar in [[Grand National Assembly|Turkish Parliament]] after adding the following sentence in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] to her parliamentary oath during the swearing-in ceremony in 1994: "I take this oath for the brotherhood of the Turkish and Kurdish peoples."&lt;ref&gt;Michael M.

In March 1994, the [[Turkish Parliament]] voted to lift the immunity of Zana and five other Kurdish [[Democracy Party (Turkey)|DEP]] members: Hatip Dicle, Ahmet Turk, Sirri Sakik, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak. Zana, Dicle, Sadak and Dogan were sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Supreme Court in October 1995. Zana was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] for human rights by the [[European Parliament]] in 1995.

Kurdish politicians, human-rights activists, journalists, teachers and other members of intelligentsia were among the victims. Virtually none of the perpetrators were investigated nor punished.

Unlike in other Kurdish-populated countries, there are strong ethnolinguistical and cultural ties between Kurds, [[Persian people|Persians]] and others as [[Iranian peoples]].&lt;ref name="kreyenbroek1719" /&gt; Some modern Iranian dynasties like the [[Safavids]] and [[Zands]] are considered to be partly of Kurdish origin.

During the late 1910s and early 1920s, [[Simko Shikak revolt|tribal revolt]] led by Kurdish chieftain [[Simko Shikak]] struck north western Iran. Although elements of [[Kurdish nationalism]] were present in this movement, historians agree these were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was a major issue in Simko's movement, and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives.&lt;ref name="kreyenbroek138141" /&gt; Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to suffer in the attacks, the [[Kurdish population]] was also robbed and assaulted.&lt;ref name="kreyenbroek138141" /&gt;&lt;ref name="entessar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Entessar|first=Nader|title=Kurdish Politics in the Middle East|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|location=Lanham|page=17|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7391-4039-0|oclc=430736528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebels do not appear to have felt any sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds.&lt;ref name="kreyenbroek138141" /&gt; Kurdish insurgency and seasonal migrations in the late 1920s, along with long-running tensions between Tehran and Ankara, resulted in border clashes and even military penetrations in both Iranian and Turkish territory.&lt;ref name="schofield" /&gt; Two regional powers have used Kurdish tribes as tool for own political benefits: Turkey has provided military help and refuge for anti-Iranian Turcophone [[Simko Shikak revolt|Shikak rebels]] in 1918-1922,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=William Edward David|last2=Muratoff|first2=Paul|title=Caucasian battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian border, 1828-1921|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|page=296|year=1953|oclc=1102813}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Iran did the same during [[Ararat rebellion]] against Turkey in 1930.

As a response to growing [[Pan-Turkism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]] in region which were seen as potential threats to the territorial integrity of Iran, [[Pan-Iranist]] ideology has been developed in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="ashraf" /&gt; Some of such groups and journals openly advocated Iranian support to the Kurdish rebellion against [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parvin|first=Nassereddin |title=Iran-e Kabir |work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |publisher=Columbia University |location=New York |url= http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-e-kabir |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular [[Pahlavi dynasty]] has endorsed Iranian ethnic [[Iranian nationalism|nationalism]]&lt;ref name="ashraf" /&gt; which seen the Kurds as integral part of the Iranian nation.&lt;ref name="banuaziziweiner" /&gt; [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] has personally praised the Kurds as "pure Iranians" or "one of the most noble [[Iranian peoples]]".&lt;ref name="Izady 1992 198"&gt;{{cite book|last=Izady|first=Mehrdad|title=The Kurds: A Concise Handbook|publisher=Crane Russak|location=Washington|year=1992|page=198|isbn=978-0-8448-1729-3|oclc=25409394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant ideology during this period was [[Marxism]] which arose among Kurds under influence of [[USSR]].

Kurds constitute approximately 17% of Iraq's population. They are the majority in at least three provinces in northern Iraq which are together known as [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Kurds also have a presence in [[Kirkuk]], [[Mosul]], [[Khanaqin]], and [[Baghdad]]. Around 300,000 Kurds live in the Iraqi capital [[Baghdad]], 50,000 in the city of [[Mosul]] and around 100,000 elsewhere in southern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/adhloc/Wh_155.html |title=By Location |work=Adherents.com |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurds led by [[Mustafa Barzani]] were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. In March 1970, Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy.

Moreover, in March 1975, Iraq and Iran signed the [[Algiers Agreement (1975)|Algiers Accord]], according to which Iran cut supplies to Iraqi Kurds. Iraq started another wave of Arabization by moving Arabs to the oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly those around Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Harris, ''Ethnic Conflict and the Kurds'' in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, p.121, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1975 and 1978, 200,000 Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;M.

During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s, the regime implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a ''de facto'' civil war broke out. Iraq was widely condemned by the international community, but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures such as the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians, the wholesale destruction of thousands of villages and the deportation of thousands of Kurds to southern and central Iraq.

The genocidal campaign, conducted between 1986 and 1989 and culminating in 1988, carried out by the Iraqi government against the Kurdish population was called ''Anfal'' ("Spoils of War"). The Anfal campaign led to destruction of over two thousand villages and killing of 182,000 Kurdish civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice |title=The Prosecution Witness and Documentary Evidence Phases of the Anfal Trial |url=http://www.ictj.org/images/content/7/2/725.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725060202/http://www.ictj.org/images/content/7/2/725.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 }} According to the Chief Prosecutor, Iraqi forces repeatedly used chemical weapons, killed up to 182,000 civilians, forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands more, and almost completely destroyed local infrastructure.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign included the use of ground offensives, aerial bombing, systematic destruction of settlements, mass deportation, firing squads, and chemical attacks, including the most infamous attack on the Kurdish town of [[Halabja poison gas attack|Halabja in 1988]] that killed 5000 civilians instantly.

After the collapse of the Kurdish uprising in March 1991, Iraqi troops recaptured most of the Kurdish areas and 1.5 million Kurds abandoned their homes and fled to the Turkish and Iranian borders. It is estimated that close to 20,000 Kurds succumbed to death due to exhaustion, lack of food, exposure to cold and disease. On 5 April 1991, [[UN Security Council]] passed resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688|688]] which condemned the repression of Iraqi Kurdish civilians and demanded that Iraq end its repressive measures and allow immediate access to international humanitarian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;DS=S/RES/688%20(1991)&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=RESOLUTION Security Council Resolution 688], 5 April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first international document (since the [[League of Nations]] arbitration of Mosul in 1926) to mention Kurds by name.  In mid-April, the Coalition established ''safe havens'' inside Iraqi borders and prohibited Iraqi planes from flying north of 36th parallel.&lt;ref name="McDowall 2004" /&gt;{{rp|373, 375}} In October 1991, Kurdish guerrillas captured [[Erbil]] and [[Sulaimaniyah]] after a series of clashes with Iraqi troops. In late October, Iraqi government retaliated by imposing a food and fuel embargo on the Kurds and stopping to pay civil servants in the Kurdish region. The embargo, however, backfired and Kurds held parliamentary elections in May 1992 and established [[Kurdistan Regional Government|Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnathan C.

They are mostly concentrated in the northeast and the north, but there are also significant Kurdish populations in Aleppo and Damascus. Kurds often speak Kurdish in public, unless all those present do not. According to [[Amnesty International]], Kurdish human rights activists are mistreated and persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=80256DD400782B8480256F63006435DB Syria: End persecution of human rights defenders and human rights activists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013142249/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=80256DD400782B8480256F63006435DB |date=13 October 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; No political parties are allowed for any group, Kurdish or otherwise.

Techniques used to suppress the ethnic identity of Kurds in [[Syria]] include various bans on the use of the [[Kurdish language]], refusal to register children with Kurdish names, the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in [[Arabic]], the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names, the prohibition of Kurdish private schools, and the prohibition of books and other materials written in Kurdish.&lt;ref name="Syria_Silenced_Kurds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm |title=Syria: The Silenced Kurds |work=Hrw.org |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/syria9812.htm Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Syria].

On 12 March 2004, beginning at a stadium in [[Qamishli]] (a largely Kurdish city in northeastern Syria), clashes between Kurds and Syrians broke out and continued over a number of days. At least thirty people were killed and more than 160 injured.

As a result of [[Syrian civil war]], since July 2012, Kurds were able to take control of large parts of Syrian Kurdistan from Andiwar in extreme northeast to Jindires in extreme northwest Syria. The Syrian Kurds started the [[Rojava Revolution]] in 2013.

Kurdish-inhabited [[Afrin Canton]] has been [[Turkish occupation of northern Syria|occupied]] by Turkish Armed Forces and [[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army]] since the [[Turkish military operation in Afrin]] in early 2018.

Between the 1930s and 1980s, [[Armenia]] was a part of the [[Soviet Union]], within which Kurds, like other ethnic groups, had the status of a protected minority. Armenian Kurds were permitted their own state-sponsored newspaper, radio broadcasts and cultural events. During the conflict in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], many non-Yazidi Kurds were forced to leave their homes since both the Azeri and non-Yazidi Kurds were Muslim.

In 1920, two Kurdish-inhabited areas of Jewanshir (capital [[Kalbajar]]) and eastern Zangazur (capital [[Lachin]]) were combined to form the [[Kurdistan Okrug]] (or "Red Kurdistan"). The period of existence of the Kurdish administrative unit was brief and did not last beyond 1929. Kurds subsequently faced many repressive measures, including deportations, imposed by the [[USSR|Soviet]] government. As a result of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh]], many Kurdish areas have been destroyed and more than 150,000 Kurds have been deported since 1988 by separatist [[Armenia]]n forces.&lt;ref name="meho"&gt;[http://www.slis.indiana.edu/faculty/meho/meho-bibliography-2001.pdf Kurds and Kurdistan: A General Background], p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the [[Council of Europe]], approximately 1.3 million Kurds live in [[Western Europe]]. The earliest immigrants were Kurds from Turkey, who settled in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], the [[Benelux]] countries, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]] during the 1960s. Successive periods of political and social turmoil in the region during the 1980s and 1990s brought new waves of Kurdish refugees, mostly from Iran and Iraq under Saddam Hussein, came to Europe.&lt;ref name="coucileu" /&gt;

==Religion==
As a whole, the Kurdish people are adherents to a large number of different religions and creeds, perhaps constituting the most religiously diverse people of West Asia. Traditionally, Kurds have been known to take great liberties with their practices. This sentiment is reflected in the saying "Compared to the unbeliever, the Kurd is a Muslim".&lt;ref name=RiK&gt;{{cite web | title=Religion in Kurdistan | first=M. | last=Van Bruinessen | url=http://www.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/m.vanbruinessen/publications/Bruinessen_Religion_in_Kurdistan.pdf | format=Religion in Kurdistan | publisher=Hum.uu.nl | accessdate=7 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109073537/http://www.hum.uu.nl/medewerkers/m.vanbruinessen/publications/Bruinessen_Religion_in_Kurdistan.pdf | archive-date=9 November 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the majority of Kurds are [[Sunni Muslim]], belonging to the [[Shafi]] school.  The Kurdish following of the Shafi legal code has caused some tension when pushed up against Sunni Turks and Sunni Arabs who subscribe to the [[Hanafi]] legal code.

The majority of Sunni Muslim Kurds belonging to the Shafi school speak the Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji) dialect.&lt;ref name="The Kurdish National Movement 2006, page 290"&gt;''The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development'', By Wadie Jwaideh, Syracuse University Press, 2006, page 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alevis (usually considered adherents of a branch of [[Shia]] [[Islam]] with elements of [[Sufism]]) are another religious significant minority among the Kurds, living in Eastern [[Anatolia]] in Turkey, meanwhile, it is estimated that 30% of Kurds in Turkey are Alevis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turkey's Kurdish Question|last=Barkey|first=Henri J.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2000|isbn=9780585177731|location=|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alevism]] developed out of the teachings of [[Haji Bektash Veli]], a 13th-century mystic from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Among the [[Qizilbash]], the militant groups which predate the Alevis and helped establish the [[Safavid Dynasty]], there were numerous Kurdish tribes.

===Ahl-i Haqq (Yarsan)===
{{Main|Yarsanism}}
Ahl-i Haqq or Yarsanism is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion founded by [[Sultan Sahak]] in the late 14th century in western Iran. Most of its adherents, estimated at around 500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kirkuknow.com/english/index.php/2014/05/19965/ |title=Kaka'ee… marginalized minority — '''kirkuknow.com''' |publisher= |accessdate=1 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901074255/http://kirkuknow.com/english/index.php/2014/05/19965/ |archivedate=1 September 2015 |df= }} Archived from on 2015-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1,000,000,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa'' (Detroit: Thompson Gale, 2004) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; are found primarily in western Iran and eastern Iraq and are mostly ethnic [[Goran Kurds]],&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Cecil.

In this text, the religion's basic pillars are summarized as: "The Yarsan should strive for these four qualities: purity, rectitude, self-effacement and self-abnegation".&lt;ref&gt;Mojan Membrado, "Jeyḥunābādi, Ḥājj Neʿmat-Allāh Mokri" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''. "Ḥājj Neʿmat-Allāh compiled and commented upon the existing material of the Ahl-e Ḥaqq tradition, stating his dismay at how far the Yāresān (i.e., Ahl-e Ḥaqq) had strayed from their core principles, and how those who at one time strove to realize the four pillars of purity, rectitude, self-effacement, and self-abnegation (''pāki'', ''rāsti'', ''nisti'', ''redā''.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yarsan faith's unique features include [[millenarism]], [[Innatism|nativism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[metempsychosis]], [[angelology]], divine manifestation and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Many of these features are found in [[Yazidi]]sm, another Kurdish faith, in the faith of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] and in [[ghulat]] (non-mainstream Shia) groups; certainly, the names and religious terminology of the Yarsan are often explicitly of Muslim origin. Unlike other indigenous Persianate faiths, the Yarsan explicitly reject class, caste and rank, which sets them apart from the Yazidis and Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name="Hamzeh'ee"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hamzeh'ee | first = M Reza | author-link = | publication-date = 1990 | year = 1990 | title = The Yaresan&amp;nbsp;: a sociological, historical, and religio-historical study of a Kurdish community | edition = | series = [[Islamkundliche Untersuchungen]] | volume = 138 | publication-place = Berlin | place = | publisher = Schwartz | pages = | page = | isbn = 3-922968-83-X | doi = | oclc = |url=| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pilgrims and festival at Lalish on the day of the Ezidi New Year in 2017 22.jpg|thumb|Yazidi new year celebrations in [[Lalish]], 18 April 2017]]
[[Yazidism]] is another [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretic religion]] practiced among Kurdish communities, founded by [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir]], a 12th-century mystic from Lebanon. Their numbers exceed 500,000, with some estimates numbering them at 1.2 million worldwide.&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web|first=Christine|last=Allison|date=2004-02-20|accessdate=20 August 2010|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yazidis-i-general-1|title=Yazidis i: General|work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|quote=There are probably some 200,000–300,000 Yazidis worldwide.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adherents"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://adherents.com/Na/Na_670.html#4286|title=Yezidi|publisher=Adherents.com}} Cites estimates between 100,000 and 700,000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-03-31|title=Deadly Iraq sect attacks kill 200|date=2007-08-15|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6946028.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central religious texts are the [[Yazidi Book of Revelation|Kitêba Cilwe]] and [[Yazidi Black Book|Meshaf Resh]].

According to Yazidi beliefs, God created the world but left it in the care of seven holy beings or angels. The most prominent angel is [[Melek Taus]] (Kurdish: ''Tawûsê Melek''), the Peacock Angel, God's representative on earth. Yazidis believe in the periodic [[reincarnation]] of the seven holy beings in human form.  Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marriage and family - Yezidis|url = http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Yezidis-Marriage-and-Family.html|website = www.everyculture.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Everything You Need to Know About the Yazidis|url = http://time.com/3091932/yazidi-iraq-isis-obama/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-02-07|first = Mirren|last = Gidda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{Main|Zoroastrianism}}
[[File:Faravahar-Gold.svg|thumb|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a ''Fravashi'' (guardian spirit)]]
The Persian religion of Zoroastrianism had a major influence on the early Kurdish culture and has maintained some effect since the demise of the religion in the Middle Ages. The Iranian philosopher Sohrevardi drew heavily from Zoroastrian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Corbin. The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism. Omega Publications, New York. 1994. {{ISBN|0-930872-48-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ascribed to the teachings of the prophet [[Zoroaster]], the faith's [[Supreme Being]] is [[Ahura Mazda]]. Leading characteristics, such as [[messianism]], the [[Golden Rule]], [[heaven]] and [[hell]], and [[free will]] influenced other religious systems, including [[Second Temple Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hinnel|first=J|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Religion|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the first official Zoroastrian [[fire temple]] of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] opened in [[Sulaymaniyah]]. Attendees celebrated the occasion by lighting a ritual fire and beating the [[frame drum]] or 'daf'.&lt;ref name=zoroastrian-temple&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/210920163|title=Hopes for Zoroastrianism revival in Kurdistan as first temple opens its doors|publisher=Rudaw|date=2016-09-21|accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awat Tayib, the chief of followers of Zoroastrianism in the Kurdistan region, claimed that many were returning to Zoroastrianism but some kept it secret out of fear of reprisals from Islamists.&lt;ref name=zoroastrian-temple /&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Kurdish Christians|Bible translations into Kurdish|Christianity}}
Although historically there have been various accounts of Kurdish Christians, most often these were in the form of individuals, and not as communities. However, in the 19th and 20th century various travel logs tell of Kurdish Christian tribes, as well as Kurdish Muslim tribes who had substantial Christian populations living amongst them. A significant number of these were allegedly originally [[Armenian people|Armenian]] or [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sykes | first1 = M. | year = 1908 | title = The Kurdish Tribes of the Ottoman Empire | url = | journal = The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 451–486 | doi=10.2307/2843309}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been recorded that a small number of Christian traditions have been preserved. Several Christian prayers in Kurdish have been found from earlier centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hervas, L. Saggio. (1787). 'Pratico delle lingue: con prolegomeni, e una raccolta di orazioni dominicali in piu di trecento lingue e dialetti...'. Cesena: Per Gregorio Biasini, pp. 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Segments of the Bible were first made available in the Kurdish language in 1856 in the Kurmanji dialect. The Gospels were translated by Stepan, an Armenian employee of the [[American Bible Society]] and were published in 1857.  Prominent historical Kurdish Christians include [[Theophobos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sevcenko|1968|p=111}}: "A converted Kurd, named Nasr and renamed Theophobos in Byzantium, was for a number of years Emperor Theophilus' (829-42) intimate friend and trusted commander."&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015|note=This ariticle does not use Harvard referencing.

==Culture==
[[File:Flag of Kurdistan.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Iraqi Kurdistan]]]]

{{Main|Kurdish culture|Kurdish literature}}

Kurdish culture is a legacy from the various ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society.  As most other Middle Eastern populations, a high degree of mutual influences between the Kurds and their neighbouring peoples are apparent. Therefore, in Kurdish culture elements of various other cultures are to be seen.
However, on the whole, Kurdish culture is closest to that of other [[Iranian peoples]], in particular those who historically had the closest geographical proximity to the Kurds, such as the [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Lur people|Lurs]]. Kurds, for instance, also celebrate [[Newroz]] (March 21) as New Year's Day.&lt;ref name="krelig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturalorientation.net/kurds/krelig.html |title=Iraqi Kurds |work=culturalorientation.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902043336/http://www.culturalorientation.net/kurds/krelig.html |archivedate=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Kurdish women's rights and equality have improved in the 20th and 21st century due to progressive movements within Kurdish society. However, despite the progress, Kurdish and international women's rights organizations still report problems related to [[gender equality]], [[forced marriages]], [[honor killings]] and in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] also [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Berivan A.

===Folklore and mythology===
[[File:Vulpes vulpes at Eshel HaNasi4, israel.jpg|thumb|left|The [[fox]]; a widely recurring character in Kurdish tales]]

The Kurds possess a rich tradition of folklore, which, until recent times, was largely transmitted by speech or song, from one generation to the next. Although some of the Kurdish writers' stories were well known throughout Kurdistan; most of the stories told and sung were only written down in the 20th and 21st century. Many of these are, allegedly, centuries old.

Widely varying in purpose and style, among the Kurdish folklore one will find stories about nature, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, love, heroes and villains, [[mythological]] creatures and everyday life. A number of these mythological figures can be found in other cultures, like the [[Simurgh]] and [[Kaveh the Blacksmith]] in the broader [[Persian mythology|Iranian Mythology]], and stories of [[Shahmaran]] throughout Anatolia. Additionally, stories can be purely entertaining, or have an educational or religious aspect.&lt;ref name="Edgecomb"&gt;Edgecomb, D. (2007). ''A Fire in My Heart: Kurdish Tales''. Westport: Libraries Unlimited, pp. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most widely reoccurring element is the fox, which, through cunningness and shrewdness triumphs over less intelligent species, yet often also meets his demise.&lt;ref name="Edgecomb" /&gt; Another common theme in Kurdish folklore is the origin of a tribe.

Storytellers would perform in front of an audience, sometimes consisting of an entire village. People from outside the region would travel to attend their narratives, and the storytellers themselves would visit other villages to spread their tales. These would thrive especially during winter, where entertainment was hard to find as evenings had to be spent inside.&lt;ref name="Edgecomb" /&gt;

Coinciding with the heterogeneous Kurdish groupings, although certain stories and elements were commonly found throughout Kurdistan, others were unique to a specific area; depending on the region, religion or dialect. The [[Kurdish Jews]] of [[Zakho]] are perhaps the best example of this; whose gifted storytellers are known to have been greatly respected throughout the region, thanks to a unique oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;D. Shai (2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u15v57k267kq7533/ "Changes in the oral tradition among the Jews of Kurdistan"].Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are the mythology of the [[Yezidis]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Alison (2006).[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yazidis-i-general-1 "Yazidis i. General"]. ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the stories of the Dersim Kurds, which had a substantial Armenian influence.&lt;ref&gt;V. Arakelova.

During the criminalization of the Kurdish language after the coup d'état of 1980, dengbêj (singers) and çîrokbêj (tellers) were silenced, and many of the stories had become endangered. In 1991, the language was decriminalized, yet the now highly available radios and TV's had as an effect a diminished interest in traditional storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/28/kurdish-singing-storytellers-rise-dengbej "Silenced Kurdish storytellers sing again"]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of writers have made great strides in the preservation of these tales.

===Weaving===
[[File:Modern Bidjar rug.jpg|thumb|Modern rug from [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]]]]

Kurdish weaving is renowned throughout the world, with fine specimens of both rugs and bags. The most famous Kurdish rugs are [[Bijar rug|those from the Bijar region]], in the Kurdistan Province. Because of the unique way in which the Bijar rugs are woven, they are very stout and durable, hence their appellation as the 'Iron Rugs of Persia'. Exhibiting a wide variety, the Bijar rugs have patterns ranging from floral designs, medallions and animals to other ornaments. They generally have two [[weft]]s, and are very colorful in design.&lt;ref name="Claremont Rug Company"&gt;J. D. Winitz '[http://www.claremontrug.com/educational-center/rugtypes/kurdish.aspx Kurdish Rugs]'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With an increased interest in these rugs in the last century, and a lesser need for them to be as sturdy as they were, new Bijar rugs are more refined and delicate in design.

Another well-known Kurdish rug is the Senneh rug, which is regarded as the most sophisticated of the Kurdish rugs. They are especially known for their great knot density and high quality mountain wool.&lt;ref name="Claremont Rug Company" /&gt; They lend their name from the region of [[Sanandaj]]. Throughout other Kurdish regions like [[Kermanshah]], [[Siirt]], [[Malatya]] and [[Bitlis]] rugs were also woven to great extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagleton | first1 = W. | year = 1989 | title = The Emergence of a Kurdish Rug Type | url = | journal = Oriental Rug Review | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurdish bags are mainly known from the works of one large tribe: the [[Jaff (Kurdish tribe)|Jaff]]s, living in the border area between Iran and Iraq. These Jaff bags share the same characteristics of Kurdish rugs; very colorful, stout in design, often with medallion patterns. They were especially popular in the West during the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = M. | year = 1989 | title = Diamonds in the Pile | url = | journal = Oriental Rug Review | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handicrafts===
[[File:KurdishNoble.jpg|thumb|left|A Kurdish nobleman bearing a [[jambiya]] dagger]]

Outside of weaving and clothing, there are many other Kurdish [[handicrafts]], which were traditionally often crafted by nomadic Kurdish tribes. These are especially well known in Iran, most notably the crafts from the [[Kermanshah]] and [[Sanandaj]] regions. Among these crafts are chess boards, talismans, jewelry, ornaments, weaponry, instruments etc.

Kurdish blades include a distinct [[jambiya]], with its characteristic I-shaped hilt, and oblong blade. Generally, these possess double-edged blades, reinforced with a central ridge, a wooden, leather or silver decorated scabbard, and a horn hilt, furthermore they are often still worn decoratively by older men. Swords were made as well. Most of these blades in circulation stem from the 19th century.

Another distinct form of art from Sanandaj is 'Oroosi', a type of window where stylized wooden pieces are locked into each other, rather than being glued together. These are further decorated with coloured glass, this stems from an old belief that if light passes through a combination of seven colours it helps keep the atmosphere clean.

Among Kurdish Jews a common practice was the making of talismans, which were believed to combat illnesses and protect the wearer from malevolent spirits.

===Tattoos===

Adorning the body with [[tattoo]]s (''deq'' in Kurdish) is widespread among the Kurds; even though permanent tattoos are not permissible in Sunni Islam. Therefore, these traditional tattoos are thought to derive from pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref name="Immigration Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/pages/14387/kurds-in-australia-brochure.pdf?epslanguage=en |format=PDF |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |title=Immigration Museum (2010) Survival of a culture: Kurds in Australia |accessdate=7 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326153229/http://museumvictoria.com.au/pages/14387/kurds-in-australia-brochure.pdf?epslanguage=en |archive-date=26 March 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattoo ink is made by mixing [[soot]] with (breast) milk and the poisonous liquid from the gall bladder of an animal. The design is drawn on the skin using a thin twig and is, by needle, penetrated under the skin. These have a wide variety of meanings and purposes, among which are protection against evil or illnesses; beauty enhancement; and the showing of tribal affiliations. [[Religious symbolism]] is also common among both traditional and modern Kurdish tattoos. Tattoos are more prevalent among women than among men, and were generally worn on feet, the chin, foreheads and other places of the body.&lt;ref name="Immigration Museum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Floor (2011) [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kalkubi "Ḵālkubi"] ''Encyclopædia Iranica''. Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of permanent, traditional tattoos has greatly diminished among newer generation of Kurds. However, modern tattoos are becoming more prevalent; and temporary tattoos are still being worn on special occasions (such as [[henna]], the night before a wedding) and as tribute to the cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Immigration Museum" /&gt;

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Kurdish music}}
[[File:Kurdish_musicians_1890.jpg|thumb|Kurdish Musicians 1890.]]
Traditionally, there are three types of Kurdish classical performers: [[Storytelling|storytellers]] (''çîrokbêj''), [[minstrel]]s (''stranbêj''), and [[bard]]s (''dengbêj''). No specific music was associated with the Kurdish princely courts. Instead, music performed in night gatherings (''şevbihêrk'') is considered classical. Several musical forms are found in this genre. Many songs are [[Epic poetry|epic]] in nature, such as the popular ''Lawiks'', heroic [[ballad]]s recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes such as [[Saladin]]. ''Heyrans'' are love ballads usually expressing the melancholy of separation and unfulfilled love, one of the first Kurdish female singers to sing heyrans is [[Chopy Fatah]], while ''Lawje'' is a form of religious music and ''Payizoks'' are songs performed during the autumn. Love songs, dance music, wedding and other celebratory songs (''dîlok/narînk''), erotic poetry, and [[work song]]s are also popular.

Throughout the Middle East, there are many prominent Kurdish artists. Most famous are [[Ibrahim Tatlises]], [[Nizamettin Arıç]], [[Ahmet Kaya]] and the [[Kamkars]]. In Europe, well-known artists are [[Darin Zanyar]], [[Sivan Perwer]], and [[Azad (rapper)|Azad]].

The main themes of [[Kurdish cinema|Kurdish Cinema]] are the poverty and hardship which ordinary Kurds have to endure. The first films featuring Kurdish culture were actually shot in Armenia.

The first critically acclaimed and famous Kurdish films were produced by [[Yılmaz Güney]]. Initially a popular, award-winning actor in Turkey with the nickname ''Çirkin Kral'' (''the Ugly King'', after his rough looks), he spent the later part of his career producing socio-critical and politically loaded films. [[Sürü]] (1979), [[Yol]] (1982) and [[Duvar]] (1983) are his best-known works, of which the second won Palme d'Or at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] of 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DVD ~ Yilmaz Güney |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/6302824435 |title=Yol (1982) |work=Amazon.com |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most prestigious award in the world of cinema.

Another prominent Kurdish film director is [[Bahman Qubadi]]. His first feature film was [[A Time for Drunken Horses]], released in 2000. It was critically acclaimed, and went on to win multiple awards. Other movies of his would follow this example;&lt;ref&gt;IMDB '[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315842/awards Bahman Ghobadi's Awards]'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; making him one of the best known film producers of Iran of today. Recently, he released [[Rhinos Season]], starring [[Behrouz Vossoughi]], [[Monica Bellucci]] and [[Yilmaz Erdogan]], detailing the tumultuous life of a Kurdish poet.

Other prominent Kurdish film directors that are critically acclaimed include [[Mahsun Kırmızıgül]], [[Hiner Saleem]] and the aforementioned Yilmaz Erdogan. There's also been a number of films set and/or filmed in Kurdistan made by non-Kurdish film directors, such as [[the Wind Will Carry Us]], [[Triage (film)|Triage]], [[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]], and [[The Market: A Tale of Trade]].

===Sports===
[[File:080603 Derdiyok.jpg|thumb|[[Eren Derdiyok]], the most famous contemporary Kurdish footballer, striker for the [[Swiss national football team]]]]

The most popular sport among the Kurds is football. Because the Kurds have no independent state, they have no representative team in [[FIFA]] or the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]; however a team representing [[Iraqi Kurdistan national football team|Iraqi Kurdistan]] has been active in the [[Viva World Cup]] since 2008. They became runners-up in 2009 and 2010, before ultimately becoming champion in 2012.

On a national level, the Kurdish clubs of Iraq have achieved success in recent years as well, winning the [[Iraqi Premier League]] four times in the last five years. Prominent clubs are [[Erbil SC]], [[Duhok SC]], [[Sulaymaniyah FC]] and [[Zakho FC]].

In Turkey, a Kurd named [[Celal Ibrahim]] was one of the founders of [[Galatasaray S.K.]] in 1905, as well as one of the original players. The most prominent Kurdish-Turkish club is [[Diyarbakirspor]]. In the diaspora, the most successful Kurdish club is [[Dalkurd FF]] and the most famous player is [[Eren Derdiyok]].&lt;ref&gt;FIFA '[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/players/player=294749/profile.html Eren Derdiyok's Profile]'  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113003014/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/players/player%3D294749/profile.html |date=13 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent sport is wrestling. In [[Iranian Wrestling]], there are three styles originating from Kurdish regions: 
*Zhir-o-Bal (a style similar to [[Greco-Roman wrestling]]), practised in [[Kurdistan]], [[Kermanshah]] and [[Ilam Province|Ilam]];&lt;ref name="Pahlevani Research Institute"&gt;Pahlevani Research Institute '[http://www.izsf.org/Content/media/image/2011/05/1054_orig.pdf The Way of Traditional Persian Wrestling Styles] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HygMzYj7?url=http://www.izsf.org/Content/media/image/2011/05/1054_orig.pdf |date=9 July 2013 }}' Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Zouran-Patouleh, practised in [[Kurdistan]];&lt;ref name="Pahlevani Research Institute" /&gt;
*Zouran-Machkeh, practised in [[Kurdistan]] as well.&lt;ref name="Pahlevani Research Institute" /&gt;
Furthermore, the most accredited of the traditional Iranian wrestling styles, the Bachoukheh, derives its name from a local Khorasani Kurdish costume in which it is practised.&lt;ref name="Pahlevani Research Institute" /&gt;

Kurdish medalists in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] were [[Nur Tatar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gundem.milliyet.com.tr/-kurt-um-ay-yildizli-bayragi-gururla-tasiyorum-/gundem/gundemdetay/21.08.2012/1584208/default.htm |title=Kürt'üm, ay yıldızlı bayrağı gururla taşıyorum - Milliyet Haber |publisher=Gundem.milliyet.com.tr |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kianoush Rostami]] and Yezidi [[Misha Aloyan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tert.am/en/news/2011/10/21/aloyan/ |title=Misha Aloyan wants to change his name - Armenian News |publisher=Tert.am |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; who won medals in [[taekwondo]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[boxing]], respectively.

===Architecture===
[[File:OnGozluBridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Marwanids|Marwanid]] [[Dicle Bridge]], [[Diyarbakir]]]]
[[File:Krak des Chevaliers, NW Syria - 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Krak des Chevaliers]], originally a Kurdish dwelling place known as Hisn al-Akrad (Castle of the Kurds), west of [[Homs]]]]
[[File:Arbil Citadel.jpg|thumb|The [[Citadel of Erbil]]]]
The traditional Kurdish village has simple houses, made of mud. In most cases with flat, wooden roofs, and, if the village is built on the slope of a mountain, the roof on one house makes for the garden of the house one level higher. However, houses with a beehive-like roof, not unlike those in [[Harran]], are also present.

Over the centuries many Kurdish architectural marvels have been erected, with varying styles. Kurdistan boasts many examples from ancient Iranic, Roman, Greek and Semitic origin, most famous of these include [[Bisotun]] and [[Taq-e Bostan]] in Kermanshah, [[Takht-e Soleyman]] near Takab, [[Mount Nemrud]] near Adiyaman and the citadels of Erbil and Diyarbakir.

The first genuinely Kurdish examples extant were built in the 11th century. Those earliest examples consist of the Marwanid [[Dicle Bridge]] in Diyarbakir, the Shadaddid [[Ani|Minuchir Mosque]] in Ani,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sim|first=Steven |title=The Mosque of Minuchihr |publisher=VirtualANI |url= http://www.virtualani.org/minuchihrmosque/index.htm |accessdate=23 January 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070120195237/http://www.virtualani.org/minuchihrmosque/index.htm| archivedate=20 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Krak des Chevaliers|Hisn al Akrad]] near Homs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=20}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2015|note=This ariticle does not use Harvard referencing. Use Template:Cite_book to provide proper citation details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th and 13th centuries the Ayyubid dynasty constructed many buildings throughout the Middle East, being influenced by their predecessors, the Fatimids, and their rivals, the Crusaders, whilst also developing their own techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 1996, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, women of the Ayyubid family took a prominent role in the patronage of new constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, 1994, pp.35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ayyubids' most famous works are the Halil-ur-Rahman Mosque that surrounds the [[Şanlıurfa|Pool of Sacred Fish]] in Urfa, the [[Citadel of Cairo]]&lt;ref&gt;Harry Ades, ''A Traveller's History of Egypt'', Arris Publishing Ltd. 2007 {{ISBN|1-905214-01-4}} p.226&lt;/ref&gt; and most parts of the [[Citadel of Aleppo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Citadel of Aleppo: Description, History, Site Plan and Visitor Tour (Guidebook) |url=http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=10623 |first1=Julia |last1=Gonnella |publisher=[[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] and the Syrian [[Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-2-940212-02-6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609095149/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.jsp?document_id=10623 |archivedate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important piece of Kurdish architectural heritage from the late 12th/early 13th century is the Yezidi pilgrimage site [[Lalish]], with its trademark conical roofs.

In later periods too, Kurdish rulers and their corresponding dynasties and emirates would leave their mark upon the land in the form mosques, castles and bridges, some of which have decayed, or have been (partly) destroyed in an attempt to erase the Kurdish cultural heritage, such as the White Castle of the Bohtan Emirate. Well-known examples are [[Hosap Castle]] of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Verity Campbell - Turkey - 2007 - 724 pages, page 643, {{ISBN|1-74104-556-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherwana Castle]] of the early 18th century, and the Ellwen Bridge of Khanaqin of the 19th century.

Most famous is the [[Ishak Pasha Palace]] of Dogubeyazit, a structure with heavy influences from both Anatolian and Iranic architectural traditions. Construction of the Palace began in 1685, led by Colak Abdi Pasha, a Kurdish bey of the Ottoman Empire, but the building wouldn't be completed until 1784, by his grandson, Ishak Pasha.&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet (2012) '[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/the-black-sea-and-northeastern-anatolia/dogubayazit/sights/palace/ishak-pasa-palace Ishak Pasha Palace]'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Institut kurde de Paris (2011) '[http://www.institutkurde.org/en/publications/bulletins/pdf/318.pdf THE RESTORATION OF ISHAQ PASHA'S PALACE WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2013]'. Retrieved 7 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Containing almost 100 rooms, including a mosque, dining rooms, dungeons and being heavily decorated by hewn-out ornaments, this Palace has the reputation as being one of the finest pieces of architecture of the Ottoman Period, and of Anatolia.

In recent years, the KRG has been responsible for the renovation of several historical structures, such as Erbil Citadel and the Mudhafaria Minaret.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Office for Iraq (2007) '[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/iraq-office/culture/erbil-citadel/ Revitalization Project of Erbil Citadel]'.

{{Ethnic Singapore sidebar}}
'''Malay Singaporeans''' or '''Singaporean Malays''' ({{lang-ms|Melayu Singapura}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{lang|ms-Arab|ملايو سيڠاڤورا}}), are defined by the [[Government of Singapore]] and by intellectuals in the country using the broader concept of the [[Malay race]], including [[Malays (ethnic group)|ethnic Malays]] and [[Malay Singaporeans#Malay subgroups|related ethnic groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/malay/ |title=Department of Malay Studies - National University of Singapore |website=Fas.nus.edu.sg |date= |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Malays are indigenous to the area that is now Singapore, and with established political rule recorded as early as the 13th century AD, most Malays in Singapore today include roots from both [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Prior to the arrival of Raffles, there were many of the indigenous Malays living on the island under the [[Johor Sultanate]]. Most of the indigenous Malays came from the [[Malay Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=83001#summary |title=MAR &amp;#124; Data &amp;#124; Assessment for Malays in Singapore |website=Cidcm.umd.edu |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2016-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328213055/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=83001#summary |archivedate=28 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Malay Singaporeans constitute 15% of the country's citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.nptd.gov.sg/Portals/0/Homepage/Highlights/population-in-brief-2015.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912061144/http://www.nptd.gov.sg/Portals/0/Homepage/Highlights/population-in-brief-2015.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-09-12|title=Population in Brief 2015|work=Singapore Government|date=September 2015|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the second largest [[ethnic group]] in Singapore.

From the 19th century until [[World War II]], the Malays enjoyed favourable treatment and disproportionate employment to colonial governmental posts; this was concurrent with a sharp increase in the Malay population due to immigration to Singapore from the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Sulawesi]]. Though coming from various background from the [[Malay world]], nonetheless many are tied together by a similar culture, language and religion.

==History of the Malay Kings of Singapore==
[[File:Photographic Views of Singapore Plate 21 Malay Ladies.jpg|thumb|right|A group of Malay women seated, [[Singapore]], circa 1900.]]
The seventeenth-century Malay chronicle, the [[Sejarah Melayu]] or [[Malay Annals]], tells of the founding of a great trading city on the island of [[Temasek]] in 1299 AD by a prince from [[Palembang]]. Palembang was then the capital of the diminishing [[Srivijayan]] Empire. The prince, Sri Tri Buana, (also known as [[Sang Nila Utama]]) was said to be a descendant of [[Alexander the Great]] and an Indian princess called Shahru Al-Bariyah. Legend states that he renamed the city Singapura ("lion city") after sighting a strange beast that he took to be a lion, although there is no real historical evidence of this.

In the mid-14th century, 
Singapura suffered raids by the expanding Javanese [[Majapahit]] Empire to the south and the emerging Thai kingdom of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] to the north, both claiming the island as a vassal state at several points in time. 
Around 1388, the ruler of [[Palembang]], [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], came to Singapore to flee from Majapahit control. He murdered the king and seized power, but it was a futile act. The Srivijayan Empire, already in decline, finally met its end when Majapahit attacked its capital Palembang in 1391. In 1396, Majapahit or Ayutthaya forces drove out Parameswara, who fled northward and founded kingdom of [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in 1400.

When the [[Battle of Malacca (1511)|Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511]], the last Malaccan sultan, Mahmud Shah, fled to [[Johore]], where he established the new [[Johor Sultanate|Johore Sultanate]]. Singapura became part of this sultanate. In 1613, however, the Portuguese reported burning down a trading outpost at the mouth of the Temasek (Singapore) River, and Singapura passed into history.

The territory controlled by the
[[Johor Sultanate|Johore]] [[Riau Sultanate|Riau]] Lingga Pahang sultanate in the late eighteenth century still included Singapore as part of its territory. The sultanate had become increasingly weakened by a division into a Malay faction, which controlled the peninsula and Singapore, and a Bugis faction which controlled the Riau Archipelago and Sumatra. When Sultan Mahmud Riayat Shah III died in 1812, the Bugis had proclaimed the younger of his two sons, Abdul Rahman, as sultan instead of the elder son, Tengku Long. 
While the sultan was the nominal ruler of his domain, senior officials actually governed the sultanate. In control of Singapore and the neighbouring islands was [[Temenggong]] Abdul Rahman, Tengku Long's father-in-law. In 1818, he and some of his followers left Riau for Singapore shortly after the Dutch signed a treaty with the Sultan Abdul Rahman, allowing the Dutch to station a garrison at Riau.

In 1819, Tengku Long signed a treaty with the British led by Sir [[Stamford Raffles]]. In exchange for British protection and recognising him as Sultan of Johore, Tengku Long agreed to allow the British to establish a trading post in Singapore. Proclaimed as [[Sultan Hussein Shah]], he became the Sultan of Johore.

In 1835, Sultan Hussein Shah died and was succeeded by his eldest son, Tengku Ali. Sultan Hussein had signed away his rights over the island in exchange for the land at [[Kampong Gelam]] plus an annual stipend for his family. After the Sultan's death, disputes broke out among his descendants. In the late 1890s, they went to court, where it was decided that no one in the family had the rights as the successor to the sultanate and the land at Kampong Gelam should revert to the state ['''''Tengku Mahmud vs. Tengku Ali, Straits Settlements Laws Report 1897 (Vol. 5)''''']. This ended the reign of the Malay kings in Singapore.

Here were also Malay settlements along the Kallang River Basin and the Singapore River. Turnbull reported that there was an estimated 1,000 people living in Singapore. There were about 500 Orang Kallang, 200 Orang Seletar, 150 Orang Gelam, 100 Orang Lauts, 20–30 Malays who were the followers of Temenggong Abdul Rahman and about 20–30 Chinese.

In the first census taken in 1824, it was revealed that the Malays (including the [[Bugis]]) then made up 60.9 per cent of the total population of 10,683. Further census figures of Singapore in the following few years showed rapid increase in population, particularly Chinese migrants with a disproportionate number of men.&lt;ref name="1823 census"/&gt; The 1826 census shows 4,790 Malays, 1,242 Bugis, and 267 Javanese out of a total population 13,750.&lt;ref name="census 1826"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023134368#page/n43/mode/2up |editors=Wright, Arnold and Cartwright, H.A. |date= 1907|title=Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Singaporean Malays are descended from different ethnic groups that are found throughout the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Most notable are the '''[[Orang Laut]]'''(the original inhabitants of Singapore), '''Riau Malays''', '''[[Javanese people|Javanese]]''', '''[[Bawean|Boyanese]]''', '''[[Bugis]]''', '''[[Minangkabau people|Minangkabaus]]''', '''Banjarese''' and the '''[[Bataks]]'''
===The Orang Laut (Sea Nomads)===
Also known as Orang Pulau/Orang Singapura
{{Further information|Orang laut}}
According to Sopher (1977), the Orang Kallang, Orang Seletar, Orang Selat and Orang Gelam were the [[Orang Laut]] that lived in Singapore. The Orang Kallang (also called the Orang Biduanda Kallang) lived in the swampy areas in the Kallang River. They lived on boats and sustained their lives by fishing and collecting other materials from the forests. After 1819, they were relocated by Temenggong Abdul Rahman to the northern Singapore Straits at Sungai Pulau. In 1847 most of the Orang Kallang were wiped out by a smallpox epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_220__2008-12-02.html |title=Kallang &amp;#124; Infopedia |website=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orang Seletar lived in the river swamps and the small islands surrounding mainland Singapore. They would often gather on the coastal areas, especially on the estuary of the Seletar River. They lived a nomadic lifestyle until the 1850s, when they started living on land and followed the lifestyles of others living in Singapore.

The Orang Selat lived in the harbour waters of Keppel Singapore. They were believed to have traversed the waters of Keppel Harbour since the early 16th century, making them one of the earliest settlers of the island. They sold fish and fruits to the trading vessels that passed the area.

The Orang Gelam came from a tribe in [[Batam Island]]. They were brought by the Temenggong of Johor together with a group of his followers to establish a settlement in the first decade of the 19th century. Many of the Orang Gelam who lived along the Singapore River served as boatmen for merchant ships while their womenfolk were fruit sellers on boats.

The Orang Laut differed from the Malays in that they lived a nomadic lifestyle and lived at sea in their boats whereas the Malays lived in settlements in the villages on the land.

When Raffles came to Singapore, there were already hundreds of [[Malay people|indigenous Malays]] and orang laut living there.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vasil 2000 96"/&gt; They were made up of the nobility that were headed by the Temenggong, the palace officials and his followers as well as the Orang Laut. Subsequently, the numbers increased with the arrivals of other Malays from [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In a matter of several months, hundreds of Malays from [[Malacca]] came to Singapore, encouraged by the British who wanted to develop Singapore as a centre for trade and administration (Siebel, 1961:27). When Singapore became more developed and there were better economic opportunities, many Malays from [[Johore]], [[Riau]], [[Sumatra]], [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]] came to Singapore (Roff, 1967:33; Census 1931:72). Many of these Malays lived in the towns and worked there (Siebel, 1961:35). The census for 1931 showed that the total number of Malay men working here were as many as 11,290. Out of this number, 18% worked as fishermen and as many as 12% lived by farming the land.

In the 1930s and 1950s, many Malay residents from Malaya were working in the British uniformed services. In 1957 alone, there were more than 10,000 Malays working in the uniform services because the British preferred them to the Javanese or [[Malay Indonesian|Malays from Indonesia]] (Betts, 1975:41; Djamour, 1959:5). However, during the period 1957–1970, most of them returned to Malaysia when their terms of services ended.

===The Javanese===
The second largest Malay group were the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. They came from [[Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern Indonesia). In the 1931 Population Census, the number of Javanese in Singapore was 16,063. The 1981 Population Census, however, showed that they made up 6% of the Malay population. However, many Javanese had actually registered themselves as 'Malay'. It is likely that the actual percentage of the Javanese within the Malay population was much higher. An ethnographic study in 1990 estimated that approximately 50–60% of Singaporean Malays have at least some degree of Javanese ancestry.&lt;ref name="KeturunanSG"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milner|first=Anthony|title=The Malays|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-7748-1333-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sACaolB0FpkC&amp;dq=singapore+malays+%22javanese+descent%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=17 February 2013|chapter=Chapter 7, Multiple forms of 'Malayness'|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KeturunanSG2"&gt;{{cite book|last=LePoer|first=Barbara Leitch|title=Singapore, a country study|year=1991|publisher=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|quote=Singapore Malay community leaders estimated that some 50 to 60 percent of the community traced their origins to Java and an additional 15 to 20 percent to Bawean Island, in the Java Sea north of the city of [[Surabaya]].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43QrSKQ0Q1EC|accessdate=17 February 2013|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Javanese came to Singapore in stages. In the mid-19th century, they came and worked as ironsmiths, leather makers as well as spice merchants and religious books dealers. There were also a group of Javanese printers and publishers in the Arab Street area. There were also community of pilgrim brokers that played an important role in encouraging the migration of the Javanese to Singapore.

[[File:Satay 2.jpg|thumb|A [[Satay]] being served in Singapore. Quintessentially Javanese in origin, the dish is now known as part and parcel of Singaporean Malay cuisine, reflecting the visible Javanese ancestry of many Malays in the republic.]]
The political situation in the Dutch East Indies created by the Dutch government caused many Javanese to go through Singapore to travel to [[Mecca]] to perform the [[hajj]]. From the mid-19th century until 1910, between 2,000 and 7,000 Javanese travelled to Mecca through Singapore until the regulations were eased (Roff 1967:39). Usually, these pilgrims would work in Singapore for several months or years before or after performing the hajj to earn money or pay their debts to their pilgrim brokers. Many of them stayed on in Singapore and became part of the Muslim community in the city (Roff, 1967:43).

A number of Javanese also came to Singapore with the help of the pilgrim brokers. They came voluntarily and a majority of them were young men who stayed in the lodgings of the pilgrim brokers until they found work. They worked as food sellers, gardeners and provided labour for the pilgrim brokers to build lodging homes for them. The pilgrim brokers also took in bonded labourers who worked for Malay or Javanese employers to clear forests to set up settlements in [[Johore]], Malaya (Roff, 1967:37). The activities with these bonded labourers continued until the 1920s. From 1886 till 1890, as many as 21,000 Javanese became bonded labourers with the Singapore Chinese Protectorate, an organisation formed by the British in 1877 to monitor the Chinese population. They performed manual labour in the rubber plantations. After their bond ended, they continued to open up the land and stayed on in Johore.

After the Second World War, the total number of Javanese coming to Singapore continued to increase. The first wave consisted of conscript labour that were brought by the Japanese and their numbers were estimated to be about 10,000 (Turnbull, 1976:216). The second wave were those who moved to Singapore through Malaya. The 1970 Population Census showed that a total of 21,324 Malays who were born in Malaya (later Malaysia) had moved to Singapore in the years 1946–1955; and as many as 29,679 moved to Singapore from 1956–1970 (Census 1970:262-3). Interviews conducted showed that a majority of them were young men of Javanese descent from Johore who wanted to find a better life in Singapore. Most of them were not educated and not highly skilled and worked as manual labourers in the post war years.

In the 2010 census, Malays of Javanese descent numbered 89,000.

===The Baweanese/Boyanese===
The Baweanese or Boyanese came from the [[Bawean Island]] in the Dutch East Indies. They built the Kampung Boyan (Boyanese Village) by the banks of the Rochor River, between Jalan Besar and Syed Alwi Road since the time of [[Munshi Abdullah]]. Most of them came to Singapore in the late 19th century until the end of Second World War. The majority of them worked as horse cart drivers and later as motorcar drivers. They could not be considered poor as their lands in Bawean were fertile; they had come in search of cash earnings. They wanted to purchase jewellery made of gold and goods that they could bring back to their villages. Some also wanted to build a better life for themselves in Singapore.

Most of them were young men who came and supported themselves, living in communal houses. There were several such houses built in Singapore. They were found in places like Adam Communal House in Ann Siang Hill, Teluk Dalam Communal House in Dixon Road and Dedawang Communal House in Sophie Road. There was also a village within the town area that was inhabited by the Baweanese called Kampung Kapur (literally 'Lime Village') in the western part of Kampung Boyan (Boyan Village). A mosque called the Masjid Bawean Kampung Kapur (Bawean Mosque of Lime Village) located at Weld Road was built in 1932. There was also a communal house that became the gathering point for writers and their friends from the literary group called Jejak Kembara (literally 'Wanderers' Steps') in the late 1970s.

Due to the fact that they shared the same religion and were closely related racially, both the Baweanese and the Javanese were able to mix freely and even intermarried with the Malays. In time, this caused the differences between them to be less obvious and more Baweanese and Javanese began identifying themselves as Malays.

===The Bugis===
[[File:Malay Heritage Centre, Istana Kampong Glam 5, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|Replica of a typical [[Pinisi]] or ''Perahu Bugis'' (lit Bugis vessel), the ancestors of many Malay Singaporeans of Bugis extraction arrived to the shores of Singapore by the Pinisi.]]
The [[Bugis]] came from [[Sulawesi]] Island in Indonesia. They were well known for a long time as maritime traders. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Bugis were spreading out from Celebes to set up trading centres throughout the region. Often they had to sail to distant lands and fight indigenous tribes. They rarely lost and acquired a reputation as fierce warriors.

The Dutch control of the Dutch East Indies and their blockades cut off the Bugis from their traditional spice trade routes from Celebes to Java. This forced them to migrate to other areas to continue trading. Their migration to what is today Malaysia and [[Riau Archipelago]] began around the 18th century or even earlier. Their influence in Riau was strong. Among the Bugis traders were also members of the nobility like Engku Karaeng Talibak who married the daughter of Raja Ali Haji. According to Raja Ali Haji in his work, ''Tuhfat al-Nafis'', the presence of Karaeng Talibak brought more Bugis traders to Riau. 

In 1819, conflicts between the Dutch and Bugis result in a number of Bugis leaving Riau, and soon after Raffles arrival to Singapore, a group of 500 Bugis led by Chieftain Arong Bilawa fled to Singapore.&lt;ref name="infopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-08-12_113516.html |title=Bugis community |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the first census in 1824, there were 1,951 Bugis recorded in Singapore, over 18% of the island’s population of 10,683.&lt;ref name="1823 census"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/2fb8948b-5f16-4a7a-8e3c-7a724e1eb6ad |title=First Census of Singapore is Taken |work=History SG }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The establishment of a free port in Singapore allowed the Bugis to expand their network in the archipelago. Sailing from Sumatra to north Australia, the Bugis ships brought cargoes of cotton cloth, gold dust, birds-of-paradise feathers, pepper, trepang (sea slugs), sandalwood, tortoiseshell, coffee, and rice to Singapore. Most of these goods were very much in demand by the Chinese merchants in Singapore. The Bugis also traded in slaves.

James Cameron gave a description in 1865 of the various ships that would visit Singapore's harbour. According to him, each year during October and November, the Bugis ships would come from [[Bali]] and the Celebes.

By the 1830s, the Bugis had established themselves in Singapore and formed the majority of the pioneer communities in the Kampung Gelam area. By 1831, the Census of Population reported over 2,000 Bugis in Singapore. The Bugis gradually formed kampongs and settlements in places like Kampung Bugis (around the Kallang River), Kampung Soopoo, Jalan Pelatok and Jalan Pergam. The number of Bugis however would decline as they lost their dominance in the sea trade, and by 1860, there were only about 900 Bugis left in Singapore.&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt;  Many of them also became assimilated into the larger Malay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |work=National Heritage Board |date=2002|title=Singapore's 100 Historic Places|publisher= Archipelago Press|isbn= 981-4068-23-3 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Bugis pioneers and historical figures are buried in [[Jalan Kubor Cemetery]].

===The Minangkabaus===
The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people came from Western [[Sumatra]]. The Minangkabaus are known for their matrilineal social system and their tradition for travelling. The Minangkabaus would leave their homes and travel in search of work, knowledge and experience. They would usually return home once they had fulfilled their objective. This tradition of travelling was a rite of passage for the young Minangkabau men and was considered a way for them to be in touch with the outside world.

The Minangkabaus have been migrating to Malaysia and Singapore since long ago. This only stopped when Malaya achieved independence from the British in 1957, when the immigration laws were tightened. The majority of Minangkabaus who came to Singapore came from Pariaman and Agam in Western Sumatra. The majority of them were engaged in business, especially in selling [[padang food]]. The Minangkabaus also sold religious items, toys and clothes. They had shops in Arab Street and Geylang. They also worked as taxi drivers and gardeners and joined uniformed services. Many Minangkabaus also worked as sailors on ships owned by trading companies. The Minangkabaus even formed an association at one time but this was subsequently banned during the 1962–66 [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]].

After Singapore became an independent state in 1965, the majority of Minangkabaus either migrated to Malaysia or returned to Sumatra. Those who stayed in Singapore assimilated into the Malay community. Not many Minangkabaus brought their wives or women with them to Singapore. As such, many married the local Malay women and did not maintain strong ties with the other Minangkabau communities. By 1973, it was estimated that there were 200 Minangkabaus family in Singapore and almost all of them were Singapore citizens.

===The Banjar===
The [[Banjar people|Banjar]] people originated from the southern and eastern coast of [[Kalimantan]] in Borneo. Most came from [[Banjarmasin]] in the area surrounding the Barito basin. These areas were used for the cultivation of paddy. The Banjarese who migrated to the Malay Peninsula were farmers who were experienced in paddy cultivation. They also migrated to spread Islam to the region, to escape poverty and the oppressive Dutch rule of their homeland. Some also wanted to escape the presence of wild animals that threatened their farms in Kalimantan.

The Banjarese generally did not like to be employees. They preferred to be self-employed, working as either farmers or businessmen. The Banjar were also well known as jewel cutters and dealers in the region. Many came to Singapore to deal in the jewellery trade and had their shops in Arab Street. They even formed a Kalimantan Association in Singapore.

The Banjarese made up a very small percentage of the Malay population in Singapore. In 1931, they numbered 445 out of a total Malay population of 65,104 (0.7%). In 1947, they formed only 0.3% of the population. This dropped to 0.2% in 1957 and 0.1% in 1970. By 1980 and 1990, the total numbers could not be determined, probably because the Banjarese have effectively assimilated into the Malay community.

===The Batak===
The [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] people are the smallest Malay group in Singapore. Up till 1978, there were less than 350 Bataks in Singapore. Unlike other Malay groups that are predominantly Muslim, there are many Christians in the Batak community ([[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]).

The Batak had been coming to Singapore before the 20th century. Not much is known about the Bataks that came to Singapore in the 19th century and before World War 2. Most were young men in their twenties who were from the [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]] and [[Angkola people]].
The Bataks came to Singapore for economic, educational and social reasons. Most of those who came to Singapore before the War had received their primary education in the Batak and Malay language. Some came to Singapore to continue their education in the private and Christian schools. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist organisation had students' amenities in Singapore in 1915 and they encouraged the Bataks from Sipirok, Angkola and Pematang Siantar in Sumatra to send their children to continue their studies in Singapore. An English education was prized as it was seen as a passport to getting a white-collar job in the plantations in Eastern Sumatra that were owned by the Dutch and the Americans. After receiving their education in Singapore, the Bataks would return to their homeland. Some would marry and bring their wives to Singapore. The Batak Christians were the first Bataks to bring their wives to Singapore.

Most of the Bataks who came before World War 2 worked as gardeners, peons and manual labourers. During the Japanese Occupation, the Bataks were conscripted as foot soldiers or forced labourers by the Japanese. Some were sent to Singapore for military training. After the War, many of the Bataks returned home. At the same time, many others came to Singapore from places like [[Medan]], [[Palembang]] and the Riau Islands. Some managed to find work as clerks, storekeepers and some started businesses with non-Bataks partners. Some also joined the British army as soldiers, technicians and electricians. Others started identifying themselves as Malays so that they could join the military or get jobs given to local Malays.

In 1947, the Bataks in Singapore formed a welfare organisation called ''Saroha'' ("one heart" in the Batak language). The aim of the organisation was to help the Bataks in Singapore. The organisation lasted until 1954 and was disbanded due to leadership problems and a lack of support from its members. Attempts to revive it later in 1958 proved futile.

There were Bataks who took Malay wives and converted to Islam. The majority of them and their descendants were assimilated into the Malay community and preferred to be known as Malays.

==Ethnic composition of Malay population 1931–1990==
The following figures show the composition of the various Malay ethnic population in Singapore for the past 60 years. The great increase shown in the other Malay groups, especially the Javanese, in 1990 is likely due to the increase in the employment of Indonesian domestic workers in Singapore.

According to the 2015 census,&lt;ref name="Singapore Census 2015"&gt;Statistics Singapore: [http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/GHS/ghs2015content 2015 General Household Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505143054/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications-and-papers/GHS/ghs2015content |date=5 May 2017 }}.

An overwhelming majority of Malays in Singapore are [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]] belonging to the [[Shafi'i|Shāfi'ī]] (شافعي) school of thought.

A very small Christian community also exists among the Malays, with 0.41% of Malays Singaporean. However, the government has strongly discouraged the publication of the Christian Bible in Malay, and strongly discourages missionaries from attempts to convert the local Malay populace. This was done so as not to cause racial and religious tensions in the predominantly Muslim community and because of [[Malay Islamic identity]], which Islam is ingrained in Malay culture.

There is also a small Buddhist community, mostly consisting of Malays with mixed Chinese ancestry (0.05%) and even there are Hindu minorities among the Malays with mixed Indian (Tamil) or [[Chitty]] ancestry (0.03%).

==Culture==
[[File:KITLV - 3653 - Lambert &amp; Co., G.R. - Singapore - Malay gamelan in the Straits Settlements - circa 1890.tif|thumb|[[Malay Gamelan]] in the [[Straits Settlements]], circa 1890.]]
The majority of Malays in Singapore generally share a similar culture with those in [[Peninsular Malaysia]].

Linguistically, most Malays in Singapore speak the Johore-Riau dialect of Malay that is similar to that spoken in the southern part of west Malaysian peninsular and the [[Riau]] islands of Indonesia. Some of the older generation who migrated here or whose parents were immigrants can speak Javanese. However, most of the Malays here do not speak the language of their ancestors from Indonesia.

Many Malays attend special religious schools known as [[Madrasahs in Singapore|Madrasahs,]] where students are instructed in [[Islamic theology]] alongside the national curriculum, however many Malays are educated in other secular institutions and attendance is not compulsory.

English is also widely spoken. Arabic is more common among the Muslim religious teachers, and is the preferred language learned by the more religious Malay Muslims.

==Status of Malays in Singapore==
Although many Malays in Singapore are generally of mixed descent, they are still recognised and considered as the indigenous people of Singapore by the Singapore Constitution, Part XIII, General Provisions, Minorities and special position of Malays, section 152:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notable Malay Singaporeans==
{{Main article|List of Malay Singaporeans|List of Singaporeans}}

For Malays in Singapore, the last name is [[patronymic]], not a family name. The person should be referred to by his or her first or second name which is the given name. The Malay word bin (b.) or binte (bte.), if used, means "son of" or "daughter of" respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4738">'''McRefugees''' is a [[neologism]] and [[McWords|McWord]] referring to those who stay overnight in a 24-hour [[McDonald's]] fast food restaurant.&lt;ref name="McRefugees in Hong Kong"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-05-01-mcrefugees_N.htm|title='McRefugees' in Hong Kong?|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first created in [[Japanese language]]: マック難民 (''makku nanmin'').&lt;ref name="livedoor 3101551"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3101551/|title=コーヒー1杯で「宿泊」 「マック難民」が急増|publisher=[[Livedoor]]|date=2007-03-30|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; That term had been largely replaced by ネットカフェ難民 (''nettokafe nanmin''), literally "[[net cafe refugee]]". In Japan, most McDonald's restaurants  are operated around the clock. Due to unemployment and high rents and [[transportation in Japan|transportation]] costs in Japan, McRefugees choose to stay at a McDonald's overnight.

The phenomenon and word spread to Hong Kong as 麥難民 (''mahk naahn màhn''),&lt;ref name="蘋果日報 4 30"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20070430/7052150|title=日式麥難民現象殺到香港|publisher=蘋果日報|date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; where some McRefugees play [[video games]] and are known as '''McGamers'''.&lt;ref name="McRefugees 20070501"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/McDs-shelters-McRefugees-20070501|title=McD's shelters 'McRefugees'|publisher=New24/[[Associated Press]]|date=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's opened 24-hour branches in [[mainland China]] in September 2006,&lt;ref name="Wang Danyang 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Danyang|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-06/02/content_9919930_2.htm|title=Homeless discover home comforts in restaurants|work=[[China Daily]]|date=2010-06-02|accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which quickly attracted McRefugees.&lt;ref name="Wang Danyang 2"/&gt;

In early October 2015, the death of a woman in a 24-hour Hong Kong McDonald’s restaurant in Kowloon Bay brought attention to the problem of McRefugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/06/a-homeless-woman-who-died-in-mcdonalds-was-among-hong-kongs-legions-of-mcrefugees/|title=In Hong Kong, a crowded restaurant, a death unnoticed and ‘McRefugees’|last=Wang|first=Yanan|date=2015-10-06|website=Washington Post|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; McRefugees can be found in other 24-hour branches as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34546807|title=The night time 'McRefugees' of Hong Kong|date=2015-10-27|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/mcrefugees-mcdonalds-shelters-hong-kongs-homeless-n462986|title='McRefugees': McDonald's Shelters Hong Kong's Homeless|newspaper=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more than 1,600 [[Homelessness|homeless]] people in Hong Kong in 2015, about 250 were McRefugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1899535/hong-kongs-shame-homeless-numbers-soar-amid-high|title=Hong Kong’s shame: homeless numbers soar amid high rents and squalid living conditions|last=Ng|first=Naomi|date=2016-01-09|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-04-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fourniret has been imprisoned numerous times since the age of 24.&lt;ref name="A newspaper article"&gt;[https://www.volkskrant.nl/buitenland/in-dutrouxs-schaduw-maar-net-zo-pervers~a886940/ A newspaper article] in the [[Volkskrant]] by Ariejan Korteweg, 27 March 2008 (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison he met his future (third) wife Monique Olivier. They married on 28 July 1989. Olivier was aware of Fourniret's activities and became his accomplice. They divorced in prison on 2 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/les-epoux-fourniret-ont-divorce-20-01-2011-1234986.php Les époux Fourniret ont divorcé] ''[[Le Parisien]]'', 20 janvier 2011 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourniret was arrested at his home in Sart-Custinne, Belgium, on 26 June 2003 after a failed attempt to kidnap a 13-year-old girl. He and Olivier were interrogated extensively but to no avail.&lt;ref name="A newspaper article"/&gt; A year later, Olivier told the police that her husband had killed a number of people since 1987. Fourniret confessed to killing eight females—aged between 12 and 30—and a man who has never been identified. The bodies of four of the identified victims had been discovered in France and Belgium between 1988 and 2002. Olivier was arrested and she and Fourniret and Olivier were [[Extradition|extradited]] to France, where they helped police to find the bodies of three of the four missing victims over the next two years. The trial took place in [[Charleville-Mézières]] between 27 March&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7311104.stm|title=French 'serial killer' on trial |publisher=BBC|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 28 May 2008. Fourniret was found guilty of the murders of all seven of the victims whose bodies had been found. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Olivier was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 28 years for complicity.&lt;ref name="BBCsentence"&gt;{{cite web |title=Life sentence for French killer |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7423703.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourniret and Olivier were also ordered to pay 1.5 million euros in moral compensation to family members of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.demorgen.be/buitenland/fourniret-moet-1-5-miljoen-schadevergoeding-betalen-b3dfc501/ Article] on the website of [[De Morgen]], published 29 May 2008 (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; Neither appealed their sentences.

In February 2018, Fourniret confessed to killing two more women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On 16 November 2018, Fourniret and Olivier were convicted of the murder of Farida Hammiche, the last of the eight females that Fourniret had confessed to killing in 2004. Fourniret was given a second life sentence and Olivier was sentenced to a further twenty years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Confessed murders ==
[[File:Chateau Sautou.jpg|thumb|200px|The bodies of two victims, Elisabeth Brichet and Jeanne-Marie Desramault, were found buried in the gardens of the Château du Sautou in [[Donchery]] in July 2004. Fourniret and Olivier bought the château in the late 1980s using stolen money.]]
Fourniret admitted to eight murders prior to his trial in 2008. He was convicted of seven of these and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/05/28/michel-fourniret-et-monique-olivier-condamnes-a-la-perpetuite_1050939_3224.html|title=Michel Fourniret et Monique Olivier condamnés à la perpétuité|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 1987, Fourniret and Olivier drove, in separate vehicles, to [[Auxerre]]. Seeing 17-year-old Isabelle Laville – whom the couple had seen a day or two earlier and were targeting – walking home from school, Olivier stopped to ask her to join her in the car and give her directions, which Laville agreed to do. Driving down the road, Olivier reached the spot where Fourniret was standing with his car, pretending it had broken down. After she, as planned, pretended to offer him a lift, he got into her car. Fourniret choked Laville with a piece of rope, before Olivier sedated her with [[Rohypnol]]. The couple brought the girl to their home in [[Saint-Cyr-les-Colons]], where Fourniret raped and strangled her. Laville's body was thrown down a disused well in [[Bussy-en-Othe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/04/03/proces-fourniret-le-calvaire-planifie-d-isabelle-laville-la-honte-de-monique-olivier_1030534_3224.html|title=Procès Fourniret : le calvaire planifié d'Isabelle Laville, la "honte" de Monique Olivier|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.francesoir.fr/actualite/societe/proces-fourniret-monique-olivier-raconte-mort-d-isabelle-laville-25250.html|title=Procès Fourniret – Monique Olivier raconte la mort d'Isabelle Laville|work=France Soir.fr|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remains were recovered from the well on 11 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2006/07/12/fourniret-sa-premiere-victime-retrouvee-au-fond-d-un-puits_45854|title=Fourniret : sa première victime retrouvée au fond d'un puits.|work=Libération.fr|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1988, Fourniret was contacted by 30-year-old&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.estrepublicain.fr/actualite/2018/11/16/michel-ne-me-tue-pas-comme-ca|title=Procès Fourniret : "Michel, ne me tue pas comme ça"|access-date=2018-11-18|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farida Hammiche, the wife of Jean-Pierre Hellegouarch, an imprisoned bank robber with whom he had shared a cell prior to his release in October 1987, and asked to help unearth a loot from a cemetery in [[Fontenay-en-Parisis]], which had been stolen by members of the ''[[Gang des postiches]]''. After they managed to retrieve the loot, which consisted of gold ingots and coins, Hammiche gave Fourniret a share worth 500,000 [[francs]] for helping her dig it up and hiding it in her apartment in [[Vitry-sur-Seine]]. A few weeks later, on 12 April, aiming to steal the rest of the loot, Fourniret and Olivier lured Hammiche out of her home and drove her to [[Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines]], where she was strangled and her body buried, before the couple broke into her home and stole the loot. They used the money they made from it to buy a château called the Château du Sautou in [[Donchery]]. Hamiche's body was never found.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By August, Olivier was heavily pregnant with Fourniret's baby. On 3 August, the couple drove to a supermarket in [[Châlons-sur-Marne]] (now Châlons-en-Champagne), and encountered 20-year-old Fabienne Leroy in the car park. With Olivier feigning illness, the couple asked Leroy to join them in their car and give them directions to a doctor's surgery. After she got in, they drove to a forest near the [[Camp de Châlons|military camp]] of [[Mourmelon-le-Grand]]. Fourniret ordered Olivier to look at Leroy's hymen to see if it was still intact, but she refused. After raping Leroy, Fourniret shot her in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/societe/20080407.OBS8486/le-couple-fourniret-reconnait-le-meurtre-de-fabienne-leroy.html|title=Le couple Fourniret reconnaît le meurtre de Fabienne Leroy|work=L'Obs|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/08/01001-20080408ARTFIG00045-la-brutalite-du-pacte-des-fourniret-glace-les-assises.php|title=La brutalité du "pacte" des Fourniret glace les assises|date=8 April 2008|work=Le Figaro|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr-FR|issn=0182-5852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/04/08/le-couple-fourniret-livre-des-souvenirs-differents-de-ses-crimes-communs_1032253_3224.html|title=Le couple Fourniret livre des souvenirs différents de ses crimes communs|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, Fourniret met 21-year-old Jeanne-Marie Desramault&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aiavi.fr/fiche.php?p=9&amp;fiche=044|title=Disparition-Espoir : Avis de Recherche|website=www.aiavi.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/une-terrible-mise-en-accusation-51b7307de4b0de6db9750de6|title=Une terrible mise en accusation|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the evening train to [[Charleville-Mézières]]. The two conversed before arriving in Charleville, where Desramault was staying at a convent. She met the couple, who had assumed false identities, at the train station again on Saturday, 18 March, and they invited her to come to their house in [[Floing, Ardennes|Floing]] – an offer she accepted – and Fourniret promised he would drive her home afterwards. After they got to Floing, Fourniret asked Desramault if she was a virgin, and she told him she wasn't and had a boyfriend. Enraged, he attacked her.

Fourniret and Olivier married in July 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/03/26/le-pacte-criminel-du-couple-fourniret-olivier_1027454_3224.html|title=Le "pacte criminel" du couple Fourniret-Olivier|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the afternoon of 20 December, they drove across the Franco-Belgian border to [[Saint-Servais, Belgium|Saint-Servais]], [[Namur]], with their one-year-old son. Fourniret saw 12-year-old Elisabeth Brichet walk to a friend's house, and waited outside for her until she left to walk the short distance home just before 7 pm. He asked her to give him directions to a doctor's surgery for his son. She agreed to do so, and the couple drove back to Floing with her. When Fourniret undressed the girl, he saw that she was on her period, so Olivier cleaned Brichet's genitals. The next day, the couple took her to the château, where Fourniret strangled her after a failed attempted to suffocate her with a plastic bag. Her body was buried in the garden of the château, near to that of Jeanne-Marie Desramault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rtl.be/info/monde/france/fourniret-conteste-la-tentative-de-viol-sur-elisabeth-brichet-regardez-les-videos-43520.aspx|title=Fourniret conteste la tentative de viol sur Elisabeth Brichet: regardez les vidéos|last=Newmedia|first=RTL|work=RTL Info|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/04/16/devant-les-assises-des-ardennes-l-aveu-en-differe-du-meurtre-d-elisabeth_1034982_3224.html|title=Devant les assises des Ardennes, l'aveu en différé du meurtre d'Elisabeth|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2008/04/15/monique-olivier-j-ai-termine-la-toilette_18474|title=Monique Olivier: "J'ai terminé la toilette"|work=Libération.fr|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a number of reported sightings of Brichet, in Belgium and abroad, in the years following her disappearance, and a number of people were suspected by police of abducting her, including [[Marc Dutroux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavenir.net/cnt/120686|title=Élisabeth Brichet : quinze années d'espoirs déçus|work=Communes, régions, Belgique, monde, sports – Toute l'actu 24h/24 sur Lavenir.net|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/elisabeth-brichet-quatorze-ans-d-enquete-de-doutes-et-de-suspicions-51b884b9e4b0de6db9aa8a1d|title=Elisabeth Brichet : quatorze ans d'enquête, de doutes et de suspicions|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dutroux's arrest in 1996, Brichet's mother Marie-Noëlle Bouzet helped to organise the [[White March]] in honour of Belgium's missing and murdered children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/la-marche-blanche-qui-a-bouleverse-la-belgique-c-etait-un-grand-moment-d-emotion-5807a0cccd701ccd4d7d1b59|title=La marche blanche qui a bouleversé la Belgique : "C'était un grand moment d'émotion"|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of Brichet and Desramault were exhumed from the gardens of the Château du Sautou on 3 July 2004, after Fourniret and Olivier confessed to the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2004/07/04/259831-deux-cadavres-au-chateau.html|title=Deux cadavres au château|work=ladepeche.fr|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final known murder Fourniret committed with Olivier's help took place on 21 November 1990 near France's western coast. The couple drove to a shopping centre in [[Rezé]] after leaving court in [[Nantes]], where they had been convicted of burglary. They saw Natacha Danais, a 13-year-old local, walking through the car park towards her home, having been sent to fetch her mother's forgotten purse. They lured her into the van, asking her for directions. After driving to a secluded area near the coast, Fourniret stabbed Danais twice in the chest with a screwdriver and strangled her before leaving her body on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/17/01001-20080417ARTFIG00003-fourniret-a-tue-natacha-ans-en-sortant-du-tribunal-.php|title=Fourniret a tué Natacha,13 ans, en sortant du tribunal|date=17 April 2008|work=Le Figaro|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr-FR|issn=0182-5852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/sitot-sortis-du-tribunal-les-fourniret-enlevent-natacha-17-04-2008-3298443574.php|title=Sitôt sortis du tribunal, les Fourniret enlèvent Natacha|last=|first=|date=17 April 2008|work=leparisien.fr|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later investigation suggested that the girl's body was raped after the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/nantes/226142-20080418-revelations-insoutenables-proces-michel-fourniret|title=Révélations insoutenables  au procès de Michel Fourniret|website=www.20minutes.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days after Danais's death, Jean Groix, a neighbour of her family, was arrested after a white van belonging to him matched the description of the van that her sister had vaguely seen her get into from across the shopping centre's car park at the time she disappeared. Groix was found to be lodging suspected members of the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in his home; police suspected that Danais had found out about this. Two months later, Groix committed suicide in his prison cell.

The Fourniret family moved to Sart-Custinne, [[Gedinne]], Belgium, in the early 1990s. Michel Fourniret admitted that he committed two more murders in France between 2000 and 2001, after a ten-year break. He drove alone across the Franco-Belgian border to Charleville-Mézières on 16 May 2000 and accosted 18-year-old Céline Saison, who was on her way home from school, in the late afternoon. Driving with her back to Belgium, he blackmailed her into having sex with him before strangling her with a rope and dumping her body in a forest in Sugny, [[Vresse-sur-Semois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/france-archive/2008/04/24/michel-fourniret-j-ai-ete-a-la-chasse-et-j-ai-obtenu-satisfaction_70357|title=Michel Fourniret : "J'ai été à la chasse et j'ai obtenu satisfaction"|work=Libération.fr|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saison's skeletal remains were discovered there by mushroom pickers on 22 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhnet.be/actu/faits/celine-serait-morte-etouffee-51b7d9fae4b0de6db991b8c8|title=Céline serait morte étouffée|last=DH.be|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 2001, Fourniret drove back to France – this time to his birthplace of [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] – and met Mananya Thumpong, a 13-year-old girl of Thai origin whom he had met and given a lift home a few weeks earlier, outside the local library. He invited her to come to his house and play with his son. Accepting this offer, Thumpong climbed into the car and was driven to Nollevaux, [[Paliseul]], where Fourniret strangled her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/04/30/la-mort-de-la-petite-asiatique-reperee-par-michel-fourniret_1040122_3224.html|title=La mort de la "petite Asiatique" repérée par Michel Fourniret|website=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Actualite/Le-dernier-aveu-de-Fourniret-93775|title=Le dernier aveu de Fourniret|last=JDD|first=Le|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.francesoir.fr/actualite/societe/proces-fourniret-derniere-semaine-d%E2%80%99examen-des-crimes-25882.html|title=Procès Fourniret – Dernière semaine d’examen des crimes|work=France Soir.fr|access-date=17 February 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body lay undiscovered for months in a nearby forest as it was devoured almost entirely by wild animals.

In February 2018, Fourniret confessed to killing two more women in Auxerre: Marie-Angèle Domèce, an 18-year-old disabled woman,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/024000181.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in July 1988, and [[Murder of Joanna Parrish|Joanna Parrish]], a 20-year-old British student, in May 1990.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{colorbox|lightgreen}} indicates victims whose murders Fourniret was convicted of.

== Other crimes ==
Two French journalists have suggested that Fourniret killed former Minister for Labour [[Robert Boulin]] (who was involved in a real estate scandal at the time), based on a letter Fourniret wrote to Olivier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.francesoir.fr/actualite/societe/fourniret-s%E2%80%99accuse-du-meurtre-robert-boulin-24084.html Article] in ''[[France Soir]]'', published 20 February 2008 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Ranucci]] was one of the last persons executed in France, having been convicted of the abduction and murder, committed on 3 June 1974, of Marie-Dolorès Rambla, aged eight. There are suspicions that Ranucci may not actually have been the killer (although he confessed, his confession was later retracted). It has been suggested that Fourniret may have been involved as Fourniret was in the area at the time and had practically the same car as Ranucci. Analysis of photographs, however, suggest that the man in photographs produced as evidence could not have been Fourniret.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20060704.OBS3967/fourniret-n-etait-pasau-proces-ranucci.html Article] in [[L'Obs]], published 4 July 2006 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Virgin hunter"==
Fourniret was also named the "Virgin hunter". Although it is unclear where this nickname came from, it is alleged that Olivier promised Fourniret to help hunt "virgins" for sport, in return for Fourniret helping Olivier to murder her first husband (which never took place).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/28/france.internationalcrime ''French court jails serial killer and wife''] by 
Angelique Chrisafis in [[The Guardian]] on 28 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The rape of women assumed to be virgins, is a recurring theme in the way Fourniret operated, something which he considered "sport".

==Legacy==
[[Rachida Dati]] the then French Minister for Justice, who advocated legal reforms in France, wanted a more relaxed attitude to preventative custody and parole under supervision. She was heavily criticised by the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/1012208.html?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1012208 Mme Dati affronte un mécontentement croissant sur la carte judiciaire]'' in [[le Monde]] by Gilles Kerdreux, published 11 Novembre 2007 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; The question was asked how Fourniret, who was a known criminal, could have carried on for such a long time without being noticed and how the changes in the law would have a positive influence on cases like these.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">'''Mirawdale, Mirawdeli ميراو ده لي''' also known as Agha, Axa or written as [[Mirawdeli]] is a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribe in [[Iraq]]i [[Kurdistan]]. The tribe has an estimated 5000+ families, and they are mainly located in the Peshdar area on the border of [[Iran]]ian Kurdistan. Some are located in Iranian Kurdistan near the town of [[Sardasht, West Azerbaijan|Sardasht]]. The Influence of the family within the Kurdish Region of Iraq has been widely noted and their history dates back to the [[Zoroastrian]] times.

Kamal Mirawdale, a Political Analyst, Author and Poet, son of the great well known Poet Mammand Aghai ("Fanie") who is well known in Kurdistan was one of the Iraqi Kurdistan Presidential candidates in 2009. Kamal Mirawdeli received majority of votes in the [[Sulaymaniyah|Sulaimaniya]] and [[Diana, Iraq|Soran]] regions.

==History==
Hamad Agha is considered the father of the tribe and had married a Russian woman later having 14 sons.

In the early 1990s the tribe was in conflict with other tribes in the Kurdish Region,after a huge fight they controlled the majority of Pshder , but unfortunately the Government at that helped the other tribes to control Mirawdelie's Area while we were always helping the government and ruled half of Kurdistan for a decades .as a result many influential Mirawdale members  fled to the border of Iran where they stayed for nearly 3 years.

Since the late 1990s, some of Mirawdalies with NGOs and other groups sought refuge from Iraqi Kurdistan due to the political and financial situation in the area and they are now mostly settled in [[Europe]], the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=1218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Due to the political and financial situation in Iraqi Kurdistan, numbers of the tribe fled the country and they were mainly in their early 20s which had high impact to the financial situation and they are still settled in the countries they went to.

== Ethnonym ==

The Pechenegs were mentioned as ''Bjnak'', ''Bjanak'' or ''Bajanak'' in medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts, as ''Be-ča-nag'' in [[Classical Tibetan]] documents, as ''Pačanak-i'' in works written in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and as ''Pacinnak'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=93}} [[Anna Komnene]] and other Byzantine authors referred to them as ''Patzinakoi'' or ''Patzinakitai''.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=93}} In [[medieval Latin]] texts, the Pechenegs were referred to as ''Pizenaci'', ''Bisseni'' or ''Bessi''.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=93}} [[East Slavic peoples]] use the terms ''Pečenegi'' or ''Pečenezi'', while the [[Poles]] mention them as ''Pieczyngowie'' or ''Piecinigi''.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=93}} The Hungarian word for Pecheneg is ''besenyő''; the Romanian term is "Pecenegi"{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=93}} The [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] word for "brother-in-law” (''baja'', ''baja-naq'' or ''bajinaq''), implying that it initially referred to an "in-law related clan or tribe".{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=93}}{{sfn|Golden|2003|p=I.64}}

Three of the eight Pecheneg "provinces" or clans were collectively known as Kangars.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=182}} According to [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the Kangars received this denomination because "they are more valiant and noble than the rest" of the people "and that is what the title Kangar signifies".{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=182}}&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 37), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; For no Turkic word with similar meaning is known, [[Ármin Vámbéry]] connected the ethnonym to the [[Kirghiz language|Kirghiz]] words ''kangir'' ("agile"), ''kangirmak'' ("to go out riding") and ''kani-kara'' ("black-blooded"), while [[Carlile Aylmer Macartney]] associated it with the [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] word ''gang'' ("chariot").{{sfn|Macartney|1968|pp=104-105}} [[Omeljan Pritsak]] proposed that the name had initially been a composite term ''(Kängär As)'' deriving from the [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] word for stone ''(kank)'' and the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ethnonym ''As''.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=213}} If the latter assumption is valid, the Kangars' ethnonym suggests that Iranian elements contributed to the formation of the Pecheneg people.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=94}}

== Language ==
{{Main|Pecheneg language}}
[[Mahmud al-Kashgari]], an 11th-century man of letters specialized in Turkic dialects argued that the language spoken by the Pechenegs was a variant of the [[Cuman language|Cuman]] and [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] idioms.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=95}} He suggested that foreign influences on the Pechenegs gave rise to phonetical differences between their tongue and the idiom spoken by other Turkic peoples.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=181}} Anna Komnene likewise stated that the Pechenegs and the Cumans shared a common language.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=95}} Although the Pecheneg language itself died out centuries ago,{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=343}} the names of the Pecheneg "provinces" recorded by Constantine Porphyrogenitus prove that the Pechenegs spoke a Turkic language.{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=239}} The [[Huns]], [[Khazars]] and Pechenegs are thought to have belonged to the same [[proto-Turkic]] group of languages as the modern [[Chuvash language]] ([[Oghur languages|Oghur]] dialects).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=9udBAAAAYAAJ Ukraine: a concise encyclopaedia, Volume 1], pg. 929. Published for the Ukrainian National Association, University of Toronto Press 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins ===

[[Paul Pelliot]] originated the proposal that the ''[[Book of Sui]]''{{mdash}}a 7th-century Chinese work{{mdash}}preserved the earliest record on the Pechenegs.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=211}} The book mentioned the ''Pei-ju'' people who had settled near the ''En-ch'u'' and ''A-lan'' peoples (identified as [[Onogurs]] and [[Alans]], respectively), to the east of ''Fu-lin'' (or the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]).{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=211}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=113}} [[Victor Spinei]] emphasizes that the Pechenegs' association with the ''Pei-ju'' is "uncertain".{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=113}} He proposes that a 8th-century Uighur envoy's report, which survives in Tibetan translation,{{sfn|Róna-Tas|1999|p=235}} contains the first certain reference to the Pechenegs.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=113}} The report recorded an armed conflict between the ''Be-ča-nag'' and the ''[[Uar|Hor]]'' (or [[Ouzes|Ouze]]) peoples in the region of the river [[Syr Darya]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=113}}

[[Ibn Khordadbeh]] (c. 820 – 912 CE), [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] (11th century), [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (1100–1165), and many other [[Muslim]] scholars agree that the Pechenegs belonged to the Turkic peoples.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=182}} The ''[[Russian Primary Chronicle]]'' stated that the "Torkmens, Pechenegs, [[Torks]], and [[Polovci]]ans" descended from "the godless sons of [[Ishmael]], who had been sent as a chastisement to the Christians".{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=186}}&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Primary Chronicle'' (year 6604/1096), p. 184)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omeljan Pritsak]] says that the Pechenegs' homeland was located between the [[Aral Sea]] and the middle course of the Syr Darya, along the important trade routes connecting Central Asia with Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|pp=211-212}} The [[Orkhon inscriptions]] listed the Kangars among the subject peoples of the [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate]].{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=211}}

=== Westward migration ===

The [[Turkic Khaganate]] collapsed in 744 which gave rise to a series of inter-tribal confrontations in the [[Eurasian steppes]].{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=212}} The [[Karluks]] attacked the [[Oghuz Turks]], forcing them to launch a westward migration towards the Pechenegs' lands.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=212}} The Uighur envoy's report testifies that the Oghuz and Pecheneg waged war against each other already in the 8th century, most probably for the control of the trade routes.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=212}} The Oghuz made an alliance with the Karluks and [[Kimaks]] and defeated the Pechenegs and their allies in a battle near the Lake Aral before 850, according to the 10th-century scholar, [[Al-Masudi]].{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=212}} Most Pechenegs launched a new migration towards the [[Volga River]], but some groups were forced to join the Oghuz.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=212}} The latter formed the 19th tribe of the Oghuz tribal federation in the 11th century.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|pp=212}}{{sfn|Golden|2003|p=I.64}}

The Pechenegs who leaved their homeland settled between the [[Ural River|Ural]] and Volga rivers.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=213}} Their new territory was quite large, with a 30-day-walk extension, according to Muslim sources.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=213}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=114}} Their territory bordered on the [[Khazars]], Slavs, [[Cumans]] and Ouzes.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=114}} The Pechenegs made regular raids against their neighbors and sold their captives.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=114}} The Khazars made an alliance with the Ouzes against the Pechenegs and they invaded the Pechenegs' land from two directions.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|pp=213}} The double attack forced the Pechenegs into a new westward migration.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|pp=213}} They marched across the Khazar Khaganate and expelled the Magyars from the lands along the [[Kuban River]] and the upper course of the river [[Donets]].{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|pp=213}} The ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]''{{mdash}}a late 10th-century Persian geography{{mdash}}distinguished two Pecheneg groups, referreing to those who lived along the Donets as "Turkic Pechenegs", and to those along the Kuban as "Khazarian Pechenegs".{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|pp=213}} The latter denominations implies that some Pecheneg tribes had been forced to acknowledge the Khazars supremacy.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=113}}

According to [[Gardizi]] and other Muslim scholars who based their works on 9th-century sources, the Pechenegs' new territories were bordered by the [[Cumans]], [[Khazars]], Oghuz Turks and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]].{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=114}}{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}} The same sources also narrate that the Pechenegs regularly waged war against the Khazars and the latter's vassals, the [[Burtas]].{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}}{{sfn|Spinei|2003|pp=113-114}} The Khazars and the Oghuz Turks made an alliance against the Pechenegs and attacked them.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=138}}{{Citation not found}} Outnumbered by the enemy, the Pechenegs started a new migration, invaded the dwelling places of the [[Hungarians]] and forced them to leave.{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=138}}{{Citation not found}}{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}} There is no consensual date for this second migration of the Pechenegs: Pritsak argues that it took place around 830,{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}} but Kristó suggests that it could hardly occur before the 850s.{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=144}}{{Citation not found}} The Pechenegs settled along the rivers [[Seversky Donets River|Donets]] and [[Kuban River|Kuban]].{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}}

It is plausible that the distinction between the "Turkic Pechenegs" and "Khazar Pechenegs" mentioned in the 10th-century ''[[Hudud al-'alam]]'' had its origin in this period.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}} Spinei proposes that the latter denomination most probably refers to Pecheneg groups accepting Khazar suzerainty.{{sfn|Spinei|2003|p=113}} In addition to these two branches, a third group of Pechenegs existed in this period: Constantine Porphyrogenitus and [[Ibn Fadlan]] mention that those who decided not to leave their homeland were incorporated into the Oghuz federation of Turkic tribes.{{sfn|Golden|2003|p=I.64}}{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}} However, it is uncertain whether this groups' formation is connected to the Pechenegs' first or second migration (as it is proposed by Pritsak and Golden, respectively).{{sfn|Golden|2003|p=I.64}}{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}} According to Mahmud al-Kashgari, one of the ''[[Oghuz Turks#Traditional tribal organization|Üçok]]'' clans of the Oghuz Turks{{sfn|Atalay|2006|p=I.57}} was still formed by Pechenegs in the 1060s.{{sfn|Pritsak|1975|p=214}}

{{Quote|Originally, the Pechenegs had their dwelling on the river Atil (Volga), and likewise on the river Geïch, having common frontiers with the Chazars and the so-called Uzes. But fifty years ago the so-called Uzes made common cause with the Chazars and joined battle with the Pechenegs and prevailed over them and expelled them from their country, which the so-called Uzes have occupied till this day. [...] At the time when the Pechenegs were expelled from their country, some of them of their own will and personal decision stayed behind there and united with the so-called Uzes, and even to this day they live among them, and wear such distinguishing marks as separate them off and betray their origin and how it came about that they were split off from their own folk: for their tunics are short, reaching to the knee, and their sleeves are cut off at the shoulder, whereby, you see, they indicate that they have been cut off from their own folk and those of their race.|[[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]]: ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 37), pp. 167., 169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name ''Beçenek'' is given two meanings. The first is "a Turkish nation living around the country of [[Rome|the Rum]]", where ''Rum'' was the Turkish word for  the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire). Kashgari's second definition of ''Beçenek'' is "a branch of [[Oghuz Turks]]"; he subsequently described the Oghuz as being formed of 22 branches, of which the 19th branch was named ''Beçenek''. [[Max Vasmer]] derives this name from the Turkic word for "brother-in-law, relative" ({{lang-tk|bacanak}} and {{lang-tr|bacanak}}).

By the 9th and 10th centuries, they controlled much of the steppes of southeast [[Europe]] and the [[Crimean Peninsula]].  Although an important factor in the region at the time, like most nomadic tribes their concept of statecraft failed to go beyond random attacks on neighbours and spells as mercenaries for other powers.

According to [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], writing in c. 950, Patzinakia, the Pecheneg realm, stretched west as far as the [[Siret River]] (or even the Eastern [[Carpathian Mountains]]), and was four days distant from "Tourkias" (i.e. [[Hungary]]).{{Quote|The whole of Patzinakia is divided into eight provinces with the same number of great princes. The provinces are these: the name of the first province is Irtim; of the second, Tzour; of the third, Gyla; of the fourth, Koulpeï; of the fifth, Charaboï; of the sixth, Talmat; of the seventh, Chopon; of the eighth, Tzopon. At the time at which the Pechenegs were expelled from their country, their princes were, in the province of Irtim, Baïtzas; in Tzour, Kouel; in Gyla, Kourkoutai; in Koulpeï, Ipaos; in Charaboï, Kaïdoum; in the province of Talmat, Kostas; in Chopon, Giazis; in the province of Tzopon, Batas.|[[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogenitus]]: ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 37), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Omeljan Pritsak]], the Pechenegs are descendants from the ancient [[Kangly|Kangars]] who originate from [[Tashkent]].

== In Armenian sources ==

In the Armenian chronicles of [[Matthew of Edessa]] Pechenegs are mentioned a couple of times.  The first mention is in chapter 75, where it says that in the year 499 (according to the old Armenian calendar — years 1050–51 according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]) the ''Badzinag'' nation caused great destruction in many provinces of Rome, i.e. the [[Byzantine]] territories. The second is in chapter 103, which is about the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. In that chapter it is told that the allies of Rome, ''Padzunak'' and ''Uz'' (some branches of the [[Oghuz Turks]]) tribes which changed their sides at the peak of the battle and began fighting against the [[Byzantine]] forces, side by side with the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In the 132nd chapter a war between Rome and the ''Padzinags'' is described and after the defeat of the Roman (Byzantine) Army, an unsuccessful siege of [[Constantinople]] by the ''Padzinags'' is mentioned. In that chapter, the ''Patzinags'' are described as an "all archer army". In chapter 299, the Armenian prince, ''Vasil'', who was in the Roman Army, sent a platoon of ''Padzinags'' (they had settled in the city of Misis, around modern [[Adana]], which is far away from the lands where Pechenegs were then mainly living) to the aid of the Christians.&lt;!--sorry, I can't parse this; we need a critical evaluation: may Matthew's evidence be trusted? --&gt;

== Alliance with Byzantium ==
[[File:63-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|Sviatoslav enters Bulgaria with Pecheneg allies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tania Velmans]] Three Notes On Miniatures In The Chronicle of Manasses Macedonian Studies https://archive.org/details/ProblemsOfByzantineHistoriographyThreeNotesOnMiniaturesInThe&lt;/ref&gt; from the Constantine Manasses Chronicle.]]

In the 9th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] became allied with the Pechenegs, using them to fend off other, more dangerous tribes such as [[Kievan Rus']] and the [[Magyars]].

The Uzes, another [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] steppe people, eventually expelled the Pechenegs from their homeland; in the process, they also seized most of their livestock and other goods. An alliance of [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]], [[Kimeks]], and [[Karluks]] was also pressing the Pechenegs, but another group, the [[Samanid]]s, defeated that alliance. Driven further west by the [[Khazars]] and [[Cuman people|Cumans]] by 889, the Pechenegs in turn drove the Magyars west of the [[Dnieper]] River by 892.

[[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Tsar Simeon I]] employed the Pechenegs to help fend off the Magyars. The Pechenegs were so successful that they drove out the Magyars remaining in [[Etelköz]] and the [[Pontic steppes]], forcing them westward   towards the [[Pannonian plain]], where they later founded the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian state]].

== Late history and decline ==

In the 9th century the Pechenegs began a period of wars against [[Kievan Rus']]. For more than two centuries they had launched raids into the lands of Rus', which sometimes escalated into full-scale wars (like the 920 war on the Pechenegs by [[Igor of Kiev]], reported in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]''). The Pecheneg wars against Kievan Rus' caused the Slavs from Walachian territories to gradually migrate north of the Dniestr in the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;V. Klyuchevsky, The course of the Russian history. v.1: "Myslʹ.1987, {{ISBN|5-244-00072-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rus'/Pecheneg temporary military alliances also occurred however, as during the Byzantine campaign in 943 led by Igor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Haukal]] describes the Pechenegs as the long-standing allies of the Rus', whom they invariably accompanied during the 10th century [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus|Caspian expeditions]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 968 the Pechenegs [[Siege of Kiev (968)|attacked and besieged Kiev]]; some joined the Prince of Kiev, [[Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev|Sviatoslav I]], in his Byzantine campaign of 970–971, though eventually they ambushed and killed the Kievan prince in 972.  According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', the Pecheneg [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kurya (khan)|Kurya]] made a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] from Sviatoslav's skull, in accordance with the custom of [[steppe]] nomads.  The fortunes of the Rus'-Pecheneg confrontation swung during the reign of [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] (990–995), who founded the town of [[Pereyaslav]] upon the site of his victory over the Pechenegs,&lt;ref&gt;The chronicler explains the town's name, derived from the Slavic word for "retake", by the fact that Vladimir "retook" the military glory from the Pechenegs.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the defeat of the Pechenegs during the reign of [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] in 1036. Shortly thereafter, other nomadic peoples replaced the weakened Pechenegs in the [[Pontic steppe]]: the [[Cuman people|Cumans]] and the [[Torks]]. According to [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] (''History of Ukraine-Ruthenia''), after its defeat near Kiev the Pecheneg Horde  moved towards the [[Danube]], crossed the river, and disappeared out of the [[Pontic steppes]].
[[File:MadridSkylitzesFol173ra.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Pechenegs slaughter the "skyths" of [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]].]]

After centuries of fighting involving all their neighbours—the Byzantine Empire, [[Bulgaria]], Kievan Rus', Khazaria, and the Magyars—the Pechenegs were annihilated as an independent force  in 1091 at the [[Battle of Levounion]] by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army under Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]]. Alexios I recruited the defeated Pechenegs, whom he settled in the district of [[Moglena]] (today in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) into a [[Tagma (military)|tagma]] "of the Moglena Pechenegs".&lt;ref&gt;Haldon, John, ''Warfare, State And Society In The Byzantine World 560-1204'', Routledge, 2002, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Attacked again in 1094 by the Cumans, many Pechenegs were slain or absorbed. The Byzantines defeated the Pechenegs again at the [[Battle of Beroia]] in 1122, on the territory of modern-day Bulgaria. For some time, significant communities of Pechenegs still remained in the Kingdom of Hungary. With time the Balkan Pechenegs lost their national identity and became fully assimilated, mostly with [[Magyars]] and [[Bulgarians]].

In the 12th century, according to Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos]], the Pechenegs fought as [[mercenaries]] for the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in [[Catepanate of Italy|southern Italy]] against the [[Normans|Norman]] [[king of Sicily]], [[William I of Sicily|William the Bad]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinnamos, IV, 4, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Pechenegs was present at the battle of [[Andria, Italy|Andria]] in 1155.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ferdinand Chalandon|Chalandon]] (1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pechenegs were last mentioned in 1168 as members of Turkic tribes known in the chronicles as the "[[Chorni Klobuky]] (Black Hats)".&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Katchanovski, Zenon E. Kohut, Bohdan Y. Nebesio, Myroslav Yurkevich, ''Historical Dictionary of Ukraine'', Scarecrow Press, 2013, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 15th-century Hungary, some people adopted the surname ''Besenyö'' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] for "Pecheneg"); they were most numerous in the [[county of Tolna]]. One of the earliest introductions of [[Islam]] into [[Eastern Europe]] came about through the work of an early 11th-century Muslim prisoner who was captured by the Byzantines.  The Muslim prisoner was brought into the [[Bosnia (region)|Besenyö]] territory of the Pechenegs, where he taught and converted individuals to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O45CAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+walker+arnold+preaching&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vh74TLilEIOdlgfN34ifAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 335]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 12th century, [[Abu Hamid al Garnathi]] referred to Hungarian Pechenegs – probably Muslims – living disguised as Christians. In the southeast of Serbia, there is a village called Pecenjevce founded by Pechenegs. After war with Byzantium, the broken remnants of the tribes found refuge in the area, where they established their settlement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6752">'''Promaucae''', also spelled as ''Promaucas'' or ''Purumaucas'' (from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] ''purum awqa'': wild enemy), were an indigenous pre-Columbian [[Mapuche]] tribal group that lived in the present territory of [[Chile]], south of the [[Maipo River]] basin of [[Santiago, Chile]] and the [[Itata River]]. Those to the north were called ''Quillotanes''&lt;ref&gt;Juan Ignacio Molina, '''Compendio de la historia civil del reyno de Chile''', pg. 9. Named for [[Quillota]], one of the settlements of the [[Inca Empire]] in Chile.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mapochoes]]'' by the Spanish colonists).  They spoke [[Mapudungun]], like the [[Moluche]] to the south, and were part of the [[Picunche]] tribe that lived north of the [[Itata River]].

==Description==
[[File:Los Restos Indígenas de Pichilemu (1908)-lámina 1.jpg|thumb|right|Tools used by Promaucaes, found in [[Pichilemu]] in 1908.]]

The [[Inca Empire|Inca]] referred to all the peoples who were not under their empire as ''puruma auca''.  Because these Picunche tribes were successful in defending their territory against the [[Inca Empire]] in the [[Battle of the Maule]], they were given this distinctive name. In an effort to transliterate the word into Spanish phonetics, the Spanish referred to them as the ''Purumaucas'' or ''Promaucaes''.  The early Spanish in the area knew their region as the province of Promaucae and its inhabitants were called ''Promaucaes''.

The Promaucae are the first inhabitants of the [[Rancagua]] Valley of whom there is a historical account. The [[Mapuche]] included them in the group that they knew as the [[Picunche|picunche, "people of the north"]]. The Promaucae, as has already been mentioned, constituted a distinct cultural unit separate from those Picunche who lived to the north of the [[Maipo river|Maipo]], named [[mapocho]]es, and to the south of the [[Maule river|Maule]], designated ''maules'' and [[cauquenes]]. The Inca invaders noted the great military capacity and will to fight of the Promucae.

They were farmers and constructed some earthworks for irrigation. They left ceramic vestiges.

===Inca campaigns===
The Inca in their expansion used the [[Pucara del Cerro La Muralla]], which they strengthened. The Pucará was the southernmost Inca settlement then known. Inca expeditions in this territory were organized by [[Túpac Inca Yupanqui]] at the end of the 15th century and later by [[Huayna Cápac]].

The history of this period is based on what was written in later chronicles. These chronicles indicate that the Promaucaes, informed about the coming of the Incas, allied themselves with the Antalli, Pincu and Cauqui subgroups, forming an army of 20,000 men. The Incas sent members of parliament in order that they recognize Túpac Inca Yupanqui as sovereign. The Purumaucas decided to face them in the so-called [[Battle of the Maule]].&lt;ref&gt;Named by Francis Goicovich Videla and Osvaldo Silva Galdames in the article and the analysis on [http://www.filosofia.uchile.cl/publicaciones/revindigena/n6/goicovich.pdf Sofia Filo, "The "Battle of the Maule: Stopped the expansion Inca towards the south of Chile?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617235418/http://www.filosofia.uchile.cl/publicaciones/revindigena/n6/goicovich.pdf |date=2007-06-17 }}, University of Chile&lt;/ref&gt; During the confrontation, both sides suffered many fatalities and neither army won a clear advantage.

On the fourth day, neither side left their own camp, both of which had been fortified, as they hoped to defend them if their opponents attacked. The fifth and sixth days were passed in the same manner but by the seventh, the Purumauca and their allies retired and returned home claiming victory. The Inca later considered chasing them, on which some chiefs agreed; but they decided to secure only what they had already conquered, with which [[Túpac Inca Yupanqui]] agreed.

Due to their proximity to the [[Inca Empire]], the Promaucae learned the new technology that the Inca displayed in their new domains.

Among the peoples the Spanish called the Promaucae, adopting the term from the Inca, were particularly the people of the [[Rapel River]] valley.&lt;ref name=CompendioChile&gt;Juan Ignacio Molina, '''Compendio de la historia civil del reyno de Chile''', pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Those of the [[Mataquito River]] valley were called the ''Cure'', for which the province of [[Curico]] is named.&lt;ref name=CompendioChile/&gt; The people in the [[Maule River]] valley and to the south were distinguished as ''Maule.'' Those to the south of the Maule and north of the Itata River were known as ''Cauqui'' by the Inca &lt;ref&gt;Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, '''Comentarios reales''', 2da_VII_20 20&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Cauquene]].''&lt;ref name=CompendioChile/&gt; The Spanish named the [[Cauquenes River]] after them.

The '''Reno Gang''', also known as the '''Reno Brothers Gang''' and '''The Jackson Thieves''', were a group of [[criminal]]s that operated in the [[Midwestern United States]] during and just after the [[American Civil War]]. Though short-lived, they carried out the first three peacetime [[train robbery|train robberies]] in U.S. history. Most of the stolen money was never recovered.

The gang was broken up by the [[lynching]]s of ten of its members by [[vigilante]] mobs in 1868. The murders created an international diplomatic incident with [[Canada]] and [[Great Britain]], a general public uproar, and international newspaper coverage. No one was ever identified or prosecuted for the lynchings.

The Reno Brothers have been portrayed in [[Reno Gang#In popular culture|two movies]], including [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|first movie]] where he starred as brother Clint.

==Family and early life==

J. Wilkison (also known as Wilkinson or Wilkerson) Reno moved to Indiana in 1813 from the [[Salt River (Kentucky)|Salt River]] region of [[Kentucky]], one of the [[Border states (Civil War)|Civil War border states]]. He married Julia Ann Freyhafer in 1835. Future gang members Franklin (Frank), John, Simeon (Sim), and William (Bill) Reno were born to the couple in [[Rockford, Jackson County, Indiana]]. There was also another son, Clinton ("Honest" Clint), and a daughter, Laura. In their early years, the siblings were raised in a strict, religious ([[Methodist]]) farming household and were required to read the [[Bible]] all day on Sunday, according to John Reno's 1879 autobiography. Neither Clint nor Laura were involved in the gang's crime spree.&lt;ref name = f102/&gt;

The brothers got into trouble early. John claimed that he and Frank bilked travelers in crooked card games.&lt;ref name=HistNet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/reno-gangs-reign-of-terror.htm |title=Reno Gang's Reign Of Terror |publisher=''Wild West'' magazine, February 2004 (reprinted at historynet.com) |author=William Bell |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Renos were suspected when a series of mysterious fires broke out around Rockford over a period of seven years beginning in 1851.&lt;ref name="HistNet"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/jb/recon/robbery_1 |title=The First Known Train Robbery in the U.S. October 6, 1866 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] (americalibrary.gov) |accessdate=2008-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731011735/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/jb/recon/robbery_1 |archivedate=July 31, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The community also suspected the brothers in the [[horse thief|theft of a horse]]. The crimes caused considerable tension in the town and Wilkison and four of his sons fled, living near [[St. Louis, Missouri]], for some time, before returning to their farm in 1860. The war broke shortly after and the brothers enlisted in hopes of escaping the angry citizens of the town.&lt;ref name = f102/&gt;

==Civil War==
During the [[American Civil War]], Frank, John, and possibly Simeon became [[bounty jumper]]s.&lt;ref name=HistNet /&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC /&gt; They were paid to enlist in the [[Union Army]], then failed to appear for duty.  They continued to enlist under different names and locales, taking additional money.  Federal records show that Frank, John and Simeon [[desertion|deserted]]. Many residents of southern Indiana were sympathetic to the [[Confederate States of America]] or were Northern Democrats wanting peace (known as "[[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]"). It is not known if the Reno brothers were Copperheads or simply taking advantage of the situation. William briefly went [[Desertion#Absence without leave|AWOL]], but did return to serve out his enlistment.  He was the only one who received an [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorable discharge]] from the army. (There is a possibility that he was not a member of the gang.)&lt;ref name = f102&gt;Funk, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, Frank and John returned to Rockford, and a gang began to form under their leadership; Simeon and William joined them. Late that year, Frank and two other gang members, Grant Wilson and a man named Dixon, robbed the post office and Gilbert's Store in nearby [[Jonesville, Indiana]]. They were arrested, but were released on bond. Wilson agreed to testify against his fellow robbers, but was murdered before he could do so, and Frank was acquitted.&lt;ref name = f102/&gt;

==Post-war crimes==
The Reno Gang was the first "Brotherhood of Outlaws" in the United States. They terrorized the [[Midwest]] for several years and inspired the creation of a host of other similar gangs who copied their crimes, leading to several decades of high-profile train robberies.&lt;ref name = f102/&gt; Their gang attracted several new members after the end of the war. They started by robbing and murdering travelers in Jackson County and began to branch out to other counties, where they raided merchants and communities.

They planned to rob their first train near [[Seymour, Indiana|Seymour]]; the town was an important rail hub at that time. On the evening of October 6, 1866, John Reno, Sim Reno, and Frank Sparkes boarded an [[Ohio and Mississippi Railway]] train as it started to leave the Seymour depot. They broke into the express car, restrained the guard, and broke open a safe containing approximately $16,000. From the moving train, the three men pushed a larger safe over the side, where the rest of the gang was waiting. Unable to open the second safe, the gang fled as a large posse approached.

Later, passenger George Kinney stepped forward to identify two of the robbers. The three men were arrested, but were released on bail. When Kinney was shot and killed, the other passengers refused to testify and all charges had to be dropped. However, the robbery would ultimately lead to the gang's downfall. The contents of the safe were insured by the [[Adams Express Company]], which hired the [[Pinkerton Detective Agency]] to track down and capture the gang.&lt;ref name = f104&gt;Funk, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 1867, the [[Daviess County, Missouri|Daviess County]] Courthouse in [[Gallatin, Missouri]], was robbed. John Reno was identified, arrested by Pinkerton agents, and sentenced to 25 years in the Missouri State Penitentiary in 1868. He was released in February 1878. He returned to Seymour in 1886, but was again sent to prison, this time for counterfeiting, for three years.&lt;ref name = f104/&gt;

However, this did not deter the gang. Three robberies in Iowa followed in quick succession, in February and March 1868. Frank Reno and fellow gang members Albert Perkins and Miles Ogle were caught by Pinkertons led by [[Allan Pinkerton]]'s son William, but broke out of jail on April 1. A second train robbery occurred in December 1867, when two members of the gang robbed another train leaving the Seymour depot. The robbers netted $8,000, which was turned over to the brothers. A third train, owned by the Ohio &amp; Mississippi, was stopped by six members of the gang on July 10, though the Reno brothers were not involved. Waiting in ambush however were ten Pinkerton agents. A shootout ensued; after several of the gang were wounded, the would-be robbers fled.&lt;ref name = f104/&gt;

In March 1868, the residents of Seymour formed a vigilante group with the aim of killing the gang. In response, the gang fled west to Iowa where they robbed the [[Harrison County, Iowa|Harrison County]] treasury of $14,000. The next day, they robbed the [[Mills County, Iowa|Mills County]] treasury of $12,000. The Pinkerton detectives quickly located the men and arrested them at [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. On April 1, the gang escaped from their Iowa jail and returned to Indiana.&lt;ref name = f105&gt;Funk, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reno Gang then robbed its fourth train on May 22. Twelve men boarded a [[Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad]] train as it stopped at the train depot in [[Marshfield, Scott County, Indiana|Marshfield, Indiana]], a now defunct community in [[Scott County, Indiana]]. As the train pulled away, the gang overpowered the engineer and uncoupled the passenger cars, allowing the engine to speed away. After breaking into the express car and throwing express messenger Thomas Harkins off the train (causing fatal injuries), the gang broke open the safe, netting an estimated $96,000. This robbery gained national attention and was published in many major papers. The Pinkertons pursued, but the gang broke up and fled throughout the Midwest.&lt;ref name = f105/&gt;

The gang attempted to rob another train on July 9. Pinkerton detectives had learned of the plan and ten agents were waiting aboard the train. When the gang broke in, the agents opened fire, wounding two of the gang. Everyone was able to escape except Volney Elliot, who identified the other members of the gang in exchange for leniency. Using the information, the detectives arrested two more members of the gang (Charlie Roseberry and Theodore Clifton) the next day in [[Rockport, Indiana|Rockport]].&lt;ref name = f105/&gt;

==Lynchings==
All three men were taken by train to jail. However, on July 10, 1868, three miles outside [[Seymour, Indiana]], the prisoners were taken off the train, and hanged by the neck from a nearby tree by a group of masked men calling itself the Jackson County Vigilance Committee. Three other gang members, Henry Jerrell, Frank Sparks, and John Moore, were captured shortly after in Illinois and returned to Seymour. In a grisly repeat, they too fell into the hands of vigilantes and were hanged from the same tree. The site became known as [[Hangman Crossing, Indiana]].&lt;ref name = f105/&gt;

On July 27, 1868, the Pinkertons captured William and Simeon Reno in [[Indianapolis]]. The men were jailed at the [[Scott County, Indiana|Scott County]] Jail in [[Lexington, Indiana|Lexington]]. They were tried and convicted of robbing the Marshfield train, but because of the threat of vigilantes, they were moved to the more secure [[Floyd County, Indiana|Floyd County]] Jail. The day after their removal from Lexington, the vigilantes broke into the vacated jail, hoping to catch and lynch the men.&lt;ref name = f105/&gt;

Frank Reno, the gang's leader, and Charlie Anderson were tracked down to the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[border town]] of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. With the help of [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], the men were extradited in October under the provisions of the 1842 [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]]. Both men were sent to [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]] to join the other prisoners.&lt;ref name = f106&gt;Funk, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of December 11, about 65 hooded men traveled by train to New Albany. The men marched four abreast from the station to the Floyd County Jail where, just after midnight, the men forced their way into the jail and the sheriff's home. After they beat the sheriff and shot him in the arm for refusing to turn over the keys, his wife surrendered them to the mob. Frank Reno was the first to be dragged from his cell to be lynched. He was followed by brothers William and Simeon. Another gang member, Charlie Anderson, was the fourth and last to be executed, at around 4:30 a.m on December 12. It was rumored that the vigilantes were part of the group known as the Scarlet Mask Society or Jackson County Vigilance Committee. No one was ever charged, named or officially investigated in any of the lynchings.  Many local newspapers, such as the ''New Albany Weekly Ledger'', stated that "Judge Lynch" had spoken.&lt;ref name = f106/&gt; Reno Avenue in New Albany is likely named for the gang.

Frank Reno and Charlie Anderson were technically in federal custody when they were lynched. This is believed to be the only time in U.S. history that a federal prisoner had ever been lynched by a mob before a trial. Secretary of State Seward wrote a formal letter of apology as a result. A new bill was later introduced into the [[U.S. Congress]] that clarified the responsibility for the safety of extradited prisoners.&lt;ref name = f106/&gt;

The three Reno brothers are buried in the [http://genealogytrails.com/ind/jackson/reno-gang.htm Seymour city cemetery]. Treasure hunters have long searched for any trace of their rumoured hoard of loot, but nothing has been found.

'''Richard Henderson Honaker''' (born March 10, 1951) is a [[lawyer]] in [[Rock Springs, Wyoming]] who was nominated on March 19, 2007, by [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] to serve as one of three [[U.S. District Judge]]s for the [[United States District Court for the District of Wyoming|District of Wyoming]]. The nomination was given the highest "well qualified" rating by the judicial evaluation committee of the [[American Bar Association]]. Honaker was initially recommended to Bush by [[U.S. Senator]] [[Craig L. Thomas]] of Wyoming, who died some three months later. Honaker had co-chaired Thomas' reelection campaign in 2006 in Rock Springs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trib.com/articles/2008/02/13/news/wyoming/cbf20cc16060049c872573ee0006a0bc.txt Casper Star-Tribune Online - Wyoming&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Honaker never obtained a Senate vote on his confirmation. The succession of [[Barack Obama]] to the presidency ended his candidacy. Had he been confirmed, Honaker would have succeeded Judge [[Clarence Brimmer|Clarence A. Brimmer]] in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]]. [[Nancy D. Freudenthal]] was subsequently nominated and confirmed to the seat.&lt;ref name=neary_20090514&gt;Ben Neary, [http://www.trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_76f75627-95c4-5449-84fa-ffb5f123255a.html Gov nominates wife for federal court], ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'' (May 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years, education, family==
Honaker was one of two children adopted by Hayward E. Honaker (1911–2001) and the former Faola Henderson (born 1917) in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], the seat of [[Albany County, Wyoming|Albany County]] in southern Wyoming. He has a sister (born 1954). The Honakers were of [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] ethnicity; originally "Honegger", they came to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in the early 18th century. One of Honaker's ancestors was with [[George Rogers Clark]] in the march to [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], [[Indiana]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The Honakers settled in western [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], and most Honakers still reside in either Virginia or [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=honaker&gt;Statement of Richard Honaker, April 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Honaker's paternal family came to Laramie in 1919 and operated a [[grocery store]] and meat market. His maternal family came to the [[Bighorn Basin|Bighorn Country]] in 1915 and farmed [[sugar beet]]s.

Honaker graduated in 1969 from [[Laramie High School (Wyoming)|Laramie High School]] and was the first member of his family to receive a college degree. He procured his [[Bachelor of Arts]] with honors in [[English studies|English]] and [[government]] in 1973 from [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. At Harvard, he and future [[U.S. Senator]] [[Al Franken]] of [[Minnesota]], washed dishes together as [[Cooperative education|work-study]] students. Still another classmate of Honaker's was the assassinated [[Benazir Bhutto]] of [[Pakistan]]. At Harvard, he was a member of the [[Hasty Pudding Club]].&lt;ref name=casper&gt;[http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2007/03/20/news/top_story/6fbf6fcf6aae840f872572a40004e07a.txt Casper Star-Tribune Online - Top Story&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Honaker obtained his [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Wyoming Law School]] in Laramie. He worked his way through law school by serving as the night [[editing|editor]] of the ''[[Laramie Boomerang]]''.&lt;ref name=casper/&gt; Honaker is recognized by ''Super Lawyers'' magazine as among the top 5 percent of attorneys in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superlawyers.com/badges/lawyer/735c539b-5f53-47c0-97ed-1e211551cbe3.html Richard H.

==Wyoming lawyer==
From 1976-1978, he was a state assistant attorney general and an aide to Democratic [[Governor of Wyoming|Governor]] [[Edgar Herschler]]. In 1979, Herschler named Honaker as Wyoming's second state [[public defender]], in which capacity he supervised in [[criminal law]] the work of thirty trial lawyers during a two-year stint. While he was a public defender, Honaker prosecuted a lengthy [[homicide]] case in Rock Springs and decided to open a law office there. He is the only person to have served as president of both the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and Wyoming Bar Association, a position he held in 2002 and 2003. He was appointed by the [[Wyoming Supreme Court]] to the bar association's rules and disciplinary committees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/olp/honakerresume.htm USDOJ: OLP: Honaker Resume&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wyoming legislator==
From 1987-1993, Honaker served in the [[Wyoming House of Representatives]] as a [[conservative Democrat]] from Rock Springs, the seat of [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]]. Part of a five-member Sweetwater County delegation, Honaker's three terms coincided with the administration of Democratic Governor [[Mike Sullivan (governor)|Michael J. Sullivan]], who  endorsed Honaker's judicial nomination. Honaker served on the House corporations, judiciary, and rules committees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He did not run for a fourth term in 1992 because of [[redistricting]]. He [[Party switching in the United States|changed his affiliation]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1994 and was defeated in a bid to return to the Wyoming House under a revised district plan. Honaker said that his party switch was motivated by his opposition to policies of U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]. Since 2000, Honaker has maintained a solo law practice in Rock Springs, a Democratic and [[organized labor]] stronghold within usually otherwise Republican-leaning Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prochoice.org/policy/courts/nominations/honaker_facts.html National Abortion Federation: Nomination of Richard H. Honaker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Honaker joined the [[Federalist Society]], a body from which President Bush has procured numerous court nominees. He is a board member of the [[homeschooling|Home School]] Legal Defense Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=Richard+H.+Honaker&amp;fr=yfp-t-361&amp;u=www.afj.org/assets/resources/nominees/afj-honaker-report.pdf&amp;w=richard+h+honaker&amp;d=eAK-HfH_Qi9L&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us Yahoo!

==Personal life==
Honaker is an elder at Providence (formerly Pilgrim's) [[Reformed Church in the United States|Reformed Church]] in Rock Springs, a small congregation akin to conservative [[Presbyterian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://incolor.inebraska.com/stuart/justice.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, he married the former Shannon Kathleen Casey (born 1957), originally from the state [[capital (political)|capital]] of Cheyenne, the seat of [[Laramie County, Wyoming|Laramie County]]. The wedding ceremony, held in the home of Shannon's parents, was performed by U.S. District Judge [[Alan Bond Johnson]], based in Cheyenne. Johnson first met Honaker when Honaker headed the indigent defender program. Judge Johnson describes Honaker as having a "warm and attentive demeanor to all persons without regard to their station in life." If confirmed to the court, Honaker and Johnson would be judicial colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Craig Thomas from Alan B. Johnson, October 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honakers have three children. Shannon Honaker is the chairman of the Sweetwater County Republican Party and a trustee of Western Wyoming Community College.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wygop.org/About/Default.aspx?SectionId=431; http://www.wwcc.wy.edu/admissions/gen-info.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon C. Honaker [[Scholarship]], created by then Representative Honaker in 1991, is given annually to a home-educated student attending the University of Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honakerlaw.com/hl_bio.htmlM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion question==
The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] under Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] of [[Vermont]] delayed holding a hearing on Honaker's nomination until February 12, 2008. His nomination was held up in committee. Opposition has also come from interest groups which support access to [[abortion]]: [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion Rights Action League Pro-Choice America]], Feminist Majority, and [[Planned Parenthood]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benchmarkcampaign.org/php/CircuitCourtNomineeProfile.php?Cnom=24 BenchMark: NCJWs Campaign to Save Roe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his legislative races, Honaker was supported by the Wyoming [[National Right to Life Committee]]. In 1991 and 1992, Honaker introduced a bill that would prohibit abortion in Wyoming except in cases of [[rape]], [[incest]], or the threat to the life of the mother. His colleagues defeated the bill both years. Honaker explains that his activity post-dated the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', a 1989 case from [[Missouri]]. The court then had impliedly invited legislation regarding abortion from the states. In the 1992 ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' decision, the court closed the door on such proposals. More than forty states considered abortion legislation during that time.&lt;ref name=honaker/&gt;

In 1994, Honaker represented a [[political action committee]] that sought to get the anti-abortion measure on the ballot as a statewide [[initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministlawprofs.law.sc.edu/?m=200703&amp;paged=2 Feminist Law Professors » 2007» March&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was reported as ''Wyoming NARAL v. Karpan''. Honaker was not involved in drafting the initiative because he maintained that the ''Casey'' decision had rendered the measure moot. "My client, the PAC, thought otherwise and paid me to represent their views. . . . I won the case, and then the voters of Wyoming voted down the initiative" by a 61-39 percent margin," Honaker explained.&lt;ref name=honaker/&gt;

At the time, Honaker said: "Unborn children are human beings, and abortion is the taking of the life of an unborn child who is a member of the human race," a statement which alarmed pro-choice advocates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Honaker has, however, procured support from some abortion supporters: Robert Shively, a [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]] lawyer who formerly represented Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Robert Shively to Patrick Leahy, July 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Fox of Cheyenne, who formerly represented Wyoming NARAL in the case,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Kate Fox to Patrick Leahy, July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and former Democratic [[Wyoming State Senate|State Senators]] Lisa Kinney&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Lisa Kinney to Patrick Leahy, July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Bob Reese,&lt;ref&gt;Bob Reese, Guest Editorial, ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'', February 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and State Representative Don Sullivan of Cheyenne.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Don Sullivan to [[Joseph Biden]], February 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric M. Alden]] of [[Wheatland, Wyoming|Wheatland]] in southeastern Wyoming, a former Republican legislator who opposed Honaker's anti-abortion bills, was nevertheless quoted accordingly in the ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'':

"I believe he has the potential to be one of the finest trial judges ever to serve in this state. His commitment to fairness is second to none. I can truthfully say that there is no person I would rather have as a judge on a case, no matter what side of any issue I was on, than Dick Honaker."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Alden, Letters and Commentary section,  ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'', March 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wyoming leaders rally for Honaker==
Shortly before his death, Senator Thomas released a statement which asserts that Honaker "has a broad range of experience over the last thirty years in both state and federal courts in Wyoming. While his credentials are certainly outstanding, I am particularly impressed with his character and his values which are deeply rooted in Wyoming. He has the right judicial philosophy &amp;mdash; he knows the importance of interpreting the law while not legislating from the bench.&lt;ref name=casper/&gt;

Republican U.S. Senator [[Mike Enzi|Michael B. Enzi]] also hailed Honaker's nomination: "[He] will be an excellent jurist . . . He has the experience and the temperament to serve our state and the judiciary well. . . . He knows the difference between legislating—from his experience as a Wyoming representative—and judging—from all his years of court work. Since the criteria is fairness, I want to assure you, Richard is among the fairest people I know."&lt;ref name=enzi&gt;http://enzi.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?
FuseAction=NewsRoom.NewsReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=0f6c9ecf-802a-23ad-496d-d0c05f0ff065&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=&lt;/ref&gt;

Enzi's Republican colleague, [[John Barrasso]] of [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], who succeeded Thomas, agrees: "I know Mr. Honaker and respect him as an individual. I admire his legal abilities and his passion for the law. There is no question he is ready to fill the seat for which he has been nominated."&lt;ref name=enzi/&gt;

Judge Brimmer describes Honaker as "very well-qualified" for the position.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Clarence Brimmer to Richard Honaker, April 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Former Governor Sullivan, in a letter to U.S. Senator [[Edward Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]], defends Honaker: "He is not, as some have tried to portray him, a radical or person of extreme views." Sullivan said that he has observed Honaker, as a lawyer for injured [[plaintiff]]s, having represented clients "very well . . . with care and concern. . . [He] carries a demeanor which would translate into a classic judicial temperament and a respect for and an understanding of the rule of law and legal precedent which would position him to be an outstanding trial judge."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Michael J. Sullivan to [[Edward M. Kennedy]], February 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roviana''' is a member of the North West Solomonic branch of Oceanic languages. It is spoken around [[Roviana]] and [[Vonavona]] lagoons at the north central [[New Georgia]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. It has 10,000 first-language speakers and an additional 16,000 people mostly over 30 years old speak it as a second language (Raymond 2005). In the past, Roviana was widely used as a trade language and further used as a lingua franca especially for church purposes in the Western Province but now it is being replaced by the Solomon Islands [[Pijin]]. Few published studies on Roviana language include: Ray (1926), Waterhouse (1949) and Todd (1978) contain the syntax of Roviana language.
Corston-Oliver (1996 &amp; 2002) discuss about the ergativity in Roviana.
Todd (2000) and Ross (1988) discuss the clause structure in Roviana.

The Roviana alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet and consists of the above letters.

'''allophones:'''
{{IPA|[h] ~ [ɦ]}} ([+voiced]) / V_V → {{IPA|/huhuβe/ [huɦuβe]}} ‘bathing’

{{IPA|[ŋ] ~ [ɲ]}} / _V [-back] → {{IPA|/ŋiɾa/ [ɲiɾa]}} ‘strong’

{{IPA|/r/}} is lightly trilled in unstressed syllables and strongly trilled in stressed syllables.

{{IPA|[a] ~ [ə]}} / _V  → {{IPA|/leana/ [leəna]}}

;Phonotactics

(C)V

( C represents a single consonant and V represents a monophthong or diphthong. )

'''Diphthongs'''

There are five diphthongs; {{IPA|/ei/}}, {{IPA|/ai/}}, {{IPA|/ae/}}, {{IPA|/au/}}, and {{IPA|/oi/}}

The majority of lexical morphemes consist of two or three syllables. Lexical morphemes consisting of four syllables or a single syllable are uncommon whereas morphemes consisting of more than four syllables have never occurred.

;Stress
Stress is not contrastive.

(i) Roots of one syllable, with the exception of prepositions and articles;

{{IPA|/ˈla/}} ‘go’, {{IPA|/ˈmae/}} ‘come’

(ii) Roots of two syllables are stressed on the initial syllables;

{{IPA|/ˈzama/}} ‘talk’, {{IPA|/ˈtalo/}} ‘taro’

(iii) Roots of more than two syllables are stressed on the first and second syllables;

{{IPA|/ˈeˈhara/}} ‘blood’, {{IPA|/ˈsiˈɡareti/}} ‘cigarette’

The nominalising infix {{angle bracket|{{IPA|in}}}} occurs within the first syllable of the root, it always receives stress;

{{IPA|/ˈɣani/}} ‘eat’, {{IPA|/ˈɣiˈnani/}} ‘food’

All material which precedes the root (prefixes and reduplicated material) is assigned stress as if it were a single root;

{{IPA|/ˈβari-ˈpera/}} ‘fight’, {{IPA|/ˈhabo-ˈhabotu-ana/}} ‘chair’

The transitive suffix {{IPA|/-i/}} takes stress;

{{IPA|/ˈseke-ˈi-a/}} ‘hit him/her/it’

Other suffixes, however, do not take stress and are ignored in determining the placement of stress. Material following the root is not treated as a unit for the purpose of stress assignment;

{{IPA|/ˈdoɣoˈr-i-ɣami/}} ‘see us (EXClusive)’

The suffix {{IPA|/-ɣami/}} does not receive stress.

Stress is assigned independently to each root in a compound:

{{IPA|/βetu/ + /lotu/}} → {{IPA|/ˈβetuˈlotu/}} ‘church (‘pray’ + ‘house’)’

== Syntax ==

Roviana word order is [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO).

'''Nouns'''

There are two classes of nouns in Roviana. The first includes kin terms,body parts and some local nouns. These are used with suffixed personal pronouns such as:

''tinaqu - 'my mother';  mata-na - 'her/his /its eyes'''

Nouns of the second class are used with separate possessive words such as:

''qua buka - 'my book';  nana vetu - 'his/her/its house'''

Local nouns are formed from verbs by the suffix ''''ana''''. They denote a place where an action is performed:

''habotu - 'sit'; habo-habotu-ana - 'chair'''

Nouns are formed from verbs &amp; adjectives by the infix {{angbr|in}}. When the verb or adjective begins with a vowel, {{angbr|in}} is prefixed:

''ene - 'to walk'; inene - 'a journey'''

When the verb or adjective begins a consonant in is infixed after the first consonant:

''kera - 'sing'; kinera -'song'''

A noun can also be formed by in from the causative or repriciprocal forms of verbs:

''gila -'to know';  vagila - 'to show';  vinagila-gila - 'a sign'''

'''Demonstratives'''

Articles in Roviana occur before the noun, marking the noun phrase as common or proper. Roviana has definite and indefinite  articles.

The indefinite article is 'na':

na nana buka
[INDEF POSS: 3SG book]
'his/her book'

'''na''' can also be exchanged with '''sa'''

''sa hore 'the canoe' ''

''''na'''' and ''''sa'''' may also be applied with pl.nouns:

na tie habahuala-di
[INDEF person poor POSS:3PL]
'the poor people'

The definite article is ''''sa''''

sa dia vetu
[DEF POSS:3PL house]
'their house'

The personal articles are the non- absolutive ''''e'''' and absolutive ''''se''''.
'''E''' is commonly used with a proper noun in the subjective case, ''''se'''' in the objective:

Dogoria rau se Nate rane sarere lahe.
[Saw 1SG ABS Nate rane sarere lahe]
'I saw Nate last Saturday.'

'''Imperative and Interrogative sentences'''

'''Imperative sentences'''

An actor can optionally be omitted (1); otherwise there is no structural difference from a declarative clause (2).

(1)

''La (si  goi).''

go ABS 2SG

‘Go!’

(2)

''Va-mae-a        sa  magu.''

CAUS-come-3SG   DEF knife

‘Give me the knife!’

'''Interrogative sentences'''

Yes-no questions are structurally identical to declaratives, but have a distinct rising intonation. The two single word answers are uve ‘yes’ and lokari ‘no’.

Wh-questions or information questions contain an interrogative phrase in focus position (i.e. clause initial) and optionally is followed by the focal particle si; for example,

''ae'' ‘where?’

''esei'' ‘who?’

''kavisa'' ‘how many/much?’

''sa'' ‘what?’

''vea'' ‘how?, why?’

'''''Esei''' poza-mu    '''si'''    agoi?''

who name-2SG  FOC  2SG:FOC

‘What is your name?’ (Lit: ‘Who is your name?’)

Interrogative morphemes are frequently preceded by the disjunctive particle na;

''na vea ke'' ‘why?’

''na sa'' ‘what?’

'''Complex sentences'''

'''Coordination'''

Coordination is marked by a conjunction between the two clauses; the conjunction belongs with the second clause;

''ba'' ‘but’

''ke'' ‘so, thus’

''me(ke)'' 'and'  &gt; me is far more common in texts

''na'' 'or'

''pude'' 'purposive'

''tiqe'' 'then'

''Gina  tourism kamahire kote sage  mae   '''ba   lopu ta-gilana'''.''

maybe tourism now     FUT go.up come  but  NEG PASS-know

‘Maybe tourism will pick up, but we don’t know.’

'''-Subordination-'''

Three major classes are relative clauses, complement clauses and adverbial clauses.

'''Relative clauses'''

Relative clauses follow the head N and are introduced by the invariant relative clause marker sapu. They may only be formed on A, S and O and on the argument nominal of a verbless clause. More detailed explanation is below.

'''Complement clauses'''

Complement clauses are introduced by the subordinator sapu; otherwise, no different from the main clauses.
Complement clauses occur after Vs of cognition, speech or perception, whereas subordinate clauses (with the exception of relative clauses) occur in focus position;

''Lopu hiva-ni-a    ri   '''sapu tangin-i-a      rau sa   vineki'''.''

NEG like-TR-3SG 3PL C    hold-TR-3SG   1SG DEF girl

‘They didn’t like me holding the girl.’ (Lit: ‘They didn’t like it, that I was holding the girl.’)

Complement clauses are considered to be intermediate between main and subordinate clauses. In texts, complement clauses in Roviana are rare. Direct quotation is more frequent than subordination to higher predicates of information, while epistemic modals (e.g. gina ‘maybe’, tu ‘EMPH) are often used rather than subordination to higher predicates of cognition. (ergativity)

'''Adverbial clauses'''

Adverbial clauses occur in focus position and never contain new mentions in core argument positions. They are introduced by a subordinator and followed by the focal particle si, a consequence of being in focus position;

''beto'' 'after'

''pude'' 'if'

''totoso'' 'while, when'

'''''Ke beto vagi ri sarina {{angle bracket|in}}avoso  si''' la buna-i-a       ri  sa  vasina asa.''

so after gather 3PL  DEF:PL {{angbr|NOM}}know FOC go bomb-TR-3SG  3PL DEF place that

‘So after they had gathered all the information, they went and bombed that place.’

Subordination is extremely limited in Roviana. Subordinate clauses never contain other subordinate clauses, nor do they contain relative clauses. Similarly, relative clauses do not contain either subordinate clauses or relative clauses.

'''Ergativity'''

The subject of an intransitive verb has the same morphological marker as a direct object, and a different morphological marker from the subject of a transitive V.

A- transitive subject, O- transitive direct object, S- intransitive subject respectively.

Whether Roviana is an ergative language or not is argumentative, however, relative clauses in this language can be categorised by ergativity, so it can be described as an ergative language.

'''-Relative clauses-'''

Relative clauses in Roviana follow the head N and are introduced by an invariant relative marker sapu. The coreferent of the N in the matrix clause is never overt within the relative clause. This feature may be according to whether the notional coreferent within the relative clause is A, S or O.

'''Relative clauses on A'''

Relative clauses on A use clausal nominalisation. The notional A has no overt realisation. The nominalised verb in a relative clause on A carries a suffix ‘NSUF’, which is also used to index the possessor in possessives;

''sa    huda  noma-na''

DEF  tree   big-3SG.NSUF

‘the big tree’

When the O in the relative clause is a proper N, it is marked with the article e;

''Hierana sa   koreo '''sapu tupa-na          e   Zone'''.''

this     DEF boy  REL punch-3SG.NSUF ART John

‘This is the boy that punched John.’

'''Relative clauses on S'''

Given that the coreferent in the relative clause does not have overt realisation;

''Hierana sa   tie  '''sapu kote taloa'''.''

this     DEF man REL FUT leave

‘This is the man who is going away.’

'''Relative clauses on O'''

In relative clauses on O, A is overt in the relative clause and full verbal morphology is used to index the O. The nominal suffixes are not used in relative clauses on O;

''Hierana sa   koreo '''sapu tupa-i-a           e   Zone'''.''

this     DEF boy  REL punch-TR-3SG.DO ART John

‘This is the boy that John punched.’

In the context of a relative clause which is by definition subordinate, e is glossed simply ART, since it is used with proper Ns which are A or O. These following two examples have got e; the first one is on A whereas the second one is on O.

''Hierana sa   koreo sapu tupa-na          '''e'''   Zone.''

this     DEF boy  REL punch-3SG.NSUF ART John

‘This is the boy that punched John.’

''Hierana sa   koreo sapu tupa-i-a           '''e'''   Zone.''

this     DEF boy  REL punch-TR-3SG.DO ART John

‘This is the boy that John punched.’

'''-‘WHEN’ clauses-'''

‘When’ clauses are introduced by the subordinator totoso ‘time’ or the syncopated form totso, but they do not specify the precise nature of the temporal relation involved;

'''''Totso koa   goi      pa   korapa tropic''' si     kaqu  pezaku    lamo  si    goi.''

time  stay  you.SG  PREP inside  tropic FOC  must  wash.hands always ABS  you.SG

‘When you stay in the tropics, you must always wash your hands.’

'''-‘AFTER’ clauses-'''

The event of an ‘after’ clause is introduced by the subordinator beto ‘finish’ and temporally precedes the event of the matrix clause to which it is syntactically subordinate;

'''''Ke beto vagiri sarina {{angbr|in}}avoso si''' 1a buna-i-a ri sa ''

so finish  gather they DEF.PL {{angbr|NOM}}know FOC  go  bomb-TR-3SG.DO   they.ERG DEF

''vasina asa.''

place  that

‘So after they had gathered all the information, they went and bombed that place.’

'''-‘CONTEMPORANEOUS’ clauses-'''

‘Contemporaneous’ clauses have imperfective aspect, usually accompanied by reduplication of the verb, with the meaning ‘While …-ing’ or ‘As …-ing’;

'''''En-ene     ri   la  hoirana si'''    tutuvi-a       ri        se  Manue.''

DUP-walk  they go  there    FOC meet-3SG.DO  they.ERG ABS Possum

‘As they were walking along, they met Possum.’

'''-Conditionals-'''

In a conditional, the protasis is a subordinate clause. As with the subordinate clauses, there is a neutral system of case marking;

''...ba   '''pude  gore    vura     mae sa  si'''   kote taloa  si   rau.''

but  if     go.down come.out come it  FOC FUT leave  ABS I

‘...but if it works out, I'll leave.’

The '''Rural People's Movement''' (''Landvolkbewegung'') was a farmers' protest movement in northern Germany from 1928 to 1933. Due to an agricultural crisis, demonstrations took place in numerous towns and cities in early 1928, and deputations were sent to Berlin to  voice grievances against trade and tax policies. Farmers' continuing financial difficulties and dissatisfaction with their own lobby organizations led to more radical protests, especially in the province of Schleswig-Holstein, from late 1928. Passive resistance included [[Tax resistance|tax strikes]] and the obstruction of foreclosures, but some farmers, with the assistance of nationalist radicals, resorted to terrorist methods. Throughout 1929 bombs were placed in public buildings, including the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]]. The Rural People's Movement ran its own newspaper "Das Landvolk" which was edited by Bruno von Salomon, the brother of [[Ernst von Salomon]]. With the arrest of the bombers and many of its leaders, as well as the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], the Landvolk declined from 1930.

[[Hans Fallada]]'s first successful novel, ''A Small Circus ''(''Bauern, Bonzen und Bomben''), was based on the farmers' protests, especially a demonstration and boycott of the town of  [[Neumünster]].

'''Russians in the Baltic states''' describes self-identifying [[Russians|ethnic Russians]] and other primary [[Russophone|Russian-speaking]] communities in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]], commonly referred to collectively as the [[Baltic states]]. In 2017, there were 0.9 million ethnic Russians in the Baltic States&lt;ref&gt;http://alkas.lt/2015/12/16/a-butkus-lietuvos-gyventojai-tautybes-poziuriu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/lv/assets/documents/Iedzivotaju%20re%C4%A3istrs/07022017/ISVN_Latvija_pec_TTB_VPD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=PO0222U&amp;ti=POPULATION+BY+SEX%2C+ETHNIC+NATIONALITY+AND+COUNTY%2C+1+JANUARY%2E+ADMINISTRATIVE+DIVISION+AS+AT+01%2E01%2E2018&amp;path=../I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/04Population_figure_and_composition/&amp;lang=1&lt;/ref&gt;, having declined from 1.7 million in 1989, the year of the [[Soviet Census (1989)|last census]] during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era.{{r|numbers}}

==History==

{{see also|History of Russians in Estonia|History of Russians in Latvia|History of Russians in Lithuania}}
Most of the present-day Baltic Russians are migrants from the Soviet era and their descendants{{r|Idzelis}}, though a relatively small fraction of them can trace their ancestry in the area back to previous centuries.

According to official statistics, in 1920, [[History of Russians in Latvia|ethnic Russians]] (most of them residing there from the times of the [[Russian Empire]]) made up 7.82% of the population in independent Latvia, growing to 10.5% in 1935.{{r|Latvia1920-1935}} The share of ethnic Russians in the population of independent Estonia was about 8.2%, of which about half were indigenous Russians living in the areas in and around [[Pechory]] and [[Izborsk]] which were added to Estonian territory according to the 1920  Estonian-Soviet Peace [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]], but were transferred to the [[Russian SFSR]] by the Soviet authorities in 1945. The share of ethnic Russians in independent Lithuania (not including the Vilnius region, then annexed by Poland) was even smaller, about 2.5%.{{r|ReferenceA}}

Following the terms of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the [[Soviet Union]] [[Occupation of Baltic states|invaded and occupied]] and subsequently annexed [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] as Soviet republics in 1940. Germany invaded and occupied the Baltic states in 1941 a week after the first Soviet-conducted mass deportation. Communist party members who had arrived in the area with the initial annexation in 1940 and the [[puppet state|puppet regimes]] established evacuated to other parts of the [[Soviet Union]]; those who fell into German hands were treated harshly or murdered. The Soviet Union reoccupied the Baltic states in 1944–1945 as the war drew to a close.

Immediately after the war, a major influx from other USSR republics primarily of ethnic Russians took place in the Baltic states as part of a ''de facto'' process of [[Russification]]. These new migrants supported the industrialization of Latvia's economy. Most were factory and construction workers who settled in major urban areas. The influx included the establishment of military bases and associated personnel with the Baltic states now comprising the USSR's ''de facto'' western frontier bordering the Baltic Sea. Many military chose to remain upon retirement, attracted by higher living standards as compared to the rest of the USSR. This led to bitter disputes with Russia regarding the issue of their military pensions after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

After Stalin's death in 1953, the flow of new migrants to the [[Lithuanian SSR]] slowed down, owing to different policies on urbanization, economy and other issues than pursued in the [[Latvian SSR]] and the [[Estonian SSR]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; However, the flow of immigrants did not stop entirely in Lithuania, and there were further waves of Russian workers who came to work on major construction projects, such as power plants.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In Latvia and Estonia, less was done to slow down Russian immigration. By the 1980s Russians made up about third of the population in Estonia, while in Latvia, ethnic [[Latvians]] made up only about half of the population. In contrast, in 1989 only 9.4% of Lithuania's population were Russians.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Scholars in international law have noted that "in accordance with Article 49 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], the settlement of Russians in the Baltic States during the period was illegal under international law" ("The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies").{{r|Ronen2011}}{{r|Benvenisti1993}}{{r|ICRC}} The convention was adopted in 1949, including by the Soviet Union. However, as the Soviet Union maintained the Baltic States joined the USSR voluntarily, it did not consider the convention applicable to the Baltic states.

Continuing the position of their legations or governments in exile, and based on international law and treaties in effect at the time of initial Soviet occupation, the Baltic states view the Soviet presence in the Baltic states as an illegal occupation for its full duration. This continuity of the Baltic states with their first period of independence has been used to re-adopt pre-World War II laws, constitutions, and treaties and to formulate new policies, including in the areas of citizenship and language.

Some of the Baltic Russians, mainly those who had come to live in the region not long before the three countries regained independence in 1991, remigrated to Russia and other ex-Soviet countries in the early 1990s. Lithuania, which had been influenced by immigration the least, granted citizenship automatically. In Latvia and Estonia, those who had no family ties to Latvia prior to World War II did not receive automatic citizenship. Those that failed to request Russian citizenship during the time window it was offered were granted permanent residency "''non-citizen''" status. (see ''Citizenship'' section).

==Current situation==
Lithuanian Russians live mainly in cities. In the Lithuanian capital [[Vilnius]], they make up 12% of the population, in Lithuania's third largest city [[Klaipėda]] no more than 19%. Other Lithuanian cities, including the second-largest city [[Kaunas]], have lower percentages of Russians, while in most small towns and villages there are very few Russians (with the exception of [[Visaginas]]). In all, 4.9% of Lithuania's population are ethnic Russians.

Russians make up almost a half of the population of Latvia's capital, [[Riga]]. In the second largest city [[Daugavpils]], where already before [[World War I]] Russians were the second biggest ethnic group after Jews,&lt;ref&gt;http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd.php?reg=127&lt;/ref&gt; Russians now make up the majority. Today about 27.6% of Latvia's population are ethnic Russians.

In [[Estonia]], [[Russians]] are concentrated in urban areas, particularly in [[Tallinn]] and the north-eastern county of [[Ida-Virumaa]]. As of 2011, 38.5% of Tallinn's population were ethnic Russians and an even higher number – 46.7% spoke Russian as their [[mother tongue]].{{r|Tallinn-stats}} In 2011, large proportions of ethnic Russians were found in [[Narva]] (82.02%),{{r|Narva}} [[Sillamäe]] (about 82%){{r|Sillamae}} and [[Kohtla-Järve]] (69.68%). In the second largest city of Estonia – [[Tartu]] – ethnic Russians constitute about 16% of the population.{{r|Tartu}} In rural areas the proportion of ethnic Russians is very low (13 of Estonia's 15 counties are over 80% ethnic Estonian). Overall, ethnic Russians make up 24% of Estonia's population (the proportion of [[Russophone]]s is, however, somewhat higher, because Russian is the mother tongue of many ethnic [[Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]] and Jews who live in the country).

Demand for industrial workers drew Russians to settle in larger cities. In all three countries, the rural settlements are inhabited almost entirely by the main national ethnic groups, except some areas in eastern Estonia and Latvia with a longer history of Russian and mixed villages. The Lithuanian city of [[Visaginas]] was built for workers at the [[Ignalina nuclear power plant]] and therefore has a Russian majority. A 2014 study found that many Russians identified with the place where they lived.{{r|Mirros2014}}

After the accession of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004, many Baltic Russians moved to other EU countries. In particular, tens of thousands of Baltic Russians (especially those with EU citizenship) moved to the United Kingdom and to Ireland, who were the first 'old' EU countries to open up their labour markets to the new members of the EU. Thousands of Russians from Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius, holding EU passports, now live in London, [[Dublin]] and other cities in the UK and Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} They make up a substantial part of the Russian-speaking community in London.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} No reliable statistics on their exact numbers exist, as in the UK they are counted as nationals of the Baltic countries, and not as Russians.

In 2012, [[Dimitri Medvedev]] issued a repatriation program designed to resettle ethnic Russians from abroad. So far 10,000{{specify|reason=Does not specify whether it's just from Baltic states or in total|date=August 2018}} families have settled in the Russian Federation, mostly to [[Pskov Oblast]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Citizenship===
{{See also|Estonian nationality law|Latvian nationality law|Lithuanian nationality law}}

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:latvian_passports.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Different types of Latvian passports]] --&gt;
After regaining independence in 1991, Latvia and Estonia restored the pre-1940 citizenship laws on the basis of the legal continuity of their statehood throughout 1940 – 1991, automatically recognising citizenship according to the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' for the persons who held citizenship before 16 June 1940 and their descendants. Most of those who had settled on the territory of these [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republics]] after their incorporation by the USSR of these states by the USSR in 1940 and their descendants received the right to obtain citizenship through [[naturalisation]] procedure, but were not granted citizenship automatically. This policy affected not only ethnic Russians, but also the descendants of those ethnic Estonians and Latvians who emigrated from these countries before independence was proclaimed in 1918. Dual citizenship is also not allowed, except for those who acquired citizenship by birth.

Knowledge of the respective official language and in some cases the Constitution and/or history and an oath of loyalty to established constitutional order was set as a condition for obtaining citizenship through naturalisation. However, the purported difficulty of the initial language tests became a point of international contention, as the government of Russia, the [[Council of Europe]], and several human rights organizations claiming that they made it impossible for many older Russians who grew up in the Baltic region to gain citizenship. As a result, the tests were altered,{{citation needed|date=May 2007}} but a large percentage of Russians in Latvia and Estonia still have [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizen]] or alien status. Those who have not applied for citizenship feel they are regarded with suspicion, under the perception that they are deliberately avoiding naturalisation.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} For many, an important reason not to apply for citizenship is the fact that Russia gives non-citizens preferential treatment: they are free to work{{fact|date=November 2015}} or visit relatives in Russia. The citizens of the Baltic states must apply for [[Visa (document)|visas]].

The language issue is still contentious, particularly in Latvia, where there were [[Russian School Defense Staff|protests]] against plans to require at least 60% of lessons in state-funded Russian-language high schools to be taught in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (in the first version of the Law on education this was 100%).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In contrast, Lithuania granted citizenship to all its residents at the time of independence redeclaration day willing to have it, without requiring them to learn [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Probably the main reason that Lithuania took a less restrictive approach than Latvia and Estonia is that whereas in Latvia ethnic Latvians comprised only a small majority of the total population, and in Estonia ethnic Estonians comprised about 70 percent, in Lithuania ethnic Lithuanians were about 80 percent of the population. Therefore, as a matter of voting in national elections or referendums, the opinions of ethnic Lithuanians would likely carry the day if there were a difference in opinion between Lithuanians and the larger minority groups (Russians and [[Poles in Lithuania|Poles]]), but this was less certain in the other two Baltic countries, especially in Latvia.

Some representatives of the ethnic Russian communities in Latvia and Estonia have claimed discrimination by the authorities, these calls frequently being supported by Russia. On the other hand, Latvia and Estonia deny discrimination charges and often accuse Russia of using the issue for political purposes. In recent years, as the Russian political leaders have begun to speak about the "former Soviet space" as their [[sphere of influence]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Socor]], [http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2369222 Kremlin Refining Policy in 'Post-Soviet Space'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703132434/http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2369222 |date=3 July 2007 }}, ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'' 8 Feb 2005&lt;/ref&gt; such claims are a source of annoyance, if not alarm, in the Baltic countries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have since 2004 become members of [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] (EU) to provide a counterbalance to Russia's claims to speak for the interests of ethnic Russian residents of these countries. Furthermore, to satisfy a precondition for their admission to the EU, both Estonia and Latvia slightly adjusted their citizenship policies in response to EU monitoring and requests. Claims of discrimination in basic rights by Russians and other minorities in the region may have less effect now than they did during the years when the Baltic countries' membership applications were still pending with the EU.{{citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Political activity===
There are a number of political parties and politicians in the Baltic states who claim to represent the Russian-speaking minority. These parties support [[Russian language]] rights, demand citizenship for all long-term residents of Latvia and Estonia and tend to be left-wing on other issues. These forces are particularly strong in [[Latvia]] represented by the [[Latvian Russian Union]] which has one seat in the [[European parliament]] held by [[Tatjana Ždanoka]] and the more moderate [[Social Democratic Party "Harmony"|Harmony party]] which is currently the largest faction in the [[Saeima]] with 24 out of 100 deputies, the party of the current [[Riga City Council|Mayor of Riga]] [[Nils Ušakovs]] and with one representative in the [[European parliament]] currently [[Andrejs Mamikins]]. In Estonia there is similarly the [[Estonian United Left Party]] however that party is not represented in the [[Riigikogu]] and the [[Estonian Centre Party]] is overwhelmingly the most favoured party among Estonian Russians. This is in part because{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} of its co-operation agreement with [[United Russia]], its advocacy of friendlier ties with the Russian government compared to other mainstream Estonian parties and the prevalence{{fact|date=November 2015}} Russians and Russophones among the party's municipal councilors and parliamentarians.

In 2011 pro-Russian groups in [[Latvia]] collected sufficient signatures to initiate the process of amending the Constitution to give Russian the status of an [[official language]]. On 18 February 2012, [[Latvian constitutional referendum, 2012|constitutional referendum]] on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html/|title=Referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/|title=Results of the referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|language=Latvian|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-citizen community (290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia's entire population) was non entitled to vote.

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's linear model of communication and created the '''Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication''', which separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The process of communication. New York,|last=Berlo|first=David|publisher=Rinehart, &amp; Winston.|year=1960|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlo described factors affecting the individual components in the communication making the communication more efficient.

== Background ==
The Berlo’s Model of Communication has developed from Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver’s mathematical model, which was first published in “Bell System Technical Journal” in 1948. The model was primary designed to improve the technical communication, but was later widely applied in different fields of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals &amp; Noise|last=John Robinson Pierce|first=|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Shannon-Weaver Model, communication includes the following concepts: sender, encoder, channel, decoder, receiver and feedback. Furthermore, there is also concept of “noise”, which affects the communication process going through the channel and makes the message more difficult to understand by the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Claude|date=|title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication|url=|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|volume=27|pages=379–423, 623–656.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of those concepts are defined as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Sender:''' the originator of message.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Encoder:''' the transmitter which converts the message into signals (the way message is changed into signals, for example sound waves).&lt;br /&gt;
'''Decoder:''' the reception place of the signal which converts signals into message. Decoding is done by the receiver when he gets the message.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Receiver:''' the recipient of the message from the sender.  He usually gives feedback to the sender in order to make sure that the message was properly received.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Noise:''' the message is transferred through a channel, which can be interrupted by external noise like horn sounds, thunder and crowd noise. Thus, the receiver can get an inaccurate message. This is why feedback from the receiver is important in case the message is not properly received. Furthermore, the noise can also affect the decoding of the message by the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|last=Weaver, Warren and Shannon, Claude Elwood|first=|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1963|isbn=0-252-72548-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Practical Example of  Shannon-Weaver model of communication : &lt;br /&gt;
Thomson made call to his assistant “come here I want to see you”.  During his call, noise appeared (transmission error) and his assistant received “I want” only. Again Assistant asked Thomson (feedback) “what do you want Thomson”.
# Sender: Thomson
# Encoder: Telephone (Thomson)
# Channel: Cable 
# Noise: Distraction in voice 
# Decoder: Telephone (Assistant)
# Receiver: Assistant. 
Berlo's Model was first published in 1960 in the book entitled El Proceso de la Comunicación or the process of communication. The model includes four components to describe the communication process: sender, message, channel and receiver, each of the them are affected by many factors. The model also focuses on encoding and decoding, which happens before sender sends the message and before receiver receives the message respectively.

The main feature from the previous Shannon-Weaver model is the focus on the purpose and objectives of communication. Berlo's model also includes verbal and non-verbal communications, it considers the emotional aspects of the message.

== Components of Berlo's Model of Communication ==
David Berlo's Model of Communication explains the various components in the communication process. The four basic components are sender (or source), message, channel and receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of communication models, perspectives, strategies|last=Uma Narula|first=|publisher=Atlantic publishers&amp;distributors|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== S-Sender ===
Sender is the source of the message or the person who originates the message and sends it to the receiver. The sender transfers the information by using following factors: 
* Communication Skills (ability to read, write, speak, listen etc.) directly affects the communication process.
An individual must possess excellent communication skills to make his communication effective and create an impact on the listeners. He should know how to speak and how pronounce a word correctly, where to take pauses and where to repeat and so on. Similarly, to the receiver. If he can not understand the message, the communication will be ineffective. 
* Attitudes towards the audience, subject, etc.  
The attitude of the sender and the receiver effects of the message. The person's attitude towardsl the receiver and the environment changes the meaning and effect of the message.
* Knowledge 
In this context knowledge is not the level of education. It is the clarity of the information which sender wants to convey to the receiver. Familiarity with the subject of the message makes it easier to understand it.
* Social Systems. 
Values, beliefs, religion, laws, rules and general understanding of society affect the sender's way of communicating the message.
* Culture
Culture refers to the cultural background of the sender or receiver.

=== M-Message ===

The step of creating a message (also called encoding) is the transformation of thoughts into words that sender sends to receiver. It can be in the form of voice, audio, text, video or other media. Any message comprises the following elements:
* Content is the thing, which the whole message from beginning to end contains.
* Elements are the non-verbal basics like language, gestures, body language etc. Content is accompanied by some elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication for social change. Anthology: histirical and contemporary readings|last=Tufte|first=Thomas|publisher=Denise Dray-Felder|year=2006|isbn=0-9770357-9-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Treatment is the way in which the message is transferred to the receiver. Treatment also effects the feedback of the receiver.
* Structure of the message is the way it has been structured into various parts or arranged. It influences the effectiveness of the message.
* Code is the form in which the message is sent. It might be in the form of language, text, video, etc.

=== C-Channel ===
Channel  refers to the medium used to send the message. In mass communication technical machines might be used as a channel like telephone, internet, etc. But in general communication, the five senses of a human being is the channel for the communication flow and it affects the effectiveness of the channel:
* Hearing - We receive the message through hearing.
* Seeing - We perceive through seeing. We also get non-verbal messages by seeing.
* Touching - Many of the non-verbal communication happens from touching like holding hands.
* Smelling - We collect information from smelling.
* Tasting - Taste also provides the information to be sent as a message.

=== R-Receiver ===
Receiver is the person who gets the message and tries to understand what the sender actually wants to convey and then responds accordingly. This is also called as decoding. Berlo's model believes that the effective communication can be achieved if the sender and the receiver are on the same level. The message might not have the same effect as intended if the receiver and sender are not similar.

The receiver must also have a very good listening skill. Other factors are similar to that of the sender:
* Communication skills
* Attitudes
* Knowledge
* Social Systems
* Culture

== Criticisms of Berlo's SMCR Model ==
#There is no concept of feedback, so the effect is not considered.
#There is no concept of noise or any kind of barriers in communication process.
#It is a linear model of communication, there is no two way communication.
#Both of the people must be similar (on same level for communication) according to all the factors mentioned above. Thus, the model is not practical in real life.
#Main drawback of the model is that the model omits the usage of sixth sense as a channel which is actually a gift to the human beings (thinking, understanding, analyzing etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://communicationtheory.org/berlos-smcr-model-of-communication/|title=BERLO’S SMCR MODEL OF COMMUNICATION|work=Communication Theory|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlo's model was further developed in 1973 by W. Schramm, who used relational model instead of linear. Schramm also used the effects and effects analysis components from Berlo's model and suggested '''Interaction''' component in relation with active, selective and manipulative audience. He argued that the most dramatic change in the communication theory in the last 40 years has been the abandonment of the idea of passive audience. Audience is a full partner in the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wilbur Schramm and Noam Chomsky Meet Harold Innis: Media, Power, and Democracy|last=Robert E.

'''Standard German''', '''High German''', or more precisely '''Standard High German''', ({{lang-de|Standarddeutsch}}, {{lang|de|Hochdeutsch}}, or in Swiss Standard German {{lang|de|Schriftdeutsch}}), is the [[standard language|standardized variety]] of the [[German language]] used in formal contexts, and for communication between different dialect areas. It is a [[Pluricentric language|pluricentric]] [[Abstand and ausbau languages#Roofing|Dachsprache]] with three codified (or "standardized") specific regional variants: [[German Standard German]], [[Austrian Standard German]], and [[Swiss Standard German]].

Regarding the spelling and punctuation, a recommended standard is published by the [[Council for German Orthography]] (formed in 2004) which represents the governments of all majority and minority German-speaking countries and dependencies. Adherence is obligatory not for everyday use but for government institutions including schools. For pronunciation, there is no official standards body but there is a long-standing ''[[de facto]]'' standard pronunciation ("[[Bühnendeutsch]]"), most commonly used in formal speech and teaching materials; it is similar to the formal German spoken in and around [[Hanover]]. Adherence to those standards by private individuals and companies, including the print and audio-visual media, is voluntary but widespread.

== Origins ==
Standard German originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region, but as a [[written language]], developed over a process of several hundred years, in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area. Until about 1800, Standard German was almost entirely a written language. In this time, people in [[Northern Germany]] who mainly spoke [[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]] languages very different from Standard German learned it as a foreign language. However, later the Northern pronunciation (of Standard German) was considered standard and spread southward; in some regions (such as around [[Hanover]]) the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of Low German speakers. It is thus the spread of Standard German as a language taught at school that defines the German ''[[Sprachraum]]'', i.e. a political decision rather than a direct consequence of [[dialect geography]], allowing areas with dialects of very limited mutual comprehensibility to participate in the same cultural sphere. Currently, local dialects are used mainly in informal situations or at home and also in dialect literature, and more recently a resurgence of German dialects has appeared in mass media.

== Terminology ==
In [[German linguistics]], only the traditional regional [[German dialects|varieties of German]] are called [[dialect]]s, not the different varieties of standard German. The latter are known as ''Umgangssprachen'' and in the territory of [[Germany]] began to replace the traditional dialects beginning in the nineteenth century. They constitute a mixture of old dialectal elements with Standard German.

In German, Standard German is often called {{lang|de|Hochdeutsch}}, a somewhat misleading term since it conflicts with the linguistic term [[High German languages|High German]]. High German of the southern uplands and the Alps (including [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[South Tyrol|parts of northern Italy]] as well as southern Germany) contrasts with [[Low German]] spoken in the lowlands stretching towards the [[North Sea]]. To avoid this confusion, some refer to Standard German as {{lang|de|Standarddeutsch}} ("standard German"), {{lang|de|deutsche Standardsprache}} ("German standard language"), or if the context of the German language is clear, simply {{lang|de|Standardsprache}} ("standard language"). However, the word "standard" downgrades the linguistic position of the daily language spoken in Switzerland and Austria, and people there often prefer "Hochdeutsch" or "High German" as it is less aggressive towards [[Swiss Standard German]] and [[Austrian German]].

== Pluricentricity ==
[[File:Standard varieties of German.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of the German language after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner, et al.: Variantenwörterbuch des Deutschen. Die Standardsprache in Österreich, der Schweiz und Deutschland sowie in Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Ostbelgien und Südtirol. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Standard German differs regionally. The most accepted distinction is between different national varieties of standard German: [[Austrian Standard German]], [[German Standard German]] and [[Swiss Standard German]]. Additionally, there are linguists who posit that there are different varieties of standard German within Germany. Linguistic research of the different varieties of standard German began for the most part only in the 1990s, especially in Austria and Switzerland. During the existence of the [[German Democratic Republic]], there were occasional studies about whether there were differences between the standard varieties of the German Democratic Republic and the [[West Germany|Federal Republic]]. The German federal state of Bavaria has promoted language diversity in the past in an effort to preserve its distinct culture.

The different varieties of standard German (Austrian, Swiss, and Germany Standard) differ only in a few features, especially in [[vocabulary]] and [[pronunciation]], but even in some instances of [[grammar]] and [[orthography]]. In the written language, it may be hard or even impossible to tell what variety of standard German has been used, though in the spoken language, the different varieties of standard German are easily recognized by most speakers.

The variation of the standard German varieties must not be confused with the variation of the local [[German dialects]]. Even though the standard German varieties are to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. All varieties of standard German are based on the common tradition of the written German language, whereas the local dialects have their own historical roots that go further back than the unification of the written language and in the case of Low German belong to a different language entirely.

== Continuum between standard German and German dialects ==
In most regions, the speakers use a continuum of mixtures from more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties according to situation. However, there are two (or three) exceptions:

*In Northern Germany, there is no continuum in the strict sense between the local indigenous languages and dialects of [[Low German]] ("Plattdeutsch") on the one hand, and standard German on the other. Since the former have not undergone the [[High German consonant shift]], they are too different from the standard for a continuum to emerge. High German and Low German can be considered to be separate languages, since they are so different, but because High, Middle and Low German form a [[dialect continuum]] and Standard German serves as [[dachsprache]] for all forms of German, they are mostly seen as dialects of German. Under a socio-linguistic approach to the problem, even if Low German dialects are [[Abstand and ausbau languages|''Abstandsprachen'']] (linguistically quite different), they are dialects of German, because they lack [[Abstand and ausbau languages|''Ausbau'']]. However, Low German did influence the standard-based vernaculars spoken today in Northern Germany by [[language transfer]] (in pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and syntax), and it continues to do so to a limited degree. High German heavily influenced by Low German has been known as [[Missingsch]], but most contemporary Northern Germans exhibit only an intermediate Low German [[substratum]] in their speech.
*In German-speaking [[Switzerland]], there is no such continuum between the [[Swiss German]] varieties and [[Swiss Standard German]], and the use of standard German is almost entirely restricted to the written language. Therefore, this situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. Standard German is rather rarely spoken among native Swiss,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Though about 10%, or {{formatnum: {{#expr: 8200000*0.101 round -4}}}} Swiss residents speak ''High German'' a.k.a. Standard German at home.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/sprachen.html |type=official site |title=Sprachen, Religionen – Daten, Indikatoren: Sprachen – Üblicherweise zu Hause gesprochene Sprachen |date=2015 |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |language=German, French, Italian |quote=Zu Hause oder mit den Angehörigen sprechen 60,1% der betrachteten Bevölkerung hauptsächlich Schweizerdeutsch, 23,4% Französisch, 8,4% Italienisch, 10,1% Hochdeutsch und 4,6% Englisch |accessdate=2016-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114180444/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/sprachen.html |archivedate=2016-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even then the accent and vocabulary is very much Swiss, except for instance when speaking with people who do not understand the [[Swiss German]] dialects at all, and it is expected to be used in school. Standard German has, however, left a clear imprint on the contemporary variants of Swiss German, regional expressions and vocabulary having been replaced with material assimilated from the standard language. Of all the German-speaking countries Switzerland has however the most retained its ability to use dialect in everyday situations, also a commonplace phenomenon in southern Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Alsace, and South Tyrol. The fairly common aspect of dialect use in Swiss media (both radio, internet, and television), which ranges from uncommon to rare in the media of Austria, Germany, East Belgium, South Tyrol, and Liechtenstein, makes Switzerland a special case.
*Although [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] is no longer considered a German dialect today but a language, the situation can be compared to that of Switzerland. Standard German is also taught in schools in Luxembourg and close to 90% of the population can speak it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Europeans and their Languages] – Eurobarometer, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
{{main|Standard German phonology}}

While there is no officially recommended standard, and multiple regional variants are considered correct, there does exist a standardised accent which is generally used in radio and television as well as in German learning materials for non-natives, and to varying degrees by language teachers.  This accent is documented in reference works such as ''Deutsches Aussprachewörterbuch'' (German Pronunciation Dictionary) by Eva-Maria Krech et al.,&lt;ref group=note&gt;On pages 1-2, ''Deutsches Aussprachewörterbuch'' discusses ''die Standardaussprache, die Gegenstand dieses Wörterbuches ist'' (the standard pronunciation which is the topic of this dictionary).  It also mentions ''Da sich das Deutsche zu einer plurizentrischen Sprache entwickelt hat, bildeten sich jeweils eigene Standardvarietäten (und damit Standardaussprachen)'' (German has developed into a pluricentric language separate standard varieties (and hence standard pronunciations)) but refers to the standards as ''regionale und soziolektale Varianten'' (regional and sociolectal variants).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Duden]] 6 Das Aussprachewörterbuch'' (Duden volume 6, The Pronunciation Dictionary) by [[Max Mangold]] and the training materials at the ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' (West German Broadcasting) and ''[[Deutschlandfunk]]'' (Radio Germany). It is an invented accent rather than radiating from any particular German-speaking city, but it is closest to the German spoken in [[Hanover]].

== Orthography ==
{{main|German orthography}}
A first standardization, although non-prescriptive, of [[Early Modern High German]] was introduced by the [[Luther Bible]] of 1534. In consequence, the written language of the chancery of [[Saxony-Wittenberg]] rose in importance in the course of the 17th century, and the 1665 revision of the [[Zürich Bible]] abandoned its [[Alemannic German|Alemannic-based]] idiom in favour of this standard.

The First Orthographical Conference was called in 1876 by the government of [[Prussia]].

[[Konrad Duden]] published the first edition of his dictionary, later simply known as the ''[[Duden]]'', in 1880. The first [[spelling reform]], based on Duden's work, came into effect in 1901. The orthographical standards predating 1901 are now known as "classical orthography" (''Klassische deutsche Rechtschreibung''), while the conventions in effect from 1901 to 1998 are summarized as "old orthography" (''Alte deutsche Rechtschreibung''). In 1944 there was a failed attempt at another reform; this was delayed on the order of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and not taken up again after the end of [[World War II]]. In the following decades German spelling was essentially decided ''de facto'' by the editors of the Duden dictionaries. After the war, this tradition was followed with two different centers: [[Mannheim]] in [[West Germany]] and [[Leipzig]] in [[East Germany]]. By the early 1950s, a few other publishing houses had begun to attack the Duden monopoly in the West by publishing their own dictionaries, which did not always conform to the "official" spellings prescribed by Duden. In response, the Ministers of Culture of the federal states in West Germany officially declared the Duden spellings to be binding as of November 1955.

[[German spelling reform of 1996|The 1996 spelling reform]] was based on an international agreement signed by the governments of the [[German language|German]]-speaking countries [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Switzerland]]; but acceptance of the reform was limited. While, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, most German print media followed the reform, some newspapers, such as ''[[Die Zeit]]'', [[NZZ|''Neue Zürcher Zeitung'']] and ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', created their own in-house orthographies.

In 2006, there was a further revision of the spelling reform because there were disagreements about capitalisation and splitting of German words. Also revised were the rules governing punctuation marks.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

''Ethnologue'' considers it a "mixed Berber–Songhay language",&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torres2009" /&gt; while other researchers consider it Northern Songhay.&lt;ref name="RueckChristiansen1999" /&gt; About half of its daily vocabulary is [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]], and three quarters overall. There are two dialects: Tagdal proper, spoken by the [[Igdalen people]], [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] who inhabit a region to the east along the [[Niger]] border to [[Tahoua]] in Niger,&lt;ref name=torres2009&gt;CM Benítez-Torres.

(2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Tabarog''', spoken by the [[Iberogan people]] of the [[Azawagh]] valley on the Niger–Mali border.

Nicolaï (1981) uses the name ''Tihishit'' as a cover term. Rueck &amp; Christiansen&lt;ref name=tainecheikh1989&gt;Catherine Taine-Cheikh.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the Igdalen and the Iberogan have for many purposes been treated as one group, and their speech forms are closely related. Nicolaï uses "tihishit" as a common designator for these two speech forms...; however, this term is ambiguous. "Tihishit" is a term of Tamajaq origin meaning "the language of the blacks". The Igdalen and Iberogan used it to refer to all Northern Songhay speech forms.&lt;ref name=RueckChristiansen1999&gt;Michael J Rueck; Niels Christiansen.

Meanwhile, the Iberogan sometimes refer to their language as Tagdal.

== Grammar ==
Tagdal is an [[agglutinative language]], most likely due to Tuareg influence.

=== Pronouns ===
Tagdal gets its pronominal system from Northern Songhay languages.

Tadgal has two different prefixes used for negation. The first is ''nɘ''-, which functions as perfective negation, and is the default choice for negation. It indicates something that might have happened in the past, but didn't, or in the case of stative verbs, something that is not true. The other negation prefix is ''sɘ''-, which acts as a negation in the present or future. Uses of this negation are shown in these examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benítez-Torres|first=Carlos M.|date=2009|title=Inflectional vs. Derivational Morphology in Tagdal: A Mixed Language|url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/acal/38/abstract2136.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''ɣɑnɘkoy'': I did not go

''ɣɑsɘbkoy'': I was not going/I do not (habitually) go

''ɣɑnəyɑrdɑ'': I disagree

]]
&lt;!-- Editor note: This article specifies when legislation is voted on, not when it takes effect. --&gt; 

The [[legal history of cannabis in the United States]] began with state-level prohibition in the early 20th century, with the first major federal limitations occurring in 1937. Starting with [[Oregon]] in 1973, individual states began to [[Drug liberalization|liberalize cannabis]] laws through [[decriminalization]]. In 1996, California became the first state to legalize [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical cannabis]], sparking a trend that spread to a majority of states by 2016. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize cannabis for [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|recreational use]].

==Federal==
* 1937: The [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937|Marihuana Tax Act]] is enacted, effectively prohibiting cannabis at the federal level.  Although medical use is still permitted, new fees and regulatory requirements significantly curtail its use.&lt;ref name="Pacula"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacula|first1=Rosalie Piccardo|title=State Medical Marijuana Laws: Understanding the Laws and Their Limitations|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|date=February 2002|doi=10.2307/3343240|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamie_Chriqui/publication/10945972_State_Medical_Marijuana_Laws_Understanding_the_Laws_and_Their_Limitations/links/09e4150c7b6221516a000000/State-Medical-Marijuana-Laws-Understanding-the-Laws-and-Their-Limitations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1970: The [[Controlled Substances Act]] is enacted, officially prohibiting cannabis for any use (medical included) at the federal level.

The '''Torghut''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: Торгууд/Torguud, "Guardsman" or "the [[Silk]]s") are one of the four major subgroups of the [[Four Oirats]]. The Torghut nobles  traced its descent to the Keraite ruler [[Keraites#Khanate|Tooril]] also many Torghuts descended from the [[Keraites]].

==History==
They might have been [[kheshig]]s of the [[Great Khan]]s before [[Kublai Khan]]. The Torghut clan first appeared as an Oirat group in the mid-16th century. After the collapse of the Four Oirat Alliance, the majority of the Torghuts under [[Kho Orluk]] separated from other Oirat groups and moved west to the [[Volga]] region in 1630, forming the core of the [[Kalmyks]]. A few Torghut nobles followed Toro Baikhu Gushi Khan to [[Qinghai Lake]] (Koke Nuur), becoming part of the so-called [[Upper Mongols]]. In 1698, 500 Torghuts went on pilgrimage to [[Tibet]] but were unable to return. Hence, they were resettled in [[Ejin River]] by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of China's [[Qing dynasty]]. In 1699 15,000 Torghut households returned from the Volga region to Dzungaria where they joined the [[Khoit]]s. After the fall of the [[Dzungar Khanate]], one of their princes, Taiji Shyiren, fled west to the Volga region with 10,000 families in 1758. The name Torghut probably originates from the Mongolian word "torog" meaning "silk."

Due to harsh treatment by [[Russia]]n governors, most Torghuts eventually migrated back to [[Dzungaria]] and western [[Mongolia]], departing en masse on January 5, 1771.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&amp;pg=PA295#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Perdue 2009], p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; While the first phase of their movement became the Old Torghuts, the Qing called the later Torghut immigrants "New Torghut". The size of the departing group has been variously estimated between 150,000 and 400,000 people, with perhaps as many as six million animals (cattle, sheep, horses, camels and dogs).&lt;ref name="defrancis"&gt;DeFrancis, John.  ''In the Footsteps of Genghis Khan''.  University of Hawaii Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beset by raids, thirst and starvation, approximately 85,000 survivors made it to [[Dzungaria]], where they settled near the [[Ejin River]] with the permission of the Qing Emperor.&lt;ref name="defrancis"/&gt; The Torghuts were coerced by the Qing into giving up their nomadic lifestyle and to take up sedentary agriculture instead as part of a deliberate policy by the Qing to enfeeble them.

The Kalmuks on the river Tekes had not sent the assistance demanded by the Governor, being angry that he had not assisted them when they had been attacked a few months before by the Kara-Kirghiz. At last, however, when their great temple on the Ili had been plundered by the Dungans, their Lama excited them to revenge. They therefore marched down to near Ili and signally defeated the insurgents, who after that dared no longer show themselves in the vicinity. The harvest was now ripe, and the grain was greatly needed by the suffering garrison and town population, but no one dared to reap it for fear of the Dungans. The Governor therefore ordered the Kalmuks to gather the harvest, but, as they were nomads who despised agriculture, they refused, and when threats were offered, they all decamped, and no persuasions could bring them back. After their departure the Dungans immediately resumed operations. Of the frightful position of affairs in the fortress, we learn something from Colonel Reinthal, who was there in July and September 1865, to obtain information on the position. It is much to be regretted that the Russian Government did not act upon the information contained in his reports, and either give some active support to the Chinese authorities, or itself occupy the country to prevent bloodshed. The scarcity of provisions in Ili became such that the Governor at last saw himself obliged to dismiss his last auxiliaries, the Thagor Kalmuks. In the meantime both Solons and Sibos were being attacked and plundered, and were obliged to make peace with the insurgents, so that only Ili, Khorgos, Losigun, and Suidun, remained in the hands of the Mantchus. Ili was now entirely surrounded, and it was resolved to reduce it by famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1876 |title=Turkistan: 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZQxe8V1X4EC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=	Sampson Low, Marston, Searle &amp;Rivington |edition=5 |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1876 |title=Turkistan: 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZQxe8V1X4EC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=	Sampson Low, Marston, Searle &amp;Rivington |edition=5 |page=181 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schuyler  |first=Eugene |date=1876|title=Turkistan: Notes of a Journey in Russian Turkistan, Khokand, Bukhara and Kuldja, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TtbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=	S.

A group of around 70,000 Torghuts were left behind in Russia, since (according to legend) the [[Volga River]] was not frozen and they could not cross it to join their comrades.&lt;ref name="defrancis"/&gt;  This group became known as the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]], or "remnant",&lt;ref name="defrancis"/&gt; although the name may predate these events. However, Muslims called the Kalmyks before.  In any case, the remnant population doubling their numbers by 1930.&lt;ref name="defrancis"/&gt;  Torghut-Kalmyk archers under the command of the notable Russian general [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] clashed with the [[France|French]] army of the legendary [[Napoleon]] in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Hoàng, Ingrid Cranfield-Genghis Khan, p.323&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the Qing put western [[Mongolia]]'s New Torghuts under the [[Altai district]]. One New Torghut prince opposed independence in Mongolia and fled to Xinjiang in 1911-12. However, the others were reincorporated into Mongolia's far western [[Khovd Province]].

Torghut forces assisted the Russians in the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]].

Today, Torghut descendants number more than 150,000 in [[Xinjiang]], [[China]] and more than 10,000 in [[Khovd Province]], Mongolia. There are around 170,000 Kalmyks in [[Russia]].

An exhibition in memorial to the Torghut exodus from the Volga to the Qing Empire is found at the [[Putuo Zongcheng Temple|Potala Palace]], [[Chengde]].

{{Women in society sidebar}}

Women in [[Russian culture|Russian society]] have a rich and varied history during numerous regimes throughout the centuries. It is important to note that since Russia is a multicultural society, the experiences of '''women in Russia''' vary significantly across ethnic, racial, religious, and social lines. The life of an [[Russians|ethnic Russian]] woman can be dramatically different from the life of a [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]], [[Chechen people|Chechen]], or [[Yakuts]] (Sakha) woman; just as the life of a woman from a lower-class rural family can be different from the life of a woman from an upper-middle-class urban family. Nevertheless, a common historical and political context provides a room for speaking about women in Russia in general.

==History==
[[File:C22693-gorbanevskaya02.jpg|150 px|thumb|left|[[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] in Moscow, 2005]]
Archaeological evidence suggests that the present day territory of Russia was inhabited since [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times: 1.5-million-year-old [[Oldowan]] flint tools were discovered in the [[Dagestan]] Akusha region of the north Caucasus, demonstrating the presence of early humans in Russia from a very early time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chepalyga|first1=A.L.|last2=Amirkhanov|first2=Kh.A.|last3=Trubikhin|first3=V.M.|last4=Sadchikova|first4=T.A.|last5=Pirogov|first5=A.N.|last6=Taimazov|first6=A.I.|title=Geoarchaeology of the earliest paleolithic sites (Oldowan) in the North Caucasus and the East Europe|url=http://paleogeo.org/article3.html|publication-date=2011|accessdate=2013-12-18|quote=Early Paleolithic cultural layers with tools of oldowan type was discovered in East Caucasus (Dagestan, Russia) by Kh. Amirkhanov (2006) [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The direct ancestors of Russians are the [[Eastern Slavs]] and the [[Finno-Ugric peoples]]. For most of the 20th century, the history of Russia is essentially that of the [[Soviet Union]]. Its fall in 1991 led, as in most of the former communist bloc countries of Eastern Europe, to an economic collapse and other social problems. 

Women in Russia are not a monolithic group, because the country itself is very diverse: there are almost 200 national/ethnic groups in Russia (77.7% being Russians - as of 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and although most of the population is (at least nominally)  [[Russian Orthodoxy|Christian Orthodox]], other religions are present too, such as [[Islam]] (approximately 6% - see [[Islam in Russia]]). 

Famous women in Russian history include [[Anna of Russia]], [[Elizabeth of Russia]], [[Catherine the Great]], and [[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova]].

==Eighteenth-century Russia==
[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-08.jpg|thumb|200px|Young women offer berries to visitors to their [[izba]] home, 1909. Photograph by [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky]].]]
Women of eighteenth-century Russia were luckier than their European counterparts in some ways; in others, the life of a Russian woman was more difficult. The eighteenth-century was a time of social and legal changes that began to affect women in a way that they had never before experienced.  [[Peter the Great]] ruled Russia from 1682–1725 and in that time brought about many changes to Russian culture, altering the orthodox traditions that had been observed since the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The three major social classes present during these reforms experienced changes in varying degrees according to their proximity to the tsar and urban settings where reforms could be more strictly enforced. Large cities underwent the westernization process more rapidly and successfully than the outlying rural villages. Noblewomen, merchant class women, and peasant (serf) women each witnessed Petrine reforms differently. For the lower classes it was not until the end of the eighteenth-century (during the time of [[Catherine the Great]]’s reign) that they began to see any changes at all. When these reforms did begin to change women’s lives legally, they also helped to expand their abilities socially. The [[Government reform of Peter the Great|Petrine reforms]] of this century allowed for more female participation in society, when before they were merely an afterthought as wives and mothers.  “The change in women’s place in Russian society can be illustrated no better than by the fact that five women ruled the empire, in their own names, for a total of seventy years.”&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|last=Pushkareva|first=Natalia|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=1997|location=Armonk, NY|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal changes===
Arguably the most important legal change that affected women’s lives was the Law of Single Inheritance instituted by Peter the Great in 1714. The law was supposed to help the tax revenue for Russia by banning the allowance of noble families to divide their land and wealth among multiple children. This law effectively ended the practice of excluding women from inheriting patrimonial estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosslyn|first=Wendy|title=Women and Gender in 18th-Century Russia|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington, VT|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
The Law of Single Inheritance was clarified in the decree of 1725. It sought to address the question of married daughter’ inheritance rights. The law mandated that if a man was survived by unmarried daughters, the eldest girl would inherit his estate, while the remaining sisters would divide his movable property. His married daughters would receive nothing, however, since they would have received dowries at the time they married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamarche- Marrese|first=Michelle|title=A Woman's Kingdom: Noblewomen and the Control of Property in Russia, 1700-1861|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1730 Anna Ivanova revoked the Law of Single Inheritance, as it had been a major point of contestation among the nobility since Peter first announced it in 1714. After 1731, property rights were expanded to include inheritance in land property. It also gave women greater power over the estates in that had been willed to them, or received in their wedding dowry.&lt;ref name=Marrese&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamarche-Marrese|first=Michelle|title=A Woman's Kingdom: Noblewomen and the Control of Property in Russia, 1700-1861|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=NY|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education for women===
In pre-Petrine centuries the Russian tsars had never been concerned with educating their people, neither the wealthy nor the serfs. Education reforms were a large part of Petrine westernization; however, it was not until Catherine II’s reforms that education rights applied to both men and women of each class. Education for girls occurred mainly in the home because they were focused on learning about their duties as wife and mother rather than getting an education. “The provision of formal education for women began only in 1764 and 1765, when Catherine II established first the [[Smolny Institute]] for girls of the nobility in St. Petersburg and then the [[Novodevichii Institute]] for the daughters of commoners.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisha|first=Robin|title=Russian Women, 1698-1917 Experience and Expression: An Anthology of Sources.|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the nobility===
In the eighteenth-century Petrine reforms and enlightenment ideas brought both welcome and unwelcome changes required of the [[Russian nobility]] and aristocratic families. Daughters in well-to-do families were raised in the terem, which was usually a separate building connected to the house by an outside passageway.&lt;ref name=Pushkareva&gt;{{cite book|last=Pushkareva|first=Natalia|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The terem was used to isolate girls of marriageable age and was intended to keep them "pure" (sexually inexperienced). These girls were raised solely on the prospect of marrying to connect their own family to another aristocratic family. Many rural and urban lower classes houses had no space to separate young women so there was no designated terem to keep them isolated. Women of lower classes had to live and work with their brothers, fathers, and husbands as well as manage all household matters along with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pushkareva|first=Natalia|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriage customs changed gradually with the new reforms instituted by Peter the Great; average marriageable age increased, especially in the cities among the wealthier tier of people closest to the tsar and in the public eye. “By the end of the eighteenth-century, brides in cities were usually fifteen to eighteen years old, and even in villages young marriages were becoming more and more rare.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pushkareva|first=Natalia|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Marriage laws were a significant aspect of the Petrine reforms, but had to be corrected or clarified by later tsars because of their frequent ambiguities. 
In 1753, a decree was issued to assure that noble families could secure their daughter’s inheritance of land by making it a part of the dowry that she would have access to once she was married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pushkareva|first=Natalia|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, New York|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The constant change in property rights was an important part of the Petrine reforms that women witnessed. Family as well as marriage disputes often went to the court system because of the confusion about the dowry, and the rights it was supposed to ensure, in the event of a father’s death or in disputed divorces. For women, the right to own and sell property was a new experience that only came because of Russia’s gradual westernization in the eighteenth century.

===Women in the merchant class===
Merchant class women also enjoyed newly granted freedoms to own property and manage it; with this new right upper class women gained more independence from their patriarchal restrictions. Wives of merchant class men had more independence than wives of the nobility or peasants because of the nature of their husband’s work, especially when their husbands were away from home on government service, as they were frequently and for long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pushkareva|first=Natalia|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The rights of married women from the nobility and merchantry to own and manage their own property offered them an opportunity to become involved in commercial and manufacturing ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisha|first=Robin|title=Russian Women, 1698-1917 Experience and Expression: An Anthology of Sources|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the peasantry===
A life among the peasant class was hard whether that peasant was male or female; each led lives filled with strenuous labor. They participated in work in the fields and in the making of handicrafts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Women were expected to do domestic work such as cooking, weaving clothes, and cleaning for their families. During planting and harvest time, when help was needed in the fields, women worked with their husbands to plow, sow seeds, then collect and prepare the crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpern- Engel|first=Barbara|title=Women in Russia, 1700-2000|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Early in the eighteenth-century, the average age for peasant girls to marry was around twelve years old. At this time they were still learning what would be expected of them as wives and also needed their parent’s consent to marry. “The requirement of the law code of 1649 that girls not marry before the age of fifteen was rarely observed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pushkareva|first=Natalia|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=1997|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Various permissions for marriage were required; widows and unmarried women living on government owned property had to obtain the permission of the village assembly before they could marry anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosslyn|first=Wendy|title=Women and Gender in 18th- Century Russia|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington, VT|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Young peasant women (like other Russian women) spent far more of their child-bearing years as married women than their counterparts in Western Europe did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpern-Engel|first=Barbara|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Childbirth was dangerous for both mother and child in the eighteenth-century but if a peasant woman was able to, she could potentially give birth, on average, to seven children. In the harsh climate of the Russian steppe, and a life of labor from an early age, perhaps half of all children would live to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpern-Engel|first=Barbara|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;   “The birth of her first child, preferably a son, established her position in her husband’s household. As she continued to bear sons, her status further improved.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpern- Engel|first=Barbara|title=Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Russian peasant families needed help in the fields and to manage the household; not being able to hire anyone for these tasks, children were the only way to get the help they needed. Having a son ensured that the family name would continue as well as any property they might own, though as Petrine reforms came into effect, it began to be equally profitable to have a girl.
However, women of any class could turn infrequently to the ecclesiastical courts to resolve their marital conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosslyn|first=Wendy|title=Women and Gender in 18th-Century Russia|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington, VT|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1850 to 1917: Feminist Reforms==
[[File:Smolny_Institute,_a_lesson.jpg|thumb|left|A lesson at [[Smolny Institute]] school for girls, 1913-1914]]
[[File:Anna_Filosovova.jpg|thumb|[[Anna Filosofova]]]]
By the mid-nineteenth century, European notions of equality were starting to take hold in Russia. In 1859 St. Petersburg University allowed women to audit its courses, but the policy was revoked just four years later. In the 1860s a feminist movement began to coalesce in St. Petersburg. It was led by [[Anna Filosofova]], [[Nadezhda Stasova]], and [[Mariia Trubnikova]], who together were known as the "triumvirate." Along with members of the St Petersburg literati, such as [[Evgenia Konradi]], they petitioned universities to educate women and wrote to prominent male figures to support their cause.&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Feminism and Bolshevism: two worlds, two ideologies | last1=Malysheva | first1=Marina | translator-last1=-Pilkington | translator-first1=Hilary | title= Women in the face of change: the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China | editor1=Shirin Rai | editor2=Hilary Pilkington | editor3=Annie Phizacklea | location=London | publisher=Routledge | p=188 | date=1992 | isbn=0-415-07540-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group also founded organizations to help unattached women become financially self-sufficient, and in 1878 they created the [[Bestuzhev Courses]], which for the first time gave Russia's women reliable access to higher education. By the early 1900s Russia boasted more female doctors, lawyers, and teachers than almost any country in Europe—a fact noted with admiration by many foreign visitors. However, most of these educational benefits were being reaped by urban women from the middle and upper classes. While literacy rates were slowly spreading throughout the country, educational and other opportunities for peasant women were still relatively few.

In 1910, Poliksena Shishkina-Iavein, the first female gynecologist in Russia, became president of the [[Russian League for Women's Rights]]. The League made universal women's suffrage its primary goal, and under Shishkina-Iavein's leadership the women's suffrage movement gained a great deal of popular support, both in Russia and abroad. In March 1917, the Provisional Government, which had replaced [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s autocracy, granted Russia's women the right to vote and hold political office. It was the first such reform enacted by a major political power.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthchild, R. (2010).

==Soviet era==
{{main|Women in the Russian Revolution|Soviet women in World War II|Women in the Russian and Soviet military}}

During the 70 years of [[Soviet Union|Soviet Era]], women’s roles were complex.&lt;ref&gt;Ilič, Melanie. ''Women in the Stalin Era''. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001., 2&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Soviet Russia became a vital part of the mobilization into the work force and this opening, of women into sectors that was previously unattainable, allowed opportunities for education, personal development, and training. Women’s responsibility as the ideal industrial Soviet woman meant that she was one who matched working quotas, never complained, and did everything for the betterment of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. These expectations were in addition to the standards demanded of them in the domestic sphere.

The legal equality of women and men was established during the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. Lenin saw women as a force of labor, that had previously been untapped and encouraged women to partake in the communist revolution. He stated, “Petty housework crushes, strangles, stultifies and degrades [the woman], chains her to the kitchen and to the nursery, and wastes her labor on barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve-racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3174213|title=Women in Russia and the Soviet Union|first=Barbara Alpern|last=Engel| authorlink = Barbara Engel (historian)|date=16 December 1987|publisher=|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=12|issue=4|pages=781–796|accessdate=|doi=10.1086/494366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women needed to be economically free from men, and this meant that there had to be an allowance of women to enter the work force. The number of women who entered the work force rose from 423,200 in 1923 to 885,000 in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Wendy Z. ''Women at the Gates: Gender and Industry in Stalin's Russia''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002., 12&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve this increase of women in the work force, the new communist government issued the First Family Code. This code separated marriage from the church, allowed a couple to choose a surname, gave illegitimate children the same rights as legitimate children, gave rights to maternal entitlements, health and safety protections at work, and provided women with the right to a divorce on extended grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Barbara Alpern; Anastasia Posadskaya-Vanderbeck, and Sona Stephan Hoisington. ''A Revolution of Their Own: Voices of Women in Soviet History''.71&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Soviet government legalized abortion. Labor laws also assisted women. Women were given equal rights in regards to insurance in case of illness, eight-week paid maternity-leave, and a minimum wage standard that was set for both men and women. Both sexes were also afforded paid holiday leave.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Buckley, Mary. ''Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; These measures were put into place to produce a quality labor force from both of the sexes. While the reality was that not all women were granted these rights, they established a pivot from the traditional systems of the Russian imperialist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To oversee this code and women’s freedoms, the communist party created a specialist women’s department, called the Zhenotdel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ilič, Melanie. ''Women in the Stalin Era''. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; The department produced propaganda encouraging more women to become a part of the urban population and the communist revolutionary party. The 1920s experienced changes in the urban centers of family policy, sexuality, and women’s political activism. The creation of the “new soviet woman”, who was self-sacrificing and dedicated to the revolutionary cause, paved the way for the expectation of women to come. In 1925, with the number of divorces increasing, Zhenotdel created the second family plan, proposing a common law marriage for couples that were living together. However, a year later, the government created a marriage law as a reaction to the ''de facto'' marriages that were causing inequality for women.&lt;ref name="Buckley, Mary 1989"&gt;Buckley, Mary. ''Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the policy implementation of the [[New Economic Policy|New Economic Plan]] (NEP), if a man left his ''de facto'' wife, she was left unable to secure assistance. Men had no legal ties and as such, if a woman got pregnant, he would be able to leave, and not be legally responsible to assist the woman or child; this led to an increase in the number of homeless children.&lt;ref name="Buckley, Mary 1989"/&gt; Because a ''de facto'' wife enjoyed no rights, the government sought to resolve this through the 1926 marriage law, granting registered and unregistered marriages equal rights and emphasized the obligations that came with marriage. 

By 1930, the Zhenotdel was disbanded, as the government claimed that their work was completed. Women began to enter the Soviet workforce at a scale that had never before been seen. However, in the mid-1930s, there was a return to the more traditional and conservative values in many areas of social and family policy. Abortion was made illegal, homosexuality was declared a crime, legal differences between legitimate and illegitimate children were restored, and divorce was once again difficult to attain.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Barbara Alpern. 1987. “Women in Russia and the Soviet Union”. ''Signs'' 12 (4). University of Chicago Press: 781–96. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174213&lt;/nowiki&gt;., 788&lt;/ref&gt; Women  became the heroine of the home and  made sacrifices for their husband and were to create a positive life at home that would “increase productivity and improve quality of work.”&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Mary. ''Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; The 1940s continued its traditional ideology and the nuclear family was the driving force of the time. Women held the social responsibility of motherhood that could not be ignored.

Some local women's organizations also existed. For example, a group of Azeri bolshevik women in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] founded the [[Ali Bayramov Club]], a women's club dedicated to the unveiling of Muslim women, promoting female literacy, giving women opportunities for vocational training and employment, and organizing leisure and cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Stalinist Russia, women also fell victim to the [[Great Purge]] that plagued the country. From 1934-1940, the number of women that were gulag prisoners rose from 30,108 to 108,898.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ilič, Melanie. ''Women in the Stalin Era''. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001., 133
&lt;/ref&gt; The women were not sent to hard labor camps, but rather worked at camps that were textile or sewing factories, and were only forced to perform hard labor as a punishment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women in the camps were often subjects of violence and/or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the same time, “Thank you literature” became a result of the personality cult that Stalin had implemented and articles in women’s magazines would praise Stalin for the work that he had done for women.

During [[World War II|WWII]], women exemplified the motherland and patriotism. Many became widowed during the war, making them more likely to be become impoverished. As men were called away to assist with the fighting, women stepped in and became in charge of state farms and large collective farms. In 1942, to meet harvest quotas, over half of the agricultural labor force was made up of women. They were not only assuming roles on collective farms, but 8,476 girls went into the Red army and Soviet navy to assist in the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War.]]&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Mary. ''Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The motto of the time became, “Soviet women gave all their strengthen to the motherland…no difficulties arising on the path to building peace could frighten them.”

The ban on abortion was repealed in 1955 - after almost 20 years of prohibition, abortion became legal again. After Stalin’s death, the Soviet government revoked the 1936 laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Указ Президиума ВС СССР от 5.08.1954 об отмене уголовной ответственности беременных женщин за производство аборта |trans_title=Decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Council of 05.08.1954 on the decriminalization of abortion for pregnant women |plaintitle= |wslink=Указ Президиума ВС СССР от 5.08.1954 об отмене уголовной ответственности беременных женщин за производство аборта |volume= |date=5 August 1954 |publisher= |location= |language=Russian |wslanguage=ru |noicon=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a new law on abortion.&lt;ref name="1955-11-12"&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Указ Президиума ВС СССР от 23.11.1955 об отмене запрещения абортов |trans_title=Decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Council of 11.23.1955 on the abolition of the prohibition of abortion |plaintitle= |wslink=Указ Президиума ВС СССР от 23.11.1955 об отмене запрещения абортов |volume= |date=23 November 1955 |publisher= |location= |language=Russian |wslanguage=ru |noicon=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RIAN_archive_612748_Valentina_Tereshkova.jpg|thumb|Valentina Tereshkova in 1969]]
[[Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova]] (Russian: Валенти́на Влади́мировна Терешко́ва; born 6 March 1937) was the [[Vostok 6|first woman to have flown in space]], having been selected from more than four hundred applicants and five finalists to pilot Vostok 6 on 16 June 1963. Before her recruitment as cosmonaut, Tereshkova was a textile factory assembly worker and an amateur skydiver. In order to join the Cosmonaut Corps, Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the Soviet Air Force and thus she also became the first civilian to fly in space. During her three-day mission, she performed various tests on herself to collect data on the female body's reaction to spaceflight.

The [[1977 Soviet Constitution]] supported women's rights both in public life (Art 35) and in family life (art Art 53). Yet, the Constitution was somewhat contradictory: although it ensured women's rights to education, in the workforce, and in the family; the emphasis on [[motherhood]] as the essential calling of women  was strong.&lt;ref&gt;''Women's Activism in Contemporary Russia'', by Linda Racioppi, Katherine O'Sullivan. See, pg 31-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rural Women in the Soviet Union and Post-Soviet Russia'', by Liubov Denisova, pg 80-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==
Most of the nominal state benefit programs for women continued into the post-Soviet era. However, as in the Soviet era, [[Russians|Russian]] women in the 1990s predominated in economic sectors where pay is low, and they continued to receive less pay than men for comparable positions. In 1995 men in health care earned an average of 50 percent more than women in that field, and male engineers received an average of 40 percent more than their female colleagues. Despite that, on average, women were better educated than men, women remained in the minority in senior management positions. In the later Soviet era, women's wages averaged 70 percent of men's; by 1995 the figure was 40 percent, according to the Moscow-based Center for Gender Studies. According to a 1996 report, 87 percent of employed urban Russians earning less than 100,000 [[ruble]]s a month were women, and the percentage of women decreased consistently in the higher wage categories.

According to reports, women generally are the first to be fired, and they face other forms of on-the-job discrimination as well. Struggling companies often fire women to avoid paying child care benefits or granting maternity leave, as the law still requires. In 1995 women constituted an estimated 70 percent of Russia's unemployed, and as much as 90 percent in some areas.

===Abuse===
Sociological surveys show that [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence]] against women increased at all levels of society in the 1990s. More than 13,000 [[rape]]s were reported in 1994, meaning that several times that number of that often-unreported crime probably were committed. In 1993 an estimated 14,000 women were murdered by their husbands or lovers,&lt;ref&gt;Russian Federation, the Russian Federation's National Report Prepared for the Fourth World Conference on Women. 1994:32.&lt;/ref&gt; about twenty times the figure in the United States and several times the figure in Russia five years earlier. More than 300,000 other types of crimes, including spousal abuse, were committed against women in 1994; in 1996 the State [[Duma]] (the lower house of the Federal Assembly, Russia's parliament) drafted a law against [[domestic violence]].

===Women's organizations===
Independent women's organizations, a form of activity  suppressed in the Soviet era, were formed in large numbers in the 1990s at the local, regional, and national levels. One such group is the Center for Gender Studies, a private research institute. The center analyzes demographic and social problems of women and acts as a link between Russian and [[Western culture|Western]] feminist groups. A traveling group called Feminist Alternative offers women assertiveness training. Many local groups have emerged to engage in court actions on behalf of women, to set up rape and domestic violence awareness programs (about a dozen of which were active in 1995), and to aid women in establishing businesses. Another prominent organization is the Women's Union of Russia, which focuses on job-training programs, career counseling, and the development of entrepreneurial skills that will enable women to compete more successfully in Russia's emerging market economy. Despite the proliferation of such groups and programs, in the mid-1990s most Russians (including many women) remained contemptuous of their efforts, which many regard as a kind of Western subversion of traditional (Soviet and even pre-Soviet) social values.

===Employment===
The rapidly expanding private sector has offered women new employment opportunities, but many of the Soviet stereotypes remain. The most frequently offered job in new businesses is that of ''sekretarja'' ([[secretary]]/receptionist), and advertisements for such positions in private-sector companies often specify physical attractiveness as a primary requirement (a requirement that is illegal in governmental organizations). Russian law provides for as much as three years' imprisonment for sexual harassment, but the law rarely is enforced. Although the Fund for Protection from Sexual Harassment has blacklisted 300 [[Moscow]] firms where sexual harassment is known to have taken place, demands for sex and even rape still are common on-the-job occurrences.

The law lists 456 occupations and 38 branches of industry than are forbidden to women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rbth.com/articles/2011/07/27/russian_women_equal_but_only_on_the_surface_13191.html|title=Russian women equal, but only on the surface|last=Darmaros|first=Marina|date=2011-07-27|work=Russia Beyond The Headlines|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are considered too dangerous to their health, especially reproductive health.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17226&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR - Russia’s list of banned jobs for women violated woman’s rights, needs amending – UN experts|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political participation===
Women's higher profile in post-Soviet Russia also has extended to politics. At the national level, the most notable manifestation of women's newfound political success has been the Women of Russia party, which won 11 percent of the vote and twenty-five seats in the 1993 national parliamentary elections. Subsequently, the party became active in a number of issues, including the opposition to the military campaign in [[Chechnya]] that began in 1994. In the 1995 national parliamentary elections, the Women of Russia chose to maintain its platform unchanged, emphasizing social issues such as the protection of children and women rather than entering into a coalition with other liberal parties. As a result, the party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold of votes required for proportional representation in the new State Duma, gaining only three seats in the single-seat portion of the elections. The party considered running a candidate in the 1996 presidential election but remained outside the crowded field.

A smaller organization, the Russian Women's Party, ran as part of an unsuccessful coalition with several other splinter parties in the 1995 elections. A few women, such as [[Ella Pamfilova]] of the Republican Party, Socialist Workers' Party chief Lyudmila Vartazarova, and [[Valeriya Novodvorskaya]], leader of the Democratic Union, have established themselves as influential political figures. Pamfilova has gained particular stature as an advocate on behalf of women and elderly people.

===Soldiers' Mothers Movement ===
The Soldiers' Mothers Movement was formed in 1989 to expose human rights violations in the armed forces and to help youths resist the draft. The movement has gained national prominence through its opposition to the war in [[Chechnya]]. Numerous protests have been organized, and representatives have gone to the Chechen capital, [[Groznyy]], to demand the release of Russian prisoners and locate missing soldiers. The group, which claimed 10,000 members in 1995, also has lobbied against extending the term of mandatory military service.

===Government officials===
Women have occupied few positions of influence in the executive branch of Russia's national government. One post in the Government (cabinet), that of minister of social protection, has become a "traditional" women's position; in 1994 Ella Pamfilova was followed in that position by Lyudmila Bezlepkina, who headed the ministry until the end of President [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s first term in mid-1996. Tat'yana Paramanova was acting chairman of the [[Russian Central Bank]] for one year before Yeltsin replaced her in November 1995, and Tat'yana Regent has been head of the Federal Migration Service since its inception in 1992. Prior to the 1995 elections, women held about 10 percent of the seats in parliament: fifty-seven of 450 seats in the State Duma and nine of 178 seats in the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. The Soviet system of mandating legislative seats generally allocated about one-third of the seats in republic-level legislatures and one-half of the seats in local soviets to women, but those proportions shrank drastically with the first multiparty elections of 1990.

==Contemporary situation==
Article 19 of the 1993 [[Constitution of Russia]] guarantees equal rights to women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-03.htm|title=Chapter 2. Rights and Freedoms of Man And Citizen - The Constitution of the Russian Federation|website=Constitution.ru|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Labour law, women have the right to paid maternity leave, paid parental leave, and unpaid parental leave, that can be extended until the child is 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trudkod.ru/chast-4/razdel-12/glava-41/st-255-tk-rf|title=Статья 255.

Women now have for generations worked outside the home; dual income families are the most common: the [[employment rate]] of women and men is 65.2% and 75.2% respectively (age 15-64, as of 2016).&lt;ref name="stats.oecd.org"/&gt; Nevertheless, women often face discrimination in the labour market; and the law itself lists 456 occupations and 38 branches of industry that are forbidden to women, as they are considered too dangerous to their health, especially reproductive health.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;  Despite this, many Russian women have achieved success in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/business/334948-russia-women-business-leaders/|title=Russia has largest number of female business leaders – US study|website=Rt.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-womens-day-business/russia-philippines-have-most-female-business-leaders-japan-ranks-lowest-idUSKCN0WA023|title=Russia, Philippines have most female business leaders, Japan ranks low|date=8 March 2016|accessdate=16 December 2017|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[total fertility rate]] of Russia is 1.61 as of 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, although below  replacement rate of 2.1, is still higher than in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/russian-demographics-perfect-storm|title=Russian Demographics: The Perfect Storm - YaleGlobal Online|website=Yaleglobal.yale.edu|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the position of women in [[Russia]]n society remains at least as problematic as in previous decades. In both cases, nominal legal protections for women either have failed to address the existing conditions or have failed to supply adequate support. In the 1990s, increasing economic pressures and shrinking government programs left women with little choice but to seek employment, although most available positions were as substandard as in the Soviet period, and generally jobs of any sort were more difficult to obtain. Such conditions contribute heavily to Russia's [[population decline|declining birthrate]] and the general deterioration of the [[family]]. At the same time, [[Feminism in Russia|feminist]] groups and social organizations have begun advancing the cause of women's rights in what remains a strongly traditional society.

While there has been an increase in the share of women in politics in Russia, this has not led to increased gender equality in Russian society overall.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Janet Elise|date=2016-09-01|title=Fast-Tracked or Boxed In?

Putin’s regime has promoted women to be “stand ins” during times of crisis or change, “loyalists” and “showgirls” when the regime needs to showcase elections and representation, and “cleaners” when the appearance of corruption threatens the regime."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Decriminalization of domestic violence===
In January 2017, the lower house of the Russian legislature decriminalized first time [[domestic violence]]. This applies to first offenses which do not cause serious injury, decreasing from a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment to a maximum of fifteen days in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38767873 "Russian MPs pass bill to soften domestic violence law"], ''BBC,'' 27 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It became an administrative offense, with the penalty for first offenses falling under the [[Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses|Administrative Code]], these usually being fines or suspended sentences if the accused is a family member, which constitutes the vast majority of domestic violence cases. For second offense and beyond, it is considered a criminal offense, prosecuted under the [[Criminal Code of Russia|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pnp.ru/social/2017/01/31/v-sovfede-podderzhali-zakonoproekt-o-dekriminalizacii-poboev-v-seme.html|title=Совфед поддержал законопроект о декриминализации побоев в семье|website=Pnp.ru|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was widely seen as part of a state-sponsored turn to traditional values under Putin and shift away from liberal notions of individual and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21715726-it-fits-traditional-values-lawmakers-say-why-russia-about-decriminalise-wife-beating|title=Why Russia is about to decriminalise wife-beating|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e523d036-e482-11e6-9645-c9357a75844a|title=Subscribe to read|website=Ft.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Putin signed the bill into law in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/europe/russia-domestic-violence-bill-putin/index.html|title=Putin signs law reducing punishment for domestic battery|last=CNN|first=Clare Sebastian and Antonia Mortensen|website=CNN|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian reported in February 2017 that "according to some estimates, one woman dies every 40 minutes from domestic abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/putin-approves-change-to-law-decriminalising-domestic-violence?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Facebook|title=Putin approves legal change that decriminalises domestic violence|last=Walker|first=Shaun|date=2017-02-07|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia has a long history of successful female skaters and gymnasts. [[Figure skating]] is a popular sport; in the 1960s the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant power in figure skating, especially in pairs skating and ice dancing; and this continued even after the fall the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/sports/articles/russian-sports|title=Russian Sports|website=Travelchannel.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic Gymnastics are among Russia's most popular sports; [[Svetlana Khorkina]] is one of the most successful female gymnasts of all time.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/kh/svetlana-khorkina-1.html|title=Svetlana Khorkina Bio, Stats, and Results|website=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian women are also internationally successful in many other sports, such as [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[basketball]], [[tennis]] and [[volleyball]].

==Human trafficking==
{{Main|Human trafficking in Russia}}
As in other former communist countries, the fall of the state [[planned economy]] after the collapse of the USSR, led to increased socioeconomic problems, such as unemployment, insecurity and crime. This created a fertile ground for [[human trafficking]], especially [[sex trafficking]].

Women and children who live in poverty are at most risk of becoming trafficking victims. [[Prostitution in Russia]] has spread rapidly in recent years, with women from small towns and rural areas migrating (willing or unwillingly) to big cities such as [[Moscow]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Omsk]], or [[Yekaterinburg]] to engage in prostitution. Russian women are also lured abroad with sham promises of jobs such as dancers, models, waitresses or domestic helpers and end up caught in [[forced prostitution]] situations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/eca/Unicef_EnglishBook(1).pdf]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825103217/https://www.unicef.org/eca/Unicef_EnglishBook(1).pdf |date=2017-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Russia has ratified the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|UN Trafficking Protocol]], and has taken steps to curb this phenomenon.

'''Zebulon Reed Brockway''' (April 28, 1827 – October 21, 1920) was a [[penologist]] and is sometimes regarded as the "Father of prison reform" and "Father of American Parole" in the [[United States]].

==Early life==
Brockway was born in [[Lyme, Connecticut]] in 1827.&lt;ref name=Beha&gt;James J. Beha, ''Redemption to Reform: The Intellectual Origins of the Prison Reform Movement, '' New York University Annual Survey of American Law, vol. 3, 773, 2007–2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Caroline Brockway. {{when|date=April 2014}} {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Career==
He began his career as a prison guard or{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} assistant warden at the state prison in [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=Beha/&gt; Brockway became a clerk at the Wethersfield prison by 23 years old.  Later he worked as assistant superintendent of the Municipal Alms House in [[Albany, New York]] for four years.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  He was made the  [[Monroe County, New York]] Penitentiary superintendent in 1854. There, he focused upon rehabilitation of the prisoners. In 1861, Brockway became the superintendent of the prison in [[Detroit]], where he attempted to introduce work and release supervision programs and "[[indeterminate sentence]]s". Brockway's chief innovation, though, was his attempt to establish the country's first indeterminate sentencing system. In 1869, Brockway drafted a law, passed by the Michigan legislature but overturned by the state Supreme Court, that would allow for the conditional and discretionary release of "common prostitutes."&lt;ref name=Beha/&gt;

When he was in Detroit, he got the inspiration for his prison reforms from Moses and Amos Pilsbury, who also brought about prison reforms. He began his reforms in Detroit. However, he resigned in 1872 when his ideas were no longer accepted.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Before the [[Elmira Reformatory]] was built, Brockway was already made the superintendent in 1876. While warden at the [[Elmira Correctional Facility|Elmira Reformatory]] in [[Upstate New York]] from 1876 to 1900, Brockway introduced a program of education, training in useful trades, physical activity, indeterminate sentences, inmate classification, and an incentive program. Brockway believed that the primary reason to have a prisoner in custody was to rehabilitate and not simply just to punish. By giving them the moral and spiritual guidance that they needed, Brockway believed that this was the key to helping them become better and useful citizens. He also used the idea of indeterminate sentence which would allow a prisoner to get parole sooner than he expected, because Brockway did not believe in fixed sentences either. His rules had two sides. One side was if a prisoner was well behaved and abided by the rules, then he would be rewarded. If a prisoner did not abide by the rules then he would be punished. These sets of rules came under scrutiny.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1893, his administration endured investigation into accusations of brutality at Elmira, but he retired at the age of 72 in 1900 after further criticism. Brockway was such a popular man in Elmira that he was elected mayor five years later at 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Corrections|year=2006|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-0-534-64652-3|pages=50–51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqrhUlY54jcC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;q=Zebulon%20Brockway%20brutality&amp;f=true#v=onepage|author1=Todd R. Clear |author2=George F. Cole |author3=Michael D. Reisig |accessdate=August 20, 2010|quote=Brockway even weathered an 1893 state investigation into charges of brutality at Elmira, which revealed that the whip and solitary confinement were used there regularly. However, in 1900 he was forced to resign in the face of mounting criticism of his administration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, he wrote ''Fifty Years of Prison Service: An Autobiography (1912)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockway|first1=Zebulon Reed|url=https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearspriso00brocgoog|title=Fifty Years of Prison Service: An Autobiography|location=New York, NY|publisher=Charities Publication Committee|date=1912|accessdate=15 Dec 2016|oclc=60736040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Zebulon Brockway died in 1920 at the age of 93.
