      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">'''101''' is a topic for beginners in any area. It has all the basic principles and concepts that is expected in a particular field.

In American university course numbering systems, the number 101 is often used for an introductory course at a beginner's level in a department's subject area. This common numbering system was designed to make [[articulation (education)|transfer between colleges]] easier. In theory, any numbered course in one [[academic institution]] should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Forest, J.J.F. (2002) ''Higher education in the United States: an encyclopedia'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=sFFX9OIkF2IC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=course%20numbering%20systems&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.73.] ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|1-57607-248-7}}. Retrieved October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The term was first introduced by the [[University of Buffalo]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engber|first1=Daniel|title=101 101|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/09/101_101.html|website=Slate|accessdate=9 May 2017|date=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a course catalog, the first known usage of the term by Oxford English dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/09/101_101.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this usage, the term "101" has been extended to mean an introductory level of [[learning]] or a collection of introductory materials to a topic.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Advanced Placement Spanish Literature and Culture''' (often referred to as '''AP Spanish Literature and Culture''', '''AP Spanish Literature''', '''AP Spanish Lit''' or '''AP SpLit''') is a [[high school]] course and examination offered by the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==The course==
This course is based on improving skills in written Spanish and critical reading of advanced [[Spanish literature|Spanish]] and [[Latin American literature]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically taught as a Spanish V or VI course. The AP Spanish Literature course is designed to be comparable to a third-year college/university introductory Hispanic literature course. Students concentrate on developing proficiency in reading and writing in preparation for the AP Spanish Literature examination. In addition, this course emphasizes mastery of linguistic competencies at a very high level of proficiency.

The course has a required reading list that draws from a variety of sources, including such well-known authors and poets as [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Tirso de Molina]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]], [[Alfonsina Storni]], [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Miguel de Unamuno]], as well as a miscellany of lesser-known short stories, poems, and novels. A complete list of the [http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/219542.html readings] is regulated annually by the College Board.  The course is meant to be taught entirely in Spanish, though [http://siempreleer.blogspot.com/ English translations] of the stories are often common resources for students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/spanish_lit/reading.html AP: Spanish Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exam==
The exam is divided into two sections with several parts. Section I, consisting of 65 multiple-choice questions, is split into two parts. Part A (15 questions) is the listening component, which includes a twice-recited poem, a recording of an interview with an author, and a presentation concerning a topic that relates to the course. Part B (50 questions) is reading comprehension based on a wide variety of works, including a literary criticism and selections from works that are not on the required reading list. 80 minutes is given for the entire section.&lt;ref&gt;http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Section II is free-response, containing two short-answer questions and two longer essays. The first question is based on an excerpt from a work on the required reading list, and students must name the author, identify the time period, and, most importantly, elaborate on the theme presented in the passage (15 minutes). The second question asks students to read an excerpt from a work on the required reading list and compare the theme presented to that of an accompanying piece of artwork (15 minutes). The third question tests students' ability to link a piece of literature on the required reading list to the greater genre or movement to which it belongs (35 minutes). Finally, the fourth question directs students to analyze the literary techniques in two excerpts, one of which is from a work on the required reading list, that are used to convey a shared theme (35 minutes). 100 minutes is allotted for this section.&lt;ref&gt;https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-spanish-literature-and-culture/about-the-exam&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/exam/exam_information/2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the test is approximately 3 hours in duration.

Notley came to prominence as a member of the second generation of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of poetry--although she has always denied being involved with the New School movement, or any specific movement in general--having been a workshop leader and frequent attendee and reader at the school's hub, the St. Mark's [[Poetry Project]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}  Notley's early work laid both formal and theoretical groundwork for several generations of poets; she is considered a pioneering voice on topics like motherhood and domestic life.  

Notley's experimentation with poetic form, seen in her books ''165 Meeting House Lane'', ''When I Was Alive'', ''The Descent of Alette'', and ''Culture of One'', ranges from a blurred line between genres, to a quotation-mark driven interpretation of the variable foot, to a full reinvention of the purpose and potential of strict rhythm and meter.  She also experimented with channeling spirits of deceased loved ones, primarily men gone from her life like her father and her husband, poet Ted Berrigan, and used these conversations as topics and form on her poetry. Her poems have also been compared to Gertrude Stein, as well as her contemporary Bernadette Mayer. Mayer and Notley both used their experience as mothers and wives in their work.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

In addition to poetry, Notley has written a book of criticism (''Coming After'', University of Michigan, 2005), a play ("Anne's White Glove"—performed at the Eye &amp; Ear Theater in 1985), a biography (''Tell Me Again'', Am Here, 1982), and she has edited three publications, Chicago, Gare du Nord, and Scarlet.  Notley's collage art appeared in [[Rudy Burckhardt]]'s film "Wayward Glimpses" and her illustrations have appeared on the cover of numerous books, including a few of her own. As is often written in her biographical notes, "she has never tried to be anything other than a poet," and with over forty books and chapbooks and several major awards, she is one of the most prolific and lauded American poets today.

==Early life==
Notley was born on November 8, 1945 in [[Bisbee, Arizona]] and grew up in [[Needles, California]].  Notley wrote extensively of her childhood and early life in her book ''Tell Me Again'' (Am here, 1982).

Notley left Needles for NYC to attend Barnard in 1963, desiring an escape from the isolation of her hometown.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets&lt;/ref&gt;  She received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Barnard College]] in spring 1967 and left NYC that fall for the fiction program at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. She was the only woman in her genre and one of two in the entire graduate writing department.  Notley cites—in part—a reading by [[Robert Creeley]] as early inspiration for her writing more poetry.  A close relationship with the poet [[Anselm Hollo]], who was teaching at the program at that time, led to Notley leaving Iowa City for Morocco in 1968.  Notley claims it was boring and returned to Iowa City where she met the poet [[Ted Berrigan]] who began as an instructor at the school that fall.&lt;ref&gt;http://jacket2.org/commentary/conversation-alice-notley-poets-novel&lt;/ref&gt;

After Notley's graduation, she and Berrigan spent periods of time in NYC and Buffalo.  During the winter of 1970-71, Notley and Berrigan lived on Long Island, where Notley wrote her first book, ''165 Meeting House Lane'' (Twenty-Four Sonnets).  The book took its title from the address of their home on Long Island and was published by Berrigan's C Press.  It bears a dedication to [[James Schuyler]] and Anne and [[Fairfield Porter]], who were also residing together on Long Island at the time.  Notley also thanks [[Tom Clark (poet)|Tom Clark]] who would go on to re-publish the sonnet cycle in his anthology ''All Stars.''&lt;ref&gt;Notley, Alice. ''165 Meeting House Lane.'' New York: C Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notley and Berrigan spent the several months between Long Island and Chicago in [[Bolinas, California]], which is where Berrigan officially printed ''165 Meeting House Lane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue3/renhist.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118060058/http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue3/renhist.html |archivedate=January 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notley's second book, Phoebe Light, was published in 1973 by [[Bill Berkson]]'s Bolinas-based press Big Sky.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigbridge.org/bol-11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==1972-75: Chicago &amp; Essex==
In 1972, Notley married Berrigan and the two moved to Chicago where Berrigan had been given [[Ed Dorn]]'s newly vacated teaching position at [[Northeastern Illinois University]].  Notley and Berrigan joined an already active community of Chicago poets, including [[Paul Carroll (poet)|Paul Carroll]], [[Paul Hoover]], and [[Maxine Chernoff]]. Notley gave birth to their first son, [[Anselm Berrigan]], named after Anselm Hollo, in 1972, as well.

At Berrigan's behest, his students at Northeastern became very active members of the local poetry scene, starting magazines and reading series.  One group of students—Darlene Pearlstein, Peter Kostakis, and Richard Friedman—started a small poetry press, The Yellow Press, which would go on to publish two books by Notley, one book by Berrigan, and give out a yearly Ted Berrigan Prize—overseen in part by Notley—for a first book (though the press would cease publishing two years in).  Young poets on the Chicago scene regularly hung out with Notley and Berrigan at their home and many followed the couple back to New York City in the late 70s.  The circle of younger poets who spent time with Notley and Berrigan included the aforementioned members of the Yellow Press team, Barbara Barg, Rochelle Kraut, Rose Lesniak, Bob Rosenthal, Steve Levine, Simon Schuchat, Tim Milk, and several others.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Barbara Barg, Rose Lesniak, and Tim Milk.  November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Chicago, Notley started publishing her magazine ''Chicago'', a legal-sized mimeograph publication which would continue through both her pregnancies and even her relocation to England.  Notley began the magazine to connect with preexisting poet friends and meet new writers on both coasts while living in the midwest.  The magazine ran for eight issues, three of which were published while Notley and Berrigan lived in England.  Notley edited seven of the issues with Berrigan taking over one while Notley was pregnant with their first son.  The artist [[George Schneeman]], perhaps most famous for his artworks that appeared on the covers of dozens of books of poetry, did all of the covers for the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://theconversant.org/?p=5891&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Berrigan got a job as a visiting poet at [[University of Essex]], so Notley and Berrigan, with their son Anselm, relocated first to [[London]], then to [[Brightlingsea]] in [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://barzakh.net/site/issue-01/286 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908091945/http://barzakh.net/site/issue-01/286 |archivedate=September 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in England, Notley would write her second sonnet cycle ''Great Interiors, Wines and Spirits of the World,'' which was originally published in a Notley-themed issue of the Chicago magazine Out There.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onedit.net/issue5/alicen/24.html&lt;/ref&gt;

From February through June 1974 in [[Wivenhoe]], Essex, Notley wrote her book ''Songs for the Unborn Second Baby'' (United Artists, 1979). While Notley had written on motherhood prior to ''Songs'', this book was her first to focus fully on the matter and is the first full-length book of a [[New York School (art)|New York School]]-affiliated poet to take on the task of addressing poetry's sexism and the pressures and setbacks of motherhood in both personal and creative life. Notley gave birth to her and Berrigan's second child, [[Edmund Berrigan]], at Colchester Hospital in 1974.

The couple returned to Chicago for a brief period of time after their year in England before moving to New York City in 1976.

==1976-92: New York City==

1976 saw Notley and Berrigan moving their family permanently to New York City's [[Lower East Side]], where they'd live together until Berrigan's death in 1983.  Their apartment at 101 St. Mark's Place again became a hub for both young writers and Berrigan and Notley's contemporaries.  Notley remained fairly prolific during this era, writing and publishing several full-length collections.  Perpetually strapped for cash, the two took on whatever small jobs they could to support the family.  Notley and Berrigan were frequent instructors at [[Naropa University]]'s summer writing program.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/naropa?sort=titleSorter&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Notley's most famous engagements with the poetry community while in NYC were her workshops at the [[Poetry Project]] at St. Mark's Church, which were attended by dozens of young poets including [[Bob Holman]], [[Patricia Spears Jones]], [[Steve Carey]], and Susie Timmons. [[Eileen Myles]] wrote of her experience in Notley's workshops in her books ''Chelsea Girls'' (Black Sparrow Press, 2004; Ecco, 2015) and ''Inferno'' (O/R Books, 2010). Of her 1983 workshop, Notley wrote:

{{Quote|text=I expect my workshop will be similar to past Alice Notley workshops: same old format, assignments, xeroxes, forms, occasions, geometries, kinds of poems, speculations on and practice of the lofty and the silly.  I assume I've learned a little more since the last time I taught, and that I've a little more to learn in the teaching.  If not, boo hoo.  Other possible issues: goofy works, "description," dreams (the new gen), school of Susie Timmons, rejuvenation of the "found work," the "line," how to be like Elinor [Nauen] and Maggie [Dubris], how to cultivate inventiveness, strategies for dry spell, dictionaries, diaries, little plays, calligrams, tiles, left-hand margins, how to get great theories and general self-improvement. 
&lt;ref&gt;The Poetry Project Newsletter, 1983: http://cassandragillig.tumblr.com/post/105654929667/1983{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; |author=Alice Notley}}

In 1986, Notley led a workshop where participants were required to write an entire book during the course of their meetings.  After the workshop ended, Notley teamed up with students to print copies of their works on the mimeograph machine in the St. Mark's basement.  The books were published under the imprint Unimproved Editions and Notley made cover art for the majority of the titles.&lt;ref&gt;Reading in Buffalo, New York, April 10, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  Her own book, entitled ''Parts of a Wedding,'' was published first in a small edition by Unimproved Editions then later as a section of the O Books anthology ''O One.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obookspoetry.org/o-onean-anthology/&lt;/ref&gt;

Berrigan's death in 1983 struck the poetry community exceptionally hard and over the next decade, Notley would suffer the loss of many others who were close to her.  Notley's 1985 play "Anne's White Glove," a commission by [[Ada Katz]]'s [[Eye and Ear Theater]] navigated the pain of Berrigan's death, and her collections ''Margaret &amp; Dusty'' (Coffee House, 1985), ''Parts of a Wedding'' (Unimproved Editions, 1986), and ''At Night the States'' (The Yellow Press, 1987) contain material written during a period of mourning.  Notley's elegiac work during this era, including her poems "Beginning With a Stain" and "At Night the States," is some of her most widely celebrated.

==1992-present: Paris==

In 1992, Notley moved to [[Paris]] with her second husband, the British poet and novelist [[Douglas Oliver]] (1937–2000), whom she met while living in England in 1974.  The two worked on two magazines together, Gare du Nord and Scarlet, and self-published a compendium of their own books, ''The Scarlet Cabinet,'' which contained Notley's ''Descent of Alette.'' ''Descent'' would grow to be Notley's most widely read and taught collection after its reprinting by Penguin in 1996. Notley has remained in Paris but makes several trips to the United States each year to give readings and teach small workshops. Some have linked Notley's geographical move to Paris—since it followed a period of intensely personal writing—as also marking a creative distance between herself and her poems, though her books ''Mysteries of Small Houses'' (Penguin, 1998) and ''Culture of One'' (Penguin, 2011) engage very much with personal matter.

In 1999, Notley was both a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a winner of the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]] for Poetry. In spring 2001, she received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the [[Poetry Society of America]]'s [[Shelley Memorial Award]]. This period also marked an increase in scholarly interest in Notley's work.

Notley has stayed very involved in the preservation of both Berrigan and Oliver's works, having edited and written introductions for a number of their books and she continues to be a prolific and powerful force in contemporary poetry, winning the Leonore Marshall Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2015/05/alice-notley-awarded-2015-ruth-lilly-poetry-prize/]&lt;/ref&gt; Several poems from her 2007 collection ''In the Pines'' were set to music by the Canadian [[indie pop]] band [[AroarA]] for their [[2014 Polaris Music Prize]]-nominated 2013 EP ''In the Pines''&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/AroarA AroarA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=March 1, 2016 }} at [[CBC Music]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in Fall 2014, a conference celebrating Notley's work was held at the Bay Area Public School in Oakland, California.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/08/bay-area-public-school-announces-three-day-symposium-on-alice-notley/&lt;/ref&gt; Over two nights, November 14 and 15, 2016, Notley read ''The Descent of Alette'' in its entirety at [[The Lab (organization)|The Lab]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelab.org/projects/2016/10/20/alice-notley-the-descent-of-alette&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Accounting and Finance Association''' ('''BAFA''') is a [[learned society]] and research organisation dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of accounting, finance and financial management. It has over 750 members and edits the [[British Accounting Review]], an [[academic journal]].

The association is a UK [[registered charity]] no. 299527&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=299527&amp;subid=0 Charity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Overview==

BAFA promotes the development of innovative approaches to research and teaching in accounting and finance, and celebrates the breadth and diversity of research by UK and international researchers.

It collaborates with other organisations, such as the [[Academy of Social Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.acss.org.uk/mem-soc/&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[British Academy]], and professional accounting bodies, to promote accounting and finance as a social science that influences professional practice and affects the economy and society.

In addition to publishing the scholarly journal, the British Accounting Review, BAFA hosts an annual conference in April that attracts academics and professionals from around the world.

==History==

The Association of University Teachers of Accounting (AUTA) was formed in 1947 with Donald Cousins as its first Chairman&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bromwich|first=Michael|last2=Macve|first2=Richard|last3=Ranger|first3=Debbie|title=Will Baxter: 100 Years Young|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bar.2006.04.001|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=38|issue=2|pages=221–223|doi=10.1016/j.bar.2006.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It held its inaugural meeting in December of that year at a time when the UK’s first accounting professorships were being created and accountancy was becoming recognised as a subject for scholarly study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeff|first=Stephen A.|title=The early years of the Association of University Teachers of Accounting: 1947–1959|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0890-8389(97)80002-9|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=29|issue=1-2|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0890-8389(97)80002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The AUTA followed in the footsteps of the Accounting Research Organisation, which had been established in 1936, although it had ceased activities by 1941. Harold Edey had an important role in the early years, in particular ensuring that the academic study of accounting was given value by the profession&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macve|first=Richard|date=2007-06-01|title=In Memoriam: Harold Edey|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00014788.2007.9730063|journal=Accounting and Business Research|volume=37|issue=2|pages=95–95|doi=10.1080/00014788.2007.9730063|issn=0001-4788}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

As a result of the small number of both researchers and teachers in accounting during the 1960s – Parker (1997, p.45) lists a mere 21 in the whole country – and because of a distinct lack of engagement at the time from the profession, the organisation almost disappeared. However, it was given a new lease of life later in that decade when the AUTA News Review was set up (although a Newsletter had existed on a more ad hoc basis since its first issue in 1948 with Will Baxter its Editor)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This publication was renamed the AUTA Review in 1974 and it then became the British Accounting Review in 1984&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maunders|first=Keith|title=The AUTA/BAA 1971–1996: Living in interesting times|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0890-8389(97)80004-2|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=29|issue=1-2|pages=63–79|doi=10.1016/s0890-8389(97)80004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Around the same time, a set of regional associations were also established, which allowed universities outside London to establish their own research foci in the accounting area. The Scottish Accountants Group ran their initial conference in April 1967 while the Northern Accountants Group also first met in that month with its first conference organised by Robert Parker taking place in October of the same year. By the end of the next decade, South-eastern and South-western groups had also been formed. 

Two of BAFA’s other sub-committees, the Conference of Professors of Accounting and Finance (CPAF) and the Committee of Departments of Accounting and Finance (CDAF) were both established in 1987 as the Conference of Professors of Accounting and the Committee of Heads of Accounting in Polytechnics respectively, although the latter was initially organised as a separate entity to the AUTA&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

The tradition of holding a broad-based conference in April with location moving around the United Kingdom began in 1949 in Birmingham. The organisation stopped holding conferences from 1959 to 1970 but these began again in 1971 with 62 attendees, and have been held annually since then with participant numbers growing to over 300&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=R.H.|title=Flickering at the margin of existence: The Association of University Teachers of Accounting, 1960–1971|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0890-8389(97)80003-0|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=29|issue=1-2|pages=41–61|doi=10.1016/s0890-8389(97)80003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The conference has included a Doctoral Colloquium since 1990. 

The AUTA became the British Accounting Association (BAA) in 1984 and the most recent chapter in the history of the organisation began in April 2012 when the BAA changed its name to the British Accounting and Finance Association (BAFA) to better match its wider remit spanning finance and financial management as well as accounting.

==Membership==

BAFA has over 750 members, comprising academics, students and accounting professionals. There are two levels of membership: ordinary and honorary.

Ordinary membership is by application and is open to anyone with an interest in research in accounting and finance.

Honorary membership is conferred by the executive committee, in recognition of services to accounting, finance and/or financial management education and research which are deemed worthy of recognition by the association.

BAFA is not a qualifying body for the purposes of practising accounting and finance.

==The British Accounting Review==

The [[British Accounting Review]] is the official journal of the British Accounting and Finance Association.  It publishes original scholarly papers covering the whole spectrum of accounting and finance.

The journal allows original research to reach academics, students, professional bodies and their members, accounting and auditing standards bodies, financial regulators and government departments.

Research contributions must demonstrate the use of rigorous and appropriate research methodologies, and use high quality data for empirical studies.

All papers published are subject to a minimum of double blind review. 

The joint editors are currently Professors Nathan Joseph and Alan Lowe.

==Groups==

===BAFA Sub-committees===

There are two BAFA sub-committees:

* '''Committee for Departments of Accounting and Finance''' ('''CDAF''')
CDAF is concerned with matters of national importance in the management of University departments of Accounting and Finance, focusing upon issues of curriculum, quality assurance, academic management, professional body links and staff development.
* '''Conference of Professors of Accounting and Finance''' ('''CPAF''')
CPAF provides a forum for the discussion of strategic matters of relevance to academics in accounting and finance. Most members are professors, but exceptionally they may be the most senior academic in an HEI without any Professors in Accounting or Finance. CPAF holds an annual conference in September.

===Regional Groups===

* Northern Area Group
* Scottish Group
* South East Area Group
* South West Area Group

Each group hosts its own local events.

===Special Interest Groups===

BAFA runs a number of groups that address specific subject areas. They are: 

* Accounting and Finance in Emerging Economies Special Interest Group
* Accounting Education Special Interest Group
* Auditing Special Interest Group (ASIG)
* Corporate Governance Special Interest Group
* Financial Accounting and Reporting Special Interest Group
* Financial Markets and Institutions Special Interest Group
* Interdisciplinary Perspectives Special Interest Group
* Public Services and Charities Special Interest Group
* Corporate Finance and Asset Pricing Special Interest Group

==BAFA Awards==

BAFA makes three awards annually:  the Distinguished Academic Award (DAA), the Lifetime Achievement Award (LAA), and the Distinguished Contribution Award (DCA). 

The DAA is presented to an individual who has made a substantial and direct contribution to UK academic accounting and finance life, while the LAA is awarded to one or more individuals who have made a substantial and direct contributions to UK academic accounting and finance over the course of their careers. 

The DCA was launched in 2016 to recognise non-academics who have made a significant contribution to the profession and to BAFA.

== Absexual ==
{{See also|Erotophobic}}
The [[neologism]] '''''absexual''''' has also been introduced by Queen, although it was coined by her partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stark | first = Christine | contribution = Resisting the sexual new world order: Girls to boyz: sex radical women, promoting prostitution, pornography, and sadomasochism | editor-last1 = Whisnant | editor-first1 = Rebecca | editor-link1 = Rebecca Whisnant | editor-last2 = Stark | editor-first2 = Christine | title = Not for sale: feminists resisting prostitution and pornography | page = 280 | publisher = Spinifex Press | location = North Melbourne, Victoria | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781876756499  |quote= She even goes so far as to suggest that feminists opposed to pornography and prostitution are "''absexual''" (a term made up by her physician husband).

== Development of SHARP ==

In 2000, Queen together with her partner Robert Morgan Lawrence published a jointly written essay in the Journal of Bisexuality detailing the role of San Francisco bisexuals in the development of safe sex strategies in response to the emerging AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Queen detailed her and Lawrence's development of a safe sex version of the SAR or [[Sexual Attitude Reassessment]] training, which they termed Sexual Health Attitude Restructuring Process or SHARP. Originally a program started by the IASHS, SHARP is described as a combination of "lectures, films, videos, slides, and personal sharing", as well as "massage techniques, condom relay races, a blindfolded ritual known as the Sensorium which emphasized transformation and sensate focus, and much more."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; In 2007, Queen expressed the intention to revive the SHARP training, now referred to as SARP or Sexual Attitude Reassessment Process.'

{{Politics of Kuwait}}

'''Coeducation in Kuwait''' has been a contentious issue since the Islamists gained slight power in parliament in the 1996. However, the government has opposed the ban and does not adopt the ban thus certain universities are still co-ed.&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/kuwaiti-mps-push-for-reinstating-co-education-1.1191933 |title=Kuwaiti MPs push for reinstating co-education |publisher=Gulfnews.com |date=8 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, MP [[Ali Al-Rashid]] proposed a bill that would reverse the 12-year-old ban on coeducation.  On the topic, Al-Rashid said: "[[Kuwait University]] was established in the 1960s as a co-ed university. Segregating students only came in 1996. If we are to go back to the origin of things, Kuwait University then is originally a co-ed facility. Religion is clear about this subject."  According to Al-Rashid, university teachers and officials have complained it has been difficult and costly to teach male and female students separately. 

In 2013, the  legal and legislative committee of the Kuwaiti parliament endorsed a proposal that reverses the ban at all public and private universities in the country.&lt;ref name=auto /&gt;

In 2015, Laws regarding segregation in universities were overturned on the basis of wrongful implementation. The original law only stated “Student attire, behavior and activities shall be according to Islamic values”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://248am.com/fajer/law/kuwait-law-no-more-segregation-and-animals-have-rights/|title = Kuwait Law: No More Segregation and Animals Now Have Rights|date = 17 December 2015|accessdate = 19 December 2015|website = 248am|publisher = Fajer Ahmed|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.arabtimesonline.com/news/case-against-gender-segregation-rejected-part-of-domestic-workers-law-unconstitutional/|title = Case against gender segregation rejected – ‘Part of domestic workers law unconstitutional’|last = |first = |date = 17 December 2015|work = |access-date = 19 December 2015|via = |agency = Arab Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College of Micronesia-FSM''' ('''COM-FSM''') is a multi-campus institution in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. It began operation in 1963 as the Micronesian Teacher Education Center.

The College of Micronesia has a state campus in each of the four states with its national campus in the capital city of [[Palikir]], [[Pohnpei]].  The COM-FSM system also includes the Fisheries and Maritime Institute (FMI) on the [[Yap]] islands.&lt;ref name="FMI"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comfsm.fm/fmi/index.html |title= Fisheries and Maritime Institute |work= COM-FSM website |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JICA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jica.go.jp/english/evaluation/project/term/oc/archives/14-1-52.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011631/http://www.jica.go.jp/english/evaluation/project/term/oc/archives/14-1-52.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-28 |title=Outline of the Fisheries Training Project in the Federated States of Micronesia |work=[[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] |quote=Partner Country's Implementing Organization: Fisheries and Maritime Institute (FMI), College of Micronesia (COM) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It as formed by the 1976 merger of the Community College of Micronesia in [[Kolonia]], [[Pohnpei]]; and the Micronesian Occupational College,&lt;ref name=Thomasp91&gt;Thomas, R. Murray. "The U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Micronesia)" (Chapter 3). In: Thomas, R. Murray and T. Neville Postlethwaite (editors). ''Schooling in the Pacific Islands: Colonies in Transition'' . [[Elsevier]], January 26, 2016. {{ISBN|1483148556}}, 9781483148557. Start: [https://books.google.com/books?id=7U1tBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 67]. CITED: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7U1tBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 91].&lt;/ref&gt; which was built in [[Koror]], [[Palau]] between the late 1960s and the middle of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Compact of Free Association in the Micronesian States of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands: Environmental Impact Statement''. [[United States Department of State]], 1984. p. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=_6g4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA36 36]. "From the late 1960's to mid-1970's the major high school complexes throughout the Trust Territory were constructed: notably,[...]additions to the Ponape High School[...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The former originated from a teaching training center on the grounds of the Pacific Islands Central School, later known as Pohnpei Island Central School (PICS) and now [[Bailey Olter High School]], established in 1962. Community College of Micronesia began operations in 1969 as a way of enhancing the training of area teachers, and it initially issued elementary education associate degrees. Teachers of elementary school students  who desired more advanced degrees formed the bulk of the student bodies of the College of Micronesia-FSM extension centers.&lt;ref name=Thomasp91/&gt;

==Programs and accreditation==
[[Image:CultureDance.jpg|thumb|Pohnpei students from the COM-FSM National Campus came out in their traditional colors at the Spanish Wall Field in Kolonia Town to celebrate the College’s Founding Day]]
The college awards [[associate degree]]s to students who complete a prescribed two-year program of study.  The time is extended for students who need to complete preparation classes before beginning the degree program. The college has [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] agreements with several online and conventional institutions.  

The college awards certificates of achievement to students who complete a prescribed one-year program of study.  Other short-term certificate programs are offered at the State Campuses in response to expressed local needs.  

The College of Micronesia is [[School accreditation|accredited]] by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC), an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Commission on Recognition of Post-secondary Accreditation and the [[United States Department of Education]]. Accreditation was awarded in 1978 and reaffirmed in 1982, 1987, 1992, 1998, and 2005. 

In 2004, the college was placed on “Warning” by WASC on the basis of its self study report and visit.  The warning status was removed the following year.&lt;ref name="Warning"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.fm/news/kp/2005/07_9.htm |title= COM-FSM Regains Accreditation |work= The Kaselehlie Press |date= 21 July 2005 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''corporation''' refers to different kinds of student organizations worldwide. Generally, universities in the various European countries have student organizations called corporations. The name is derived from the Latin ''corporatio'' meaning a body or group. There was an earlier type of student organization, called a ''[[Nation (university)|nation]]'' from the [[Middle Ages]], where students from all over Europe at a particular university would unite according to national (actually regional) lines. Today, many student organizations in [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and, to a lesser degree, [[Scotland]] are still termed nations, while most of the rest of European universities, the organizations are considered corporations.

Below are short entries on the organizations found at universities on a country-by-country basis. There are also references to longer articles.

==Austria==
Sharing common roots, Austrian corporations are quite similar to their German counterparts. While Catholic corporations generally are associated with the Christian-conservative Austrian People's Party ([[Austrian People's Party|ÖVP]]) and are generally pro-Austrian, other corporations, especially ''Burschenschaften'', are involved with the right-wing Freedom Party ([[Freedom Party of Austria|FPÖ]]) and can be characterized as German-nationalist organizations.

==Belgium==
Most Belgian corporations were founded during the last century. In French, they are called ''[[:fr:Ordres|ordres]]'', in Dutch ''[[:nl:Studentenvereniging#De studentenvereniging in Vlaanderen|studentenvereniging]]''.

''See also: [[:de:Ian Lilburn]] (Scotto-Germania London)''

==Estonia==
Corporations in [[Estonia]] are very much like those in [[Germany]] though foxes (first-year members) do not wear colours, but a black cap instead. Estonian corporations usually have a ''[[Compass (drafting)|circinus]]'' stitched to their caps, that is, the letters ''VCFC'' (an abbreviation for a Latin sentence: ''Vivat, crescat, floreat corporatio'', meaning "Live, grow, prosper corporation") and the initials of the name of the corporation. Corporations are popular in Estonia. Other student organisations or societies with a lengthy tradition, but without the name, corporation, are also commonly referred to as corporations.

Active corporations and student societies in Estonia:

Male corporations, members of the [[League of Estonian Corporations]]:
* [[Korporatsioon Vironia|Korp! Vironia]], founded in Riga November 26, 1900.

== Finland ==
{{main|Nations in Finnish universities}}
Corporations in Finland are called in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''osakunta'', in [[English language|English]], "nations". The name refers to the historical custom of the continental universities where students usually formed corporations according to their home nations. In Swedish universities, the same practice was followed by the provinces but the name remained. The Finnish version of the name actually is an archaic form of ''department'', and this name was adopted to replace the term "kansakunta" ("nation" in the purely ethnic sense) during the 19th century when the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Russian]] government tried to diminish the importance of nations as political organizations.

Earlier, it was traditional for students to belong to the nations of their provinces. Since 1937, students could resign from their nation, but they still had to pay the fee to the nation throughout their time at the university. This compulsory fee was abolished in the 1960s. Nowadays, the nations are a feature peculiar to the [[University of Helsinki]], the oldest Finnish university and they concentrate on the student culture. There is also a [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] nation, [[Teknologföreningen]], at [[Aalto University School of Science and Technology]].

In most universities, the primary form of corporation is an association of students majoring in a particular subject. In the universities of technology, these are called ''guilds''.

In addition to the voluntary corporations, every Finnish university student is also required to be a member of the general student corporation of the university, the Student Union (''ylioppilaskunta'', ''studentkår''), which has the power to levy a membership fee. The union also has the legal power to represent the students to the university administration and in all other matters. It also organizes the health care of the students.

==France==
Corporations in [[France]] are called ''bureau des étudiants'', ''[[:fr:Associations étudiantes en France|corporation]]'' or, for short, ''corpo''.

==Germany==

== Hungary ==
* [[:de:Corps Nassovia Szeged]], now in Budapest

==Italy==
Corporations in [[Italy]] are known as ''[[:it:Confraternita studentesca|confraternite studentesche]]'' or collectively as ''[[:it:Goliardia|goliardia]]'' (from [[Goliard]]), although the latter generally refers to the spirit they follow (conviviality, license, celebrating love and drink, and making satyrical songs). 

There are also two German-speaking Catholic corporations. In [[Rome]], the  [[:de:K.A.V. Capitolina Rom|Capitolina]], associated with the German [[:de:Cartellverband|CV]], and composed mainly of German Theology students.  In [[Bolzano|Bozen]], the Meinhardia, associated with the Austrian [[:de:ÖCV|ÖCV]].

==Japan==
In [[Tokyo]], there is the corporation [[AV Edo-Rhenania zu Tokio]], associated with the German [[:de:Cartellverband|CV]].

Furthermore, [[Canada]], [[British Columbia]] The Japanese student corporation is there, called Ouka. The meaning is [[Cherry blossom]].
The Ouka related with [[bushido]] and Tokyo Angling and Country Club.

==Latvia==
Corporations in [[Latvia]] follow traditions similar to those in Germany, however a "fuksis" (from {{lang-la|faex}} "sediment", first year members) does not wear colours, but a black cap instead with a circinus stitched to it, usually made of silver. Although there are some differences, tradition of the Baltic, to include Latvian corporations is still based on 1812 Jena rules. The Baltic branch of German tradition is distinct to Latvian, Estonian, Polish and some German corporations founded at universities of Tartu and Riga. Their umbrella organizations maintain reciprocal links. THe umbrella organization for Latvian student corporations is the [[Presidium Convent]] (P!K!) and for female corporations the '''Female Student Presidium Convent''' or [http://spk.lv/ S!P!K!].

Latvian student corporations are closed, lifelong organizations and strictly wear 3 colours. During the Soviet occupation corporations were prohibited but they continued to work abroad, among Latvian refugees in countries like the USA, Canada, Australia, Sweden and Germany. In Latvia corporations renewed operation after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The first Latvian corporation, ''Lettonia'' was founded in 1870 at the [[University of Tartu]] (then ''Dorpat''). It combined [[beer]], [[commercium songs]], and [[academic fencing]] traditions of German corporations with Latvian nationalism and a strong emphasis on Latvian culture. The first Latvian corporation founded  in Riga was ''Selonija'', founded in 1880 at the [[Riga Polytechnicum]].
The first female corporation, ''Daugaviete'', was founded in 1921 at the [[University of Latvia]]. As of 2004, Latvia has 23 male and 13 female corporations, with about 10,000 members in total.

Various academic lifelong organisations (student societies etc.)with similar traditions, also sometimes named as corporations, but with differences in traditions and symbols, are also active in Latvia.

==Poland==
Corporations in [[Poland]] mostly follow traditions similar to those in [[Germany]], however "fuxes" (first year members) do not wear full colours. The first Polish corporation, Konwent Polonia, was established in 1828 by the Polish students of the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]]. The second and third oldest corporations were established by the Polish students of the [[Riga Technical University]]: [[Arkonia]] (1879) and [[Welecja]] (1883). There were more than one hundred corporations in Poland between 1918 and 1939. During [[communism]] in Poland (1944–1989), corporations were forbidden. Today about fifteen corporations continue to be active in Poland, at the universities in [[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]], [[Poznań]], [[Wrocław]], [[Gdańsk]] and [[Toruń]]

==Netherlands==
The oldest corporation in the Netherlands, ''[[Vindicat|Vindicat atque Polit]]'', was established in the Dutch city of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] on 4 February 1815, other corporations were established in the cities of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Leiden]], [[Delft]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Wageningen]].

During the first half of the 19th century, it was very common for every student to join such a corporation (or ''corps'' in Dutch). At the beginning of the 20th century, more types of student associations were established, and many had a religious basis.

During World War II, all ''corpora'' (Latin plural of ''corps'') not willing to subscribe to the new German law that Jewish students no longer could become member of non-commercial unions, the ''corpora'' either closed-down or became clandestine organizations. During the 1970s, most of the corporations started to enroll women as fully accepted members. Now, corporations and other student associations are widespread in the Netherlands.

==Switzerland==
There is a continuous tradition of corporations in [[Switzerland]] which goes back to the early 19th century. Especially in its beginnings, political developments had a strong influence on the foundation of corporations and their activities. In the 1840s, the catholic-conservative [[Schweizerischer Studentenverein]] was founded as the counterpart of the radical-liberal [[Schweizerischer Zofingerverein]] which led to religion playing a more important role in corporation life. Today, many corporations are still active (the Schweizerischer Studentenverein being the biggest umbrella organization), but play a less significant role in society.
Swiss corporations call themselves ''[[Studentenverbindung]]'' and resemble strongly to German Studentenverbindungen.

'''Darshana Jhaveri''' (born 1940), the youngest of the four ''Jhaveri sisters'', is a leading [[India]]n exponent of [[Manipuri dance]], an [[Indian classical dance|Indian classical dance form]].&lt;ref name=hi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/03/02/stories/2007030201000300.htm|title=Dancer's mission |last=Ajith Kumar |first=P.K.|date=2 March 2007|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a disciple of [[Guru Bipin Singh]], and started performing on stage in 1958 along with her sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2007/02/16/stories/2007021600810300.htm|title=Subtle expressions: Darshana Jhaveri enthralled the audience with her Manipuri dance recital.|date=16 February 2007|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is one of the founders of the ''Manipuri Nartanalaya'' in 1972, which popularized Manipuri dance in India, and is currently headed by her, with centres at [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Imphal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2003/11/21/stories/2003112101220400.htm|title=Illuminating show on dance choreography: It was a happy confluence of teachers and disciples as Sri Shanmukhananda Sabha, Mumbai, celebrated its Golden Jubilee.|date=21 November 2003|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sa|Doshi, p. 43]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and training==
Jhaveri was born and brought up in [[Mumbai]] in a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] household. At the age of six, she saw her elder sisters, Nayana and Ranjana, learn Manipuri dance from Guru Bipin Singh at their home. Soon, she too started learning the dance form, along with her sister Suverna.&lt;ref name=hi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-29/pune/28127729_1_manipuri-dance-traditional-art-dance-form|title=Learn a traditional art form: Darshana Jhaveri|date=29 Jan 2010|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she learned the traditional ''Raslila'' dances from Sutradhari Kshetritombi Devi, the ''Nata Pung'' from Guru Meitei Tomba Singh and traditional ''Maibi Jagoi'' from Kumar Maibi.

==Career==
By the 1950s, the ''Jhaveri sisters''{{snd}} Nayana, Ranjana, Suverna, and Darshana{{snd}} had started performing together on stage all over India and abroad, and, in 1956, were the first non-Manipuris to perform their dances at the Govindji Temple inside the royal palace of [[Imphal]]. Eventually, the sisters established the ''Manipuri Nartanalaya'' with their Guru and Kalavati Devi in 1972, at Mumbai, Kolkata, and Imphal,&lt;ref name=hi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Si|Singha, p. 177]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in time their name became synonymous to Manipuri dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/4545/Simply%20Gujarati/Sisters+in+sync.html|title=Sisters in sync  |date=13 February 2008|publisher=India Today|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Darshana has published several books and articles on the dance and has assisted her guru during his lifetime, in teaching, research as well as in choreography, before taking on the mantle herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiansarts.com/DarshanaJhaveripage.htm Darshana Jhaveri]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a noted dance critic [[Sunil Kothari]] in a 2008 article, they are "responsible for bringing the temple tradition of Manipuri dance to the cities". The article also noted that Nayana died two decades ago and, with Suverna unwell, Ranjana and Darshana continue to perform along with her Dance troupe and teach Manipuri dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/3604/Simply%20Kolkata/Renewed+splendour.html|title=DANCING QUEENS|date=16 January 2008|publisher=India Today|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/24/arts/dance/24dance.html?pagewanted=print|title=Dance Listings: DOWNTOWN DANCE FESTIVAL|date=24 August 2007 |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Darshana Jhaveri received the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]] in 1996 by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy of Dance, Music and Drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sangeetnatak.com/programmes_recognition&amp;honours_dance_manipuri.html Dance Manipuri awardees] [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] website&lt;/ref&gt; She was honored with the [[Padma Shri]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded the Kalidas Samman Award in 2018.

'''Education Facilitators''', a privately held company in [[South Africa]], was a holding and operating company in the education management industry that consisted of three trading divisions, one in professional services and two [[college]] brands that operated throughout southern and central Africa from its founding in 1994 to its closure in 2005.

The two Colleges operated as [[distance learning]] institutions and offered programs for formal diplomas, degrees and postgraduate qualifications to adults studying part-time in the fields of [[teacher education]], business administration and [[policing]]. Education Facilitators had agreements with various [[higher education]] institutions including the University of Port Elizabeth (name has changed to the [[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University]]) and the Technikon Pretoria (name has changed to the Tswane University of Technology), which provided for the offering of their qualifications on the group’s distance learning infrastructure. In addition to the above, Education Facilitators also obtained recognition from various education authorities namely, the Department of Education in South Africa, the Ministry of Education in [[Zambia]], the SERTEC (Certification Council for Technikon Education) in South Africa, and its Colleges was accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the (DETC) [[Distance Education and Training Council]] in [[Washington DC]], USA. This enabled the group to develop their own certificate, diploma and degree qualifications, such as Associate, Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Business Administration and Master of Business Administration programs. At its peak, the group had approximately 28,000 registered students throughout southern and central Africa, awarded more than 20,000 certificates, diplomas and degrees and employed 250 plus full and part-time employees.

==Business Overview of Education Facilitators==

Education Facilitators was established in 1994 after a buy-out of the shareholders in Norite Education and Training Company. Initially, Education Facilitators offered education programs through distance learning for the upgrading of unqualified and under qualified in-service teachers, which was based on the curriculum and syllabi of the teacher training programs offered by the DET (the former Department of Education and Training) at Colleges of Education throughout South Africa. Education Facilitators had its Head Office in [[Johannesburg]] and was registered by order of the court in terms of the Higher Education Act, 1997 (Act No 101 of 1997).

During 1996 Education Facilitators entered into agreements with the University of Port Elizabeth (name has changed to the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University) and the Technikon Pretoria (name has changed to the Tswane University of Technology). The programs offered by the two Colleges in collaboration with these two institutions through distance learning were examined and certified by these institutions. In addition, the programs offered by the Colleges for Technikon qualifications, were examined and inspected by the SERTEC (Certification Council for Technikon Education), which was a statutory body. Certification by these examining bodies meant that all instructional programmes complied with the norms and standards of education prescribed by the SERTEC and the Department of Education. All certificates issued by the former Technikon Pretoria to students of the Colleges were therefore issued in conjunction with SERTEC. Furthermore, all certificates awarded were recognised externally for employment, promotion and further education purposes.

The increase in student numbers compelled the operating company of the Colleges to establish a Professional Services division.  Since 1999 the professional services division was gradually upgraded from a position where personnel and student support was dealt with by an integrated HR, IR, Finance, ICT and logistics back office with a clearly defined [[value chain]] and [[service-level agreement]]s.

Very little changes occurred in the [[marketing]] procedures of the Colleges.  Advertisements were placed in selected magazines and newspapers and student advisors travelled from region to region to counsel and register new students.  Thereafter, the Professional Services division dealt with telephone enquiries, as well as applications that were received via either traditional or electronic methods.

The group’s commitment to responding positively to the education needs of the peoples of Africa, and to provide quality programs and excellent service in the fields of education, business administration and policing that assisted learners to develop the necessary skills and competency to enhance their careers were evident in the growing numbers of successful graduates. The Colleges also acknowledged that it had a positive role to play in enhancing the establishment and maintenance of a prosperous and self-sufficient democratic society in the countries that it operated in.

The [[education]] system in [[New Zealand]] is a three-tier model which includes primary  and intermediate schools, followed by secondary schools (high schools) and tertiary education at universities and [[Institute of technology#New Zealand|polytechnics]]. The academic year in New Zealand varies between institutions, but generally runs from early February until mid-December for primary schools, late January to late November or early December for secondary schools, and polytechnics, and from late February until mid-November for universities.

In 2009, the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), published by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), ranked New Zealand 7th best at science and reading in the world, and 13th in maths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229020307/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |archivedate=29 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Education Index]], published as part of the UN's [[Human Development Index]] consistently ranks New Zealand among the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf |title=Human development indices |accessdate=16 February 2010 |date=18 December 2008 |publisher=Human Development Reports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219191319/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of education in New Zealand}}
{{Expand section|sourced information from the main article|date = February 2014}}
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, [[Māori people|Māori]] ran schools to pass on tradition knowledge including songs, chants, tribal history, spiritual understanding and knowledge of medicinal plants. These ''wānanga'' were usually run by elders called [[tohunga]], respected for their tribal knowledge and teaching was confined to the [[rangatira]] (chiefly) class. Reading and writing were unknown, but wood carving was well developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-education-matauranga/page-1 "http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-education-matauranga/page-1"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007023443/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-education-matauranga/page-1 |date=7 October 2015 }}, Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BesMaor-c4-2.html "The Whare Wananga"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016011624/http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BesMaor-c4-2.html |date=16 October 2014 }}, Elsdon Best, via NZETC&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal European-style schooling was first introduced in 1815 and was well established in 1832 by the [[London Missionary Society]] missionaries, who learnt Māori and built the first schools in the Bay of Islands. Both children and adults were taught. The main resources were the Christian [[New Testament]] and [[Slate (writing)|slates]], and teaching was in Māori. For many years the bible was the only literature used in teaching, and this became a major factor in how Māori viewed the European world. In the 1850s a Māori trade school was established at [[Te Awamutu]] by [[John Eldon Gorst|John Gorst]] to teach Māori practical skills associated with European-style farming,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-CowOldF-t1-body1-d5.html "John Gorst at Te Awamutu"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016014627/http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-CowOldF-t1-body1-d5.html |date=16 October 2014 }}, "The Old Frontier", James Cowan, via NZETC&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1863 was burnt down by [[Rewi Maniapoto]] in the early stages of [[New Zealand Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;The Road to War 1860–64.Monogram 16. Whakatane Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 missionaries Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a school for 50 Māori girls for 3 years at Taupiri in the Waikato, teaching arithmetic and reading.

Teaching by missionaries and in Native schools was in Māori between 1815 and 1900. The Young Māori Party MPs, especially Sir Maui Pomare and Ngata, advocated the teaching of Māori children using English, as well as teaching hygiene to lower the Māori sickness and death rates. Pomare was knighted after WW1 for his work in improving Māori learning and integration into New Zealand society.

New Zealand did not establish a [[Education Act 1877|state education system until 1877]]. The absence of a national education system meant that the first sizable secondary education providers were Grammar Schools and other private institutions. The first Grammar School in New Zealand, Auckland Grammar School, was established in 1850 and formally recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 through the Auckland Grammar School Appropriation Act.

==Early childhood education==
Many children attend some form of [[early childhood education]] before they begin school such as:
* [[Playcentre]] (1 to school age)
* [[Kindergarten]] (ages 3–5)
* [[Kohanga Reo]]
* Licensed Early Childhood Centres (ages 0–5) (usually privately owned)
* Chartered Early Childhood Centres (ages 0–5) (state funded)

==Primary and secondary education==
{{main|Secondary education in New Zealand}}

All New Zealand citizens, and those entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely, are entitled to free primary and secondary schooling from their 5th birthday until the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Education Act 1989, section 3&lt;/ref&gt; Education is compulsory between a student's 6th and 16th birthdays;&lt;ref&gt;Education Act 1989, section 20&lt;/ref&gt; however most students start primary school on (or shortly after) their 5th birthday, and the vast majority (around 84%) stay in school until at least their 17th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/main/student-engagement-participation/1955 |title= Retention of students in senior secondary schools |publisher= Ministry of Education |accessdate= 19 January 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160328222532/http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/main/student-engagement-participation/1955 |archivedate= 28 March 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some special cases, 15-year-olds can apply for an early leaving exemption from the Ministry of Education (MOE). Families wishing to home-school their children can apply for exemption. To get an exemption from enrolment at a registered school, they must satisfy the Secretary of Education that their child will be taught "as regularly and as well as in a registered school".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150121232913/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/Parents/YourChild/HowSchoolsWork/TypesOfSchool.aspx#2 "Home schooling"], Ministry of Education website&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 proposal by the New Zealand Government, called [[Schools Plus]], would see students required to remain in some form of education until age 18.&lt;ref name="nzh-2014dl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10533068 |title=Clark sets 2014 deadline for education to age 18 |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=19 September 2008|accessdate=22 September 2008|author=[[NZPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled students with special educational needs can stay until the end of the calendar year they turn 21.

There are three main types of schools in New Zealand: state (public) schools, [[state-integrated school]]s, and private (independent) schools. State schools educate approximately 84.9% of students, state-integrated schools educate 11.3%, and private schools educate 3.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0003/71796/Roll-by-Education-Region-and-Authority.xlsx |title= Roll by Education Regional &amp; Authority – 1 July 2015 |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 16 April 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160315115354/http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0003/71796/Roll-by-Education-Region-and-Authority.xlsx |archivedate= 15 March 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two additional types of schools: Vote Education schools funded directly out of the education budget, and [[charter school]]s (or partnership schools) which are state funded but privately run. These schools however educate only 0.1% of all students.

===Years of schooling===
New Zealand schools designate school class levels based on the years of schooling of the student cohort,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/technical_info/guidelines/school_roll_return_guidelines School Roll Return Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524123116/http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/technical_info/guidelines/school_roll_return_guidelines |date=24 May 2010 }}, 2006–2008, retrieved 16 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; using 13 academic year levels, numbered 1 through to 13. Before 2000, a system of Forms, Standards and Juniors/Primers was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cooper| first = Tracey| title = School Year| work = Choosing the right road| publisher = Waikato Times| date = 21 September 2009| url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/features/2885011/Choosing-the-right-road| accessdate = 16 January 2011| dead-url = yes}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students turning five enter at Year 1 if they begin school at the beginning of the school year or before the cut-off date (31 March in legislation, later for most schools). Students who turn five late in the year may start in Year 0 or stay in Year 1 for the next school year, depending on their academic progress. The Ministry of Education draws a distinction between academic and funding year levels, the latter being based on when a student first starts school—students first starting school after July, who therefore do not appear on the July roll returns, are classified as being in Funding Year 0 that year, and are recorded as being in Year 1 on the next year's roll returns. 

Primary education lasts eight years (Years 1–8). Depending on the area, the last two years of primary education may be taken at a primary school, at a secondary school, or at a separate intermediate school. 

Students generally transition to secondary education at age 12–13. Secondary education lasts five years (Year 9–13).

===Curriculum and qualifications===
All state and state integrated schools follow the national curriculum: ''The New Zealand Curriculum'' (NZC) for English-medium schools and ''Te Marautanga o Aotearoa'' (TMoA) for Māori-medium schools. Private schools do not need to follow the national curriculum, but must have a curriculum that is at least equivalent to NZC or TMoA.

The New Zealand Curriculum has eight levels, numbered 1 to 8, and eight major learning areas: English, the arts, health and physical education, learning languages, mathematics and statistics, science, social sciences, and technology. Te Marautanga o Aotearoa includes a ninth learning area, Māori language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/content/download/1110/11995/file/Charts1.pdf |title= Curriculum achievement objectives by level – New Zealand Curriculum |publisher= Te Kete Ipurangi |accessdate= 24 January 2012 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110202151748/http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/content/download/1110/11995/file/Charts1.pdf |archivedate= 2 February 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main secondary school qualification in New Zealand is the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (NCEA), which is offered in all state and state-integrated schools. Some schools offer [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) or the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) alongside NCEA.

===Types of schools by funding===
====State schools====
State schools are government funded and operated, and are free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. Students and parents however are expected to pay for stationery, uniforms, textbooks and school trips. Schools may ask for donations to supplement their government operational funding. While it is completely voluntary to pay the donation, some schools have been reported coercing parents into paying the donation by withholding school reports and not allowing students on trips for non-payment; Some schools,  especially those in affluent areas, request donations in excess of $1000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Kirsty |last=Wynn |date= 26 January 2014 |title= Auckland school donation exceeds $1k |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11192103 |publisher= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate= 11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each state school is governed by an elected Board of Trustees, consisting of the school principal, a number of trustees (usually 5) elected by the parents of the students, one staff trustee elected by the school staff, and in secondary schools, one student trustee elected by the students. State schools follow the national curriculum, and are required to remain [[secularity|secular]].

====State-integrated schools====
{{main|State-integrated school}}
State-integrated schools are former private schools which have chosen to integrate into the state education system, becoming state schools but retaining their special character. They were established in 1975 after the near-collapse of the then-private [[Catholic school]] system, which had run into financial difficulties and threatened to overwhelm the state school system were they to close.&lt;ref name="TeAraPS2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/private-education/page-2 |title= Private schools, 1820s to 1990s |first= Megan |last= Cook |publisher= Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date= 13 July 2012 |accessdate= 11 January 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150215031104/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/private-education/page-2 |archivedate= 15 February 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of state-integrated schools are Catholic, but other Christian denominations, religions and educational philosophies are also represented. The private school owners stay on as proprietors, and sit on the school's board of trustees to ensure the special character is maintained. State-integrated schools charge "attendance dues" to parents to cover the costs of the still privately owned land and buildings, and to pay off any debts accrued by the school prior to integration. Typical attendance dues range between $240 and $740 per year for Catholic schools, and between $1,150 and $2,300 per year for non-Catholic state-integrated schools.&lt;ref name="North&amp;South"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Brand Catholic: a (not so) private education |first= Joanna |last= Wade |magazine= [[North &amp; South (New Zealand magazine)|North &amp; South]] |date= November 2011 |pages= 40–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private schools====
Private schools receive a small amount of government funding, but nearly all of them rely on tuition fees paid by students' parents to operate.

====Alternative schooling====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Charter schools are state funded schools which operate outside of the normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools do not have to operate with any registered or trained teachers. Teachers do not have to have current practicing certificates. They do not have to have a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They do not have to follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.

Parents may home-school their own children, if they can prove that their child will be "taught at least as regularly and as well as in a registered school",&lt;ref name=home&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150121232913/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/Parents/YourChild/HowSchoolsWork/TypesOfSchool.aspx#2 "Home schooling"], Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; and receive an annual grant&lt;ref name=home /&gt; to help with costs, including services from [[The Correspondence School]]. The percentage of children home-schooled is well under 2% even in the [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson region]], the area where the concept is most popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/schooling/homeschooling/homeschooling-as-at-1-july-2011 |title=Homeschooling as at 1 July 2011 – Education Counts |work=educationcounts.govt.nz |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209023526/http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/schooling/homeschooling/homeschooling-as-at-1-july-2011 |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are many{{quantify|date=July 2014}} local and national support-groups.

===Types of schools by years===
While there is overlap in some schools, primary school traditionally runs from Year 1 to Year 8 and secondary school from Year 9 to Year 13. Depending on the area, Years 7 and 8 may be taken either at a 'full' primary school (in contrast to a Year 1–6 'contributing' primary school), a separate intermediate school, or at a Year 7–13 secondary school. Schools catering for both primary school and secondary school students (Years 1 to 13) are common among private schools, and also state schools in areas where the population does not justify separate primary and secondary schools (the latter are termed '[[area schools]]').

The main six types of schools are:
* '''Contributing Primary school''': Years 1–6 (ages 5–11). There are no private contributing primaries.
* '''Full Primary school''': Years 1–8 (ages 5–13). Common among integrated and private schools.
* '''Intermediate school''': Years 7–8 (ages 10–13). Only two non-state intermediate schools exist.
* '''Secondary school''': Years 9–13 (ages 13–18).
* '''Year 7–13 secondary school''' or '''Secondary school with intermediate''': Years 7–13 (ages 10–18). Common among integrated and private schools, and state schools in Invercargill and South Island provincial areas.
* '''Composite school''' or '''[[Area school]]''': Years 1–13 (ages 5–18). Common among integrated and private schools.

There are some schools that fall outside the traditional year groupings. All of the following types of schools are rare, with less than ten of each type existing.
* '''Middle School''': Years 7–10 (ages 10–15). Only six exist
* '''Senior School''': Years 11–13 (ages 14–18). Only three exist ([[Albany Senior High School, Auckland|Albany Senior High School]], Auckland, [https://www.rhs.school.nz/ Rototuna Senior High School], Hamilton and [[Ormiston Senior College]], Auckland)

In addition, there are three other types of schools defined by the Ministry of Education:
* '''[[Distance education|Correspondence school]]''': Preschool – Year 13 (Preschool – age 19). Serves distance education, for those in remote areas or for individual subjects not offered by a school. The only school of this type is the national correspondence school: [[The Correspondence School|Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu]].
* '''[[Special education|Special school]]''': Preschool – age 21. Serves special education to those with intellectual impairments, visual or hearing impairments, or learning and social difficulties, who receive Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS) funding.
* '''Teen parent unit''': Years 9–15 (age 12–19). Serves [[teenage pregnancy|teenage parents]] in continuing secondary school education. They are under the jurisdiction of a hosting secondary school, but are largely autonomous.

=== State school enrollment schemes ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
Geographically based state school enrolment schemes were abolished in 1991 by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] and the Education Amendment Act 1991. Although this greatly opened up the choice of schools for students, it had undesirable consequences. Popular high-decile schools experienced large roll growths, while less popular low-decile school experienced roll declines. Schools could operate a roll limit if there was a risk of overcrowding, but enrolments under this scheme were on a "first come, first served" basis, potentially excluding local students.

The Education Amendment Act 2000, enacted by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]], partially solved this problem by putting in place a new "system for determining enrolment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding." Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined "home zone". Residence in this zone, or in the school's boarding house (if it has one) gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school's home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, in the following order of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of past students; children of board employees and staff; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a randomly drawn ballot. The system is complicated by some state schools having boarding facilities for students living beyond the school's zone. Typically these students live in isolated farming regions in New Zealand, or their parents may live or work partly overseas. Many secondary schools offer limited scholarships to their boarding establishment to attract talented students in imitation of private school practice.

As of September 2010, 700 of New Zealand's 2550 primary and secondary schools operate an enrolment scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://koordinates.com/layer/743-nz-school-zones-sept-2010/#/layer/743-nz-school-zones-sept-2010/data/ |title= NZ School Zones (Sept 2010) |publisher= New Zealand ministry of Education (via koordinates.com) |date= September 2010 |accessdate= 2 February 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130222071718/http://koordinates.com/layer/743-nz-school-zones-sept-2010/#/layer/743-nz-school-zones-sept-2010/data/ |archivedate= 22 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the remaining 1850 schools are "open enrolment", meaning any student can enrol in the school without rejection. Enrolment schemes mostly exist in major towns and cities where school density is high and school choice is active; they rarely exist for primary schools in rural areas and secondary schools outside the major towns and cities, where school density is low and school choice is limited by the distance to the nearest alternative school.

Critics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationforum.org.nz/documents/e_newsletter/12_03/Dec03_Chchzone.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905164438/http://www.educationforum.org.nz/documents/e_newsletter/12_03/Dec03_Chchzone.htm |archivedate=5 September 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school.

===Māori language in education===
[[File:Petition to introduce te reo Māori in schools, 1972 (19531308104).jpg|thumb|In 1972 [[Ngā Tamatoa]] collected this petition of over 30,000 signatures. It called for the government to offer Māori language in schools, as a gift from Māori to Pākehā. It was an important public act which included the delivery of the petition to Parliament on 14 September 1972.]]

While English is the dominant language of education throughout New Zealand, this was not always the case, and in recent years there have been ongoing efforts to raise the availability of Māori language education in New Zealand as one of New Zealand's three official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/te-reo-maori/news/article.cfm?c_id=336&amp;objectid=10764982 |title=Maori Party wants te reo available to all |work=nzherald.co.nz |quote=The Maori Party wants to make te reo 'compulsorily available' in schools by 2015 but students wouldn't be compelled to take the subject. |accessdate=25 November 2011 |first=Yvonne |last=Tahana |date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in what would become New Zealand, traditional educational systems in Māori society (a ritual transfer of knowledge for most Māori, and the more formal whare wānanga—“house of learning”—model primarily for those of chiefly lineage) were naturally conducted through the medium of the Māori language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-education-matauranga/page-1 |accessdate= 6 January 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140106134508/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-education-matauranga/page-1 |archivedate= 6 January 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, the first mission school was opened to teach the Māori in the Bay of Islands. Here too, instruction was conducted primarily in the Māori language.&lt;ref name="oag.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oag.govt.nz/2012/education-for-maori/part3.htm |accessdate= 6 January 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140106141414/http://www.oag.govt.nz/2012/education-for-maori/part3.htm |archivedate= 6 January 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though English-medium education would have also been available for children of European settlers from nearly their first arrival, ethnic Māori continued to learn primarily through the medium of the Māori language for many years. It was not until the Native Schools Act was passed in 1867 that a systematic government preference was articulated for the English language as a medium of instruction for Māori children. And even with the passage of the act, the English-language provision was not rigorously enforced until 1900.&lt;ref name="oag.govt.nz"/&gt;

Starting in 1903, a government policy to discourage, and even punish, the use of the Māori language in playgrounds was enacted. In the early 1930s the director of Education blocked an initiative by the New Zealand Federation of Teachers to have the Māori language added to the curriculum. Though not the only factor, the ban on the Māori language in education contributed to the widespread loss of Māori-language ability. By 1960 the number of Māori who could speak the language had fallen to 25% from 95% in 1900.&lt;ref name="oag.govt.nz"/&gt;

Focus on falling Māori academic achievement in the 1960s coupled with the loss of the language, led to heavy lobbying by Ngā Tamatoa and the Te Reo Māori Society in the 1970s for the introduction of the language into the schools. This was accompanied by the establishment of Māori Studies programs in each of the Teacher Colleges by 1973.&lt;ref name="oag.govt.nz"/&gt; The 1980s then marked a pivotal decade in the revival of Māori-medium education, with the establishment of the first [[kōhanga reo]] (“language nest” – essentially a total immersion Māori-medium pre-school and kindergarten) in 1981, the first kura kaupapa (established at Hoani Waititi Marae, West Auckland) in 1985, a finding by the Waitangi Tribunal the Māori language is guaranteed protection under Article II of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1986, and the passage of the Māori Language Act in 1987, recognizing Māori as an official language.&lt;ref name="oag.govt.nz"/&gt;

Under New Zealand's current education laws, Māori language education is available in many locations throughout the country, both as a subject in a normal English-medium school as well as through immersion in a Māori-medium school set up under Section 155 (s155) or Section 156 (s156) of the Education Act 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/maori_education/schooling/6040 |title=Māori Language in Education |work=Ministry of Education: Education Counts |year=2013 |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624001744/http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/maori_education/schooling/6040 |archivedate=24 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The full immersion schools are commonly referred to as [[Kura Kaupapa Māori]]. Though enrollment numbers in Māori language programs have remained relatively stable in the last 5 years, both the raw total as well as the percentage of students enrolled have fallen since a high mark set in 2004. The decrease has primarily been among ethnic Māori themselves. See table below.

The definitions provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Education are as follows:

'''''Māori Medium''''': Māori Medium includes students who are taught the curriculum in the Māori language for at least 51 percent of the time (Māori Language Immersion levels 1–2).

'''''Māori Language in English Medium''''': Māori Language in English Medium includes students who are learning the Māori language as a language subject, or who are taught the curriculum in the Māori language for up to 50 percent of the time (Māori Language Immersion levels 3–5).

'''''No Māori Language in Education''''': No Māori Language in Education includes those students who are only introduced to the Māori language via Taha Māori, i.e. simple words, greetings or songs in Māori (Māori Immersion Level 6), and students who are not involved in Māori language education at any level.

==Tertiary education==
{{main|Tertiary education in New Zealand}}
{{see also|List of universities in New Zealand}}

[[Tertiary education]] in New Zealand is used to describe all aspects of post-school education and training. This ranges from informal non-assessed community courses in schools through to [[undergraduate degree]]s and advanced, research-based [[postgraduate degree]]s. Tertiary education is regulated within the New Zealand Qualifications Framework, a unified system of national qualifications in schools, vocational education and training.

==Funding==

===Primary and secondary===
State and state integrated schools are allocated funding from the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]] on a per-student basis to fund the running of the school. Smaller schools receive additional funding due to the added fixed costs of running them compared to larger schools, and schools also receive funding based on the school's [[Socio-Economic Decile|socio-economic decile rating]], with low-decile schools (i.e. those in poorer areas) receiving more funds. They may also receive funds from other activities, such as hiring out school facilities outside school hours to outside groups. Schools also ask for a voluntary donation from parents, informally known as "[[School Fees in New Zealand|school fees]]", to cover extra expenses not covered by the government funding. This may range from $40 per child up to $800 per child in high decile state schools, to over $4000 in state integrated schools. The payment of this fee varies widely according to how parents perceive the school. Typically parents will also outlay $500–$1000 per year for uniforms, field trips, social events, sporting equipment and stationery at state schools.

Most state integrated schools also charge "attendance dues", a compulsory fee paid to the school's proprietors to cover the cost of maintaining and upgrading school land and buildings. Unlike voluntary donations, attendance dues are not optional and parents are contractually and legally required to pay them, and schools can take action to collect these or cancel the enrollment of a student if they are not paid.

Private schools rely mainly on tuition fees paid to the school by the parents of the students, although some funding is provided by the government. As of 2013, private schools receives from the Government (exclusive of GST) $1013 for every Year 1 to 6 student, $1109 for every Year 7 and 8 student, $1420 for every Year 9 and 10 student, and $2156 for every Year 11 to 13 student.&lt;ref name="privatesubsidy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/Schools/PublicationsAndResources/Circulars/Circulars2012/Circular201207.aspx |title= Circular 2012/07 – Private school subsidy funding 2013 |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |date= September 2012 |accessdate= 7 February 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130217014213/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/Schools/PublicationsAndResources/Circulars/Circulars2012/Circular201207.aspx |archivedate= 17 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government funding is more of a partial tax rebate, as the GST payable to the government on the tuition fees collected often exceeds the government funding received in turn.

Salaries and wages for teaching staff in state and state integrated schools are paid directly from the Ministry of Education to the employee, and are not paid out of a school's funding. The salaries are fixed nationwide, and are based on the teacher's qualifications, years of service and workload, with middle and senior management awarded extra pay through "units". In 1991, following the decentralisation of school administration (the "Tomorrow's Schools" reforms), there was an attempt to move the responsibilities of paying teachers' salaries from the ministry to each school's Board of Trustees, in which each board would receive a lump sum from the government for all costs, including the payment of salaries. Known as "Bulk Funding", the proposal met strong opposition from teachers and their unions, particularly the [[Post Primary Teachers' Association]], and [[wildcat strike action]] occurred among teachers as some schools' boards of trustees gradually elected to move to the new system. Bulk Funding was eventually scrapped in July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://old.ei-ie.org/statusofteachers/file/%282003%29%20Bulk%20Funding%20in%20New%20Zealand%20-%20%20A%20Retrospective%20en.pdf |title= Bulk Funding in New Zealand: A Retrospective |first= Bronwyn |last= Cross |date= September 2003 |accessdate= 24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special needs students are entitled to Ongoing Resource Scheme (ORS) funding, which is used for facilitating the adaption of the curriculum to fit the student, funding of teacher aides and specialists, and procuring any special equipment required. There are three levels of funding based on the student's needs: very high, high or combined moderate. For example, a student who is totally blind or deaf is classified as very high needs, while a student who is partially sighted (6/36 or worse) or severely or profoundly deaf (71&amp;nbsp;dB loss or worse) is classified as high needs. ORS funding is permanent, so it continues until the student leaves school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/ServicesAndSupport/OngoingResourcingScheme/AboutORS.aspx |title= About Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS) |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 12 February 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207024200/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/SpecialEducation/ServicesAndSupport/OngoingResourcingScheme/AboutORS.aspx |archivedate= 7 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tertiary education===
Funding for tertiary education in New Zealand is through a combination of government subsidies and student fees. The government funds approved courses by a tuition grant based on the number of enrolled students in each course and the amount of study time each course requires. Courses are rated on an equivalent full-time Student (EFTS) basis. Students enrolled in courses can access Student Loans and Student Allowances to assist with fees and living costs.

Funding for Tertiary Institutions has been criticised recently due to high fees and funding not keeping pace with costs or inflation. Some also point out that high fees are leading to skills shortages in New Zealand as high costs discourage participation and graduating students seek well paying jobs off shore to pay for their student loans debts. As a result, education funding has been undergoing an ongoing review in recent years{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

===Students===
Most tertiary education students rely on some form of state funding to pay for their tuition and living expenses. Mostly, students rely on state provided student loans and allowances. Secondary school students sitting the state run examinations are awarded scholarships, depending on their results, that assist in paying some tuition fees. Universities and other funders also provide scholarships or funding grants to promising students, though mostly at a postgraduate level. Some employers will also assist their employees to study (full-time or part-time) towards a qualification that is relevant to their work. People who receive state welfare benefits and are retraining, or returning to the workforce after raising children, may be eligible for supplementary assistance, however students already in full or part-time study are not eligible for most state welfare benefits.

====Student allowances====
Student Allowances, which are non-refundable grants to students of limited means, are means tested and the weekly amount granted depends on residential and citizenship qualifications, age, location, marital status, dependent children as well as personal, spousal or parental income. The allowance is intended for living expenses, so most students receiving an allowance will still need a student loan to pay for their tuition fees.

====Student loans====
The [[Student loans in New Zealand|Student Loan Scheme]] is available to all New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. It covers course fees, course related expenses, and can also provide a weekly living allowance for full-time students. The loan must be repaid at a rate dependent on income and repayments are normally recovered via the income tax system by wage deductions. Low income earners and students in full-time study can have the interest on their loans written off.

On 26 July 2005, the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] announced that they would abolish interest on Student Loans, if re-elected at the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|September election]], which they were. From April 2006, the interest component on Student Loans was abolished for students who live in New Zealand. This has eased pressure on the government from current students. However, it has caused resentment from past students many of whom have accumulated large interests amounts in the years 1992–2006.

== Dropping standards in New Zealand ==
In 1995 New Zealand students finished 18th out of 24 countries on an international survey, [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS). There was considerable public concern so the Government created a taskforce to address the problem. In 2001, the Ministry introduced the Numeracy Development Project, which was supposed to lift student performance. Instead, the new teaching methods appear to have "confused teachers, children and parents by presenting multiple alternative problem-solving strategies but neglecting basic knowledge" and over the next few years New Zealand's rating dropped even further.

In December 2012, the latest TIMSS survey found New Zealand 9-year-olds ranked 34th out of 53 countries — and were bottom equal among developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10870080|title=The great maths division|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half could not add 218 and 191 compared to 73% internationally. Ministry of Education figures show the number of 12-year-olds who were able to answer simple multiplication questions correctly dropped from "47% in 2001 — the year new maths teaching methods were introduced — to 37% in 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10870138|title=New MOE figures show its true – kids struggling at maths|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem flows on to high schools, where "there are still students who have difficulty with the very basics such as knowledge about whole numbers and decimals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10867176|title=Govt eyes back to basics in maths|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaughan Jones|Sir Vaughan Jones]], New Zealand's foremost mathematician, is concerned about the way maths is now taught in New Zealand arguing that children need to learn how to multiply and add and really understand those processes before moving on. Jones said children "need to know basic arithmetic before they try to start problem solving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10868665|title=Top mathematician backs call to change teaching methods|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012 a broader ranking process put New Zealand eighth out of 40 countries — seemingly giving the country one of the top education systems in the world. This ranking came from ''The Learning Curve'' global education report, published by education firm [[Pearson Education|Pearson]]. The report assesses performance rates of pupils in reading, writing and maths and is based on data from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. However, the validity of Pearsons' testing process for students has been questioned following the discovery of numerous errors in its tests and controversy regarding a question about a talking pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Gail|title=A Very Pricey Pineapple|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/opinion/collins-a-very-pricey-pineapple.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=22 August 2012|date=27 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615101504/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/opinion/collins-a-very-pricey-pineapple.html|archivedate=15 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more general note, the Pearson report said the quality of teaching was key factor in a successful education system but also highlighted the importance of an underlying culture focused on children's learning. The report noted that Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, which were all ahead of New Zealand, had societies "where education and learning was of the greatest importance and where parents were very much involved with their children's education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10851193|title=NZ's education system ranked high globally|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Māori and Pacific Island standards ===

According to former Education Minister Hekia Parata, New Zealand needs to raise the academic achievement of its Māori and Pacific Island students to match those of [[Pākehā]] students. In 2013, she said that the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] international standard showed Pākehā were ranked second in the world, Māori were 34th equal and Pacific students were ranked 44th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8481561/Parata-calls-for-system-shift-in-education|title=Parata calls for system shift in education|work=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School bullying ==

[[Bullying]] is a widespread issue in New Zealand schools. In 2007, one in five [[New Zealand high school]] students reported being [[cyber bullying|cyber-bullied]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10849907|title=Parents told to take charge online|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to [[physical bullying]], an international study in 2009 found New Zealand had the second highest incidence of bullying out of the 40 countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-government/news/article.cfm?c_id=144&amp;objectid=10609295|title=Deborah Coddington:  Parliamentary thugs give free lessons to child bullies|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Office of the Ombudsman (New Zealand)|Ombudsman]] launched an investigation into [[school bullying]] and violence after serious incidents at [[Hutt Valley High School]] in Lower Hutt, which included students being dragged to the ground, sexually assaulted, a student "being beaten unconscious and a student being burnt with a lighter". The Ombudsman's report recommended schools' guidelines be amended to make anti-bullying programmes compulsory in schools. [[Post Primary Teachers' Association]] president [[Robin Duff]] said the report illustrated a systemic failure by the Ministry of Education to help schools deal with bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10750043|title=Anti-bullying fight gains more support|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government responded by putting $60 million into a ''Positive Behaviour for Learning'' plan but the results were less than satisfactory. In March 2013, Secondary Principals Association president Patrick Walsh asked the Ministry to "urgently draft a comprehensive bullying policy for schools, after being surprised to find it did not have one." Mr Walsh believes that since schools are supposed to be self-managing, each school has "work it out" for themselves which "would mean that all 2500 schools all have to reinvent the wheel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10872836|title=Bullying: Principals want action|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HisoricNewEnglandlogotype.png|right|thumb|280px|Historic New England's brand and descriptor line. The organization was formerly known as the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities.]]
'''Historic New England''', previously known as the '''Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities''' ('''SPNEA'''), is a charitable, non-profit, historic preservation organization headquartered in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. It is focused on [[New England]] and is the oldest and largest regional preservation organization in the [[United States]]. Historic New England owns and operates [[historic site]] museums and study properties throughout all of the New England states except [[Vermont]], and serves more than 198,000 visitors and program participants each year. Approximately 48,000 visitors participate in school and youth programs focused on New England heritage.

Historic New England is a museum of cultural history that collects and preserves buildings, landscapes, and objects dating from the seventeenth century to the present and uses them to keep history alive and to help people develop a deeper understanding and enjoyment of New England life and appreciation for its preservation.

== History ==
[[File:1st Harrison Gray Otis House.JPG|thumb|right|[[First Harrison Gray Otis House|Harrison Gray Otis House]] is a historic house in Boston that serves as the headquarters of Historic New England]]
[[William Sumner Appleton]] Jr. founded the Society for the Preservation of new England Antiquities in 1910 for "the purpose of preserving for posterity buildings, places and objects of historical and other interest." Fearing that "our New England antiquities are fast disappearing because no society has made their preservation its exclusive object," Sumner Appleton and a small group of like-minded individuals founded SPNEA in 1910. By 1920, Director of Museums Harry Vinton Long wrote in his report that the museum’s purpose is "to preserve and illustrate the life of New Englanders..." The history of New Englanders encompasses the stories of family life, immigration, school girls' routines, servants' duties, the enslaved Africans, and the products of masons, carpenters, and furniture makers. The first annual meeting was held at the 41 Brimmer Street Boston home of [[Mary Lee Ware]], a noted philanthropist in the area as well at the patroness of Harvard University's famed [[Glass Flowers]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;The Magazine of History with Notes and Queries, Volume 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Accession records for 1910 list 19 items. Appleton considered everything from the mundane to the singular worth preserving, and so Historic New England's collection today ranges from everyday cakes of [[soap]] to extraordinary specimens of fine [[furniture]].  As a comprehensive heritage organization, Historic New England today cares for historic properties and landscapes; holds preservation easements and undertakes preservation advocacy work to protect historic properties; develops, maintains and interprets artifact collections; operates a library and archive; researches and publishes books and ''Historic New England'' magazine; and provides educational programs for children and adults.  The organization's mission statement outlines its goals: "We serve the public by preserving and presenting New England heritage." The organization focuses on New England domestic architecture, collections, and stories.

Founder William Sumner Appleton was succeeded as Director by Bertram K. Little, [[Abbott Lowell Cummings]] and Nancy R. Coolidge before the title of the chief executive officer was changed to President, with Jane C. Nylander and now Carl R. Nold serving in that capacity.

The organization formerly included one of America's most prominent architectural conservation centers (the SPNEA Conservation Center), which pioneered a number of conservation techniques under research leader [[Morgan W. Phillips]] and his apprentices.  Phillips is credited with coining the term [[architectural conservation]].

== Properties ==
Historic New England currently owns and operates 37 [[house museum]]s and 1,284 acres of farmland and landscapes across five New England states, representing nearly 400 years of architecture.  It also owns a wide-ranging collection of more than 100,000 objects of historical and aesthetic significance, the largest such assemblage of New England art and artifacts in the country. It also archives more than one million items documenting New England architectural and [[cultural history]], including photographs, prints and engravings, more than 20,000 [[architectural drawing]]s and specifications, books, manuscripts, and other ephemera.  The Collections Access Project, which provides Internet-based access to catalog data about many of the collections, went online during the organization's centennial in 2010.  A Collections and Conservation Center is located in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]], in a former shoe factory building.  While not open to the public, this facility provides for the proper care of collections and access to collections and collections information for curators, students and scholars.  Other museums also rent space for collections storage in this facility. Historic New England also owns the [[Plum Island Airport]], a small public [[general aviation]] airport located in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] on a site used for aviation since 1910.  The airport is located on the property of the historic Spencer-Peirce-Little Farm, donated to the organization in 1971 and operated as a museum since 1986.[http://www.plumislandaerodrome.org/]

[[File:Stephen Phillips House.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Stephen Phillips House|The Phillips House]] is  located at 34 [[Chestnut Street District|Chestnut Street]], Salem, MA. It is owned and operated as a [[historic house museum]] by Historic New England and is open for public tours.]]

== Exhibition programs ==
A traveling exhibition program presents collections and research to the general public, in cooperation with other museums throughout the region. Exhibitions have included ''America's Kitchens'', which appeared at the New Hampshire Historical Society in 2009; ''Drawing Toward Home'', an architectural drawing exhibition that opened at the [[Boston University]] Art Gallery in November 2009 and traveled to the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] during 2010; and a centennial exhibition entitled ''The Preservation Movement Then and Now'', which appeared in all six New England states beginning in late 2009 and continued through 2013.

On line exhibitions include ''Jewelry at Historic New England'', found at [http://www.jewelryhistory.org], ''The Preservation Movement Then and Now'', at [http://www.historicnewengland.org/resources/PresMovement/], ''From Dairy to Doorstep: Milk Delivery in New England, 1860-1960'' at [http://www.historicnewengland.org/resources/From_Diary_to_Doorstep/], and ''New England Photographs of Verner Reed'', at [http://www.historicnewengland.org/visit/tour/verner_reed.asp].

==Stewardship easement program==

Through a conservation easement program established in the early 1980s,  Historic New England holds easements on 97 ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}) privately owned New England properties.  It works with the owners of these properties to ensure preservation of their character-defining historic features.  The program provides comprehensive protection of exterior, interior and landscape features and is considered a national model for the protection of buildings that remain in active use and in private ownership.  Approximately one-third of the properties in the program were previously owned by Historic New England, and were returned to private ownership with preservation restrictions that continue in perpetuity.  The balance of the properties were enrolled by current or former owners, who donated the deed restrictions to the organization along with endowment fund contributions.  Endowment funds provide for the monitoring and enforcement of the easements, carried out by a full-time staff dedicated to that purpose.

== Membership programs ==
A Historic Homeowner program, available to all for an annual membership fee, provides information to those who own historic houses of any age, up to and including mid-20th-century homes.  The annual membership includes two consultations with staff experts, one on historic paint colors, and a second on a topic chosen by the member, ranging from window repair to roofing materials, hardware source or historic wallpaper selections, or other topics needed for the care of historic homes. Other specialized membership programs focus on Gardens and Landscapes, and on young adults through the Young Friends program, and an upper-level membership society called the Appleton Circle provides benefactor support for organizational programs.

== Governance ==
Historic New England is a [[501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt non-profit organization operating under the direction of a 15-member board of trustees.

== Museum properties ==
The following properties are open to the public.  Most are open only during the warmer months (typically June to mid-October), and many are open only for limited days on selected weekends.  Particularly fragile properties are open only a few days each year.  The grounds and facilities of some properties (notable ones being the Lyman Estate and the Langdon House) are available for private functions.

The '''Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center''' is a museum located in [[Skokie, Illinois]] near [[Chicago]].

Its [[mission statement]] is to "Remember the Past" and "Transform the Future" and to preserve the legacy of the Holocaust by honoring the memories of those who were lost and by teaching universal lessons that combat hatred, prejudice and indifference. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ilholocaustmuseum.org/pages/about/mission/|title=Mission|website=Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center|access-date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum fulfills its mission through the exhibition, preservation and interpretation of its collections and through education programs and initiatives that foster the promotion of human rights and the elimination of genocide

==History==

The Holocaust Memorial Foundation of Illinois, which runs the museum, began as small storefront operation along Main Street in 1981. The foundation and small museum were established as a response to a [[National Socialist Party of America|Neo-Nazi group's]] attempt to march through [[Skokie, Illinois#NSPA controversy|Skokie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which many Holocaust survivors had settled in the decades following the atrocities.

The new museum building opened to the public on April 19, 2009, in the attendance of keynote speaker [[Bill Clinton]] and special guest [[Elie Wiesel]]. President [[Barack Obama]] spoke through a recorded video message, as did [[Shimon Peres]], president of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There are also volunteers from the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace and the [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service]] (since 2009) that work for the museum.

==Take a Stand Center==
In 2017, the museum opened the Take a Stand Center.  It became the first museum in the world to employ a new technology that allows visitors to interact with speaking [[holographic]] images of [[Holocaust survivors]].  Connected to the holograph theater is an exhibit concerning organizations and individuals that have promoted [[human rights]] including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], and such figures as [[Ruby Bridges]] and [[Malala Yousafzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/reich/ct-ent-holocaust-museum-visionaries-0101-story.html |title=Two visionaries who made history at the Illinois Holocaust Museum |last=Reich |first=Howard |date=December 29, 2017 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-01-01 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The building was designed by [[Stanley Tigerman]]. The Interior and Exhibition was co-designed by [[Yitzchak Mais]], a former director of [[Yad Vashem]]. The Holocaust exhibition occupies the first floor, beside the auditorium, the main entrance hall, the information and membership desks, the coatroom, the gift shop, and library.

The upper floor contains the remembrance areas, the art gallery, the upper part of the auditorium, and offices. The basement contains classrooms, exhibition for children, an exhibition on the building’s history, and a conference area. 

The building’s main front is divided into two halves. The black half includes the entrance doors and the white half includes the exit doors. Between the two halves of the main front, there are objects that resemble torches. The main front is located in a narrow alley with a small parking lot on its northeast side. A wooded slope separates the museum from the highway I-94. As a result, one cannot  view the entire front from any place.

==Location and access==

The museum is located in the northwest corner of [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]], west of the [[Edens Expressway]] ([[Interstate 94|I-94]]). The nearest exit is Old Orchard Road. To the east of the museum is also an abandoned railroad [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]]. This right of way is considered for a new [[CTA Yellow Line]] extension, with a new terminal station in the proximity of the museum. The museum is already accessible through several bus lines nearby: [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] lines 205 and 54A, and [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] lines 208 and 422.

}}

The '''International Association for Military Pedagogy (IAMP)'''[http://www.militarypedagogy.org] was founded in November 2005 in Strausberg (Germany) as a successor to the European Military Pedagogy Forum (EMPF). 

The IAMP is an independent network of professionals whose studies focus on education and training in the [[military]] setting. Its goals include the spreading of information that would assist professional military institutions of advanced learning (e.g. [[military academies]] and [[staff colleges]]). The purpose of IAMP activities is to encourage discussion and  development in the theory of military pedagogy. Academics concerned with such subjects in civilian institutions of [[Higher education|higher learning]] can participate in the Association.

The Association accomplishes its goals by promoting research, publication, and information sharing among its membership. The IAMP establishes contacts among military institutions of higher learning, as well as among national and international agencies. Annual conferences are hosted by member institutions.

Membership is open to individuals with a professional interest in military pedagogy.

'''Jacob D. Hyman''' (December 11, 1909 – April 8, 2007) was a dean of the [[University at Buffalo]] (UB) Law School. 

Known to his friends as "Jack" and to former students as "Dean Hyman," the Boston native earned a bachelor's degree from [[Harvard College]] in 1931 and a law degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1934. After graduation, Hyman began his legal career in [[New York City]] with Blumberg and Parker, a medium-sized [[law firm]] with a significant administrative practice before federal agencies. Fascinated with the energetic [[New Deal]] lawyers whom he encountered in practice, Hyman moved to Washington, D.C., in 1939, joining the legal staff of the Wage and Hour Division of the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]]. Three years later, he moved to the Office of Price Administration, where he worked for [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and eventually became associate general counsel in charge of litigation in the special federal court that reviewed price-control orders.

In 1946, with the end of wartime price regulations, Hyman moved to Buffalo to join the faculty at the UB [[Law school|Law School]], then located downtown on Eagle Street. His teaching and scholarship centered in the areas of [[administrative law]], [[constitutional law]], jurisprudence, and state and local government law. Hyman became dean in 1953 and held that post until 1964, when he returned to full-time teaching. He retired for the first time in 1981, but kept teaching [[Part time|part-time]] until 2000, when he again retired, at the age of 90, after 54 years at the Law School. His devotion to equal educational opportunity at all levels of education was constant throughout his time in Buffalo. Throughout his teaching career, Hyman was active as a labor arbitrator, both in the public and private sectors. He also served as chair, board member, committee chair or committee member of such organizations as the City of Buffalo's Charter Revision Commission, the Community Welfare Council of Buffalo and [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Citizens Council on [[Human rights|Human Rights]], the Children's Aid Society and the [[Legal Aid Society]] of Buffalo and Erie County. Devoted to what some saw as "his" law school, Hyman also championed the university, working hard in support of its merger into the [[SUNY]] system in 1963 and later serving as the first chair of the President's Review Board.

Hyman was married to Clarice S. Lechner-Hyman, a former faculty member in the UB School of Nursing, who survived him.

'''Jamshid Nakhchivanski Military Lyceum''' ({{lang-az|Cəmşid Naxçıvanski adına Hərbi Lisey}}), also known as '''Military Lyceum named after Jamshid Nakhchivanski''', is a [[state school]], specializing in education and training of students in [[military science]] and preparing them for professional [[military service]]. The lyceum is located in the suburbs of [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

==History==
[[File:Jamshid.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Jamshid Nakhchivanski]]
The lyceum was established on July 28, 1971 by the decree No. 331 of the Central Committee of the [[Azerbaijani Communist Party|Communist Party]] of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] at initiative of the First Secretary of [[Azerbaijan Communist Party]] and later [[President of Azerbaijan]], [[Heydar Aliyev]] on the basis of an eight-year [[Baku]] [[boarding school]] No. 2. The initial name of the school was "Specialized boarding school of the republic". The school was subordinated to the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan SSR. In November 1971, Heydar Aliyev named it after Azerbaijani general, [[Jamshid Nakhchivanski]]. [[Major General]] Jamshid Nakhchivanski was a well known military professional, who liberated [[Shusha]] in 1918 but was purged by [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/eBooks/Articles/Azerbaijani%20Generals,%20Military%20Leaders%20and%20Heroes%20VAR.pdf| title= Azerbaijani Generals and Admirals, Military Leaders and Heroes | accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1976 through 1981, government provided financial and technical assistance to the lyceum to enhance the activities of the school.

In 1986, the school was renamed by the Ministry of Education to 'Boarding School for students studying Russian and increased military training'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://cnaxcivanski.azersayt.com/blog.html?page=comments&amp;member=cnaxcivanski&amp;newsid=251984 | title= Historical background on Jamshid Nakhchivanski Military Lyceum | accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aliyev&gt;{{cite web | url= http://library.aliyev-heritage.org/az/171589.html| title= Speech of President Heydar Aliyev | accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 28, 1991, the school was transferred from the Ministry of Education to [[Minister of Defense (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Defense]] by decree No. 65 and on November 18, 1991 was renamed to "Baku secondary school named after Jamshid Nakhchivanski" by Presidential decree No. 377. It was then renamed again by Heydar Aliyev to 'Jamshid Nakhchivanski Military Lyceum' on November 24, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://e-qanun.az/files/framework/data/3/f_3970.htm| title= Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı |trans-title= Decree of President of Azerbaijan Republic | accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student body==
At the time of establishment, there were only 49 cadets from first enrollment in 1971 who graduated in 1974. At present, the lyceum welcomes 800 cadets annually, 600 of which study in [[Baku]] and 200 study in the lyceum branch in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]].

The lyceum program consists of three year intensive study.&lt;ref name=Aliyev/&gt; Annually hundreds of young military professionals graduate from the lyceum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mia.gov.az/?/en/speech/view/3/| title= Interview of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Azerbaijan Republic, General - Colonel Ramil Usubov to the newspaper of "Azerbaijan" | accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many graduates continue their higher education in military schools in [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Italy]]. By 2009, the lyceum had produced 8,909 graduates: 10 of whom became [[general]]s and one [[admiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://az.apa.az/xeber_Cemshid_Naxchivanski_adina_Herbi__171308.html | title= Cəmşid Naxçıvanski adına Hərbi Liseyin məzunları təhsillərini aparıcı ölkələrin hərbi məktəblərində davam etdirirlər |trans-title=Jamshid Nakhchivanski Military Lyceum graduates continue their education abroad | publisher= [[Azeri Press Agency]] | author = Rashad Suleymanov| date= 2009-12-09 | accessdate= 2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heydar Aliyev has always paid special attention to this educational military establishment. On April 21, 2003 he collapsed on the stage due to severe drop in blood pressure while addressing the graduates of the lyceum on the occasion of anniversary of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1340708.html | title= Azerbaijan Report: May 6, 2003 | publisher= [[RFE/RL]] | author = | date= 2003-05-03 | accessdate= 2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aliyev died a few month later. Every year, the cadets hold events commemorating the founder of their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://az.apa.az/xeber_Cemshid_Naxchivanski_adina_Herbi__171308.html | title= Cəmşid Naxçıvanski adına hərbi liseydə anım tədbiri keçirilib |trans-title=Commemoration event is held at Jamshid Nakhchivanski Military Lyceum | publisher= [[Azeri Press Agency]] | author = Elnur Mammadli | date= 2010-05-07 | accessdate= 2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Small nations and great powers: a study of ethnopolitical conflict in the Caucasus |last1=Cornell |first1=Svante |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher= Curzon Press|location= England |isbn= 0-7007-1162-7 |page=72 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ff2zOZYaZx0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Khosrov+Sultanov#v=onepage&amp;q=Khosrov%20Sultanov&amp;f=false |accessdate= July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsley received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[University of Nashville]] in 1839,&lt;ref name="conkin"/&gt; and a Master of Arts degree in 1841.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; He received his M.D. degree in 1843 from the [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|Medical School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="tnencyclopedia"/&gt;

Lindsley became a congregant at the [[Downtown Presbyterian Church (Nashville)|First Presbyterian Church of Nashville]] in 1840.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; Four years later, on April 10, 1845, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; He received a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1858.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt;

==Career==
Lindsley became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of [[Smyrna, Tennessee]] in 1846.&lt;ref name="tnencyclopedia"/&gt; He returned to Nashville in 1847,&lt;ref name="tnencyclopedia"/&gt; where he was appointed by the Presbyterian Board of Domestic Missions to preach to African slaves and poor whites.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; He was also the pastor of [[Tulip Grove]], a plantation owned by [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]] next to [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], another plantation owned by President [[Andrew Jackson]] near Nashville.&lt;ref name="conkin"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Lindsley had been a classmate and he was a good friend [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], who ruled [[Nicaragua]] between 1856 and 1857.&lt;ref name="conkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jamison"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamison |first=James Carson |date=1909 |title=With Walker in Nicaragua: Reminiscences of an Officer of the American Phalanx |location=Columbia, Missouri |publisher=E.

During the [[American Civil War]], Lindsley was responsible for protecting the University of Nashville from the [[Union Army]].&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; He turned the university buildings into a hospital for the [[Confederate States Army]].&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; He was also in charge of all Confederate hospitals in Nashville.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt;

Lindsley was appointed as superintendent of schools in Tennessee in 1866.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; A year later, in 1867, he established [[Montgomery Bell Academy]] in 1867.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; Three years later, in 1870, he was a co-founder of the Tennessee College of Pharmacy.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; Lindsley served as secretary of the Tennessee Board of Health from 1877 to 1897.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; 

Lindsley was a co-founder of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; He was a member of the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Medical Association]], the American Academy of Medicine, the [[American Chemical Society]], the [[American Historical Association]], the Medical Society of Tennessee, and the [[Tennessee Historical Society]].&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt;

Lindsley authored ''The Confederate Military Annals of Tennessee'', published in 1886.&lt;ref name="conkin"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Lindsley married Sarah McGavock, the daughter of [[Jacob McGavock]],&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; on February 9, 1857. Sarah was the granddaughter of [[Randal McGavock]], who was the owner of the [[Carnton]] plantation and served as Mayor of Nashville from 1824 to 1825, as well as [[Felix Grundy]], who served as the Senator from Tennessee from 1829 to 1838 and as the 13th [[United States Attorney General]] from 1838 to 1840.&lt;ref name="tnencyclopedia"/&gt; She was also the sister of [[Randal William McGavock]], who served as the Mayor of Nashville from 1858 to 1859. 

They had six children.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; Their daughter Margaret married [[Percy Warner]], a prominent Nashville businessman and the namesake of the [[Percy Warner Park]]. 

==Death and legacy==
Lindsley died in 1897 in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; He was buried in the [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="findagrave"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14719457 |title=Dr John Berrien Lindsley |website=[[Find a Grave]] |access-date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his granddaughters, Mary and Pierce, were the first and second wives of [[Luke Lea (senator)|Luke Lea]], who served as the Senator from Tennessee from 1911 to 1917. 

The University of Nashville Medical Department is a precursor to the [[Vanderbilt University School of Medicine]], founded in 1875.&lt;ref name="eskindbio"/&gt; As a result, Lindsley's portrait is on display on the Vanderbilt campus.&lt;ref name="nashvillelibraryportrait"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nashville.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/nr/id/1853 |title=Portrait of John Berrien Lindsley, ca. 1983 |publisher=Nashville Public Library Digital Collections |website=Nashville Public Library |access-date=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also on display on the second floor of the [[Nashville Public Library]].&lt;ref name="nashvillelibraryportrait"/&gt;

The UK '''Large-Scale Complex IT Systems''' (LSCITS) Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lscits.cs.bris.ac.uk/ |title=About Large Scale Complex IT Systems |publisher=Bristol University |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a research and graduate education programme focusing on the problems of developing large-scale, complex IT systems (also referred to as [[Ultra-large-scale systems]] or ULSS). The initiative is funded by the [[EPSRC]], with more than ten million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] of funding awarded between 2006 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/F001096/1 |title=LSCITS-RPv2: Large-Scale Complex IT Systems Initiative - Research Programme v2 |publisher=Gow.epsrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H042644/1 |title=Cloud Computing for Large-Scale Complex IT Systems |publisher=Gow.epsrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The initial motivation for the establishment of a research programme in large-scale complex IT systems was the publication of a 2004 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/1167 |title=BCS Policy Hub |publisher=Bcs.org |date=2015-06-25 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] and the [[British Computer Society]]. This report examined the causes of failure of a number of large software projects and made several recommendations for research to address some of these problems.

A second report, authored by Seth Bullock &amp; Dave Cliff and also published in 2004, was commissioned by the UK Government's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Office of Science and Technology and carried the title ''Complexity and Emergent Behaviour in ICT Systems''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11478/1/HPL-2004-187.pdf|format=PDF|title= Complexity and Emergent Behaviour in ICT Systems :  Technical Report HP-2004-187, Semantic &amp; Adaptive Systems, Hewlett-Packard Labs|publisher=Eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main conclusions of this report were that the primary challenges needing to be addressed in the UK are institutional and cultural obstacles to appropriate interdisciplinary research and that there was an urgent need to address omissions in UK undergraduate computer science education.

In October 2005, Dave Cliff was appointed Director of the LSCITS initiative by the EPSRC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/Publications/corporate/AnnualReportAccounts0607.pdf EPSRC Annual Report 2006-7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402230012/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/Publications/corporate/AnnualReportAccounts0607.pdf |date=2 April 2012 }} p. 10/11&lt;/ref&gt; and was asked to consult extensively with industry on their problems in this area and, on the basis of this consultation, to form a consortium to tackle these problems. The results of the consultation were that the key concerns of industry were socio-technical issues arising from the interactions between organisations, people and systems and in high-integrity systems engineering. On the basis of this, a consortium was formed with two partners (York, Oxford) focusing on formal methods and high-integrity systems and two partners (Leeds, St Andrews) focusing on socio-technical systems. Subsequently, a further project focusing on cloud computing was approved with Bristol, St Andrews and Aston Universities as partners.

The five-year research project started in October 2007 with the associated EngD program starting in October 2009.

== Partners ==
* [[University of Bristol]]. Department of Computer Science (Prof [[Dave Cliff (professor)|Dave Cliff]])
* [[University of Leeds]]. Institute of Health Sciences (Prof Justin Keen). Dr Andreas Hild and Mr Kanwar Adeel Waheed Khan also worked on the LSCITS team along from 2008-2011, examining complexity in organisations aspects.
* [[University of Oxford]]. Department of Computer Science (Prof [[Marta Kwiatkowska]])
* [[University of St Andrews]]. School of Computer Science (Prof [[Ian Sommerville (academic)|Ian Sommerville]])
* [[University of York]]. Department of Computer Science (Prof John McDermid, Prof Tim Kelly, Prof Richard Paige, Dr Radu Calinescu)

== Research ==
The aim of the LSCITS research project is:

:"to improve existing technical approaches to complex systems engineering and to develop new socio-technical approaches that help us understand the complex interactions between organisations, processes and systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lscits.cs.bris.ac.uk/overview.html |title=Initiative overview |publisher=Bristol University |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSCITS stack (Figure 1) shows the research areas that are particularly relevant to LSCITS.

[[File:LSCITS-stack.jpg]]

The focus of the work of the project was initially in the following areas:

* Complexity in organisations (led by [[University of Leeds]])
* Socio-technical systems engineering (led by [[University of St Andrews]]).
* Predictable software systems(led by [[University of Oxford]])
* High-integrity systems (led by [[University of York]])

Work on mathematical foundations was not included as these were funded in a separate research programme by the [[EPSRC]] with complexity science research centres at the [[University of Bristol]] and the [[University of Warwick]]. A further centre on complex systems simulation was funded later at the [[University of Southampton]].

The work on novel computational approaches was superseded by work on [[cloud computing]] as the significance of this area emerged during the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lscits.cs.bris.ac.uk/cloud.html |title=Cloud computing |publisher=Bristol University |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Key Publications below describe the work of the project in more detail.

==The LSCITS EngD programme==
The LSCITS EngD programme &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/EngD/|title=Engineering Doctorate Centre|publisher=University of York|year=2010|accessdate=2015-10-19|archivedate=2011-01-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107132104/http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/EngD/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Engineering Doctorate]] scheme, coordinated by the [[University of York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/students/centres/Pages/byuni.aspx|title=Centres for doctoral training listed by university|publisher=EPSRC|accessdate=2015-10-19|archivedate=2011-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629212612/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/students/centres/Pages/byuni.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focuses on training and research in complex IT systems. Students on the programme take a range of core and optional taught modules and carry out research in conjunction with an industrial sponsor. The key difference between this programme and a conventional PhD is that students spend the majority of their time working with the industrial sponsor and may submit a portfolio thesis, describing several related research projects on a common theme, rather than a single topic.

Core modules on the scheme include
* Empirical Methods for LSCITS
* High-Integrity Systems Engineering
* Predictable Software Systems
* Socio-Technical Systems
* Systems Engineering for LSCITS
* Technology Innovation
Students take a number of optional modules in addition to these core topics from computer science, mathematics and management. Overall, the core and optional modules are intended to provide EngD students with breadth as well as depth in LSCITS topics.

In parallel with the taught part of the programme, students carry out research; research projects span LSCITS topics, including socio-technical systems, high-performance computing, cloud computing, systems and software engineering, safety critical systems, interactive and accessible systems, and advanced decision making. EngD industrial sponsors include leading multi-national corporations, through to small-to-medium-sized enterprises who wish to build research capability and capacity.

==Management and governance ==
Operational management of the entire LSCITS Initiative is the responsibility of the Director (Dave Cliff), and the two Initiative Co-Directors (Ian Sommerville and John McDermid).  Ian Sommerville manages integration across the various LSCITS work-packages and activities. John McDermid works with Richard Paige, the LSCITS EngD Centre Director, to manage the York-based LSCITS Engineering Doctorate programme.

The Director reports to the chair of the LSCITS International Scientific Advisory Board, and to the chair of the LSCITS National Stakeholder Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lscits.cs.bris.ac.uk/management.html |title=Large Scale Complex IT Systems Management |publisher=Bristol University |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two boards provide their guidance and advice on the LSCITS research and training programmes.

[[Image:Gordon Longmoor 1949.jpg|thumb|right|[[LMR 600 Gordon]] at Longmoor in 1949.]]
The '''Longmoor Military Railway''' (LMR) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[military]] [[railway]] in [[Hampshire]], built by the [[Royal Engineers]] from 1903 in order to train soldiers on railway construction and operations.

==Route==
{{Longmoor Military Railway}}
Authorised for construction from 1902, activities date from 1903 when an {{RailGauge|18in}} gauge tramway was laid to assist in removing 68 large [[corrugated iron]] huts from [[Longmoor Military Camp]] Camp to [[Bordon]].

The railway was relaid to {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}} [[standard gauge]] in 1905–1907 and was initially known as the '''Woolmer Instructional Military Railway'''. It was renamed the ''Longmoor Military Railway'' in 1935. The [[Liss]] extension was opened in 1933. The stations and junctions included:
*'''[[Bordon railway station|Bordon]]''' – the northern terminal, adjacent to Bordon station and with access to [[British Railways]] via the [[LSWR]] owned [[Bentley and Bordon Light Railway]].
*'''[[Oakhanger Halt railway station|Oakhanger Halt]]''' - serving the village of [[Oakhanger, Hampshire]]. Bordon station was nearer to Oakhanger and Oakhanger station was nearer to Bordon.
*'''[[Whitehill Junction railway station|Whitehill Junction]]''' - serving the village of [[Whitehill, Hampshire]].
*'''[[Two Range Halt railway station|Two Range Halt]]'''
*'''[[Woolmer railway station|Woolmer]]''' - serving the hamlet of [[Woolmer]].
*'''[[Longmoor Downs railway station|Longmoor Downs]]''' – the original terminus, and largest station on the line, serving the military camp.
*'''[[Weaversdown Halt railway station|Weaversdown Halt]]''' – originally a passing place at the hamlet of [[Weaversdown]], a station was constructed which served the eastern side of Longmoor Military Camp.
*'''[[Liss Forest Road railway station|Liss Forest Road]]''' - serving the hamlet of [[Liss Forest]].
*''Liss Junction'' – with access to the exchange sidings, and onwards into Liss [[British Railways]] goods yard.
*'''[[Liss railway station|Liss]]''' – the southern terminus, with a platform adjacent to those serving the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] (still running).

An additional loop ran eastwards from Longmoor camp via a station at Hopkins Bridge to Whitehill Junction, completed in 1942. This provided circular running to the line, allowing for improved training without the need to turn trains at the terminals.

As a training railway, it was often being constructed/deconstructed. The layout would often change, and at one time housed a machine which could lay {{convert|1500|yd}} of track a day. At its peak, the railway ran to over {{convert|70|mi|km}} of operational laid track and sidings.

==Operations==

The vehicles and stock on the LMR were very much an assortment to give the maximum learning opportunity. Well over a thousand locomotives had associations with the railway, although many only through the need for storage. The same was true of the signalling at the various locations on the line, including an Army version of flag signalling. After the end of [[World War II]], the collection also included captured enemy equipment, including a ''"Schienenwolf"'' or [[railroad plough]]: a German wagon which dragged behind it a huge hook, used to destroy sleepers and so render railway lines unusable to advancing enemy troops.

In addition to the various military items, there were old versions of standard passenger carriages. A passenger service was operated over the line at various times, nominally for personnel required on the railway, and others from the War Department/Ministry of Defence and their families.

There was only one fatal accident recorded on the line, which occurred in October 1956.&lt;ref name=HR115/&gt;&lt;ref name=HR156/&gt;

With a declining military role for railways both in Britain and the rest of the world, it was inevitable that the significance of the facilities offered by the LMR would be reduced in later years. Even so, the LMR was still important enough for the tracks of the Bentley to Bordon branch to be left in place when passenger services were withdrawn on 16 September 1957. This line remained in place as, although there was a British Railways connection at Liss, the Bordon branch made it easier to accommodate the movements of military traffic at short notice. In 1966, the movement of goods over the Bordon branch was suspended, and the line was taken up in 1967.

===Railway Inspectorate===
Among those who learned the workings of railways on the LMR, there were a select band who continued in railway-related work after leaving the services. These were the members of the [[Railway Inspectorate]], whose remit is to enquire into the circumstances surrounding British railway accidents. The first Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways not to have been trained in the army was R. J. Seymour, appointed in 1988.

===Locomotives===

A notable locomotive based on the LMR was 'Kingsley', an 1886-built [[4-4-0]] tank locomotive.  This had formerly been locomotive No.10 of the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]] and was the last surviving locomotive from this company when scrapped in 1953.&lt;ref name="MGNJRloc"&gt;{{cite journal

===Accidents and incidents===
On 13 October 1956 a passenger train hauled by [[LMS Stanier Class 8F|Class 8F]] [[2-8-0]] WD512 was involved in a head-on collision with a permanent way train hauled by [[0-6-0]] [[LMS diesel shunters|diesel shunter]] WD877 ''Bari'' between Weaversdown Halt and Liss Forest Road stations. Six soldiers who were in a [[brake van]] behind the diesel locomotive were killed and eight were injured. The cause of the accident was driver error on the part of the driver of the passenger train, who had entered the section without authority. This was compounded by the signalling arrangements at Liss Forest Road, where there was no [[trap point]] to prevent the train entering the section after [[signal passed at danger|passing a danger signal]].&lt;ref name=HR115&gt;{{cite journal | last = Courtney | first = Geoff | authorlink = | title = Longmoor derailed an Arthur | journal = Heritage Railway | volume = | issue = 115 | pages = 32–33 | publisher = Mortons Media Group Ltd | location = Horncastle | date = 4 Sep – 1 Oct 2008 | url = | issn =1466-3562 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HR156&gt;{{cite journal |title=Six die in Longmoor's blackest day - but was there a military cover-up? |first=David |last=Willcock |journal= Heritage Railway |issue= 156|date= 27 October – 23 November 2011 |pages=62–66 |publisher=Mortons Media Ltd |location=Horncastle |issn=1466-3562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signalling system at Liss Forest was single line telephone and ticket. The block man wrote out the ticket even though the work train was still in section. The ticket was exchanged for the one engine in steam key which controlled the section from Liss Forest to Liss. This saved the block man the trip of walking up the platform with the ticket after the work train had cleared. It was a misty day and the passenger train armed with the ticket passed the signal at red which then led to the fatal crash.

===Closure===
In the light of the reducing role of the military and the severely reduced British Empire, it was decided by the Ministry of Defence to close the railway. On hearing of its impending closure local locomotive preservation groups became interested in acquiring the small but complete rail system, and a bid was placed to purchase LMR along with the airstrip at Gypsy Hollow which would have enabled the production of a unique transport museum. The MOD rejected this proposal, which had been backed by the Association of Railway Preservation Societies and The Transport Trust.  However the Army did offer the last 1½ miles of line from Liss Forest Road to Liss. The offer was accepted, a provisional lease was drawn up and planning permission was sought for developments at Liss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dypevag.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/liss.htm Liss, Hants&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205215705/http://www.dypevag.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/liss.htm |date=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately the people of Liss did not share this enthusiasm and opposed the planning permission.  Several residents raised £9,100 in a successful bid to buy this last piece of line. Longmoor Military Railway closed down with a ceremonial last day of operation on 31 October 1969, though for another two years some locomotives and stock remained on site, and there were occasional movements.  Three items of rolling stock (a van, a brake van, and a bogie flat) still remain on the Longmoor site, as part of the [[FIBUA]] training village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.films.mod.uk/south_east/longmoor_camp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207232402/http://www.films.mod.uk/south_east/longmoor_camp.htm |archivedate=7 February 2011 |df= }} Image of three remaining rolling stock items.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation===
Some of the stock of the LMR did pass into the hands of preservationists, for example [[Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST]] No.118 ''Brussels'' to the [[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]], and many relics went to the Museum of Army Transport at [[Beverley]], [[Yorkshire]], itself since closed, with the exhibits transferred to care of the [[National Army Museum]], although mostly held in storage. [[WD Austerity 2-10-0]] locomotive [[LMR 600 Gordon]], resident on the [[Severn Valley Railway]] for many years, was donated to the SVR by the National Army Museum in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Severn Valley Railway News|year=2008|volume=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preserved Ex-LMR Locomotives====

Some of the Hunslet Austerity tanks were only ever at Longmoor for storage, and were not used operationally there.

==In popular culture==
The railway was used as the location for a number of films including ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]'' (1956), ''[[The Inn of the Sixth Happiness]]'' (1958), ''[[Runaway Railway]]''  (1965), ''[[The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery]]'' (1966), ''[[The Magnificent Two]]'' (1967) and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968).

In February 1956 the railway was used to stage a train derailment for the BBC programme ''Saturday Night Out'' when Ex-SR King Arthur class locomotive 30740 Merlin and three coaches were pushed down an incline onto a specially canted section of track.&lt;ref name=HR115 /&gt;

[[File:Lourdesnajera3.jpg|thumb|alt= |Lourdes Gutiérrez Nájera]]

'''Lourdes Gutierrez Najera''' is an American [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]]. She is an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at [[Drake University]]. She is a member of the [[Latin American Studies Association]], [[American Anthropological Association]], and Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social. Her research is published in journals and books such as ''Beyond El Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America''. Other publications include reviews of scholarly work. Her academic accomplishments and research pertain to the field of Latinx national migration, indigenous communities in the United States and Mexico, and the U.S.-Mexican borderlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~anthro/faculty/gutierrez.html|title=Department of Anthropology {{!}}|website=www.dartmouth.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gutierrez Najera received her bachelor's degree in Latin American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles after transferring with an associate degree from Pasadena City College. In 2007 she published an award-winning dissertation and received a joint Ph.D. in Social Work and Anthropology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She holds a professional degree in [[Social work|Social Work]] with a concentration in Health Policy and Evaluation from [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Dartmouth College. [http://dfd.dartmouth.edu/profiles/194 Faculty directory], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Gutierrez Najera was awarded first place for her dissertation "Yalálag is No Longer Just Yalálag: Circulating Conflict and Contesting Community in a Zapotec Transnational Circuit" at the American Association of Hispanics in Higher Education 2009 conference.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt, Mark I. [http://www.ets.org/newsroom/news_releases/hispanic_scholars_honored_2009 "Hispanic Scholars Honored for Dissertations"]. ETS Press Release, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research==
Much of Gutierrez Najera's ethnographic research and work is within the frameworks of transnational migration and [[indigeneity]]. Gutiérrez Nájera's focus is on concepts of identity, conflict and belonging.

===Hayandose===
In her work, "Hayandose: Zapotec Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging," Gutierrez Najera conducted [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] research in the Los Angeles enclave of migrants from the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] town of Yalálag, [[Oaxaca]].  [[Hayandose]] refers to the phrase "no se hayaban." The Yalaltecos use this phrase to explain a feeling of displacement, or of "belonging neither here nor there." Gutierrez Najera developed the concept of hayandose to explain cultural practices that create a sense of belonging, [[collective identity]] and community:

:"As Yalaltecos, part of the Oaxacalifornia experience, inhabiting a space that is neither fully Yalálag or Angelinos, reflects the ambiguities they feel about belonging neither here nor there. But through participation in cultural events and practices such as those described in this chapter, Yalaltecos living in Los Angeles create a sense of belonging."&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez Najera, Lourdes. "Hayandose," in ''Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America''. Ed. Gina M. Perez, Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PérezGuridy2010"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=cNu_BHxxHu4C}}|title=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America|last1=Pérez|first1=Gina M.|last2=Guridy|first2=Frank|last3=Burgos|first3=Adrian|date=27 October 2010|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-9128-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutierrez Najera contends that the Yalaltec community displays the feeling of belonging, creation of space and community for transnational migrants in which migrants symbolically exist and participate in multiple sites.{{Clarify|reason=no idea what this means|date=May 2018}} Other scholars who have contributed in the area of indigenous transnational migration include [[Lynn Stephens]], Jonathan Fox, Gaspar Rivera-Salgado and Robert C. Smith.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Conflict and migration===
Instead of viewing conflict as a finite event, Gutierrez Najera describes it as a process. Using a historical framework, she argues migration and the state play a role in the production of conflict among Yalaltecans.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez Nájera, Lourdes. [http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/4344655 "Yalálag is No Longer Just Yalálag: Circulating Conflict and Contesting Community in a Zapotec Transnational Circuit"]. Digital Dissertation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/4344655|title=HKUL: Electronic Resources|last=Libraries|first=The University of Hong Kong|website=sunzi.lib.hku.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She expanded on this in her essay "Transnational Migration, Conflict, and Divergent Ideologies of Progress". In this piece, she argues conflict and migration are "interrelated parts of broad historical, economic, and political processes" that unfold through the "circulation of people, ideas, and goods". This understanding of transnational migration as part of the process of local conflict offers a new perspective for social workers working with indigenous migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nájera|first=Lourdes Gutiérrez|date=2009|title=Transnational Migration, Conflict, And Divergent Ideologies Of Progress|jstor=40553652|journal=Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development|volume=38|issue=2/3/4|pages=269–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child welfare===
Her work ''Latinos and Child Welfare'' influenced the literature and practices of social workers working with children in the Latino community. Gutierrez Najera helped identify the unique social service needs and characteristics of this population and has been cited by other scholars to help address these issues.

==Publishing==
Cohen's first book was ''Creative Writing for Lawyers'', which was published in 1990. The book was intended to draw the natural fictional talents of lawyers, with the idea that legal and fictional writing are compatible genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawyer Who Writes Offers Advice to Others Who Might |date=July 8, 1991 |author=Robin Pogrebin |publisher=''New York Observer''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He next authored the book ''Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Legal Boundaries and Regulatory Perspectives'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=36160 |title=Whither Goes Alternative Care? |date=July 12, 1999 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |publisher=''Dynamic Chiropractic''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=188134 |page=1633 |title=Law: Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Legal Boundaries and Regulatory Perspectives - Review |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |date=November 11, 1998 |publisher=''JAMA Ethics''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen then authored the book ''Beyond Complementary Medicine: Legal and Ethical Perspectives on Health Care and Human Evolution'' in 2000. Dr. Wayne Jonas reviewed the book in the ''[[Association of American Medical Colleges|Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges]]'' stating that, "Cohen ... points out the consequences of applying legal and ethical principles to concepts and assumptions not usually discussed in conventional circles yet used and believed daily by the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Wayne Jonas |publisher=''[[Association of American Medical Colleges|Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges]]'' |title=Beyond Complementary Medicine |date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Cohen authored the book ''Future Medicine: Ethical Dilemmas, Regulatory Challenges, and Therapeutic Pathways to Health Care and Healing in Human Transformation''.

}}'''''Multani v Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys''''', [2006] 1 S.C.R. 256, 2006 SCC 6 is a decision by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in which the Court struck down an order of a [[Quebec]] school authority, that prohibited a [[Sikh]] child from wearing a [[kirpan]] to school, as a violation of [[freedom of religion]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2(a)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.  This order could not be saved under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the ''Charter''.

The case involved a 12-year-old Sikh named Gurbaj Singh, who in November 2001 dropped a metal kirpan at his school, [[École Sainte‑Catherine‑Labouré]].  This prompted the [[school board]] to request certain limits on the wearing of the kirpan, including that it be covered at all times.  The Sikh family accepted this request.  However, another board, in February 2002, overrode the school board, deciding that the kirpan was a weapon and thus was not allowed under the code of conduct.  The council of commissioners agreed with the latter decision, although they suggested a non-metal kirpan could be used.  The [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] found in favour of the council of commissioners.

==Decision==
First, the majority of the Court, whose opinion was authored by Justice [[Louise Charron]], denied that the case should be decided under the rules of [[administrative law]], which required simple reasonableness.  The majority believed this would limit the rights under the Charter.  As Charron wrote, "The rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Canadian Charter establish a minimum constitutional protection that must be taken into account by the legislature and by every person or body subject to the Canadian Charter."&lt;ref&gt;Para. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule against weapons under administrative law was not the subject of this case.  The real focus was how in practise the law banned the kirpan.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court went on to note that the council of commissioners, which had banned the kirpan, was bound by the Charter.  This was because the council was created by a statute and thus received its powers from a legislature.  While the concurring justices Deschamps and Abella believed section 1 of the Charter could only be used on unconstitutional written laws, Charron wrote that section 1 can also be applied to delegated power.  If the power is used according to the law, it is "prescribed by law" as required by section 1; ''[[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)]]'' (2000) was an example of a case in which delegated power was not prescribed by law.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the council acted according to the law, the Court could now look at the freedom of religion issue.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of religion===
[[Image:Kirpan small.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A student's right to carry a kirpan is an example of religious freedom according to the Supreme Court.]]
This raised the question of whether freedom of religion was an "absolute right" or had "internal limits" aside from the limits under section 1. ''[[Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers]]'' (2001) was cited to suggest freedom of religion is limited by other values aside from under section 1, in this case the goals of order and security.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court noted that since ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'' (1985), there had been recognition that freedom of religion should not be used to harm others, but section 1 was the ideal place for this consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, in the ''Trinity Western University'' case, the Court merely had to address a situation in which freedom of religion and equality rights might contradict each other.  As this contradiction was prevented by the Supreme Court, section 1 was not used to harmonize the two rights.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  With these issues in mind, the Court turned to apply freedom of religion analysis to this case.

The decision followed precedent in ''[[Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem]]'' (2004) that for a claim to freedom of religion to succeed, an individual should show he/she believes a practise is connected to a religious belief.  Next, the infringement of freedom of religion should be serious.  In this case, the carrying of the kirpan was deemed to be connected to religion because it was necessary according to Orthodox Sikhism.  The same beliefs also dictated that the kirpan not be used to harm others.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  The claimant's belief that the kirpan must be metal was also considered sincere.  While other Sikhs used non-metal kirpans, that was irrelevant to the beliefs of this individual.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court then moved on to find the violation of freedom of religion was considerable.  The claimant had to leave public school.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasonable limits===
The Court then turned to consider whether the violation of freedom of religion could be upheld under section 1 of the Charter.  Following ''[[R. v. Oakes]]'' (1986), the Court asked whether there was a sufficient objective for the violation.  The main concern, as noted by the Quebec Court of Appeal, was school safety, which helps to maintain an atmosphere in which students can learn.  The Supreme Court agreed that would qualify as an important objective under section 1.  However, they then noted there were varying degrees of safety, with the highest degree of safety being excessive.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court contemplated the highest degree of safety would require the banning of [[scissors]] and other such objects.  Thus, safety in school is usually only supposed to be "reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;Para. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the council wanted to rid the schools of weapons, the Court deemed the council's objective to be reasonable.  This raised the question as to whether the rights infringement was rational and proportionate to the objective.  The banning of the kirpan was considered rational because it was a weapon, and thus the banning fit the objective of ridding the school of weapons.

However, the banning of the kirpan was not proportionate to the objective.  It was noted the claimant could not wear the kirpan at school at all, even though the claimant would have accepted limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The council had said that the kirpan could be stolen, or it could encourage other students to bring weapons to school.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court replied the claimant himself was not violent, and the limitations accepted by the claimant made a theft unlikely.  The thief would have to seize the claimant and look under the claimant's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there was little to no proof students have used kirpans as weapons in schools.  Although cases involving airline security have resulted in the banning of kirpans on planes, the Court quoted the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] as saying whereas people know each other in a school, planes will always carry different people who never know each other.  There is little opportunity to judge whether a passenger is violent.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  As for the argument that the kirpan could encourage other students to bring weapons to school, as defence against the kirpan, the Court replied this was speculative.  Of relation to this concern was the worry that the school atmosphere would be negatively affected.  The Court replied it was untrue that the kirpan represented violence, and that it had religious meanings instead.  The Court also found this theory could be offensive to Sikhs and would thus contradict [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Para. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  If some students feel it is unfair that the claimant can wear a kirpan to school while they cannot carry knives, the Court suggested schools should teach these students the importance of freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was noted that in ''Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers'', the Court had said schools should teach values and promote [[civic virtue]].  Allowing the kirpan would thus be beneficial in that it would teach students the importance of freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concurrences==

===Deschamps and Abella===
Justices [[Marie Deschamps]] and [[Rosalie Abella]] wrote a concurring opinion.  While they agreed with Charron's decision to overturn the ban on the kirpan, they found that the proper way to do this was through the rules of administrative law.  Constitutional law should be used primarily for statutes and regulations, and the tests used in constitutional law, such as the Oakes test, work best on these laws.  Section 1 of the Charter indicates the Oakes test best applies to decisions "prescribed by law."  Meanwhile, administrative law would work when dealing with what in this case was an administrative body.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 85, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the ''Trinity Western University'' case and ''[[Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36]]'', Charron and Abella also felt a measure of [[deference]] was appropriate.  There was also indication that the law meant for local authorities rather than courts to have a greater say in such matters.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  At any rate, Descamps and Abella found that "it is difficult to imagine a decision that would be considered reasonable or correct even though it conflicted with constitutional values."&lt;ref&gt;Para. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideal situation would be for administrative laws to apply Charter values rather than to have their decisions challenged as violations of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative law required reasonableness.  The Quebec Court of Appeal found that kirpans could only be harmful, but Abella and Deschamps criticized this opinion for neglecting other evidence.  Other objects commonly found at school can be used as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Para. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the Sikh student had accepted limits on the wearing of the kirpan.  Thus, the decision was judged unreasonable.

===LeBel===
Another concurrence was written by Justice [[Louis LeBel]].  He noted the difficulty of using a section 1 analysis, in this case on administrative law.  He wrote that the Canadian Charter and [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]] do not always need to be used when administrative law provides an analytical framework.  However, the [[Constitution of Canada]] inevitably has an impact in some cases.  In this case freedom of religion was invoked, as well as [[security of person]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7 of the Charter]] when it came to other students' safety.

To reconcile these conflicting rights, LeBel wrote that section 1 was not the only possible answer.  He pointed to ''[[Young v. Young]]'' (1993) to support this proposition.  In this situation, evaluating the ban on kirpans should be done through administrative law regarding the commission's authority to protect security of person, and then this evaluation should be judged in light of the Constitution.  Before moving to section 1, the rights should be defined.  In this case, LeBel found no evidence anyone's security of person was at risk.  Turning to the Oakes test, he disregarded the requirement for a sufficient objective for rights violations since the governing statutes were not questioned.  On the issue of proportionality, he felt the commission did not effectively prove its case.

The '''National Policy on Education''' (NPE) is a [[Government policy|policy]] formulated by the [[Government of India]] to promote education amongst India's people. The policy covers elementary education to colleges in both rural and urban India. The first NPE was promulgated in 1968 by the government of [[Indian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], and the second by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in 1986. 
The government of India has appointed a new committee under K. Kasturirangan to prepare a Draft for the new National Education Policy in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/education/national-education-policy-kasturirangan-to-head-panel-to-prepare-final-draft-4723600/ National Education Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
{{main|Education in India}}

Since the country independence in 1947, the Indian government sponsored a variety of programmes to address the problems of illiteracy in both rural and urban India. [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]], India's first [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Minister of Education]], envisaged strong central government control over education throughout the country, with a uniform educational system. The Union government established the University Education Commission (1948–1949), the Secondary Education Commission (1952–1953), university Grants Commission and the Kothari Commission (1964–66) to develop proposals to modernise India's education system. The Resolution on Scientific Policy was adopted by the government of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first Prime Minister. The Nehru government sponsored the development of high-quality scientific education institutions such as the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]]. In 1961, the Union government formed the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT) as an autonomous organisation that would advise both the Union and state governments on formulating and implementing education policies.&lt;ref name="NCERT"&gt;{{cite journal|title=NCERT|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/html/pdf/FinalNCERT_ProfileBrochures.pdf|publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1968==
Based on the report and recommendations of the Education Commission (1964–1966), the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced the first National Policy on Education in 1968, which called for a "radical restructuring" and equalise educational opportunities in order to achieve national integration and greater cultural and economic development.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Informatics Centre|url=http://www.education.nic.in/policy/npe-1968.pdf|publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]]|pages=38–45|accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy called for fulfilling compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14, as stipulated by the [[Constitution of India]], and the better training and qualification of teachers.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; The policy called for focus on learning of regional languages, outlining the "[[three language formula]]" to be implemented in secondary education - the instruction of the [[English language]], the official language of the state where the school was based, and [[Hindi language|Hindi]],&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Language education was seen as essential to reduce the gulf between the [[intelligentsia]] and the masses. Although the decision to adopt Hindi as the national language had proven controversial, the policy called for use and learning of Hindi to be encouraged uniformly to promote a common language for all Indians.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; The policy also encouraged the teaching of the ancient [[Sanskrit language]], which was considered an essential part of India's culture and heritage. The NPE of 1968 called for education spending to increase to six percent of the national income.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Informatics Centre|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/NPE-1968.pdf|journal=PDF|publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]]|format=PDF|pages=38–45|accessdate=2009-07-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the NPE 1968 has moved location on the national website.&lt;ref&gt;http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/NPE-1968.pdf{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1986==
Having announced that a new policy was in development in January, 1985, the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi introduced a new National Policy on Education in May, 1986.&lt;ref name="A401"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Education Policy 1986|url=http://education.nic.in/cd50years/g/T/49/0T490401.htm|publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]]|pages=38–45|accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new policy called for "special emphasis on the removal of disparities and to equalise educational opportunity," especially for Indian women, [[Scheduled Tribe]]s (ST) and the [[Scheduled Caste]] (SC) communities.&lt;ref name="A401" /&gt; To achieve such a social integration, the policy called for expanding scholarships, adult education, recruiting more teachers from the SCs, incentives for poor families to send their children to school regularly, development of new institutions and providing housing and services.&lt;ref name="A401"/&gt; The NPE called for a "child-centred approach" in primary education, and launched "Operation Blackboard" to improve primary schools nationwide.&lt;ref name="A501"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Education Policy 1986 |url=http://education.nic.in/cd50years/g/T/49/0T490A501.htm |publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]] |pages=38–45 |accessdate=2009-07-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy expanded the [[open university]] system with the [[Indira Gandhi National Open University]], which had been created in 1985.&lt;ref name="A501"/&gt; The policy also called for the creation of the "rural university" model, based on the philosophy of Indian leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]], to promote economic and social development at the grassroots level in rural India.&lt;ref name="A501"/&gt; 1986 education policy expected to spent 6%of GDP on education

==1992==
The 1986 National Policy on Education was modified in 1992 by the [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] government.&lt;ref name="HRD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.education.nic.in/policy/npe86-mod92.pdf | title=National Policy on Education, 1986 (As modified in 1992) | accessdate=3 March 2011 | publisher=[[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|HRD Ministry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Former Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] adopted a new policy based on the "Common Minimum Programme" of his [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) government.&lt;ref name="AIEEE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aieee.nic.in/aieee2012/aieee/welcome.html | title=AIEEE | accessdate=15 July 2012 | publisher=[[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|HRD Ministry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programme of Action (PoA), 1992 under the National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986 envisaged conduct of a common entrance examination on all India basis for admission to professional and technical programmes in the country. For admission to Engineering and Architecture/Planning programmes, Government of India vide Resolution dated 18 October 2001 has laid down a Three – Exam Scheme (JEE and AIEEE at the National Level and the State Level Engineering Entrance Examinations (SLEEE) for State Level Institutions – with an option to join AIEEE). This takes care of varying admission standards in these programmes and helps in maintenance of professional standards. This also solves problems of overlaps and reduces physical, mental and financial burden on students and their parents due to multiplicity of entrance examinations.

The '''National Postdoctoral Association''' ('''NPA''') is a non-profit 501(c)3 educational organization in the [[United States]] that is dedicated to enhancing the quality of the postdoctoral experience for all participants. Since its founding in 2003, more than 160 institutions have adopted portions of the NPA’s Recommendations for Postdoctoral Policies and Practices. Today the NPA has 180 institutional members, whose research efforts are supported by 40,000 postdocs, and 2,000 individual members

Largely run by member volunteers, NPA activities are coordinated by three professional staff members located at NPA headquarters in Washington, DC. The NPA is supported by its members and charitable contributions from the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

==History==
The NPA was established with the goal of facilitating improvements for postdoctoral researchers in the United States. At the time of its founding, there was no national organization with the primary aim of improving the American postdoctoral experience. The NPA has worked collaboratively with research institutions, postdoctoral affairs offices (PDOs), postdoctoral associations (PDAs), professional organizations, and scientific funding agencies. The NPA has sought especially to encourage the creation of additional PDOs and PDAs.

=== Founding members ===
A steering committee composed of postdoctoral representatives from across the country initiated the formation of the NPA. The committee coalesced in April 2002 during Science's NextWave Postdoc Network meeting held in Washington D.C. At this meeting, attendees expressed broad support for a national organization that would provide focus and affect positive change for postdocs. In January 2003, the NPA was officially formed.

The founding members of the NPA include:

*Orfeu M. Buxton - University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois
*Karen Christopherson - Stanford Medical School, Stanford, California
*Raymond Clark - University of California, La Jolla, California
*Carol L. Manahan - Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland
*Arti Patel - National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, Maryland
*Avi Spier - The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California
*Claudina Aleman Stevenson - National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, Maryland

==Aims==
The aim of the NPA is to advance the U.S. research enterprise by maximizing the effectiveness of the research community and enhancing the quality of the postdoctoral experience for all participants.

==NPA organization==
Largely run by member volunteers, NPA activities are coordinated by two professional staff members located at NPA headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] The NPA is supported by its members and grants from government agencies and private foundations.

=== Leadership ===
The NPA is led by a 12-member Board of Directors that is elected by the dues-paying membership. Within this Board, the Executive Committee and Governance Committees provide direction for the operations of the association. The Board governs the Committees of the Membership and the Executive Director. The Advisory Council also reports to the Board and provides an additional resource for guidance and support to the Board and Executive Director. The staff report directly to the Executive Director.

The members of the Board of Directors are elected for a two-year term, and Board elections are held annually. Governance Committee Chairs serve one-year terms. The Board appoints Chairs and Vice Chairs for the Committees of the Membership and the Diversity and International Officers, usually after a call for candidates.

=== Membership ===
There are three types of NPA membership: Affiliate Member, Sustaining Member, and Full Individual Member. Organizations can obtain a Sustaining Membership that serves as a conduit for complimentary affiliate membership to that organization’s individuals. Any individual may join the NPA under the full membership category.

===Committees of the membership===
These committees are run by volunteers and are open to anyone interested in improving the postdoctoral experience.

'''Advocacy Committee:''' 
Addresses advocacy and policy issues affecting the postdoctoral community. Activities of this committee include the promotion and implementation of NPA recommended policies and practices as described in the Agenda for Change, increasing diversity among postdoctoral researchers, and monitoring the interests of international postdocs training in the United States. Additionally, the Advocacy Committee monitors policy issues and helps to maintain relationships with federal agencies and national organizations.

'''Meetings Committee:''' 
Plans and coordinates NPA-sponsored meetings and seminars. The main tasks revolve around the Annual and Regional meetings, including development of agendas, logistical arrangements, marketing and fundraising activities, and conducting post-meeting evaluations

'''Outreach Committee:''' 
Conducts outreach activities to promote the mission of the NPA. Its main activities include development and implementation of an annual campaign to recruit and retain NPA members, and expansion of member benefits through partnerships with organizations, businesses, and institutions. This committee is working on cultivating relationships with news media, societies. and other groups interested in postdoctoral issues.

'''Resource Development Committee:''' 
Develops and maintains tools and resources for use by the postdoctoral community. Main activities of this committee include maintaining the NPA website, publication of The POSTDOCKet, the quarterly publication of the NPA, and creation and implementation of NPA-sponsored surveys

===Diversity and international officers===
The Diversity Officer provides leadership on diversity issues and brings together postdocs and their allies in order to develop new resources, track information, promote dialogue, and effect change for underrepresented groups. The International Officer serves as the public face of international postdoc issues for the NPA. The Officers work with the membership committees to ensure that the NPA addresses the needs of the communities they represent and are the primary resource and expert advisor to the NPA Board of Directors, the Staff, and committees.

=== Governance committees ===
Governance committees are generally populated by the members of the Board of Directors, although members of the NPA Advisory Council may be invited to serve if their skill set matches the agenda of the Committee.
* Development
* Finance
* Oversight governance
* Personnel
* Strategic planning

==NPA program activities==
The NPA’s program activities are focused in three key areas:

=== Advocacy ===
The association advocates for policy change within research institutions that host postdoctoral scholars. Since the association’s founding, more than 160 institutions have adopted portions of the NPA’s Recommended Practices. The NPA continues to work with the leadership of federal funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), to develop new programs and policies for postdoctoral training, compensation, and benefits. The NPA values its partners in advocacy, including prominent national associations and organizations that represent the scientific, research, and higher education communities.

=== Community-building ===
The NPA hosts annual and regional meetings to provide opportunities for the postdoctoral community to gather and share best practices. The association also maintains various listservs and a Web site to facilitate networking nationwide

=== Resource development ===
The NPA continues to provide the tools and resources that postdocs and administrators need for success. Most NPA publications are available online, with selected resources for members only. These include: an International Postdoc Survival Guide, Toolkits for Postdoc Associations &amp; Offices, an Institutional Policy Database, and a Career Development Clearinghouse.

== Events ==

=== Annual meeting ===
Ever since its birth, the NPA convenes once a year for a meeting that focuses on postdoc activities (e.g., career development, training standard, advocacy, etc.). The meeting locations alternate between the East coast and the West coast, and spans two-and-a-half days. The first day of the meeting includes on site registration, a poster session, sessions for new attendees and round table networking meetings about the structure and functioning of the PDA and PDOs, as well as opening reception. The second day includes many plenary sessions, and concurrent workshops that cover topics of interests for postdocs, as well as keynote speaker. The third day continues with some concurrent sessions, plenary, and the meeting concludes with a town-hall meeting for the NPA, where ideas for new topics are exchanged.

Over the years sessions have included: career development and immigration planning for postdocs, underrepresented minority in academia, science and policy, issues related to communicating with non-scientific audience, a transition from academia to industry workshop Myers-Briggs sessions, posters describing activities in various postdoc associations nationwide. Among the keynote speakers, Dr Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), gave a speech at the 8th NPA meeting in Philadelphia March 12–14, 2010, for 283 attendants.

==== 2012 ====
The 2012 NPA Meeting was held at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco, CA from March 16–18, 2012. This meeting marked the 10th anniversary of the NPA and had over 300 attendees. The 2012 meeting featured a session with the NPA founders, provided sessions about the growth and contributions of the NPA to postdocs, and the nationwide role the NPA plays to the postdoctoral community. During a Town Hall session, participants were invited to provide the NPA with what they thought are unsolved or unknown problems in the scientific research community in general, as well as postdoc-specific issues, in order to incorporate them in the future strategic planning for the organization. The meeting also hosted sessions for networking and innovative discussions. As always, the NPA meeting gives special care to international postdocs, with sessions on immigration and Green Card application. The meeting’s Keynote speaker was Dr. Alan Leshner, Chief Executive Officer of the American Association on for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Executive Publisher of the journal Science since December 2001. Dr. Leshner spoke on the current state of the scientific enterprise and what the future may hold. The NPA LinkedIn page saw a surge of almost 1200 new members in the 3 months following the meeting.

=== National Postdoc Appreciation Week ===
Starting 2009, every year the NPA holds a celebration to highlight the contributions of postdocs. The event takes places on the third week of September. Institutions and universities around the US participate in that event through major networking activities, including happy hour, seminars, and more. Although postdoc training is considered a temporary position, postdocs are a vital part of the research body, and contribute a major portion of publications and grants. Therefore, the NPA decided to focus on the role postdocs play by celebrating an annual National Postdoc Appreciation Week. This event includes not only postdocs, but also graduate students and faculty members, friends and family.

September 24, 2009 marked the National Postdoctoral Association's first ever 'National Postdoc Appreciation Day'. 70 institutions across 27 states hosted celebrations, and there were events held in Canada and Australia. The Appreciation Day was organized to recognize the contribution that postdocs make to research every day across the country. Events were organized at institutions ranging from universities and research institutes, to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Events ran the gamut from ice cream socials, to BBQs and Happy Hours. Many institutions also used the day as an opportunity to hold career seminars, mini research symposia and presentations about maximising the postdoctoral experience.

== Interaction with the community ==
The NPA maintains a Facebook page, a LinkedIn page, and a Twitter account. These sites are used to encourage communication and information sharing by the NPA members and the community.

{{Communitarianism sidebar}}
{{distinguish|negative liberties|positive liberties}}
'''Negative and positive rights''' are [[rights]] that oblige either action (''positive rights'') or inaction (''negative rights''). These obligations may be of either a [[natural and legal rights|legal or moral]] character. The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to [[liberty rights]].

To take an example involving [[Party (law)|two parties in a court of law]]: Adrian has a ''negative right to x'' against Clay [[if and only if]] Clay is ''prohibited'' from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. In contrast, Adrian has a ''positive right to x'' against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. A case in point, if Adrian has a ''negative right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has a ''positive right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian.

Rights considered ''negative rights'' may include [[civil and political rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]], life, [[property (ownership right)|private property]], freedom from [[violent crime]], [[freedom of religion]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', a [[fair trial]], and freedom from [[slavery]].

Rights considered ''positive rights'', as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist [[Karel Vasak]], may include other civil and political rights such as [[police]] protection of person and property and the [[right to counsel]], as well as [[economic, social and cultural rights]] such as [[right to food|food]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[public education]], [[employment]], [[national security]], [[military]], [[right to health|health care]], [[social security]], [[right to internet access|internet access]], and a minimum [[right to an adequate standard of living|standard of living]]. In the [[three generations of human rights|"three generations"]] account of human rights, negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights, while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations.

Some philosophers (see criticisms) disagree that the negative-positive rights distinction is useful or valid.

==Overview==
Under the theory of positive and negative rights, a negative right is a right ''not to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group—a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or [[coercion]].  As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to ''negate'' them. A positive right is a right ''to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group.  In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be ''added'' to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. In the framework of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]], negative rights can be associated with [[Categorical imperative#Perfect duty|perfect duties]] while positive rights can be connected to [[Categorical imperative#Imperfect duty|imperfect duties]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Belief in a distinction between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] lists both positive and negative rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions of most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority of liberal democracies provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and [[unemployment benefit]]s.

==When they conflict==

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

Rights are often spoken of as [[natural rights|inalienable]] and sometimes even [[moral absolutism|absolute]]. However, in practice this is often taken as [[graded absolutism]]; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted in the course of preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: [[right of self-defense|self-defense]]. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered [[prima facie]], meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.

Thus a thief may have a negative obligation not to steal, and a [[police officer]] may have a negative obligation not to tackle people&amp;mdash;but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the (unarmed) thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill&amp;mdash;being universally regarded as one of the highest, if not the highest obligation&amp;mdash;is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.

Positive obligations confer duty. But as we see with the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered ''[[prima facie]]''. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception&amp;mdash;one higher obligation of self-defense&amp;mdash;but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically in the case of [[triage]] after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably ''prima facie''. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably ''prima facie'' they must always be agreed to through contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html "Individual rights"], ''Ayn Rand Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying:
{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary." It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to [[Jan Narveson]], the view of some that there is no distinction between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is "mistaken". He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says "the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Narveson - Libertarianism: A Philosophical Introduction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210122955/http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|url=http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|author=Narveson, Jan|work=Against Politics|archivedate=February 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarians]] hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view do not mean that police, for example, are not obligated to protect the rights of citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life&amp;mdash;but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

Other advocates of the view that there is a distinction between negative and positive rights argue that the presence of a police force or army is not due to any positive right to these services that citizens claim, but rather because they are [[natural monopolies]] or [[public goods]]&amp;mdash;features of any human society that arise naturally, even while adhering to the concept of negative rights only. [[Robert Nozick]] discusses this idea at length in his book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.{{ref|nozick}}

===In medicine===
In the field of [[medicine]], positive rights of [[patient]]s often conflict with negative rights of [[physician]]s.  In controversial areas such as [[abortion]] and [[assisted suicide]], medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out as a result of conscience, a right granted by [[conscience clause]] statutes in many jurisdictions, patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/do-we-need-a-pro-choice-l_b_178456.html|title=Do We Need a Pro-Choice Litmus Test for Obstetricians?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case of [[Janet Murdock]], a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/big-sky-dilemma-must-doct_b_275034.html|title=Big Sky Dilemma: Must Doctors Help Their Patients Die?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] and bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]].&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley J.|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2009/09/03/right-to-die-means-a-physician-duty-to-kill/|title=The 'Right to Die' Means a Physician Duty to Kill?|date=3 September 2009|website=First Things|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'', Appel has written:
{{quote|Medical licenses are a limited commodity, reflecting an artificial shortage created by a partnership between Congress and organizations representing physicians&amp;mdash;with medical school seats and residency positions effectively allotted by the government, much like radio frequencies. Physicians benefit from this arrangement in that a smaller number of physicians inevitably leads to increased rates of reimbursement. There's nothing inherently wrong with this arrangement. However, it belies any claim that doctors should have the same right to choose their customers as barbers or babysitters. Much as the government has been willing to impose duties on radio stations (e.g., indecency codes, equal time rules) that would be impermissible if applied to newspapers, Montana might reasonably consider requiring physicians, in return for the privilege of a medical license, to prescribe medication to the dying without regard to the patient's intent.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;}}

Smith replies that this is "taking the duty to die and transforming it into a duty to kill", which he argues "reflects a profound misunderstanding of the government’s role".&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Aid Pakistan Truck.jpeg|thumb|right|180px|A right to adequate nutrition requires duties to avoid stealing, but also duties to act in ways that protect or repair the delivery of the supplies. The right cannot be fully guaranteed by only positive, or else only negative duties; it needs both.]]
Presumably, if a person has positive rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher [[Henry Shue]] is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more "negative" or "positive") requires both kinds of duties at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a "negative" duty) but also protective or reparative actions ("positive" duties). The negative positive distinction may be a matter of emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe ''any right'' as though it requires only one of the two types of duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights/&gt;

To Shue, rights can always be understood as confronting "standard threats" against humanity. Dealing with standard threats requires all kinds of duties, which may be divided across time (e.g. "if avoiding the harmful behaviour fails, begin to repair the damages"), but also divided across people. The point is that every right provokes all 3 types of behaviour (avoidance, protection, repair) to some degree. Dealing with a threat like murder, for instance, will require one individual to practice avoidance (e.g. the potential murderer must stay calm), others to protect (e.g. the police officer, who must stop the attack, or the bystander, who may be obligated to call the police), and others to repair (e.g. the doctor who must resuscitate a person who has been attacked). Thus, even the negative right not to be killed can only be guaranteed with the help of some positive duties. Shue goes further, and maintains that the negative and positive rights distinction can be harmful, because it may result in the neglect of necessary duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights&gt;Shue, Henry (1980). Chapters 1-2 of ''[[Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

James P. Sterba makes similar criticisms. He holds that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. He writes:
{{quote|What is at stake is the liberty of the poor not to be interfered with in ''taking from the surplus possessions of the rich'' what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs. Needless to say, libertarians would want to deny that the poor have this liberty. But how could they justify such a denial? As this liberty of the poor has been specified, it is not a positive right to receive something, but a negative right of non-interference.(emphasis added){{ref|sterba}}}}
Sterba has rephrased the traditional "positive right" to provisions, and put it in the form of a sort of "negative right" ''not to be prevented'' from taking the resources on their own.. Thus, all rights may not only require both "positive" and "negative" duties, but it seems that rights that do not involve forced labor can be phrased positively or negatively at will.{{ref|sterba}} The distinction between positive and negative may not be very useful, or justified, as rights requiring the provision of labor can be rephrased from "[[right to education]]" or "[[right to health|right to health care]]" to "right to take surplus money to pay teachers" or "right to take surplus money to pay doctors".

The '''New York City Parents Union''' is a student rights advocacy organization, formed in 2011 by President [[Mona Davids]].  According to its mission statement, the group seeks to make high-quality public education available to the children of New York, through "empowering parents, supporting school choice, advocacy, legislation and lawsuits."&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite web|author1=NYCPU|title=Mission|url=http://www.nycparentsunion.org/about-us/mission|accessdate=4 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711131741/http://www.nycparentsunion.org/about-us/mission|archivedate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been at the center of a number of high-profile lawsuits, most notably the case now known as ''Davids v. New York'', which was closely patterned after a similar case, ''[[Vergara v. California]]''.  ''Davids v. New York'' was eventually consolidated with a similar suit known as ''Wright v. New York'' that fellow school reformer [[Campbell Brown]], head of Partnership for Educational Justice, had announced she would file on behalf of seven New York parents.  The ''Davids v.

An '''online community''', also called an '''internet community''', is a [[virtual community]] whose members interact with each other primarily via the Internet. For many, online communities may feel like home, consisting of a "family of invisible friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rheingold|first1=H|title=The virtual community: Homesteading on the electronic frontier|date=2001|publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who wish to be a part of an online community usually have to become a member via a specific site and necessarily need an internet connection. An online community can act as an [[information system]] where members can post, comment on discussions, give advice or collaborate. Commonly, people communicate through [[social networking sites]], [[chat room]]s, [[Internet forum|forum]]s, e-mail lists and discussion boards. People may also join online communities through [[video games]], [[blogs]] and [[virtual worlds]].

Constance Elise Porter from the University of Notre Dame in a paper entitled ''A Typology of Virtual Communities: A Multi-Disciplinary Foundation for Future Research''&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Constance Elise. (2004). A Typology of Virtual Communities: A Multi-Disciplinary Foundation for Future Research.&lt;/ref&gt; offers this definition: "a virtual community is defined as an aggregation of individuals or business partners who interact around a shared interest, where the interaction is at least partially supported and/or mediated by technology and guided by some protocols or norms".

==Categorization==
The idea of a community is not a new concept. On the telephone, in [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] and in the online world, social interactions no longer have to be based on proximity; instead they can literally be with anyone anywhere.&lt;ref name="jcmc.indiana.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Preece|first1=Jenny|last2=Maloney-Krichmar|first2=Diane|title=Online Communities: Design, Theory, and Practice|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=July 2005|volume=10|issue=4|pages=00–00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00264.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of communities has had to adapt along with the new technologies. Many researchers have used [[ethnography]] to attempt to understand what people do in online spaces, how they express themselves, what motivates them, how they govern themselves, what attracts them, and why some people prefer to observe rather than participate.&lt;ref name="jcmc.indiana.edu"/&gt; Online communities can congregate around a shared interest and can be spread across multiple websites.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baym, Nancy. "The new shape of online community: The example of Swedish independent music fandom."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some signs of community are:
*Content: articles, information, and news about a topic of interest to a group of people.
*Forums or newsgroups and email: so that community members can communicate in delayed fashion.
*Chat and instant messaging: so that community members can communicate more immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdesign.about.com/cs/communityonline/a/aa082599.htm|title=Why Create an Online Community|author=Jennifer Kyrnin|work=About.com Tech|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020222605/http://webdesign.about.com/cs/communityonline/a/aa082599.htm|archivedate=2011-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
There is a set of values known as [[Etiquette in technology|netiquette]] (or Internet etiquette) to consider as an online community develops. Some of these values include: opportunity, education, culture, democracy, human services, equality within the economy, information, sustainability, and communication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;hci.uma.ptPreece03-OnlineCommunities-HandbookChapt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An online community's purpose is to serve as a common ground for people who share the same interest(s).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Online communities may be used as calendars to keep up with events such as upcoming gatherings or sporting events. They also form around activities and hobbies. Many online communities relating to health care help inform, advise and support patients and their families. Students can take classes online and they may communicate with their professors and peers online. Businesses have also started using online communities to communicate with their customers about their products and services as well as to share information about the business. Other online communities allow a wide variety of professionals to come together to share thoughts, ideas and theories.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Fandom]] is an example of what online communities can evolve into. Online communities have grown in influence in "shaping the phenomena around which they organize" according to Nancy K. Baym's work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She says that: "More than any other commercial sector, the popular culture industry relies on online communities to publicize and provide testimonials for their products." The strength of the online community's power is displayed through the season 3 premiere of BBC's ''Sherlock''. Online activity by fans seem to have had a noticeable influence on the plot and direction of the season opening episode. Mark Lawson of The Guardian recounts how fans have, to a degree, directed the outcome of the events of the episode. He says that "Sherlock has always been one of the most web-aware shows, among the first to find a satisfying way of representing electronic chatter on-screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lawson, M.|title=Sherlock and Doctor Who: beware of fans influencing the TV they love|work=The Guardian|date=January 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/03/sherlock-doctor-who-fans-influencing-tv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107171839/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/03/sherlock-doctor-who-fans-influencing-tv|archivedate=2017-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions where members may post their feedback are essential in the development of an online community.&lt;ref&gt;Cothrel, Joseph, Williams, L. Ruth "Four Smart Ways to Run Online Communities"&lt;/ref&gt; Online communities may encourage individuals to come together to teach and learn from one another. They may encourage learners to discuss and learn about real-world problems/situations as well as focus on such things as teamwork, collaborative thinking and personal experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751601000471 | doi=10.1016/S1096-7516(01)00047-1 |year=2001 | volume=4 | title=A survey of current research on online communities of practice | journal=The Internet and Higher Education | pages=45–60| last1=Johnson | first1=Christopher M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Online communities"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plant|first=Robert|date=January 2004|title=  Online communities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X0300099X|doi=10.1016/j.techsoc.2003.10.005|volume=26|journal=Technology in Society|pages=51–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Online communities are dynamic by nature and there are researchers and organizations working to classify them. For example, it is important to know the security, access, and technology requirements of a given type of community as it may evolve from an open to a private and regulated forum.&lt;ref name="Online communities"/&gt; A number of authors have studied online communities to better understand how they are structured. It has been argued that the technical aspects of online communities, such as whether pages can be created and edited by many, as is the case with wikis including [[Wikipedia]], or whether only certain users can post entries and edit them, as is the case with most [[weblog|blog]]s, can place online communities into stylistic categories. Another approach argues that "online community" is a metaphor and that contributors actively negotiate the meaning of the term, including values and social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Nicole R.|title="Community" Metaphors Online: A Critical and Rhetorical Study Concerning Online Groups.|journal=Business Communication Quarterly|year=2002|volume=65|issue=2|pages=92–100|doi=10.1177/108056990206500210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has looked at the users of online communities. [[Amy Jo Kim]] has classified the rituals and stages of online community interaction and called it the 'Membership life cycle'.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, A.J. (2000). Community Building on the Web : Secret Strategies for Successful Online Communities. Peachpit Press. {{ISBN|0-201-87484-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clay Shirky]] talks about community of practice whose members collaborate and help each other in order to make something better or improve a certain skill. What makes these communities bond is "love" of something as demonstrated by members who go out of their way to help without any financial interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clay Shirky|Shirky, Clay]] (2008). ''[[Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007925.html|title=Worldchanging - Evaluation + Tools + Best Practices: The Worldchanging Interview: Clay Shirky|work=worldchanging.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514233712/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007925.html|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell et al. developed a character theory for analyzing online communities, based on tribal typologies. In the communities they investigated they identified three character types:&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. &amp; Greenhil, A. (2002). Tribalism, Conflict and Shape-shifting Identities in Online Communities. In the Proceedings of the 13th Australasia Conference on Information Systems, Melbourne Australia, 7–9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. and Greenhill, A. (2009). Conflict and Identity Shape Shifting in an Online Financial Community, Information Systems Journal, (19:5), pp. 461–478. Available [http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2235/ online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307080636/http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2235/ |date=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The Big Man (offer a form of order and stability to the community by absorbing many conflictual situations personally)
# The Sorcerer (will not engage in reciprocity with others in the community)
# The Trickster (generally a comical yet complex figure that is found in most of the world's culture)

A 2001 McKinsey &amp; Company study showed that only 2% of transaction site customers returned after their first purchase, while 60% of new online communities users began using and visiting the sites regularly after their first experiences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Online communities have changed the game for retail firms, forcing them to change their business strategies. Companies have to network more, adjust computations, and alter their organizational structures. This leads to changes in a company's communications with their manufacturers including the information shared and made accessible for further productivity and profits. Because consumers and customers in all fields are becoming accustomed to more interaction and engagement online, adjustments must be considered made in order to keep audiences intrigued.&lt;ref name="Online communities"/&gt;

It may be beneficial to introduce a term described by Ray Oldenberg called a ''[[third place]]'' to help classify online communities. A "third place is a generic designation for a great variety of public places that host the regular, voluntary, informal, and happily anticipated gatherings of individuals beyond the realm of home and work" (Oldenburg, p.&amp;nbsp;16). An online community can take on the role of a third place. Third places have characteristics that many online communities exhibit, for example: they provide neutral ground for all parties; they are levelers, easily accessible and highly accommodating; conversation is the main activity; they allow people to keep a low profile, and a few others. While these may be characteristics to help classify online communities, they may not all apply to a specific online community nor does an online community need to embody each of these characteristics.

The four requirements of "virtual settlement" include: interactivity, a variety of communicators, a common public place where members can meet and interact, and sustained membership over time. Based on these considerations, it can be said that microblogs such as Twitter can be classified as online communities.&lt;ref&gt;Gruzd, Anatoliy, Barry Wellman, and Yuri Takhteyev. "Imagining Twitter as an Imagined Community." American Behavioral Scientist (2011). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building communities==
According to Dorine C. Andrews, author of ''Audience-Specific Online Community Design'' there are three parts to building an online community: starting the online community, encouraging early online interaction, and moving to a self-sustaining interactive environment.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Dorine C.|title=Audience specific online-community design|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=April 2001|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=505248.505275|accessdate=6 February 2012|doi=10.1145/505248.505275|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; When starting an online community, it may be effective to create webpages that appeal to specific interests. Online communities with clear topics and easy access tend to be most effective. In order to gain early interaction by members, privacy guarantees and content discussions are very important.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt; Successful online communities tend to be able to function self-sufficiently.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;

===Participation===
There are two major types of participation in online communities: public participation and non-public participation, also called lurking. [[Lurker]]s are participants who join a virtual community but do not contribute. In contrast, public participants, or posters, are those who join virtual communities and openly express their beliefs and opinions. Both lurkers and posters frequently enter communities to find answers and to gather general information. For example, there are several online communities dedicated to technology. In these communities, posters are generally experts in the field who can offer technological insight and answer questions, while lurkers tend to be technological novices who use the communities to find answers and to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nonnecke|first=Blair|author2=Dorine Andrews |author3=Jenny Preece |title=Non-public and public online community participation: Needs, attitudes and behavior|journal=Electronic Commerce Research|year=2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=7–20|doi=10.1007/s10660-006-5985-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, virtual community participation is influenced by how participants view themselves in society as well as norms, both of society and of the online community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Tao|title=Understanding online community user participation: a social influence perspective|journal=Internet Research|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=67–81|doi=10.1108/10662241111104884}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants also join online communities for friendship and support. In a sense, virtual communities may fill social voids in participants' offline lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ridings|first=Catherine M.|author2=David Gefen|title=Virtual Community Attraction: Why People Hang Out Online|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00229.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Barry Wellman presents the idea of "globalization" – the Internet's ability to extend participants' social connections to people around the world while also aiding them in further engagement with their local communities.&lt;ref name="pewinternet.org"&gt;[http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2001/Online-Communities/Summary-of-Findings/The-vibrant-social-universe-online.aspx Horrigan, John. (October 2001). Online Communities Summary of Findings: The Vibrant Social Universe Online. Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713012556/http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2001/Online-Communities/Summary-of-Findings/The-vibrant-social-universe-online.aspx |date=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspects of successful online communities===
An article entitled "The real value of on-line communities," written by A Armstrong and J Hagel of the ''Harvard Business Review'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = A. | last2 = Hagel | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = The real value of on-line communities | url = | journal = Harvard Business Review | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 134–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; addresses a handful of elements that are key to the growth of an online community and its success in drawing in members.  In this example, the article which was available on mendeley.com focuses specifically on online communities related to business, but its points can be transferred and can apply to any online community.  The article addresses four main categories of business-based online communities, but states that a truly successful one will combine qualities of each of them: communities of transaction, communities of interest, communities of fantasy, and communities of relationship.  Anubhav Choudhury, from incrediblogger.net, provides basic descriptions of each of these four types of online communities.&lt;ref&gt;Choudhury, Anubhav (2012). incrediblogger&lt;/ref&gt;

#Communities of transaction emphasize the importance of buying and selling products in a social online manner where people must interact in order to complete the transaction.
#Communities of interest involve the online interaction of people with specific knowledge on a certain topic.
#Communities of fantasy encourage people to participate in online alternative forms of reality, such as games where they are represented by avatars.
#Communities of relationship often reveal or at least partially protect someone's identity while allowing them to communicate with others, such as in online dating services.

==Membership lifecycle==
Amy Jo Kim's membership lifecycle states that members of online communities begin their life in a community as visitors, or lurkers. After breaking through a barrier, people become novices and participate in community life. After contributing for a sustained period of time they become regulars. If they break through another barrier they become leaders, and once they have contributed to the community for some time they become elders. This life cycle can be applied to many virtual communities, most obviously to [[bulletin board system]]s, but also to [[blog]]s, [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]] (list serve) and [[wiki]]-based communities like Wikipedia.

A similar model can be found in the works of Lave and Wenger, who illustrate a cycle of how users become incorporated into virtual communities using the principles of legitimate peripheral participation. They suggest five types of trajectories amongst a learning community:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lave and Wenger|url=http://www.novamind.com/connect/nm_documents/show_branch/joaoa/cb1c68a7-38b0-49d1-a475-eb45a0e6488d/658|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230084537/http://www.novamind.com/connect/nm_documents/show_branch/joaoa/cb1c68a7-38b0-49d1-a475-eb45a0e6488d/658|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2008|work=What is an online community?&gt;Virtual Community online community or e-community&gt;Membership life cycle&gt;|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Peripheral (i.e. Lurker) – An outside, unstructured participation
# Inbound (i.e. Novice) – Newcomer is invested in the community and heading towards full participation
# Insider (i.e. Regular) – Full committed community participant
# Boundary (i.e. Leader) – A leader, sustains membership participation and brokers interactions
# Outbound (i.e. Elder) – Process of leaving the community due to new relationships, new positions, new outlooks

The following shows the correlation between the learning trajectories and Web 2.0 community participation by using the example of YouTube.

'''Peripheral''' (Lurker) – Observing the community and viewing content.  Does not add to the community content or discussion. The user occasionally goes onto YouTube.com to check out a video that someone has directed them to.

'''Inbound''' (Novice) – Just beginning to engage the community.  Starts to provide content. Tentatively interacts in a few discussions.  The user comments on other user's videos.  Potentially posts a video of his or her own.

'''Insider''' (Regular) – Consistently adds to the community discussion and content.  Interacts with other users. Regularly posts videos.  Either videos they have found or made themselves.  Makes a concerted effort to comment and rate other users' videos. 
 
'''Boundary''' (Leader) – Recognized as a veteran participant.  Connects with regulars to make higher concepts ideas.  Community grants their opinion greater consideration. The user has become recognized as a contributor to watch.  Possibly their videos are podcasts commenting on the state of YouTube and its community.  The user would not consider watching another user's videos without commenting on them.  Will often correct a user in behavior the community considers inappropriate.  Will reference other user's videos in their comments as a way to cross link content.

'''Outbound''' (Elders) – Leave the community. Their interests may have changed, the community may have moved in a direction that they don't agree with or they may no longer have time to maintain a constant presence in the community.

=== Newcomers (Inbound) ===
Newcomers are important for online communities. Online communities rely on volunteers' contribution, and most online communities face high turnover rate as one of their main challenges. For example, only a minority of Wikipedia users contribute regularly, and only a minority of those contributors participate in [[Wikipedia:Dashboard|community discussions]].  In one study conducted by [[Carnegie Mellon University]], they found that "''more than two-thirds (68%) of newcomers to Usenet groups were never seen again after their first post"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arguello|first=Jaime|last2=Butler|first2=Brian S.|last3=Joyce|first3=Elisabeth|year=2006|title=Talk to me: foundations for successful individual-group interactions in online communities|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1124916|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|volume=|pages=Pages 959–968|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above facts reflect a point that recruiting and remaining new members have become a very crucial problem for online communities: the communities will eventually wither away without replacing members who leave.

Newcomers are new members of the online communities and thus often face many barriers when contributing to a project, and those barriers they face might lead them to give up the project or even leave the community. By conducting a systematic literature review over 20 primary studies regarding to the barriers faced by newcomers when contributing to the open source software projects, [http://www.igor.pro.br/ Steinmacher] et al. identified 15 different barriers and they classified those barriers into five categories as described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinmacher|first=Igor|last2=Silva|first2=Marco Aurelio Graciotto|last3=Gerosa|first3=Marco Aurelio|year=2015|title=A systematic literature review on the barriers faced by newcomers to open source software projects|url=|journal=Information and Software Technology|volume=59 |pages=67–85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Social Interaction''': this category describes the barriers when newcomers interact with existing members of the community. The three barriers that they found have main influence on newcomers are: ''"lack of social interaction with project members"'', ''"not receiving a timely response"'', and ''"receiving an improper response"''.
# '''Newcomers' Previous Knowledge''': this category describes the barriers which is regarding to the newcomers' previous experience related to this project. The three barriers they found classified into this part are: ''"lack of domain expertise", "lack of technical expertise",'' and ''"lack of knowledge of project practices"''.
# '''Finding a Way to Start:''' this category describes the issues when newcomers try to start contributing. The two barriers they found are: ''"Difficulty to find an appropriate task to start with"'', and ''"Difficulty to find a mentor"''.
# '''Documentation:''' documentation of the project also shown to be barriers for newcomers especially in the Open Source Software projects. The three barriers they found are: ''"Outdated documentation"'',''"Too much documentation"'', and ''"Unclear code comments"''.
# '''Technical Hurdles:''' technical barriers are also one of the major issue when newcomers start contributing. This category includes barriers: ''"Issues setting up a local workspace"'', ''"Code complexity"'' and ''"Software architecture complexity"''.
Because of the barriers described above,  it is very necessary that online communities engage newcomers and help them to adjust to the new environment. From online communities' side, new comers can be both beneficial and harmful to online communities. On the one side, newcomers can bring online communities innovative ideas and resources. On the other side, their misbehavior caused by lack experiences can be also harmful to communities. [[Robert E. Kraut|Kraut]] et al. defined five basic issues faced by online communities when dealing with newcomers, and proposed several design claims for each problem in their book ''Building Successful Online Communities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Successful Online Communities: Evidence-Based Social Design|last=Kraut|first=Robert|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=9780262528917|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Recruitment'''. Online communities need to keep recruiting new members in the face of high turnover rate of their existing members. Three suggestions are made in the book:
#* Interpersonal recruitment: recruit new members by old members' personal relationship
#* Word of mouth recruitment: new members will join in the community because of the word-of-mouth influence from existing member
#* Impersonal advertisement: although the direct effect is weaker than previous two strategies, impersonal advertising can effectively increase number of people joining among potential members with little prior knowledge of the community.
# '''Selection'''. Another challenge for online communities is to select the members who are a good fit. Unlike the offline organizations, the problem of selecting right candidates is more problematic for online communities since the anonymity of the users and the ease of creating new identities online. Two approaches are suggested in the book:
#* Self-selection: make sure that only good fit members will choose to join.
#* Screen: make sure that only good fit members will allow to join.
# '''Keeping Newcomers Around'''. Before new members start feel the commitment and do major contribution, they must be around long enough in online communities to learn the norms and form the community attachment. However, majority of them tend to leave the communities at this period of time. At this period of time, new members are usually very sensitive to either positive or negative evidence they received from group, which may largely impact the users' decision on whether they quit or stay. Authors suggested two approaches:
#* Entry Barriers: Higher entry barriers will be more likely to drive away new members, but those members who survived from this severe initiation process should have stronger commitment than those members with lower entry barriers.
#* Interactions with existing members: communication with existing member and getting respond from them in friendly environment encourage the new members commitment. The existing members are encouraged to treat the newcomers gently. One research did by Halfaker et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Don't bite the newbies: How Reverts Affect the Quantity and Quality of Wikipedia Work|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration - WikiSym '11, 163–172.|volume=|pages=163|doi=10.1145/2038558.2038585|year=2011|last1=Halfaker|first1=Aaron|last2=Kittur|first2=Aniket|last3=Riedl|first3=John|isbn=9781450309097}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned in the book suggested reverting new members' work in Wikipedia will likely to make them leave the communities. Thus, new members are more likely to stay and develop commitment if the interaction between existing member and new members are friendly and gentle. The book suggested different ways, including "''introduction threads''" in the communities, "''assign the responsibilities of having friendly interactions with newcomers to designed older-timers''", and "''discouraging hostility towards newcomers who make mistakes''".
# '''Socialization.''' Different online communities have their own norms and regulations, and new members need to learn to participate in an appropriate way. Thus, socialization is a process through which new members acquire the behaviors and attitude essential to playing their roles in a group or organization. Previous research in organizational socialization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Newcomer adjustment during organizational socialization: A meta-analytic review of antecedents, outcomes, and methods|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=92|issue=3|pages=707–721|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.3.707|year=2007|last1=Bauer|first1=Talya N.|last2=Bodner|first2=Todd|last3=Erdogan|first3=Berrin|last4=Truxillo|first4=Donald M.|last5=Tucker|first5=Jennifer S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that newcomers' active information seeking and [[Onboarding|organizational socialization]] tactics are associated with better performance, higher job satisfaction, more committed to the organization, more likely to stay and thus lower turnover rate. However, this institutionalized socialization tactics are not popular used in online setting, and most online communities are still using the individualized socialization tactics where newcomers being socialized individually and in a more informal way in their training process. Thus, in order to keep new members, the design suggestions given by this book are: ''"using formal, sequential and collective socialization tactics"'' and ''"old-timers can provide formal mentorship to newcomers."''
# '''Protection.''' Newcomers are different from the existing members, and thus the influx of newcomers might change the environment or the culture developed by existing members. New members might also behave inappropriately and thus be potential harmful to online communities as a result of their lack of experience. Different communities might also have different level of damage tolerance, some might be more fragile to newcomers' inappropriate behavior (such as open source group collaboration software project) while others are not (such as some discussion forums). So the speed of integrating new members with existing communities really depends on community types and its goals, and groups need to have protection mechanisms that serve to multiple purposes.

==Roles in an online community==
Although online societies differ in content from real society, the roles people assume in their online communities are quite similar. Elliot Volkman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialmediatoday.com/elliot-volkman/343142/what-online-community|title=What Is An Online Community?|work=Social Media Today|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101225201/http://socialmediatoday.com/elliot-volkman/343142/what-online-community|archivedate=2012-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out several categories of people that play a role in the cycle of social networking, these include:
*Community architect – Creates the online community, sets goals and decides the purpose of the site.
*[[Online community manager|Community manager]] – Oversees the progress of the society. Enforces rules, encourages social norms, assists new members, and spreads awareness about the community.
*Professional member – This is a member who is paid to contribute to the site. The purpose of this role is to keep the community active.
*Free members – These members visit sites most often and represent the majority of the contributors. Their contributions are crucial to the sites' progress.
*Passive [[lurker]] – These people do not contribute to the site but rather absorb the content, discussion, and advice.
*Active lurker – Consumes the content and shares that content with personal networks and other communities.
*[[Power user]]s – These people push for new discussion, provide positive feedback to community managers, and sometimes even act as community managers themselves. They have a major influence on the site and make up only a small percentage of the users.

==Motivations and barriers to participation==
{{main|Motivations for online participation}}
Successful online communities motivate [[online participation]]. Methods of motivating participation in these communities have been investigated in several studies.

There are many persuasive factors that draw users into online communities. Peer-to-peer systems and social networking sites rely heavily on member contribution. Users' underlying motivations to involve themselves in these communities have been linked to some persuasion theories of sociology.
* According to the reciprocation theory, a successful online community must provide its users with benefits that compensate for the costs of time, effort and materials members provide. People often join these communities expecting some sort of reward.
* The consistency theory says that once people make a public commitment to a virtual society, they will often feel obligated to stay consistent with their commitment by continuing contributions.
* The social validation theory explains how people are more likely to join and participate in an online community if it is socially acceptable and popular.

One of the greatest attractions towards online communities is the sense of connection users build among members. Participation and contribution are influenced when members of an online community are aware of their global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|doi=10.1145/2145204.2145267|title=Classroom Wikipedia participation effects on future intentions to contribute|conference=Proceedings of the ACM 2012 conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work - CSCW '12|pages=403|year=2012|last1=Zube|first1=Paul|last2=Velasquez|first2=Alcides|last3=Ozkaya|first3=Elif|last4=Lampe|first4=Cliff|last5=Obar|first5=Jonathan|isbn=9781450310864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of people learn by example and often follow others, especially when it comes to participation.&lt;ref&gt;Cosley, D., Frankowski, D., Ludford, P.J., &amp; Terveen, L. (2004). Think different: increasing online community participation using uniqueness and group dissimilarity. Proceedings of the Proceedings of the sigchi conference on human factors in computing systems (pp. 631–638). New York, NY: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are reserved about contributing to an online community for many reasons including but not limited to a fear of criticism or inaccuracy. Users may withhold information that they don't believe is particularly interesting, relevant, or truthful. In order to challenge these contribution barriers, producers of these sites are responsible for developing knowledge-based and foundation-based trust among the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ardichvili|first1=Alexander|last2=Page|first2=Vaughn|last3=Wentling|first3=Tim|title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge‐sharing communities of practice|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|date=March 2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=64–77|doi=10.1108/13673270310463626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users' perception of audience is another reason that makes users participate in online communities. Results showed that users usually underestimate their amount of audiences in online communities. Social media users guess that their audience is 27% of its real size. Regardless of this underestimation, it is shown that amount of audience affects users' self-presentation and also content production which means a higher level of participation.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, M. S., Bakshy, E., Burke, M., &amp; Karrer, B. (2013, April). Quantifying the invisible audience in social networks. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 21-30). ACM. {{cite web |url=http://static2.volkskrant.nl/static/asset/2013/Facebook_1462.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107171723/http://static2.volkskrant.nl/static/asset/2013/Facebook_1462.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of virtual online communities (VOC): dependent and self-sustained VOCs. The dependent VOCs are those who use the virtual community as extensions of themselves,{{clarify|date=October 2015}} they interact with people they know. Self-sustained VOCs are communities where relationships between participating members is formed and maintained through encounters in the online community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi/Budiman%20Adrian%20M.pdf?ohiou1215559506|title=ETD Home|work=ohiolink.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331124015/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi/Budiman%20Adrian%20M.pdf?ohiou1215559506|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all VOCs, there is the issue of creating identity and reputation in the community. People can create whatever identity they would like to through their interactions with other members. The username is what members identify each other by but it says very little about the person behind it. The main features in online communities that attract people are a shared communication environment, relationships formed and nurtured, a sense of belonging to a group, the internal structure of the group, common space shared by people with similar ideas and interests. The three most critical issues are belonging, identity, and interest. For an online community to flourish there needs to be consistent participation, interest, and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unisi-ch.academia.edu/STardini/Papers/783206/A_semiotic_approach_to_online_communities_belonging_interest_and_identity_in_websites_and_videogames_communities|title=A semiotic approach to online communities: belonging, interest and identity in websites' and videogames' communities|author=Stefano Tardini|work=academia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425082247/http://unisi-ch.academia.edu/STardini/Papers/783206/A_semiotic_approach_to_online_communities_belonging_interest_and_identity_in_websites_and_videogames_communities|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by Helen Wang applied the Technology Acceptance Model to online community participation.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, H., et al. (2012). "Understanding Online Community Participation: A Technology Acceptance Perspective." Communication Research 39(6): 781–801.&lt;/ref&gt; Internet self-efficacy positively predicted perceived ease of use. Research found that participants' beliefs in their abilities to use the internet and web-based tools determined how much effort was expected. Community environment positively predicted perceived ease of use and usefulness. Intrinsic motivation positively predicted perceived ease of use, usefulness, and actual use. The technology acceptance model positively predicts how likely it is that an individual will participate in an online community.

==Consumer-vendor interaction==
Establishing a relationship between the consumer and a seller has become a new science with the emergence of online communities. It is a new market to be tapped by companies and to do so, requires an understanding of the relationships built on online communities.  Online communities gather people around common interests and these common interests can include brands, products, and services.&lt;ref name="Heinonen2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heinonen, Kristina|year=2011|title=Conceptualizing consumers' dynamic relationship engagement: the development of online community relationships|journal=Journal of Customer Behavior|volume=10|issue=1|pp=49–72|doi=10.1362/147539211X570519}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} Companies not only have a chance to reach a new group of consumers in online communities, but to also tap into information about the consumers. Companies have a chance to learn about the consumers in an environment that they feel a certain amount of anonymity and are thus, more open to allowing a company to see what they really want or are looking for.

In order to establish a relationship with the consumer a company must seek a way to identify with how individuals interact with the community.  This is done by understanding the relationships an individual has with an online community. There are six identifiable relationship statuses: considered status, committed status, inactive status, faded status, recognized status, and unrecognized status.&lt;ref name="Heinonen2011"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Unrecognized status means the consumer is unaware of the online community or has not decided the community to be useful. The recognized status is where a person is aware of the community, but is not entirely involved. A considered status is when a person begins their involvement with the site. The usage at this stage is still very sporadic. The committed status is when a relationship between a person and an online community is established and the person gets fully involved with the community. The inactive status is when an online community has not relevance to a person. The faded status is when a person has begun to fade away from a site.&lt;ref name="Heinonen2011"/&gt;{{rp|57}} It is important to be able to recognize which group or status the consumer holds, because it might help determine which approach to use.

Companies not only need to understand how a consumer functions within an online community, but also a company "should understand the communality of an online community"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goodwin, C.|year=1996|title=Communality as a dimension of service relationships|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=5|issue=4|pp=387–415|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp0504_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|401}} This means a company must understand the dynamic and structure of the online community to be able to establish a relationship with the consumer. Online communities have cultures of their own, and to be able to establish a commercial relationship or even engage at all, one must understand the community values and proprieties. It has even been proved beneficial to treat online commercial relationships more as friendships rather than business transactions.

Through online engagement, because of the smoke screen of anonymity, it allows a person to be able to socially interact with strangers in a much more personal way.&lt;ref name="Heinonen2011"/&gt;{{rp|69}} This personal connection the consumer feels translates to how they want to establish relationships online. They separate what is commercial or spam and what is relational. Relational becomes what they associate with human interaction while commercial is what they associate with digital or non-human interaction. Thus the online community should not be viewed as "merely a sales channel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heinonen, K.|author2=Strandvik, T.|author3=Mickelsson, K-J.|author4=Edvardsson, B.|author5=Sundström, E. |author6=Andersson, P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2010|title=A Customer Dominant Logic of Service|journal=Journal of Service Management|volume=21|issue=4|pp=531–548|doi=10.1108/09564231011066088}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|537}} Instead it should be viewed as a network for establishing interpersonal communications with the consumer.

==Growth cycle==
{{See also|Metcalfe's law|Bass diffusion model}}

Most online communities grow slowly at first, due in part to the fact that the strength of motivation for contributing is usually proportional to the size of the community. As the size of the potential audience increases, so does the attraction of writing and contributing. This, coupled with the fact that organizational culture does not change overnight, means creators can expect slow progress at first with a new virtual community. As more people begin to participate, however, the aforementioned motivations will increase, creating a virtuous cycle in which more participation begets more participation.

Community adoption can be forecast with the [[Bass diffusion model]], originally conceived by [[Frank Bass]] to describe the process by which new products get adopted as an interaction between innovative early adopters and those who follow them.

== Online learning community ==
Online learning is a form of online community. The sites are designed to educate.  Colleges and universities may offer many of their classes online to their students; this allows each student to take the class at his or her own pace.

According to an article published in volume 21, issue 5 of the ''European Management Journal'' titled "Learning in Online Forums",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Learning in Online Forums|journal=European Management Journal|volume=21|issue=5|pp=565–577|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0263-2373(03)00106-3|url=http://www.qou.edu/arabic/researchProgram/eLearningResearchs/learningInOnline.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206172500/http://www.qou.edu/arabic/researchProgram/eLearningResearchs/learningInOnline.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-12-06|author1=Gerardine Desanctis|author-link1=Gerardine DeSanctis|author2=Anne Laure Fayard|author3=Michael Roach|author4=Lu Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers conducted a series of studies about online learning.  They found that while good online learning is difficult to plan, it is quite conducive to educational learning.  Online learning can bring together a diverse group of people, and although it is asynchronous learning, if the forum is set up using all the best tools and strategies, it can be very effective.

Another study was published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer-supported team-based learning|journal=Computers &amp; Education
|volume=55|issue=1|date=August 2010|pp=378–390|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.003|author1=Elizabeth Avery Gomeza|author2=
Dezhi Wub|author3=Katia Passerinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; in volume 55, issue 1 of ''Computers and Education'' and found results supporting the findings of the article mentioned above. The researchers found that motivation, enjoyment, and team contributions on learning outcomes enhanced students learning and that the students felt they learned well with it.  A study published in the same journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can learning be virtually boosted? An investigation of online social networking impacts|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=55|issue=4|date=December 2010|pp=1494–1503|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2010.06.015|last1=Yu|first1=Angela Yan|last2=Tian|first2=Stella Wen|last3=Vogel|first3=Douglas|last4=Chi-Wai Kwok|first4=Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt; looks at how social networking can foster individual well-being and develop skills which can improve the learning experience.

These articles look at a variety of different types of online learning. They suggest that online learning can be quite productive and educational if created and maintained properly.

One feature of online communities is that they are not constrained by time thereby giving members the ability to move through periods of high to low activity over a period of time. This dynamic nature maintains a freshness and variety that traditional methods of learning might not have been able to provide.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

It appears that online communities such as Wikipedia have become a source of professional learning.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} They are an active learning environment in which learners converse and inquire.

In a study exclusive to teachers in online communities, results showed that membership in online communities provided teachers with a rich source of professional learning that satisfied each member of the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://0-web.ebscohost.com.sculib.scu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7f2a1970-8af4-4bb5-9562-ca24f64aadde%40sessionmgr12&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=14{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saurabh Tyagi&lt;ref name=Tyagi/&gt; describes benefits of online community learning which include:
* No physical boundaries: Online communities do not limit their membership nor exclude based on where one lives.
* Supports in-class learning: Due to time constraints, discussion boards are more efficient for question &amp; answer sessions than allowing time after lectures to ask questions.
* Build a social and collaborative learning experience: People are best able to learn when they engage, communicate, and collaborate with each other.  Online communities create an environment where users can collaborate through social interaction and shared experiences.
*Self-governance: Anyone who can access the internet is self-empowered.  The immediate access to information allows users to educate themselves.

These terms are taken from Edudemic, a site about teaching and learning. The article "How to Build Effective Online Learning Communities"&lt;ref name=Tyagi/&gt; provides background information about online communities as well as how to incorporate learning within an online community.&lt;ref name=Tyagi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edudemic.com/build-effective-online-learning-communities|title=How to Build Effective Online Learning Communities|date=October 6, 2013|author=Saurabh Tyagi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007030518/http://www.edudemic.com/build-effective-online-learning-communities/|archivedate=October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online health community ==
Online health communities is one example of online communities which is heavily used by internet users.&lt;ref name="Neal, Lisa 2007"&gt;{{cite conference|author=Neal, Lisa|displayauthors=etal|title=Online health communities|conference=CHI'07 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|publisher=ACM|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chou, Wen-ying Sylvia|displayauthors=etal|title=Social media use in the United States: implications for health communication|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=11|issue=4|year=2009|p=e48|pmid=19945947|doi=10.2196/jmir.1249|pmc=2802563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chou, Wen-ying Sylvia|displayauthors=etal|title=Health-related Internet use among cancer survivors: data from the Health Information National Trends Survey, 2003–2008|journal=Journal of Cancer Survivorship|volume=5|issue=3|pages=263–70|year=2011|pmid=21505861|doi=10.1007/s11764-011-0179-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key benefit of online health communities is providing user access to other users with similar problems or experiences which has a significant impact on the lives of their members.&lt;ref name="Neal, Lisa 2007"/&gt; Through people participation, online health communities will be able to offer patients opportunities for emotional support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Farnham, S.|displayauthors=etal|title=HutchWorld: clinical study of computer-mediated social support for cancer patients and their caregivers|year=2002|conference= Proc.

==Problems==
Online communities are relatively new and unexplored areas. They promote a whole new community that prior to the Internet was not available. Although they can promote a vast array of positive qualities, such as relationships without regard to race, religion, gender, or geography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/publications%7ctitle=NetLab%7cwork=utoronto.ca|title=NetLab|work=utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; they can also lead to multiple problems.

The theory of risk perception, an uncertainty in participating in an online community, is quite common, particularly when in the following online circumstances:
# performances,
# financial,
# opportunity/time,
# safety,
# social,
# psychological loss.&lt;ref&gt;Shiue 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clay Shirky]] explains one of these problems like two hoola-hoops. With the emersion of online communities there is a "real life" hoola-hoop and the other and "online life". These two hoops used to be completely separate but now they have swung together and overlap. The problem with this overlap is that there is no distinction anymore between face-to-face interactions and virtual ones; they are one and the same. Shirky illustrates this by explaining a meeting. A group of people will sit in a meeting but they will all be connected into a virtual world also, using online communities such as wiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html|title=Shirky: A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy|author=Clay Shirky|work=shirky.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050818002414/http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html|archivedate=2005-08-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further problem is identity formation with the ambiguous real-virtual life mix. Identity formation in the real world consisted of "one body, one identity",{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} but the online communities allow you to create "as many electronic personae" as you please. This can lead to identity deception. Claiming to be someone you're not can be problematic with other online community users and for yourself. Creating a false identity can cause confusion and ambivalence about which identity is true.

A lack of trust regarding personal or professional information is problematic with questions of identity or information reciprocity. Often, if information is given to another user of an online community, one expects equal information shared back. However, this may not be the case or the other user may use the information given in harmful ways.&lt;ref&gt;Matzat 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of an individual's identity within an online community requires self-presentation. Self-presentation is the act of "writing the self into being", in which a person's identity is formed by what that person says, does, or shows. This also poses a potential problem as such self-representation is open for interpretation as well as misinterpretation. While an individual's online identity can be entirely constructed with a few of his/her own sentences, perceptions of this identity can be entirely misguided and incorrect.

Online communities present the problems of preoccupation, distraction, detachment, and desensitization to an individual, although online support groups exist now. Online communities do present potential risks, and users must remember to be careful and remember that just because an online community feels safe does not mean it necessarily is.&lt;ref name="pewinternet.org"/&gt;

===Trolling and harassment===
The most common problem with online communities tend to be online harassment, meaning threatening or offensive content aimed at known friends or strangers through ways of online technology. Where such posting is done "for the [[lulz]]" (that is, for the fun of it), then it is known as [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Liverpool Daily Echo|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-echo-letters-november-22-3360750|title=Trolls and Snerts|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108070506/http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-echo-letters-november-22-3360750|archivedate=2017-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes trolling is done in order to harm others for the gratification of the person posting. The primary motivation for such posters, known in character theory as "snerts", is the sense of power and exposure it gives them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gulraiz Smith|url=http://www.trollingacademy.org/online-safety-sociability/112/why-trollers-do-what-they-do/|title=Why do Trollers do what they do?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426055922/http://www.trollingacademy.org/online-safety-sociability/112/why-trollers-do-what-they-do/|archivedate=April 26, 2012|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Online harassment tends to affect adolescents the most due to their risk-taking behavior and decision-making processes. One notable example is that of Natasha MacBryde who was tormented by Sean Duffy, who was later prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-14897948|title=Sean Duffy case highlights murky world of trolling|date=September 13, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101164630/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-14897948|archivedate=January 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Alexis Pilkington, a 17-year-old New Yorker committed suicide. Trolls pounced on her tribute page posting insensitive and hurtful images of nooses and other suicidal symbolism. Four years prior to that an 18-year-old died in a car crash in California. Trolls took images of her disfigured body they found on the internet and used them to torture the girl's grieving parents.&lt;ref name="anonymity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/opinion/30zhuo.html?_r=0|title=Where Anonymity Breeds Contempt|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-04-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419210803/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/opinion/30zhuo.html?_r=0|archivedate=2015-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychological research has shown that anonymity increases unethical behavior through what is called the [[online disinhibition effect]]. Many website and online communities have attempted to combat trolling. There has not been a single effective method to discourage anonymity, and arguments exist claiming that removing Internet users' anonymity is an intrusion of their privacy and violates their right to free speech. Julie Zhou, writing for the ''New York Times'', comments that "There's no way to truly rid the Internet of anonymity. After all, names and e-mail addresses can be faked. And in any case many commenters write things that are rude or inflammatory under their real names". Thus, some trolls don't even bother to hide their actions and take pride in their behavior.&lt;ref name="anonymity"/&gt; The rate of reported online harassment has been increasing as there has been a 50% increase in accounts of youth online harassment from the years 2000–2005.&lt;ref&gt;Lwin 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of harassment prevalent online is called [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]]. According to a study conducted by Peter J. Moor, flaming is defined as displaying hostility by insulting, swearing or using otherwise offensive language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moor, Peter J.|author2=Heuvelman, Ard|year=2010|title=Flaming on YouTube|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=6|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.05.023|pages=1536–1546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flaming can be done in either a group style format (the comments section on YouTube) or in a one-on-one format (private messaging on Facebook). Several studies have shown that flaming is more apparent in computer mediated conversation than in face to face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Moor, Peter J.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study conducted by Kiesler et al. found that people who met online judged each other more harshly than those who met face to face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiesler, S.|author2=Zubrow, D.|author3=Moses, A. M.|author4=Geller, V.|title=Affect in computer-mediated communication: An experiment in synchronous terminal-to-terminal discussion|journal=Human-Computer Interaction|year= 1985|volume=1|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0101_3|pages=77–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study goes on to say that the people who communicated by computer "felt and acted as though the setting was more impersonal, and their behavior was more uninhibited. These findings suggest that computer-mediated communication ... elicits asocial or unregulated behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler, S.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unregulated communities are established when online users communicate on a site although there are no mutual terms of usage. There is no regulator. Online interest groups or anonymous blogs are examples of unregulated communities.&lt;ref name="Online communities"/&gt;

[[Cyberbullying]] is also prominent online. Cyberbullying is defined as willful and repeated harm inflicted towards another through information technology mediums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mishna, Faye|author2=Khoury-Kassabri, Mona|author3=Gadalla, Tahany|author4=Daciuk, Joanne|title=Risk factors for involvement in cyber bullying: Victims, bullies and bully-victims|journal=Children and Youth Sciences Review|year=2012|volume=34|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.08.032|pages=63–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying victimization has ascended to the forefront of the public agenda after a number of news stories came out on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tokunaga, Robert S. |title=Following you home from school: A critical review and synthesis of research on cyberbullying victimization|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2010|volume= 26 |issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.11.014|pages=277–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Rutgers freshman [[Tyler Clementi]] committed suicide in 2010 after his roommate secretly filmed him in an intimate encounter and then streamed the video over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Foderaro, Lisa W.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/nyregion/30suicide.html|title=Private moment made public, then a fatal jump|work=New York Times|date=September 30, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310090016/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/nyregion/30suicide.html|archivedate=March 10, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous states, such as New Jersey, have created and passed laws that do not allow any sort of harassment on, near, or off school grounds that disrupts or interferes with the operation of the school or the rights of other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hinduja, Sameer|author2=Patchin, Justin W.|title=State cyberbullying laws: A brief review of state cyberbullying laws and policies|date=January 2012|url=http://cyberbullying.org/Bullying-and-Cyberbullying-Laws.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123071950/http://cyberbullying.org/Bullying-and-Cyberbullying-Laws.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trolling and cyber bullying in online communities are very difficult to stop for several reasons: 
#Community members don't wish to violate [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ideologies that state everyone has the right to speak. 
#The distributed nature of online communities make it difficult for members to come to an agreement.
#Deciding who should moderate and how create difficulty of community management.

An online community is a group of people with common interests who use the Internet (web sites, email, instant messaging, etc.) to communicate, work together and pursue their interests over time.

===Hazing===
A lesser known problem is [[hazing]] within online communities. Members of an elite online community use hazing to display their power, produce inequality, and instill loyalty into newcomers. While online hazing doesn't inflict physical duress, "the status values of domination and subordination are just as effectively transmitted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fraser, Matthew|author2=Soumitra Dutta|title=Throwing Sheep in the Boardroom: How Online Social Networking Will Transform Your Life, Work and World|location=Chichester, England|publisher=Wiley|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elite members of the in-group may haze by employing derogatory terms to refer to newcomers, using deception or playing mind games, or participating in intimidation, among other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nuwer, H.|year=1999|title=Wrongs of Passage: Fraternities, Sororities, Hazing, and Binge Drinking|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[T]hrough hazing, established members tell newcomers that they must be able to tolerate a certain level of aggressiveness, grossness, and obnoxiousness in order to fit in and be accepted by the BlueSky community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honeycutt | first1 = C | year = 2005 | title = Hazing as a Process of Boundary Maintenance in an Online Community | url = | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 10 | issue = 2| page = 00 | doi = 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00240.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
Online communities like [[social networking websites]] have a very unclear distinction between private and public information. For most social networks, users have to give personal information to add to their profiles. Usually, users can control what type of information other people in the online community can access based on the users familiarity with the people or the users level of comfort. These limitations are known as "privacy settings". Privacy settings bring up the question of how privacy settings and terms of service affect the [[expectation of privacy]] in social media. After all, the purpose of an online community is to share a common space with one another. Furthermore, it is hard to take legal action when a user feels that his or her privacy has been invaded because he or she technically knew what the online community entailed.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Strutin 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Creator of the social networking site [[Facebook]], [[Mark Zuckerberg]], noticed a change in users' behavior from when he first initiated Facebook. It seemed that "society's willingness to share has created an environment where privacy concerns are less important to users of social networks today than they were when social networking began".&lt;ref&gt;Connie Davis Powell&lt;/ref&gt;  However even though a user might keep his or her personal information private, his or her activity is open to the whole web to access. When a user posts information to a site or comments or responds to information posted by others, social networking sites create a tracking record of the user's activity.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia E. Salkin 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

In the USA, two of the most important laws dealing with legal issues of online communities, especially social networking sites are Section 512c of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] and Section 230 of the [[Communications Decency Act]].

Section 512c removes liability for copyright infringement from sites that let users post content, so long as there is a way by which the copyright owner can request the removal of infringing content. The website may not receive any financial benefit from the infringing activities.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives protection from any liability as a result from the publication provided by another party. Common issues include defamation, but many courts have expanded it to include other claims as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fayle|first=Kevin|title=Understanding the Legal Issues for Social Networking Sites and Their Users|url=http://articles.technology.findlaw.com/2007/Sep/18/10966.html|publisher=FindLaw: For Legal Professionals|accessdate=17 October 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111018114648/http://articles.technology.findlaw.com/2007/Sep/18/10966.html|archivedate=18 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online communities of various kinds (social networking sites, blogs, media sharing sites, etc.) are posing new challenges for all levels of law enforcement in combating many kinds of crimes including harassment, identity theft, copyright infringement, etc.

Copyright law is being challenged and debated with the shift in how individuals now disseminate their intellectual property. Individuals come together via online communities in collaborative efforts to create. Many describe current copyright law as being ill-equipped to manage the interests of individuals or groups involved in these collaborative efforts. Some say that these laws may even discourage this kind of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elkin-Koren, N.|year=2011|title=Tailoring Copyright to Social Production|journal=Theoretical Inquiries in Law|volume=12|issue=1|pp=309–347|doi=10.2202/1565-3404.1270|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228186295_Tailoring_Copyright_to_Social_Production|ssrn=1663982|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108002058/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228186295_Tailoring_Copyright_to_Social_Production|archivedate=2017-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws governing online behavior pose another challenge to lawmakers in that they must work to enact laws that protect the public without infringing upon their rights to [[free speech]]. Perhaps the most talked about issue of this sort is that of cyberbullying. Some scholars call for collaborative efforts between parents, schools, lawmakers, and law enforcement to curtail cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, A.|year=2010|title=Constitutionality of Cyberbullying Laws: Keeping the Online Playground Safe for Both Teens and Free Speech|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|volume=63|issue=3|pp=845–884|url=http://vanderbiltlawreview.org/articles/2010/05/King-Constitutionality-of-Cyberbullying-Laws-63-Vand.-L.-Rev.-845-2010.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108001854/http://vanderbiltlawreview.org/articles/2010/05/King-Constitutionality-of-Cyberbullying-Laws-63-Vand.-L.-Rev.-845-2010.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws must continually adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media in all its forms; some legal scholars contend that lawmakers need to take an interdisciplinary approach to creating effective policy whether it is regulatory, for public safety, or otherwise. Experts in the social sciences can shed light on new trends that emerge in the usage of social media by different segments of society (including youths).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palfrey, J.|year=2010|title=The Challenge of Developing Effective Public Policy on the Use of Social Media by Youth|journal=Federal Communications Law Journal|volume=63|issue=1|pp=5–18|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4738023/2010-Dec%20-Vol%2063-01_Palfrey%20(2).pdf?sequence=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107171120/https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4738023/2010-Dec%20-Vol%2063-01_Palfrey%20(2).pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2017-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armed with this data, lawmakers can write and pass legislation that protect and empower various online community members.

'''''Oršuš and Others v. Croatia''''' (15766/03) was a case heard before the European Court of Human Rights, concerning activities of [[Romani people|Roma]]-only classes in some schools of Croatia, which were held legal by the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]] in 2007 by a decision no. U-III-3138/2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sljeme.usud.hr/usud/prakswen.nsf/Ustav/C12570D30061CE53C125727B0038B838?OpenDocument Constitutional Court decision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chamber judgment==
On 17 July 2008, the Chamber of Court's First Section found unanimously both that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] on account of the excessive length of the proceedings, and that there had not been a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (right to education) taken alone or in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention (ban of discrimination).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=837978&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Chamber judgment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand Chamber judgment==

On 16 March 2010, the court delivered the judgment, finding a violation of Article 6, unanimously, and a violation of Article 14 of ECHR read in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1, by nine votes to eight. The majority has considered that ''the schooling arrangements for Roma children were not sufficiently attended by safeguards that would ensure that, in the exercise of its margin of appreciation in the education sphere, the State had sufficient regard to their special needs as members of a disadvantaged group'' and ''as a result of the arrangements the applicants were placed in separate classes where an adapted curriculum was followed, though its exact content remains unclear. Owing to the lack of transparency and clear criteria as regards transfer to mixed classes, the applicants stayed in Roma-only classes for substantial periods of time, sometimes even during their entire primary schooling'' (Para. 182).

Judges Jungwiert, [[Nina Vajić|Vajić]], Kovler, [[Alvina Gyulumyan|Gyulumyan]], [[Renate Jaeger|Jaeger]], [[Egbert Myjer|Myjer]], Berro-Lefèvre and Vučinić have filed a joint partly dissenting opinion, finding no violation of Articles 14 and P1-2. They referred to interests of Croatian-speaking children (Para. 9) and right of minority to preserve diversity (para. 17), pointing that:
*applicants agreed they lacked the required level of language proficiency (Para. 4),
*the Roma-only classes were not established as a rule (Para. 6),
*the slow linguistic development and progress in the applicants' case was to a large degree due to their very poor school attendance (Para. 7),
*''pupils who at times or during their entire primary education attend Roma-only classes and successfully complete final grade also receive the same standard final certificate which in no way indicates that they attended some special, separate classes'' (para. 11).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=864619&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Grand Chamber judgment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

According to [[European Roma Rights Centre|ERRC]] evaluation after a visit to Croatia in June 2010, "The situation in the schools remains the same; the majority of Romani children continue to attend Roma-only classes. The ERRC even identified one more school in the village of [[Podturen]] where Romani children are attending Roma-only classes. The situation for applicants in the Oršuš case themselves is little improved and they have been reportedly threatened with the possibility of having their social benefits cut because of their damages award. The only positive development was an initiative coming from the directors of the primary schools at the heart of the case which asked Medjimurje county authorities and the Ministry of Education to introduce three-year, free of charge pre-school programmes for Romani children to help these children to overcome language barriers before beginning their primary education".&lt;ref&gt;Memedov I.

In March, 2011, [[Amnesty International]] has filed a submission to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe concerning implementation of the judgment, where it found several shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=1806268&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=1717772&amp;Usage=2 submission to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on Oršuš and Others v.

==Background==
After interacting with businesspeople and students while working for an libertarian nonprofit, Praxis founder Isaac Morehouse noticed a skills gap between recently graduated college students and employers.&lt;ref name="fifitk"&gt;[http://fionatk.podomatic.com/entry/2013-08-29T00_23_51-07_00 Conversations with FiFi and T.K.] ''Don't Go To College''&lt;/ref&gt; Having been [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] himself and then exposed to a [[university]]-education, Morehouse noticed the disparity in skills taught and skills demanded by the professional world, as well as the frustration faced by students who expected a job upon graduation.&lt;ref name=fifitk /&gt; This led Morehouse to believe that most of the perceived value of a [[college degree]] comes from its value as a [[signaling (economics)|signaling mechanism]], showing employers that a candidate is superior to those without the signal. Employers told Morehouse that a lack of [[work experience]] was the primary reason they did not hire candidates with college degrees.&lt;ref name=realclear /&gt; Morehouse founded Praxis in 2013 as an alternative signal for employers and students, combining traditional  educational components with [[work experience]].&lt;ref name=fifitk /&gt;

==Description==
Praxis places participants with business partners to work 30 hours per week as an employee (as opposed to a traditional [[internship|intern]]).&lt;ref name="alisterpaine"&gt;[http://alisterpaine.com/2014/07/14/7-questions-with-the-guy-whos-disrupting-education/ Alister &amp; Paine] ''Seven Questions with the Guy Who's Disrupting Education''&lt;/ref&gt; Participants then complete 10 hours per week's worth of coursework designed by professors contracted with Praxis. The academic and non-academic subjects in the curriculum is designed to instill a level of [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] thinking in the participants, and to challenge them to think broadly about complex questions.&lt;ref name="Praxis Blog"&gt;[http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/2013/11/07/is-a-liberal-arts-education-valuable/ Praxis Blog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729022718/http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/2013/11/07/is-a-liberal-arts-education-valuable/ |date=2014-07-29 }} ''Is A Liberal Arts Education Valuable?'' By Isaac Morehouse, November 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of hands-on [[work experience]], [[technical education]] in the curriculum, and a [[liberal arts]] education is designed to train participants to work practically and to be [[wikt:analytic|analytic]] thinkers.&lt;ref name="Praxis Blog 2"&gt;[http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/2013/09/02/is-praxis-only-for-entrepreneurs/ Praxis Blog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729064239/http://blog.discoverpraxis.com/2013/09/02/is-praxis-only-for-entrepreneurs/ |date=2014-07-29 }} ''Is Praxis Only For Entrepreneurs?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Praxis also features [[resume]] and writing workshops, [[public speaking]] seminars, professional networking opportunities and a variety of [[professional development]] projects, both within the business partner context and within the broader scope of the program. Motivated by the belief that college costs are disproportionately high relative to the payoff of a degree, Morehouse designed the program to give participants "the best of a college education and [[reality|real-world]] [[work experience]]."&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc4h_FJkoZY YouTube] ''Praxis: A Real World Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is additionally structured as to provide low-cost, high-quality labor to small businesses and [[startup company|startups]].&lt;ref name="Praxis"&gt;[http://www.discoverpraxis.com/business Praxis] ''Praxis for Business''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
The Praxis curriculum covers economics, history, entrepreneurship, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soave|first1=Robby|title=As college costs increase, alternatives arise|url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/03/as-college-costs-increase-alternatives-arise/|accessdate=26 August 2016|publisher=The Daily Caller|date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curriculum includes an additional portfolio project and hard skills module, which includes [[resume]] writing skills, writing development, [[interview]] skills, and [[public speaking]] skills.

{{refimprove|date=January 2011}}

A '''pugil stick''' is a heavily padded pole-like training weapon used since the early 1940s by [[military]] personnel in training for [[rifle]] and [[bayonet]] combat.&lt;ref name="Marine pugil"&gt;[http://www.marines.com/main/index/making_marines/recruit_training/training_matrix/pugil_stick "Pugil Stick-Overcoming Hesitation and the Opponent"], www.marines.com, Retrieved 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The pugil stick is similar to a [[quarterstaff]] or [[bo (weapon)|Japanese ''bo'']], and may be marked to indicate which end represents the bayonet and which the [[rifle]] butt. Dr. Armond H. Seidler (1919-2017) of the [[University of New Mexico]] invented the Pugil Stick training method during [[World War II]]. It was initially adopted by the [[United States Marine Corps]], but was later included in [[United States Army]] combat training as well. Dr. Seidler received an award from the Marine Corps for his invention. 

Pugil bouts are usually conducted with hard contact while wearing protective gear such as groin protectors, [[American football]] helmets, [[hockey]] gloves, and chest protectors or shin guards, such as those worn by [[baseball]] [[catcher]]s. Some pugil sticks are made with integrated hand guards to reduce the potential for injury. Military procedures for pugil bouts are often detailed, with [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] both prohibiting pugil training by anyone who has recently suffered [[concussion of the brain]], lest they suffer [[traumatic brain injury]], or had a tooth extraction within the past 24 hours.

Pugil stick sparring was popularized in the United States by the ''[[American Gladiators]]'', a physical [[game show]] which ran from 1989 to 1996, and again in the [[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|2008 revival]], as well as in [[Gladiators (1992 UK TV series)|the British version]]. In the "Joust" contest, competitors would try to knock each other off pedestals using pugil sticks.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

The name "pugil stick" is a [[neologism]] from the [[Latin]] noun ''pugnus'' (fist), the source for other English words such as "pugilist" (boxer) and "pugnacious" (eager to fight).

[[File:BasicCombatTraining.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] recruits practice bayonet fighting skills at [[Fort Benning, Georgia]] in March 2004.]]
'''Recruit training''', more commonly known as '''basic training''' or colloquially '''boot camp''', refers to the initial instruction of new [[military personnel]]. Recruit training is a physically and psychologically intensive process, which [[Resocialization|resocializes]] its subjects for the demands of military employment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title='Joining the ranks: The role of indoctrination in transforming civilians to service members', (in 'Military life: The psychology of serving in peace and combat [vol. 2]')|last=McGurk et al.|first=|publisher=Praeger Security International|year=2006|isbn=978-0275983024|location=Westport|pages=13–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major characteristics ==
Initial military training is an intensive residential programme normally lasting several weeks or months, which aims to induct [[Military recruitment|newly recruited military personnel]] into the [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and essential tasks of the armed forces. Common features include [[foot drill]], inspections, physical training, weapons training, and a [[Passing out (military)|graduation parade]].

The training process [[resocialization|resocializes]] recruits to the demands made of them by military life. Psychological conditioning techniques are used to shape attitudes and behaviours, so that recruits will obey all orders, face mortal danger, and kill their opponents in battle.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/docs/LCIreport.pdf|title=Final report of the Learning Culture Inquiry|last=Australia, Department of Defence|first=|date=2006|website=|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Donna|date=2004|title=Misplaced Loyalties: The Role of Military Culture in the Breakdown of Discipline in Two Peace Operations|url=http://jmss.org/jmss/index.php/jmss/article/view/214|journal=Journal of Military and Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|issn=1488-559X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427757599|title=On killing : the psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society|last=Dave.|first=Grossman,|date=2009|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|isbn=9780316040938|edition=Rev.|location=New York|oclc=427757599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25283124|title=Squaddies : portrait of a subculture|last=John.|first=Hockey,|date=1986|publisher=University of Exeter|isbn=9780859892483|location=Exeter, Devon|oclc=25283124}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an expert in United States military training methods, [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]], recruit training makes extensive use of four types of conditioning techniques: [[role model]]ing, [[classical conditioning]], [[operant conditioning]], and [[brutalization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the Canadian military historian [[Gwynne Dyer]], inductees are required to partially submerge their individuality for the good of their unit; this is essential because military organizations, unlike civilian ones, require their members to endure stress and perform actions that are normally absent in civilian life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The resocialization of recruit training operates in several ways, as follows:

=== Confinement and suppression ===
[[File:USMC-15585.jpg|thumb|A recruit in the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] is shaved before his initial training begins, 2006.]]
Once their training has begun, the right of recruits to leave the military estate (or to quit the armed forces) is denied or tightly restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/about-policies-standards-defence-admin-orders-directives-5000/5002-1.page#cc|title=DAOD 5002-1 - Enrolment|last=Canada, National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces|first=|date=2017|website=www.forces.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|title=Terms and conditions of service|last=British Army|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072744/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-01|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.time.com/2012/05/04/why-is-getting-out-of-the-u-s-army-so-tough/|title=Why Is Getting Out of the U.S. Army So Tough?|last=Kristiansen|first=Ryan|work=Time|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By shaving the head, issuing uniforms, denying privacy, and prohibiting the use of first names, individuality is suppressed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Control and conformity ===
Recruits' daily routine is highly controlled, in the manner of the '[[total institution]]' described by the Canadian-American sociologist [[Erving Goffman]]. For example, the training regime determines how recruits must make their beds, polish boots, and stack their clothes; mistakes are punished.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Peter G.|date=1967-05-01|title=Some Observations on the Psychosocial Phenomena Seen in Basic Training|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.1967.11023507|journal=Psychiatry|volume=30|issue=2|pages=187–196|doi=10.1080/00332747.1967.11023507|issn=0033-2747|pmid=27791700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[File:Postawa.zasadnicza.jpg|thumb|[[Polish Armed Forces|Polish army]] recruits on [[foot drill]], 2007]]
Throughout their training, recruits are conditioned to [[Conformity|conform]] to military [[Norm (social)|norms]]. In particular, recruits are repeatedly instructed to stand, march, and respond to orders in a ritual known as [[foot drill]], which is derived from 18th-century military practices and trains recruits to obey orders without hesitation or question. According to [[Finnish Army]] regulations,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} for example, foot drill is essential for the [[esprit de corps]] and cohesion; gets the recruits used to instinctive obedience; enables large units to be marched and moved in an orderly manner; and creates the basis for action in the battlefield.

=== Stress and punishment ===
The training process applies [[stressor]]s continuously. Instructors may deprive recruits of sleep, food, or shelter; shout personal [[insult]]s; use physical [[aggression]]; or give orders intended to [[Humiliation|humiliate]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to specialists in US recruit training, the conditions of continuous stress deplete recruits' resistance to the demands made of them:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The intense workload and sleep restriction experienced by military recruits leaves them little attention capacity for processing the messages they receive about new norms… Therefore, recruits should be less likely to devote their remaining cognitive effort to judging the quality of persuasive messages and will be more likely to be persuaded by the messages…"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Evidence from Canada, the UK, the US and elsewhere shows that [[punishment]]s are used routinely to condition group conformity and discourage poor performance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenhart|first=R. Wayne|date=1975-10-01|title=You Can't Hack It Little Girl: A Discussion of the Covert Psychological Agenda of Modern Combat Training|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb01008.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=13–23|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb01008.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of group punishment in [[Canadian Army|Canadian army]] training, for example, has been described as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Coming from civilian society that elevates the individual, recruits are now in a world where the institutional value of the group is supreme. One has to be a team player or risk ostracism. The military does things quite deliberately to intensify the power of group pressure within its ranks. The group is made responsible for each member... even though it may seem manifestly unfair to make the group suffer for the individual."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Bonding and the hierarchy of esteem ===
As a buffer against the stressful conditions of their training, the trainee group normally forms a strong bond of mutual [[loyalty]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dornbusch|first=Sanford M.|date=1955-05-01|title=The Military Academy as an Assimilating Institution|url=https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/33/4/316/2225997|journal=Social Forces|volume=33|issue=4|pages=316–321|doi=10.2307/2573000|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in the US have described it as an intense "we-feeling", which can feel more powerful than the civilian bonds that recruits are familiar with.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2006, an official report on [[Australian Defence Force]] training explained the importance of the group bond:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Willingness to apply [[Deadly force|lethal force]] requires… sufficient bonding within the team to override each individual’s natural human resistance to kill. The toughness and bonding required increases the closer the contact with the [[enemy]]."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Recruits are taught to be proud of their identity as professional military personnel, and of their [[Military unit|unit]] in particular.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Heroic [[regiment]]al stories and symbols are used to ennoble the recruits' own unit above others, and above other branches of the armed forces, thereby establishing a [[hierarchy]] of esteem (also known as a hierarchy of [[respect]]); the same stories are used to draw a contrast with inferior [[Norm (social)|norms]] associated with civilian life.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/569431|title=The soldier and the state : the theory and politics of civil-military relations|last=P.|first=Huntington, Samuel|date=1957|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674817364|location=Cambridge|oclc=569431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/369563/19931021-Army_Discipline_and_Standards_Paper-AG.pdf|title=The Discipline and Standards Paper|last=British Army|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/433769/QR_Army.pdf|title=Queen's Regulations for the Army (Annex B: Values and Standards of the British Army)|last=British Army|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/07/the-widening-gap-between-military-and-society/306158/|title=The Widening Gap Between Military and Society|last=Ricks|first=Thomas E.|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aggression and objectification ===
[[File:Drill instructor at the Officer Candidate School.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] [[drill instructor]] shouts at [[Officer cadet|officer]] trainees, 2009.]]
Evidence from Australia, the UK and the US shows that recruit training systematically stimulates [[aggression]], particularly in those enlisted for ground [[close combat]] roles.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=No more heroes: Masculinity in the infantry (in P Highgate [ed.], 'Military masculinities: Identity and the state')|last=Hockey|first=J|publisher=Praeger|year=2003|isbn=|location=Westport, CT|pages=15–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Forces TV|title=VIP Visitor Adds Pressure to Parachute Regiment Recruits {{!}} Forces TV|date=2014-06-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tCOcLqHqNI|accessdate=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Bayonet]] practice is an example, as the strong language of this instruction from a [[British Army|British army]] [[corporal]] illustrates:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I wanna see it in your eyes that you wanna kill these fuckers.

To further enable recruits to kill on demand, they are taught to [[Objectification|objectify]] ([[Dehumanization|dehumanize]]) their opponent in battle as an ‘enemy target’ to ‘be engaged’, which will ‘fall when hit’.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Fieldcraft and fitness ===
Recruits are taught the basic skills of their profession, such as [[military tactics]], [[first aid]], managing their affairs in the field, and the use of [[weapon]]ry and other equipment.

Throughout, the [[physical fitness]] of recruits is tested and developed, although evidence from Israel, Norway, South Africa, the UK and the US has found that the heavy strain on the body also leads to a high rate of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milgrom|first=C.|last2=Finestone|first2=A.|last3=Shlamkovitch|first3=N.|last4=Rand|first4=N.|last5=Lev|first5=B.|last6=Simkin|first6=A.|last7=Wiener|first7=M.|date=January 1994|title=Youth is a risk factor for stress fracture.

=== Graduation and drop-out ===
Recruits who complete their initial training normally take part in a [[Passing out (military)|graduation parade]] (also called passing-out or marching-out). The parade is observed by their family and friends, and senior military personnel. Recruits then pass to the next stage of their training, if applicable.

A large minority of recruits drop out of training.

== Variations in recruit training ==
Recruit training varies by nation according to the national requirement and can be voluntary ([[volunteer military]]) or mandatory ([[conscription]]). Some nations operate both volunteer and conscription systems simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/louder-than-words-1|title=Louder than words: An agenda for action to end state use of child soldiers|last=|first=|date=|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruit training differs according to [[military branch]]:
* [[Army]] and [[Marine (military)|Marine]] recruits are nearly always trained in basic [[marksmanship]] with individually assigned [[weapon]]s, field maintenance of weapons, [[physical fitness]] training, [[first aid]], and basic survival techniques.
* [[Navy]] and [[Coast Guard]] training usually focuses on water survival training, physical fitness, basic seamanship, and such skills as shipboard [[firefighting]], basic [[engineering]], and signals.
* [[Air force]] training usually includes physical fitness training, military and classroom instructions, and field training in basic marksmanship and first aid.
The training further differs according to military role:

Recruits for [[close combat]] roles (e.g. [[infantry]], [[marines]]) are trained to fight at [[Close quarters combat|close quarters]], including with a [[bayonet]]; training for these positions is normally more vigorous and aggressive than that for other roles (e.g. [[Military logistics|logistics]]).

== Australia ==
{{Main|Australian Army Recruit Training}}
Most of the recruit training in the [[Australian Army]] is currently held at [[Army Recruit Training Centre]] (ARTC) at [[Kapooka]], near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. Recruit training lasts 80 days for members of the [[Australian Regular Army]] and 35 days for members of the [[Australian Army Reserve]]. In basic training recruits are taught drill, weapons and workplace safety, basic equipment maintenance, marksmanship, fieldcraft, radio use and defensive/offensive operations.

===Regional Force Surveillance Units===
Training for recruits in the [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]]s usually differs greatly from training in the rest of the Army. For instance, [[NORFORCE]] recruits attend a 2-week course at the Kangaroo Flats. Recruits from areas covered by the RFSUs often come from indigenous cultures radically different from that of the general Australian population, and as such many regular standards and methods of training are not as applicable in their case.

===Royal Military College Duntroon===
Recruit Training for Officers in the Australian Army (known as ICT - Initial Cadet Training) takes place at [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC). The ICT is conducted for approximately 7 weeks after which staff cadets continue military instruction in skills such as weapons training, military history, leadership, strategic studies and other such skills at Section, Platoon and Company levels. Trainees at RMC hold the rank of Staff Cadet and, if successful in completing the course are commissioned as Lieutenants (pronounced Left-tenant). The overall full-time Officer Training course at RMC is 18 months long.

== Canada ==
[[File:RMC Sandhurst 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] cadets compete in the prestigious Sandhurst Competition.]]
Centralized recruit training in the Canadian Army did not exist until 1940, and until the creation of Basic Training Centres across Canada, recruit training had been done by individual units or depots.

The [[Canadian Army]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were [[unification of the Canadian Forces|unified into one service]], the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1968. The Canadian Forces Training System, a unified system for all the services, was devised and remains in place today.

Most non-commissioned CF recruits in the Regular Force (full-time) participate in the 10-week [[Basic Military Qualification]] (BMQ) at [[Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School]] at [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]]. Regular Force officers complete their 15-week [[Basic Military Officer Qualification]] (BMOQ) at CFLRS as well, before moving on to Second Language Training or their occupational training.

After basic training, personnel are trained in the specialty of their "environment". Members of the Royal Canadian Navy undergo a five-week sea environment training course; with members of the Canadian Army undergo a 20-day Soldier Qualification course, while officers go through a 12-week Common Army Phase (now renamed to Basic Military Officer Qualification-Land); while members from the Royal Canadian Air Force move on directly to their trade training.

Reservists, particularly the Army Reserve, may conduct basic and trades training part-time, generally alternating weekends with their own units. Due to increased integration of the Regular and Reserve Force, many reservists attend courses hosted by the Regular Force. Members of the Army Reserves complete an 8-week BMQ/SQ combined course (Basic Military Qualification and Soldier Qualification) during the summer. Formerly the Naval and Air Reserve jointly conduct BMQ for its recruits at the Naval Reserve Training Division [[Borden, Ontario]] equivalent to Regular Force BMQ, at [[Canadian Forces Base Borden]]. Now the Naval Reserve conducts the Basic Military Naval Qualification in CFB Valcartier by the Canadian Forces Fleet School Québec (a combination of recruit training and naval environmental training which leads to savings in the training). Navy trains its personnel in [[seamanship]], [[firefighting]], damage control and other skills after BMQ, in the Naval Environmental Training Program (NETP) in either [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] or [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

The [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, and is a degree-granting university. The [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] is a Canadian military academy located on the site of [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)]],

== China ==
{{Main|Military education and training in China}}

==Denmark==
The [[Danish Army]] conducts the HBU (Hærens Basisuddannelse, Army Basic Training course) at 8 bases around the country. The course lasts four months, and has its focus on training skills used in connection with the Danish total defence, and on recruiting for the army's international missions, and for the NCO-schools. The recruits are technically conscripts, but during recession years, many young men and woman have volunteered for HBU.

==Finland==
Training lasts 5.5 to 11.5 months total. All Finnish conscripts undergo two months of basic training (''peruskoulutuskausi''), which is essentially the same for all servicemen. It includes assault rifle ([[Rk 62|RK-62]]/[[Rk 95 Tp|RK-95]]) marksman training, few other basic weapon training, battle training, short field medic training and camping skills. At the end of this training, all men are promoted to their first military rank. After this, specialized training is given depending on the person (5,5–11,5 months). The NCO trainees go to AUK (NCO school) and become corporals or sergeants, from which some are selected to [[Reserve Officer School|RUK (Reserve officer school)]] and become second lieutenants. The officer and NCO training always lasts a total of 11,5 months.

==France==
In the French army, the Formation Generale Initiale (FGI) is a 12 weeks course which occurs in a Centre de Formation Initiale des Militaires du Rang (CFIM). There are 10 CFIM in the country. Prior to this course, new recruits are joining the regiment they are going to serve during 3 to 5 years for reception week where they get gears, filling administrative documents, and last medical exam before starting training =&gt; in France any enlisted soldier signs not only for a MOS but also a unit to serve.

After completing the 12 week FGI course, recruits are receiving the AFFIM certificate (say BCT graduation) and are considered as private 2nd class. After one week of leave, they go back to their regiment for the Formation de Spécialité Initiale (FSI) =&gt; MOS training

After FGI+FSI, they can start training with their platoon for external deployment. Usually, Private 1st class rank is earned after 6 to 12 month of time in service.

For some units (mountain troops - airborne), there is also during first year a Formation d'Adaptation (FA)  for basic mountain training (2 × 2 weeks) or parachute school (3 weeks)

Content of FGI is the following one:

Drills,
First aid and chemical warfare,
PT and obstacle course,
First weapon qualification (FAMAS, pistol and grenade), 
Signals,
Basic field and infantry training (even if not MOS11B later on),
Presentation of French army, soldiers duties and reports.

==Germany==
The Allgemeine Grundausbildung (AGA) (i.e. ''general basic training'') of the [[Bundeswehr]] covers the first three months of military service.

The contents of the "Allgemeine Grundausbildung" includes

* Formal training (ranks, flags, orders and other fundamentals)
* Weapon Drill and Basic Combat training for all soldiers (Rifle, Pistol and machine gun drills are mandatory for every soldier)
* Theoretical Courses about Democracy and legal regulations
* Sports: the Basic Fitness Test (BFT) and the German Sports Badge (DSA)
* Guard duty training (ATB SichSdt)
* First Aid

A notable peculiarity of German basic training is rooted in German military tradition that prefers initiative to obedience. Rather than "breaking" the personality of new recruits through intimidation and aggression, German basic training generally tries to "mold" a recruit's personality in the hope of producing soldiers with stronger personalities and more own initiative.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Greece==
While until 2000 the Greek Army was mainly conscript based, since then a large Professional Enslisted institution has been adopted, which combined with the reduction of conscript service will produce an approximate 1:1 ratio between conscript and professional enlisted. While initially training of the two institutions was shared, it has since then diverged, and conscript training has been reduced in length while professional enlisted training has been increased.

Professional Enlisted, signing 7-year contracts, are called once per year. They go through a 14-week initial training, which is broken into a 6-week basic training period which ends with the oathing ceremony, and a 8-week combat course. After that period they proceed to specialty training which can last from 4 to 42 weeks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.gr/default.php?pname=ekpsi_emth_epop_dekp&amp;la=1|title=Γενικό Επιτελείο Στρατού - Εκπαίδευση ΕΜΘ-ΕΠΟΠ|website=www.army.gr|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscripted enlisted, serving a 9-month obligation, are called 6 times per year. They report to various recruit camps spread over the country. The first week is the reception week, followed by a 3-week basic soldier training course, which ends with the oathing ceremony. Depending on their awarded specialty the conscript recruits are then transferred to specialty training camps or to operational units. In the operational units the recruits go through a 3-week 'advanced' recruit training course, followed occasionally (depending on whether they have already received specialty training or not), by a 2 to 6 week specialty training course, conducted by the unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==India==
{{Main|Military academies in India}}
The Indian military services have established numerous and distinguished academies and staff colleges across India for the purpose of training professional soldiers in new generation military sciences, warfare command and strategy, and associated technologies.

==Israel==
{{Main|Tironut}}
The recruit training of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (called '''''tironut''''' in Hebrew) varies depending on the unit: virtually every unusual unit completes a different training course. Recruits are certified as riflemen after the completion of the training, while most non-combat units train in all-army bases for the certification of Rifleman 02. Individuals who want to become officers must apply to be trained at a facility in the Negev desert called "Bahad One" (abbreviation of "Basis Hadracha", Instruction Base).

==Pakistan==
{{Main|Pakistan Military Academy}}
The Pakistan Military Academy (or '''PMA''') is a [[Military Academy]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]. It is located at [[Kakul]] in [[Abbottabad]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The Pakistan Military Academy is analogous to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], [[West Point]] or [[Tironut]] and undertakes training of the prospective officers of Pakistan Army. The academy has four training battalions and sixteen companies. A Cadet is trained and passed out as an officer of the Pakistan Army in 2 years.

Enlisted Men undertake training at the Regimental Center of their chosen regiment.

==Singapore==
{{update|section|date=July 2011}}
{{Main|National Service in Singapore}}
National Service (NS) in Singapore is compulsory for all able-bodied male citizens and second generation permanent residents who have reached the age of 18. Conscripts enlisted into the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) are required to attend Basic Military Training (BMT) at the beginning of their NS. They are known as Full Time National Servicemen (NSFs).

Based on their Physical Employment Status (PES) grade determined by a pre-enlistment medical examination, NSFs may undergo either a standard, enhanced, modified, or obese BMT at the [[Basic Military Training Centre]] (BMTC) on the offshore island of [[Pulau Tekong]] or at the various military units that directly accept mono-intake PES A and B recruits.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/mindef/mindef-nsmen|title=NS Portal|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Singapore Armed Forces|access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2016}}

Throughout their BMT, NSFs will acquire the basic skills required of a SAF soldier by:
* Executive basic drills
* Physical training
* Passing the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT)
* Operating and firing a [[SAR 21]] assault rifle
* Throwing both practice and live SFG 87 hand grenades
* Complete a Standard Obstacle Course (SOC) and Battle Inoculation Course (BIC)
* Going through a field camp

At the end of BMT, NSFs will typically complete a 24 kilometer long route march in Full Battle Order (FBO) and attend a Passing Out Parade (POP).{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After BMT, NSFs will receive their posting orders to their respective vocations, which are determined by their PES status, suitability for deployment, and manpower requirements. Some of them will be directly posted to a military unit while others may undergo vocational training at certain institutes before being posted to units.

NSFs who have performed well during BMT may progress to either the [[Specialist Cadet School]] (SCS) or [[Officer Cadet School (Singapore)|Officer Cadet School]] (OCS) for further leadership training to become [[Specialist (Singapore)|Specialist]]s (non-commissioned officers) or Officers.

NSFs will serve the remaining part of their NS in their respective units until their Operationally-Ready Date (ORD), whereupon they will be known as Operationally-Ready National Serviceman (NSmen, or [[reservist]]s). NSmen may still be required to attend reservist training or In-Camp Training (ICT) for ten annual cycles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, officer training is carried out at the [[General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University]] and at the respective [[Military Academies]] of each respective service.

Recruit training for enlisted personal of the [[Sri Lanka Army]] is organised by the [[Army Training School]] and carried out at its premises and at several other locations. Following basic training specialized training would be carried out at Regimental Training Centres.

Basic training for new recruits of the [[Sri Lanka Navy]] which is approximately six months are conducted at  ''Advanced Naval Training Center'', SLNS 'Nipuna'; ''Naval Artificer Training Institute'', SLNS 'Thakshila', Welisara; and at Naval Recruit Training Centres at several shore establishments . This basic training will be followed by ''on-the-job'' training on-board fleet units and at shore establishments. Combat Training School at SLNS 'Pandukabaya' conducts combat training for [[Sri Lanka Navy#Naval Patrolmen|Naval Patrolmen]].

Basic training for airmen of the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] is handled by the Training Wing of the [[SLAF Diyatalawa]]. This is followed by secularized training at '' Advanced &amp; Specialized Trade Training School''.

== Sweden ==
Since conscription ended in 2010, all recruits who seek employment within the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] have to go through ''Grundläggande Militär Utbildning'' (GMU) (Basic Military Training) for three months.

After a recruit has completed GMU, he/she may continue with further, specialized training with any of the branches of the military, as long as the candidate fits the requirements.

There is also a shorter volunteer training program for people who seek service within the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard]] called GU-F. GU-F training takes only 14 days, but following a completed GU-F, a guardsman may go through additional training in order to specialize within the Home Guard.

Basic training as part of GMU as well as GU-F usually takes place at any of the [[Swedish Army]] training units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jobb.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/vagen-in/grundutbildning/|title=Grundutbildning|last=Försvarsmakten|website=Försvarsmakten|language=sv-SE|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
British armed forces recruits train in two phases. Phase One is initial recruit training lasting approximately three months, bringing all recruits to a similar standard of basic military ability. Phase Two consists of courses of varying duration to prepare recruits for their assigned role. Infantry training is an exception, combining Phase One and Phase Two in a course lasting six months.

The [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Air Force]] manage their own Phase One and Phase Two training establishments.

The first six weeks of training are the most demanding. Recruits are not permitted to leave the military estate or end their contract with the armed forces during this time.

==United States==
In the United States, recruit training in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is called [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]]; U.S. Army Combat Arms MOS (11 Series, 19 series, 13 series, 12 series) undergo OSUT (One Station Unit Training) which involves BCT, Advanced Individual Training and Specialized Training (such as Bradley, or Mortar School, or Gunnery) all in one. In the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] it is called [[Basic Military Training]] or "BMT". In the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] it is called Recruit Training (commonly known as Boot Camp), and in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]], it is called "Basic Training."

Some services present a badge or other award to denote completion of recruit training. The Army typically issues the [[Army Service Ribbon]] (issued after completion of Advanced Individual Training), and the Air Force presents the [[Air Force Training Ribbon]] and the [[Airman's coin|Airman's Coin]]. The Marine Corps issue the [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] once initial training is complete to signify that the recruits are now Marines. The Navy replaces the "RECRUIT" ball cap the recruits have worn throughout training with the "NAVY" ball cap upon successful completion of "Battle Stations". The United States Coast Guard's basic training graduates place a Coast Guard Medallion on their ball cap.

For honor graduates of basic training, the Air Force, Coast Guard, and Navy present a [[Basic Training Honor Graduate Ribbon]]. The Navy and Marine Corps often meritoriously advance the top graduates of each division one pay-grade (up to a maximum of E-3).

===U.S. Army===
[[File:Army Bayonet Training.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army recruit practices bayonet training at [[Fort Jackson, South Carolina]].]]
{{Main|United States Army Basic Training}}

In the [[United States Army]], recruits are sent to Basic Combat Training in a location designated according to the military [[Military Occupational Specialty]], or MOS, which is selected upon enlistment.

Initial Entry Training (IET) is divided into two parts, which commonly take place at two different locations, depending on the chosen MOS:
*Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is a ten-week training cycle. Keep in mind, this period does not include "Reception Week" during which recruits are being slotted to their training companies (troops for cavalry).
*Advanced Individual Training, or AIT, is where new soldiers receive specific training in their chosen MOS. The length of AIT training varies depending on the MOS and can last anywhere from four weeks to nearly one year.
*Several MOSs (mainly combat arms) combine both basic training and AIT in a single combined course called One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which can last up to 22 weeks. The attitude and environment remain the same throughout the entire training cycle, including drill instructors.  Essentially, OSUT is an extended version of Basic Training, especially for Infantry OSUT, which remains on the same basic soldiering tasks for the entire cycle, although in greater detail. Infantry OSUT is conducted at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at Fort Benning, and lasts 15–17 weeks.
The U.S. Army has four sites for BCT:
*[[Fort Benning]] in Columbus, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
*[[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]] in Columbia, [[South Carolina]]
*[[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in St. Robert, [[Missouri]]
*[[Fort Sill]] in Lawton, [[Oklahoma]]

During Basic Combat Training, Army recruits learn a variety of basic combat skills including: Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM), land navigation, patrolling, securing and defending a position, drill and ceremony, fireteam formations and assaults, communications and use of AN/PRC-119 radio, combat lifesaving skills, 9-line medevac, reporting intelligence, hand grenades, Claymore mines, M203/M320 grenade launcher, M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), M240B machine gun, M2 .50 caliber machine gun, MK-19, and AT-4 anti-tank weapon. Training also includes combat conditioning by running an obstacle course, the Confidence Course, conducting marches of varying distances up to 12 miles, physical training, and Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP), a martial arts program based on the combination of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing, and a number of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Combatives#Modern Army Combatives]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recruits are trained to adopt the Army "Warrior Ethos", and to memorize and live by the [[Soldier's Creed]].

BCT is divided into three phases. During Phase I, (also known as "Red Phase") recruits are subject to "Total Control," meaning their every action is monitored and constantly corrected by drill sergeants. The first week of training is commonly referred to as "Hell Week," due to the intense period of adjustment required on the part of the new recruits. Marches are common throughout basic training. Recruits are sent to the "gas chamber" during Phase I, as part of training for defensive chemical warfare. They are also introduced to their standard-issue weapon, the [[M16A2 rifle]], the [[M16A4]] rifle, or [[M4 carbine]].

In Phase II (also known as "White Phase") soldiers begin actually firing weapons, starting with the rifle or carbine ([[M4A1]]). Other weapons the recruit becomes familiarized with include various grenades (such as the M67 fragmentation grenade) and grenade launchers (such as the M203). Recruits are then familiarized with the [[bayonet]], anti-tank/armor weaponry and other heavy weapons. The course also includes an obstacle course which the soldiers are expected to negotiate in a certain amount of time. Additionally, Phase II includes continual, intense PT, along with drill and ceremony training. At the conclusion of Phase II, Soldiers are to demonstrate proficiency with the various weaponry with which they trained.

Phase III or "Blue Phase," is the culmination and the most challenging of all the training phases. A final PT test is administered during the first week. Recruits who fail are frequently retested, often up until the morning of their cycle's graduation. If they do not pass, then they are recycled to another platoon until they meet the fitness standards. The final PT Test is the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). Usually, a Soldier needs to score at least 60 points in each APFT category (pushups, sit-ups, and 2 mile run) to pass, but in Basic Combat Training, only 50 points are required; the Soldier will nevertheless take another APFT with a 60-point requirement at AIT. During Blue Phase, the recruits move on to such longer and more intensive "bivouac" and FTX ([[Field Training Exercise]]s) as nighttime combat operations. Drill sergeants will make much of this an adversarial process by working against the recruits in many of the night operations and trying to foil plans, etc.

Upon completion of Basic Combat Training, a recruit is now a soldier, and has developed skills to operate in a combat environment, as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her MOS-specific duties under fire.

The United States Marine Corps Recruit Depots are located at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]], South Carolina, and [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]], California. All female enlisted Marines go to Parris Island. Men go to either, depending on whether they were recruited east or west of the [[Mississippi River]].  Marine Corps boot camp is the longest basic training regimen in the U.S. Armed Forces, and is physically demanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nation.time.com/2011/06/02/the-few-the-proud-the-broken/|title=The Few, the Proud, the Broken|first=Mark|last=Thompson|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017|via=nation.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, recruits were referred to as either "(the) Private(s)" or "(the) recruit(s)" from day one of Recruit Training. Since the 1990s, they are referred to as "(the) recruit(s)" alone until they earn the title of Marine.

Marine Corps Recruit Training (MCRT) is a 13-week program that is divided up into three four-week phases and further broken down into individual training days.&lt;ref name="mcrt-1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are 69 individual training days, recruits also go through pre- and post-training processing where recruits are afforded relatively little freedom. Phase one mainly consists of learning recruit life protocol, physical training, [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program|MCMAP]] training, academic classes, initial drill, a series inspection, and the confidence course. West coast recruits also do swim qualification during this phase. Phase two is completely in the field at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] for west coast recruits, with the first two weeks being spent on marksmanship training and qualification with the M16A4 service rifle, and the last week in the field learning skills such as fireteam formations, land navigation, and hikes. For east coast recruits, phase two is swim qualification, rifle qualification, and Team Week, a week of maintenance duties for the island as a show of how to perform base support tasks while still keeping military bearing and attention to detail. Phase three brings the San Diego recruits back to the recruit depot where they finish up with final drill, final inspection, more PT and confidence courses, and graduation. During third phase, west coast recruits also go back into the field one last time to do the Crucible event. Parris Island recruits finish with field training, final drill and inspection, the Crucible, and graduation. Note that recruits going to either depot receive exactly the same training, if in a different order. An important part of this process is training recruits to adopt and live by the motto, "Every Marine a rifleman".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation_needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion, recruits proceed to receive further training at the [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|School of Infantry (SOI)]].

Upon completion of Marine Combat Training, the Marine is to have gained the knowledge and ability to operate in a combat environment as a basic rifleman and to perform his or her primary duties under fire.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry]]&lt;/ref&gt; (The main contrast with Army recruit training is that nearly identical training is integrated into Basic Combat Training, so there is no follow-on school.) Upon completion, Marines proceed to their MOS-specific school.

In Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), [[infantry]] [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|MOS]] (03XX) Marines receive 59 days of training in infantry skills, including advanced marksmanship, combat patrolling, land navigation, and a wide array of other infantry skills. Upon completion of ITB, newly qualified Marine infantrymen proceed to their assigned units.

===U.S. Navy===
[[File: Instructional Training exercises at RTC Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|In March 2002, a U.S. Navy Recruit Division Commander conducts "Instructional Training" to correct substandard performance during boot camp.]]
{{Main|Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois}}
The [[United States Navy]] currently operates boot camp at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at [[Naval Station Great Lakes]], near [[North Chicago, Illinois]]. Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated processing cycle). Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example, 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes that it is a processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the [[M9 pistol]] and [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the [[M16 rifle|M16]] in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at sea, mass casualties, shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various "A" Schools located across the United States—where they begin training to receive their [[List of United States Navy ratings|ratings]] (jobs)—or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.

The Navy formerly operated Recruit Training Centers in San Diego, California; Orlando, Florida; Meridian, Mississippi; and [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Port Deposit (Bainbridge), Maryland]]. From 1942 to 1946—during and immediately following World War II—the Navy had two additional training sites: Naval Training Station (USNTS) Sampson (renamed [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in 1950), near Seneca Lake, New York, where over 400,000 recruits were trained, and [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] in Bayview, Idaho.

===U.S. Air Force===
[[File: Air Force Military Training Instructor.jpg|thumb|upright|A formation of USAF airmen]]
{{Main|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}
The U.S. Air Force's Basic Military Training (BMT) is eight and a half weeks long, as they do not count the first week ("Week 0"). BMT is 63 calendar days long. It is conducted at [[Lackland Air Force Base|Lackland AFB]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Formerly, trainees were referred to as "Airman" from day one of BMT. This has been changed; now, personnel are referred to as Trainees until the Airman's Coin Ceremony in the seventh week of training, when they receive their Airman's Coin.  Trainees receive military instruction (including the Air Force core values, flight and individual drill, and living area inspections), academic classes (covering topics such as Air Force history, dress and appearance, military customs and courtesies, ethics, security, and alcohol/drug abuse prevention and treatment), and field training (including protection against biological and chemical attack, basic marksmanship on the [[M16 (rifle)|M16]] rifle as well as first aid).  Following BMT, Airmen go to a technical school (or 'tech school') where they learn the specifics of their [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC), which is similar to the MOS ([[Military Occupational Specialty]]) in the Army and Marines, the Navy's NEC (Naval Enlisted Classification) code, or the Coast Guard's ratings.

All non-prior-service enlistees are required to complete BMT, including those enlisting in the [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve Command]]. Reserve component enlistees receive the same training as their active-duty counterparts. Credit can be given on a case-by-case basis for enlistees with college credit, Eagle Scouts and service in the [[Civil Air Patrol]] qualify for promotion to E-2 ([[Airman]]) or E-3 ([[Airman First Class]]) upon graduation from BMT. The stripes are not worn until graduation, though trainees are paid at the higher pay grade.

Lackland AFB has been associated with BMT for almost the Air Force's entire history. From 1950 to 1956, 300,000 airmen received BMT at [[Sampson Air Force Base]] in New York.  In 1951, [[Parks Air Force Base]] in [[Dublin, California]] became a BMT center, with training beginning in March 1952. BMT at Parks AFB ceased later in the decade and the installation was transferred to the US Army in 1959. For a brief time between 1966 and 1968, the Air Force operated a second BMT at [[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport#Amarillo Air Force Base (1951-68)|Amarillo AFB]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]].

Unlike the Army and Navy, but like the Marine Corps (throughout boot camp) and Coast Guard (during the first section of boot camp), trainees are required to refer to all Airmen, enlisted and NCO's as well as commissioned and warrant officers, as "sir" or "ma'am". Trainees are required to preface speaking to Military Training Instructors with their reporting statement: "Sir/Ma'am, Trainee (the recruit's surname) reports as ordered".

An additional 2 weeks of BMT was added to the program on November 1, 2008, extending the duration of BMT from six and a half weeks to eight and a half weeks. BMT has been tailored to incorporate some of the additional warfighting skills to coincide with increased Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations and more frequent support of its sister services during those rotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|title=BMT extended, NCOs to learn new languages|date=17 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717031836/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123016059|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 BMT was shortened once again to seven and a half weeks. Trainees still stay at Lackland for eight and half weeks, however, the eighth week following graduation they are moved to a more relaxed environment under a program called Airman's Week, which is designed to transition trainees to technical training.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
[[File: USCG Basic Training.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs a recruit during basic training.]]
Recruit training for the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] is held at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/applicants/|title=USCG Recruit Training|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official standard recruit training cycle lasts eight weeks. A limited number of recruits may face reversion to earlier weeks of training should one exhibit egregious deficiencies in attitude and/or aptitude.
  
The U.S. Coast Guard recruit basic training offers an additional, abbreviated, route to serve as an enlisted member of the Fleet.  Namely, Direct Entry Petty Officer Training (DEPOT): "The goal of the Direct Entry Petty Officer Training Course is to produce petty officers who on the basis of their civilian professions, prior military experience, or a combination of both"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcecom.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/FORCECOM-UNITS/TraCen-Cape-May/Training/Depot/|title=DEPOT|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are otherwise duly qualified.

The U.S. Coast Guard is unique in that it fires the [[SIG Sauer P229|SIG Sauer P229R]] pistol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,96246,00.html|title=Military Life|first=|last=Military.com|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the training. The training also covers basic seamanship, drill, military bearing and firefighting. The Coast Guard base on Government Island (now known as [[Coast Guard Island]]) Alameda, California was also used as a second major recruit training center until it was closed in 1982 and converted into the base for the USCG Pacific Area Command, the Eleventh Coast Guard District, the Marine Safety Office San Francisco Bay, the USCG Maintenance &amp; Logistics Command Pacific and the Integrated Support Command Center - Alameda.

Although the Coast Guard is a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], rather than the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], it is by law and tradition a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. As with all military members, Coast Guard personnel are subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). Due to the Coast Guard's unique mission set – including [[CONUS]] and [[CONUS#CONUS/OCONUS|OCONUS]] defense operations, search and rescue and maritime law enforcement – there are added requirements to maintain high physical fitness standards and intense military bearing. Due to its extremely unusual, diverse and difficult mission, the U.S. Coast Guard is the most selective in recruiting and training standards. As an example, the [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard Academy]] is the only service academy that uses competitive admissions for prospective officer candidates.

During their time at Cape May, recruits are subjected to the usual "boot camp" atmosphere of direct instruction and intense motivation. The recruits are designated as Seaman Recruits (SR; E-1). Unique to the Coast Guard among the services, recruits successfully completing basic recruit training are advanced to the rank of Seaman Apprentice/Fireman Apprentice (SA/FA; E-2) or Seaman/Fireman (SN/FN; E-3) upon graduation—the difference generally based on level of higher education one possess. They must adhere to strict rules such as hygiene and uniform regulations and obey all lawful orders. Coast Guard drill instructors are called "company commanders" and hold a rank ranging from Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5) up to Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8). Coast Guard companies have approximately two or three company commanders and anywhere from 20 to over 100 recruits.

After completing boot camp, recruits can select their rate and then attend an "A" school. Not all graduates go straight to "A" school, many spend time in the fleet as "non-rates". "A" school is a long-term technical school providing specific instruction about a rate. The "A" schools last two to six months and usually occurs at [[Training Center Yorktown|TRACEN Yorktown]], Yorktown, Virginia or [[Training Center Petaluma|TRACEN Petaluma]], Petaluma, California. Some rates have an available apprenticeship training option instead of attending an "A" school, known as "striking".

'''Rolf A. Faste''' (1943–2003) was an American designer who made major contributions to the fields of [[human-centered design]] and [[design education]]. He was a professor of industrial design at [[Syracuse University]] from 1971–1984, and professor of mechanical engineering and director of the [[Stanford Joint Program in Design]] from 1984–2003. He is best known for his contributions to creative design practice, or "[[design thinking]]," which he pioneered as a 'whole person' approach to problem solving centered on the perception of needs.&lt;ref&gt;Faste, Rolf A., [http://fastefoundation.org/publications/perceiving_needs.pdf “Perceiving Needs”], ''SAE Journal'', Society of Automotive Engineers, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faste, Rolf A., [http://fastefoundation.org/publications/ambidextrous_thinking.pdf “Ambidextrous Thinking”], ''Innovations in Mechanical Engineering Curricula for the 1990s'', American Society of Mechanical Engineers, November 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Faste was born in [[Seattle, Washington]], the eldest child of Andreas Faste, a naval architect noted for his work on the [[MV Coho]] ferry, and Edith Morch Faste, an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Obie, Dave, [http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/comment/story.html?id=62f1a70b-ba4e-46c1-8c02-c4882e3924ac&amp;p=1 "The artist behind the Coho legacy"], ''Times Colonist'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Interested from a young age with the intersection between art and engineering, he earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in 1965, a master's degree in engineering design from [[Tufts University]] in 1971, and a second bachelor's degree in architecture from [[Syracuse University]] in 1977. Faste's graduate thesis work at Tufts on engineering creativity was advised by [[William J. J. Gordon]], the originator of [[Synectics]], and demonstrated a correlation between an individual's creative ability when working on science and engineering problems and their capacity to visualize solution concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Faste, Rolf A., [http://fastefoundation.org/publications/the_role_of_visualization.pdf “The Role of Visualization in Creative Behavior”], ''Engineering Education'', November 1972, pp. 124-127, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Faste was a professor of design at [[Syracuse University]] from 1971–1984, where he taught classes on rapid visualization, prototyping, materials, computer-aided design, aesthetics and the creative process. He was active in the field of [[accessible design]] in the early 1970s, and as research associate on the [[ANSI]] A117 project he co-authored the national standards for accessibility to buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Faste, Rolf A., [http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol17-4and5/Ijee1230.pdf "The Human Challenge in Engineering Design"], ''International Journal of Engineering Education'', vol. 17, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also served as an [[UNESCO]] consultant to the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay]], India.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000649/064990eo.pdf "Industrial Design Centre, India Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay: Project Findings and Recommendations"]; United Nations Development Programme, Paris, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Stanford]] Faste was noted for his contributions to engineering education and [[design research]], developing courses to strengthen students' visual and creative skills such as ''Aesthetics of Machinery'', ''Ambidextrous Thinking'' and ''Expression of Function''. He was interested in exploring the way that the body and mind influence technical creativity, understanding needs and cultural meaning in the creation of products, and incorporating functional, aesthetic and humanistic concerns in design. He was a recipient of the Raymond J. Perrin Award for Teaching and Course Development, and held five patents and one patent pending for his innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Stanford News Service | url = http://news.stanford.edu/pr/03/faste2312.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
In 2009, Faste's sons founded the Rolf A. Faste Foundation for Design Creativity, a non-profit center for creativity research. The foundation is dedicated to furthering Rolf's vision of design as a way of being in the world for the betterment of human society and mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Rolf A. Faste Foundation for Design Creativity | url=http://www.fastefoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

The Faste Laboratory, a centre for innovation in the area of functional products at [[Luleå University of Technology]], Sweden, was named in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Faste Laboratory | url = http://www.ltu.se/centres/Fastelaboratoriet-Vinnexc-Center?l=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7270">The '''scholarships in Taiwan''' include [[scholarship]]s for pursuing degrees ([[bachelor degree|bachelor]], [[master degree|master]] or [[PhD]]), academic exchange, conducting research, learning [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] and experiencing culture in [[Taiwan]]. They are mostly funded by the Taiwanese government, [[List of universities in Taiwan|universities]] and [[Academia Sinica]], but also by non-profit foundations.

== Overview ==
The Taiwan Fellowships &amp; Scholarships (TAFS) program is a joint governmental initiative ([[Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)|Ministry of Science and Technology]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (MOFA), [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] (MOE), [[Ministry of Culture (Taiwan)|Ministry of Culture]] and [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]]) aimed to promote exchange and friendships between Taiwan and the global community. The TAFS comprises awards in three categories: scholarships for Degree, fellowships for research and Huayu (Mandarin) Enrichment Scholarships. Approximately 1,250 TAFS grants are provided annually for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as researchers across the world to study or to conduct advanced research in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://tafs.mofa.gov.tw/Default.aspx?loc=en Taiwan Fellowships and Scholarships (TAFS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="836">The '''School-Centred Initial Teacher Training''' ('''SCITT''') programme is a [[teacher]]-training course in [[England]].

The SCITT enables graduates to undertake their training within a school environment, leading to [[Qualified Teacher Status]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucas.com/ucas/teacher-training: ''UCAS Teacher Training'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some SCITT programmes also award a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE) qualification.

The programmes cover primary, middle and secondary age ranges and candidates work in a consortium of schools within a designated region.

The entrance requirements and funding availability is the same as for PGCE courses and applications are also made through the UCAS, where applications can be monitored using UCAS 'Track'.

'''Text, Speech and Dialogue''' ('''TSD''') is an annual conference involving topics on [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]]. The meeting is held every September alternating in [[Brno]] and [[Pilsen, Czech Republic]].

The first Text, Speech and Dialogue conference took place in [[Brno]] in 1998.

== Overview ==
TSD series evolved as a prime forum for interaction between researchers in both spoken and written language processing from all over the world. Proceedings of TSD form a book published by [[Springer-Verlag]] in their Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=Text%2C+Speech+and+Dialogue+Conference&amp;btnG=Hledat+knihy&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;hl=cs#hl=cs&amp;q=%22International+Conference%2C+TSD%22&amp;tbm=bks TSD proceedings at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;
TSD Proceedings are regularly indexed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.  Moreover, LNAI series are listed in all major citation databases such as [[DBLP]], [[SCOPUS]], [[Ei Compendex|EI]], [[INSPEC]] or [[COMPENDEX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/?SGWID=0-102-24-0-0&amp;submit=Submit+Query&amp;sortOrder=pubdateSortdesc&amp;searchType=EASY_CDA&amp;searchScope=editions&amp;queryText=International+Conference%2C+TSD All TSD proceedings at Springer]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈtomaːʃ ˈɡarɪk ˈmasarɪk|lang}}), sometimes anglicised to '''Thomas Masaryk''' (7 March 1850 – 14 September 1937), was a [[Czechs|Czechoslovak]] [[politician]], statesman, [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher]].

After trying to reform the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[monarchy]] into a [[federal state]], with the help of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], he eventually succeeded in gaining Czechoslovak independence as a republic after [[World War I]]. He both founded and was the first [[list of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|President]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and so is called the "President Liberator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Prezident osvoboditel)

==Early life==
Masaryk was born to a poor working-class family in the predominantly [[Catholic]] city of [[Hodonín]], [[Moravia]] (in the region of [[Moravian Slovakia]], today in the [[Czech Republic]] but then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].) Another tradition claims the nearby [[Slovakia|Slovak]] village of [[Kopčany]], the home of his father, as his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;Michaláč, Jozef 2007 T.G.Masaryk a kopčianska legenda. Kde sa v skutočnosti narodil náš prvý prezident? Bratislava: Nestor.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently grew up in the village of [[Čejkovice (Hodonín District)|Čejkovice]], in [[South Moravian Region|South Moravia]], before he moved to [[Brno]] to study.&lt;ref name=capek&gt;Čapek, Karel. 1995 [1935–1938]. ''Talks with T.G. Masaryk'', tr. Michael Henry Heim. North Haven, CT: Catbird Press, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father Jozef Masárik, born in [[Kopčany]] in Slovakia (then the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary), was a carter and later the steward and coachman at the Imperial Estate of nearby [[Hodonín]]. Tomáš's mother, Teresie Masaryková ([[née]] Kropáčková), was a [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravian]] of Slavic origin but [[German language|German]] education. She worked as a cook at the Estate where she met Masárik, and they married on 15 August 1849.

==Education==
After grammar school in Brno and [[Vienna]], from 1872 to 1876, Masaryk attended the [[University of Vienna]], where he was a student of [[Franz Brentano]].&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;Zumr, Joseph. 1998. "Masaryk, Tomáš Garrigue (1850–1937)". pp. 165–66 in the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', ed. Edward Craig. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his Ph.D. at the University of Vienna in 1876 and completed his [[habilitation]] thesis at the same university in 1879, entitled ''Der Selbstmord als sociale Massenerscheinung der modernen Civilisation'' ("Suicide as a Social Mass Phenomenon of Modern Civilization").&lt;ref name=routledge /&gt; Between 1876 and 1879, he studied in [[Leipzig]] with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;
Čapek, Karel. 1995 [1935–1938]. Talks with T.G. Masaryk, tr. [[Michael Henry Heim]]. North Haven, CT: Catbird Press, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 1878, he married [[Charlotte Garrigue]] in [[Brooklyn]], whom he had met at Leipzig. They lived in Vienna until 1881, when they moved to Prague.

In 1882, he was appointed Professor of Philosophy in the Czech part of [[Charles University of Prague]]. The following year he founded ''[[Athenaeum (Czech magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', a magazine devoted to Czech culture and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepka |first=Karel |date=2015 |title=Mathematics in T. G. Masaryk journal Athenaeum |location=Copenhagen |publisher=Danish school of education |pages=749–59 |isbn=978-87-7684-737-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Athenaeum'' issued in October 15, 1883 (editor was Jan Otto).

He challenged the validity of the epic poems ''Rukopisy královedvorský a zelenohorský'', supposedly dating from the early [[Middle Ages]] and providing a false nationalistic basis of Czech [[chauvinism]] to which he was continuously opposed. Further enraging Czech sentiment, he fought against the old superstition of [[Jewish]] blood [[libel]] during the [[Hilsner Trial]] of 1899.

==Early career==
Masaryk served in the ''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'' from 1891 to 1893 in the [[Young Czech Party]] and again from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1900, but he did not yet campaign for the independence of [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] from [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1909, he helped [[Hinko Hinković]] in [[Vienna]] in the defense during the fabricated trial against members of the [[Croato-Serb Coalition]] (such as [[Frano Supilo]] and [[Svetozar Pribićević]]) and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years, with a number of [[Death penalty|death penalties]].

When the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek an independent country for Czechs and Slovaks, outside Austria-Hungary. He went into exile with his daughter, Olga, in December 1914, to [[Rome]], then to [[Geneva]] and then to [[London]] via [[Paris]] in 1915, the [[Russian Empire]] in May 1917 and the United States via [[Vladivostok]] and [[Tokyo]] in April 1918. From Geneva onwards, he started organizing Czechs and Slovaks living outside Austria-Hungary, primarily in [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[England]], Russia and the United States, establishing the contacts that would prove crucial for Czechoslovak independence. He also gave lectures and wrote numerous articles and official memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. In Russia, he was pivotal in establishing [[Czechoslovak Legions]] as an effective fighting force on the side of the Allies in World War I. During the war, he held a [[Serbian passport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=Србија некада мамила као Америка|website=www.novosti.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, he was one of the first members of staff of the new [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]], now part of [[University College London]], where the Student Society and Senior Common Room are named after him. He became Professor of Slavic Research at [[King's College London|King's College]] in [[London]], lecturing on "the problem of small nations".

===Creation of Czechoslovak Legion===
During the war, Masaryk's intelligence network of Czech revolutionaries provided important and critical intelligence to the Allies. Masaryk's [[Europe|European]] network worked with an American counterespionage network of nearly 80 members, headed by [[E.V. Voska]], who, as [[Habsburg]] subjects were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Among other things, the intelligence from these networks was critical in uncovering the [[Hindu-German Conspiracy]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Masaryk50/&gt;&lt;ref name=Masaryk50&gt;{{Harvnb|Masaryk|1970|pp=50, 221, 242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Voska|Irwin|1940|pp=98, 108, 120, 122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bose|1971|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.G. Masaryk started teaching at London University in October 1915. There, he published "Racial Problems in Hungary" in which he also expressed thoughts on Czechoslovak's independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the [[French government]] of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. After the [[February Revolution]] in 1917, he proceeded to Russia (he left London for St. Petersburg in May) to help organize Slavic resistance to the Austrians, the [[Czechoslovak Legion]].

On 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion, recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914 and was attached to the Russian Third Army.

From its start, Masaryk desired to grow the Družina from a battalion into a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he recognized that they would need to recruit from Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the Družina to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army, but the order was rescinded after a few weeks because of opposition in other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuous efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their mind, the Czechs and the Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.

Under such conditions the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew very slowly from 1914 and 1917. In early 1916, the Družina was reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. Following the Czechoslovak soldiers' stellar performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]], when the Czecho-Slovak troops overran Austrian trenches, the Russian Provisional Government finally granted to Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer, a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (Československý sbor na Rusi), also known as the Czechoslovak Legion (Československá legie) in Russia. A second division consisting of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 troops by 1918.

In 1918, he traveled to the United States (starting from Moscow 7 March to [[Vladivostok]], [[Fusan]] and Tokyo and then to [[Vancouver]] by steamliner, and from [[Canada]] to [[Chicago]]), where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. Speaking on 26 October 1918 from the steps of [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], as head of the [[Mid-European Union]], Masaryk called for the independence of the Czechoslovaks and the other oppressed peoples of Central Europe. On May 5, 1918, more than 150,000 Chicagoans filled the streets to give a triumphant welcome to the future President of Czechoslovakia. Chicago was then the center of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States and the city gave Masaryk an enthusiastic reception, which echoed Masaryk's earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902. Masaryk had lectured at the University of Chicago in 1902 and 1907. He also had strong personal links with the US since 1878 by his marriage with an [[American citizen]] and his friendship with [[Charles R. Crane]]. a Chicago industrialist. Crane got Masaryk invited to the [[University of Chicago]] and introduced into the highest political circles, including to Wilson.

==Leader of Czechoslovakia==

{{expand section|date=June 2012}}

With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] recognized Masaryk as head of the Provisional Czechoslovak government (on October 14), and on November 14, 1918, [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1918|he was elected President of the Czechoslovak Republic]] by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. He came back to Prague Castle on December 21, 1918.

Masaryk was re-elected as president three times: in May [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1927|1927]], and [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1934|1934]]. A provision in the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]] exempted him from the two-term limit. He visited many countries like France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Clark Hoover]], he guaranteed the 1. PIMCO – First Prague International Management Congress, organized Masaryks Academy of Labour and 120 experts around the world in Prague in July 1924. In March 1930, the National Assembly approved the law: "T.G. Masaryk, he deserved on the State" (law No.22/1930 Sb., from March 6, Czech: "T.G. Masaryk, zasloužil se o stát"). After the rise of Hitler, he was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern. He resigned from office on December 14, 1935 on the grounds of old age and poor health, and [[Edvard Beneš]] succeeded him.

On paper, Masaryk's powers as president were limited; the framers of the constitution intended for the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|Prime Minister]] and Cabinet to hold the real power. However, he provided a considerable measure of stability in the face of frequent changes of government (there were ten cabinets headed by nine Prime Ministers during his tenure). The stability that he ensured, as well as his great prestige both inside and outside the country, made Masaryk enjoy almost-legendary authority by the people. He used his authority to create an extensive informal political network called ''[[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]]'' (the Castle). Under his watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in central Europe.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13623, Tomá- Garrigue Masaryk.jpg|thumb|upright|Masaryk in 1932]]
Masaryk died less than two years after leaving office, at the age of 87, in [[Lány (Kladno District)|Lány]], Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic. He died before the [[Munich Agreement]] and the Nazi occupation of his country. He was known as "The Great Old Man of Europe". Commemorations of Masaryk, state institutions and democratic societies have taken place annually in Lány cemetery on March 7 and September 14, since 1989.

Masaryk wrote several books, including ''The Czech Question'' (1895), ''The Problems of Small Nations in the European Crisis'' (1915), ''The New Europe'' (1917) and ''The World Revolution'' (1925), in Czech, published in English as ''The Making of a State'' (1927), and the two following Volumes). The writer [[Karel Čapek]] wrote a series of articles entitled 'Hovory s T.G.M.' (Conversations with T.G.M.) which were later collected as a form of [[autobiography]].

==Philosophy==
Masaryk's life motto was "Do not fear and do not steal" ({{lang-cz|Nebát se a nekrást}}). He was a philosopher and an outspoken [[rationalist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], he emphasised practical [[ethics]], reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philosophy, and especially the work of 18th Century German philosopher, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who is considered the founder of nationalism. He was critical of German [[idealism|idealistic philosophy]] {{cn-span|and [[Marxism]].|date=February 2018}}

==Personal life==
Masaryk married Charlotte Garrigue in 1878 and took her family name as his middle name. They had met in [[Leipzig]], Germany, and were engaged in 1877. She was born in [[Brooklyn]] in a Protestant family with French [[Huguenots]] among their ancestors. She came to learn Czech perfectly and published studies in ''[[Bedřich Smetana]]'', a Czech magazine. Hardships during the war took their toll on her, and she died in 1923 from an unspecified illness. Their son, [[Jan Masaryk]], served as [[Foreign Minister]] in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile (1940–1945) and in the governments of 1945 to 1948. Charlotte gave birth to four other children, Herbert, [[Alice Masaryková|Alice]], Eleanor (Anna, or Hana), and Olga.

Although born a [[Catholic]], Masaryk eventually became a non-practising [[Protestant]],&lt;ref name="rozhlas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/nabozenstvi/mezinebem/_zprava/masarykuv-vztah-k-nabozenstvi--1464205 |title=Masarykův vztah k náboženství |language=czech |publisher=rozhlas.cz |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced in part by both the declaration of [[papal Infallibility]] in 1870 and his wife, who was raised as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]].&lt;ref name="HaanDaskalova2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francisca de Haan|author2=Krasimira Daskalova|author3=Anna Loutfi|title=Biographical Dictionary of Women's Movements and Feminisms in Central, Eastern, and South Eastern Europe: 19th and 20th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsgQjbgBOAkC&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=2013-08-07|year=2006|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-7326-39-4|pages=306–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
[[File:Statue of Masaryk in Prague, Apr 2012.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Statue of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, Prague|Statue of Masaryk in Prague.]]]]

As the principal [[father of the nation|founding father]] of Czechoslovakia, Masaryk was regarded in a way as [[George Washington]] is regarded in the [[United States]]. Czechs and Slovaks alike still regard him as a symbol of democracy.

The [[Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] is a [[order (decoration)|state decoration]] established in 1990 that is awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to humanity, democracy and human rights.

[[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]], founded in 1919 as the second university of Czechoslovakia, is named after him, first when it was founded and again since 1990, after it had carried the name ''Univerzita [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně|Jana Evangelisty Purkyně]] v Brně'' for 30 years

Numerous statues, busts and plaques commemorate Masaryk. Most are located in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but some are in other countries; notably the [[Statue of Tomas Masaryk (Washington, D.C.)|Masaryk Statue]] on [[Embassy Row]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as in [[Chicago]] on the [[Midway Plaisance|Midway]], and in [[San Francisco]]'s Golden Gate Park [[rose garden]]. A plaque with a portrait of Masaryk is set on a wall of Rachiv, [[Ukraine]], on the site of a hotel where he reportedly resided for a time (1917 to 1918). There is also a bust of Masaryk, erected in 2002, at Druzhba Narodiv Square (Friendship of Nations Square) in [[Uzhhorod]], in the far-western corner of Ukraine.

[[Avenida Presidente Masaryk]] (President Masaryk Avenue), a main avenue in [[Mexico City]], where are located some of the most exclusive garment retailers takes its name from him, as does [[Masaryktown, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H6xaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Xk8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5126%2C1819266 | title=Into center of state | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=Mar 23, 1952 | accessdate=1 November 2015 | author=Blackstone, Lillian | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; So too does the [[Kfar Masaryk|Kfar Masaryk kibbutz]] near [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], founded largely by Czechoslovak immigrants. Also [[Tel Aviv]] has a Masaryk Square - Masaryk had visited Tel Aviv in 1927. There is a street in [[Zagreb]], the capital of [[Croatia]], named ''Masarykova ulica'', as well in many other Croatian towns such as [[Dubrovnik]], [[Daruvar]], [[Varaždin]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. ''Masarikova ulica'' in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], although one of the smallest in the city, has the address of the tallest building in Belgrade, the [[Beograđanka]] palace. One of the streets in the centre of [[Novi Sad]], Serbia is named ''Masarikova ulica''. One of the biggest streets in the capital of [[Slovenia]], [[Ljubljana]], is also named after Masaryk. There is "Rue Thomas Masaryk" in Geneva as well, as well as in downtown [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]].

A [[United Nations]] Expeditionary Force [[starship]] in [[Joe Haldeman]]'s 1974 science fiction novel ''[[The Forever War]]'' is named ''Masaryk.''

A photograph of Masaryk leaning out of a train window, waving to and shaking hands with supporters, is the front cover for [[alternative metal]] band, [[Faith No More]]'s 1997 album ''[[Album of the Year (Faith No More album)|Album of the Year]]''. The [[liner notes]] for the [[album jacket]] depicts the funeral of an old man, with the words "[[Truth prevails|pravda vítězí]]" (truth prevails) adorning the coffin. The statement is the motto of the [[Czech Republic]] and is seen as a symbol of democracy.

Asteroid [[1841 Masaryk]], discovered by [[Lubos Kohoutek]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_1842 |title=(1841) Masaryk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">'''Universal Accounting Center (UA)''' is a [[Privately owned enterprise|privately owned]] training organization located in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  Founded in 1979, they offer self-paced [[Home study course|home-study courses]] in [[accounting]], [[bookkeeping]], [[tax preparation]], [[QuickBooks]] and [[marketing]] that specializes in [[small business]].

==History==
Universal Accounting was established in 1979.  The training center was founded as Universal Training Systems by Alf Bostrom with the purpose to teach students full-charge bookkeeping and accounting.  It first functioned under the parent company Metropolitan Business Bureau (MBB) which Alf began as a [[Financial consultant|financial consulting]] firm in 1960.  Through his experience with MBB, Alf established the [[business model]] upon which Universal Accounting would be built. Until quite recently, Universal Accounting was run by Alf’s son, [[Allen Bostrom]].

Universal Training Systems initially followed a [[classroom]]-based learning model, and the first Universal classroom was opened in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Shortly thereafter, several school locations in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] were opened and franchised.

In 1992, Alf’s sons, Allen and Ken Bostrom, joined his staff, and in 1994, Alf retired, and Allen Bostrom became president and [[CEO]] of the newly named Universal Accounting Center. The school has evolved from offering local live courses to developing and selling home-based study materials for bookkeeping, accounting, tax preparation, QuickBooks and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upgrade.slco.org/upAndComing/UaC008.html] Upgrade.com "Teaching Basics Propels Company to Inc. 500 List."&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1st, 2014, Roger Knecht became UAC's new president and CEO; Allen Bostrom remains as the chair of Universal's Board of Directors.

==Accreditation==
Universal Accounting has been approved by the California Tax Education Council (CTEC) to offer the Professional Tax Preparer Certification (PTP) as a [[distance learning]] course in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enewschannels.com/2006/11/09/enc381_012629.php] Berg, Tabitha (2006-11-09).“Universal Accounting Center Tax Education Approved by California.” eNewsChannels.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continuing professional development|Continuing Professional Education]] (CPE) credits are awarded for each of Universal’s training programs.  UA has also been accredited by the [[Better Business Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbb.org/utah/business-reviews/business-vocational-schools/universal-accounting-center-in-salt-lake-city-ut-89110024] BBB.org "BBB Reliability Report for Universal Accounting Center."&lt;/ref&gt;
