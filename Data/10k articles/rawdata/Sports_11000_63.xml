==News==

===January===
*25: [[Chiyonofuji]] wins his twentieth ''[[yūshō]]'', becoming the third man after [[Taiho Koki|Taihō]] and [[Kitanoumi]] to reach this landmark. He defeats fellow ''[[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' [[Futahaguro]] in a playoff after both men finish on 12–3. Futahaguro had beaten Chiyonofuji in their regulation match but could not do so a second time. Although this is his sixth runner-up performance, his first top division championship continues to elude him. ''[[Sekiwake]]'' [[Konishiki]] scores 10–5 and wins the Outstanding performance prize for his wins over both yokozuna. [[Masurao]] wins the Technique Award. Former ''[[komusubi]]'' [[Ōyutaka]], who lost ''[[sekitori]]'' status in 1985, announces his retirement. He assumes the Arashio ''[[toshiyori]]'' or elder name and stays on as a coach at his stable.

===March===
*22: [[Ōzeki]] [[Hokutoumi]] wins his second championship with a score of 12–3, finishing one win ahead of stablemate Chiyonofuji and Konishiki on 11–4. New ''[[komusubi]]'' Masurao has a superb tournament, defeating two ''yokozuna'' and four ''ōzeki'' in the first seven days and is awarded the Outstanding Performance prize. [[Hananoumi]] wins the Technique prize and [[Tochinowaka Kiyotaka|Tochinowaka]] the Fighting Spirit Award. Futahaguro drops out on the tenth day. In jūryō [[Takamisugi]] wins the ''yūshō'' while [[Kaiki Nobuhide|Kaiki]] announces his retirement. He stays in sumo as Takashima Oyakata.

===May===
*24: Ōzeki [[Onokuni]] wins his first ''yūshō'' with a perfect 15–0 record. He is the first man other than Chiyonofuji to win in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan which opened over two years before in January 1985. Runner-up is Hokutoumi on 13–2, who is promoted to ''yokozuna'' after the tournament. [[Kokonoe stable]] becomes the first since [[Takasago stable|Takasago]] in 1949 to have two active ''yokozuna'' simultaneously. Konishiki is also promoted to ''ōzeki'' after a fine 12–3 score, becoming the first foreigner ever to reach sumo's second highest rank. He wins the fighting spirit prize while the other ''sekiwake'' [[Asahifuji]] gets the Technique prize. Masurao has another giant-killing tournament and wins another Outstanding performance prize. The ''jūryō yūshō'' is won by [[Onohana]]; the ''[[makushita]]'' championship by [[Akinoshima]]. Former ''sekiwake'' [[Kaneshiro Kofuku|Kaneshiro]] (also known as Tochihikari) retires rather than face demotion to ''makushita''. Unable to obtain elder stock, he leaves the sumo world.

===July===
*19: After an unremarkable 10–5 last time out, Chiyonofuji wins the ''yūshō'' in style with a 14–1 record. Ōnokuni turns in another good performance, finishing runner-up on 12–3. New ''yokozuna'' Hokutoumi wins eleven bouts and new ''ōzeki'' Konishiki is on 9–6. Futahaguro can manage only 8–7. Ōzeki [[Wakashimazu]] retires, leaving [[Futagoyama stable]] without anyone in ''[[san'yaku]]'' for the first time in 15 years. Also announcing his retirement is [[Hattori Yuji|Hattori]] (also known as Fujinokawa), a former amateur champion who was plagued by injuries in his four years as a professional. Special prizes are awarded to Asahifuji for Technique, Tochinowaka for Outstanding Performance and [[Dewanohana Yoshitaka|Dewanohana]] for Fighting Spirit. Veteran former ''sekiwake'' [[Masudayama]] wins the ''jūryō'' championship.

===September===
*27: Hokutoumi wins his first championship as a ''yokozuna'' with a 14–1 record. His only defeat is to Ōnokuni, whose 13–2 runner-up performance earns him promotion to ''yokozuna'' as well. [[Asahifuji Seiya|Asahifuji]] is simultaneously promoted to ''ōzeki'' after scoring 12–3 and winning Technique and Fighting Spirit prizes. Konishiki also finishes in third on 12–3. [[Sakahoko]] is awarded the Outstanding Performance prize for his defeat of Chiyonofuji on Day 6. (Chiyonofuji later withdrew from the tournament because of injury.) The lightweight ''jūryō'' veteran [[Hachiya Toshiyuki|Hachiya]] retires and becomes Onogawa Oyakata.

===November===
*22: Chiyonofuji returns from injury to win his 22nd yūshō with a perfect 15–0 record (his fourth). Futahaguro has his best performance for some time, finishing runner-up on 13–2 alongside Hokutoumi. Ōnokuni can manage only 8–7 in his ''yokozuna'' debut. Sakahoko wins his second Outstanding performance prize in a row — he had defeated two ''ōzeki'' and a ''yokozuna'' in the first three days. [[Tochitsukasa]] receives the Technique award. [[Nankairyu]] from [[Western Samoa]], only the third non-Japanese to reach the top division, scores 8–7 on his debut in ''[[makuuchi]]''. Former ''sekiwake'' [[Hō'ō Tomomichi|Hō'ō]] wins the jūryō division ''yūshō'' for the fourth time.

===December===
*31: Futahaguro is forced to retire by the [[Sumo Association]] after a heated argument with his stablemaster (former ''sekiwake'' [[Osamu Annen|Haguroyama]]) four days earlier led to him storming out of the stable, allegedly slapping his boss's wife on the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestler Gives Sumo Tradition A Big Kick Into 20th Century|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-01-11/news/8803210309_1_wrestlers-stable-japan-sumo-association|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=January 11, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He becomes the first ''yokozuna'' ever to be forced out of the sumo world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grand Sumo|author=Sharnoff, Lora|publisher=Weatherhill|year=1993|isbn=0-8348-0283-X|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation is concerned with [[organized crime]], [[money laundering]] and private corruption ([[bribery]]) in Belgian football, [[Belgian First Division A|division 1A]] and [[Belgian First Division B|division 1B]] specifically. Started in late 2017, the investigation raised to national prominence on October 10, 2018, when 44 house searches were carried out across Belgium and 14 more house searches internationally. 29 suspects were arrested in Belgium, and 4 more abroad. Of the 29 arrested in Belgium, 20 were charged with one or more crimes.&lt;ref name="D1/026/18"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.om-mp.be/nl/article/press-release-federal-public-prosecutor-s-office-d102618-0 |title=Press Release by the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office - D1/026/18 |date=2018-10-11 |access-date=2018-10-12 |institution=Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sporza Overzicht"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://sporza.be/nl/2018/10/12/overzicht-fraudedossier/ |title= 21 mensen in verdenking in fraudedossier van Belgisch voetbal |date=2018-10-16 |access-date=2018-10-16 |publisher=[[Sporza]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the weeks following the raids, 3 additional suspects were arrested and criminally charged.&lt;ref name="Maes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/10/23/fresh-arrest-in-money-laundering-and-match-fixing-probe/ |title=Fresh arrest in money laundering and match fixing probe |date=2018-10-23 |access-date=2018-11-12 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/11/07/voetballer-fabien-camus-vrijgelaten-door-onderzoeksrechter-in-vo/ |title=Voetballer Fabien Camus vrijgelaten door onderzoeksrechter in voetbalschandaal |date=2018-11-07 |access-date=2018-11-07 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maeschalck"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.demorgen.be/sport/ook-makelaar-evert-maeschalck-in-verdenking-gesteld-in-belgisch-voetbaldossier-be75e9c9/ |title=Ook makelaar Evert Maeschalck in verdenking gesteld in Belgisch voetbaldossier |date=2018-11-07 |access-date=2018-11-07 |publisher=[[De Morgen]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Following the ''[[Ye Zheyun|Ye]] affair'' in 2005, the [[Belgian federal police]] launched the Sports Fraud Cell, a department of the Central Office for the Repression of Corruption (OCRC). Jointly managed by the Federal Public Prosecutor and the OCRC, the main task of the department is to gather and corroborate intelligence concerning sports fraud, corruption and match-fixing. If deemed necessary, an investigation is launched by the federal police.

In early 2017, the Sports Fraud Cell received a report from the Belgian [[Financial Intelligence Unit]] concerning suspicious activity through tens of bank accounts in bank office in [[Genk]]. As these transactions were connected to the [[Belgian First Division A]], the Sports Fraud Cell launched an investigation. In late 2017, the report of the investigation was passed to the federal police and the Federal Public Prosecutor.&lt;ref name="Bisschop Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D1/026/18"/&gt;

== Investigation ==
The investigation broadly consists of three components: two parts relating to money laundering and fraud, and a third relating to potential match-fixing. Two player agents, [[Mogi Bayat]] and Dejan Veljkovic, would have set up, independently of each other, a scheme to hide commissions from Belgian authorities. These payments included commissions on player transfers, player and manager wages, and other payments. During the investigation of these schemes, indications of possible [[Match fixing in association football|match-fixing]] arose. The match-fixing pertains to at least two relegation matches in [[2017–18 Belgian First Division A|competition season 2017-2018]].&lt;ref name="D1/026/18"/&gt;

On November 12, after the high profile arrests were made, the [[Court of Appeal (Belgium)|Court of Appeal]] of Antwerp removed examining magistrate Joris Raskin from the investigation. The recusal was requested by Hans Rieder, the lawyer of referee Bart Vertenten. Rieder argued that Raskin could not be impartial and independent because he was part of the Licensing Commission of the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] until March 2018, months after the investigation started. Although Raskin himself and the Public Prosecutor disagreed, the Court of Appeal did find Rieder's request compelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/11/12/magistrate-removed-from-match-fixing-investigation/ |title=Magistrate removed from match-fixing investigation |date=2018-11-12 |access-date=2018-11-12 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the verdict of the Court, Rieder argued for the immediate release of his client Vertenten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/11/12/advocaat-hans-rieder-meneer-vertenten-moet-op-staande-voet-vri/ |title=Advocaat Hans Rieder: "Meneer Vertenten moet op staande voet vrijgelaten worden" |date=2018-11-12 |access-date=2018-11-12 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 4 days after the Court ordered the recusal, Vertenten was released on conditions and he resumed his main job as [[radiologist]] at the University Hospital [[UZ Brussel]].&lt;ref name="Vertenten Released"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/11/16/referee-bart-vertenten-liberated-from-prison/ |title=Referee Bart Vertenten released from prison |date=2018-11-16 |access-date=2018-11-20 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/11/19/bart-vertenten-blijft-aan-de-slag-als-radioloog-in-het-uz-brusse/ |title=Vertenten en Delferière, de twee verdachte scheidsrechters in voetbalschandaal, opnieuw aan het werk |date=2018-11-19 |access-date=2018-11-20 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, Dejan Veljkovic, widely regarded as a key suspect in the investigation, signed a [[plea deal]] with the prosecution. As part of the plea deal, Veljkovic will serve a [[suspended sentence]] of 5 years and pay a (suspended) fine of 80,000 euros. Additionally, all illegally acquired assets will be seized by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/11/20/persconferentie-kris-luyckx/ |title=De deal van Veljkovic: 5 jaar met uitstel en een boete van 80.000 euro in ruil voor alles wat hij weet |date=2018-11-20 |access-date=2018-11-20 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although informal plea deals were used before, Veljkovic was the first to sign a deal where specific sentence reduction is assured by prosecutors. A law allowing these formal agreements was instated only months before the arrests, in August 2018, meaning Veljkovic is the first official ''spijtoptant'' in Belgian history. According to the law, a ''spijtoptant'' is suspect able to provide "substantial, revealing, sincere, and complete information" about serious crimes, e.g. organized crime or terrorism. In exchange for this information, the ''spijtoptant'' can get a more lenient sentence. Following the deal, Veljkovic was released on strict conditions.&lt;ref name="Veljkovic Released"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/11/20/veljkovic/ |title=Spelersmakelaar Veljkovic sluit deal met gerecht in ruil voor strafvermindering en wordt eerste spijtoptant in België |date=2018-11-20 |access-date=2018-11-20 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2018, the federal police searched 44 buildings across Belgium, mostly focused on football club headquarters and suspect's residencies. The headquarters of [[RSC Anderlecht]], [[Club Brugge]], [[KRC Genk]], [[KV Kortrijk]], [[KV Mechelen]], [[KV Oostende]], [[Sporting Lokeren]], [[AA Gent]], and [[Standard de Liège]] were searched. During these searches, documents and contracts pertaining to player agents Mogi Bayat and Deljan Veljkovic were seized. 3 luxury watches were seized as well. Simultaneously, residences of club board members, player agents, referees, a former lawyer, journalists and a manager were searched. Further raids occurred at an accountancy bureau and 2 jewelry stores. During these raids, empty luxury watch boxes valued at 8 million euros, jewels, luxury watches, and cash were seized. As a result of these searches, 28 people were arrested, most of them very early in the morning.&lt;ref name="D1/026/18"/&gt;

[[File:Map Of Europe With Belgium France Luxembourg Serbia Montenegro Macedonia Cyprus Marked.png|thumb|Countries where searches were performed.]]
Internationally, 14 locations were searched in 6 other countries: [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Cyprus]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. During these searches, coordinated by [[Eurojust]], documents and assets on bank accounts and in safes have been seized, for a total amount of 3.6 million euros. No arrests were made during the searches at banks and a company in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wort.lu/de/sport/festnahmen-im-belgischen-fussball-durchsuchungen-in-luxemburg-5bbe036a182b657ad3b952cd |title=Festnahmen im belgischen Fußball, Durchsuchungen in Luxemburg |date=2018-10-10 |access-date=2018-10-12 |publisher=[[Luxemburger Wort]] |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cyprus, a 52 year old man was arrested on a European arrest warrant, with extradition procedures underway. More than 15 Cypriot police officers, and two Belgian investigators were involved in the searches of four properties in [[Nicosia]] and [[Famagusta]], where four computers, two laptops, two iPads, and documents were seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.financialmirror.com/news-details.php?nid=35966 |title=FOOTBALL: Cyprus arrest as part of Belgium match-fixing raids |date=2018-10-10 |access-date=2018-10-12 |publisher=[[Financial Mirror]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six locations in the cities [[Belgrade]] and [[Niš]], Serbia, were searched, resulting in the seizure of up to €800.000 which allegedly originated from organized crime in Belgium. Uros Jankovic, business associate of Dejan Veljkovic, was also arrested Wednesday in Belgrade and ordered to be extradited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://sport.blic.rs/fudbal/evropski-fudbal/ekskluzivno-blic-saznaje-policija-u-srbiji-zaplenila-800000-evra-prljavog-novca-od/3qvlqtf |title=EKSKLUZIVNO!

In total, 184 Belgian and 36 foreign police officers participated in the searches, in Belgium and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/10/10/police-raid-club-brugge-and-anderlecht/ |title=Police raid Club Brugge and Anderlecht as part of wider match-fixing and money laundering investigation |date=2018-10-10 |access-date=2018-11-12 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the size and scope of the investigation, as well as the number of suspects arrested after the searches, up to 3 examining magistrates were working concurrently to process those arrested. Multiple examining magistrates being assigned to a single investigation is very unusual in Belgium, with the exception of terrorism cases.&lt;ref name="Sven Mary Criticism"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/10/12/heeft-advocaat-sven-mary-gelijk/ |title=Heeft advocaat Sven Mary gelijk met zijn kritiek op het voetbalonderzoek en de verschillende onderzoeksrechters? |first=Dominique |last=de Graaf |date=2018-10-12 |access-date=2018-10-10 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charges ==
Throughout the investigation, 23 people were accused of one or multiple crimes. 14 were released on conditions and 6 were released without conditions. Among those charged are player agents, referees, club executives and board members, journalists, players, and managers.&lt;ref name="D1/026/18"/&gt;

== Civil Parties ==
In Belgian criminal law, a civil party ([[:nl:Burgerlijke partij|nl]]) is a person or entity claiming to be injured by a crime, to be awarded damages following the proceedings.

As of November 2018, 3 entities have claimed to be a civil party to the investigation: the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/10/22/vertenten/ |title=Scheidsrechter Bart Vertenten wraakt onderzoeksrechter in voetbaldossier |date=2018-10-22 |access-date=2018-11-20 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Pro League&lt;ref name="Pro League Announcement"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sport.be/nl/jupilerproleague/nieuws/article.html?Article_ID=841637 |title=Persbericht Pro League na RvB van 17 oktober |date=2018-10-17 |access-date=2018-10-17 |publisher=Pro League |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the association of all the Belgian professional football teams, and [[KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://sporza.be/nl/2018/11/13/beerschot-wilrijk-fraudedossier-burgerlijke-partij/ |title=Beerschot Wilrijk is burgerlijke partij in fraudedossier: "Zaak van dichtbij volgen"  |date=2018-11-13 |access-date=2018-11-20 |publisher=[[Sporza]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
On October 11, 2018, the Pro League announced that the tenth match day for the First Division B, planned for October 13 and October 14, would be postponed.&lt;ref name="Belgian football chaos"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/10/12/investigation-threatens-to-plunge-belgian-football-into-chaos/ |title=Investigation threatens to plunge Belgian football into chaos |date=2018-10-12 |access-date=2018-11-12 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johan Verbist, arbitration coordinator for the Royal Belgian Football Association (RBFA), announced on October 11 that Bart Vertenten and Sébastien Delferière were suspended following the investigation, with the RBFA aiming to make this suspension permanent. Delferière was supposed to referee a [[UEFA Nations League|Nations League]] match on October 13, but was quickly replaced by the [[UEFA]] at the request of Verbist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://sporza.be/nl/2018/10/11/refs-vertenten-en-delferiere-worden-geschorst/ |title=Refs Vertenten en Delferière zijn geschorst: "Klap voor imago van refs" |date=2018-10-11 |access-date=2018-10-12 |publisher=[[Sporza]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belgian football chaos"/&gt;

Several politicians, including [[deputy prime minister]] [[Kris Peeters]], [[finance minister]] [[Johan Van Overtveldt]], Flemish [[sports minister]] [[Philippe Muyters]], and [[Ministry of Social Affairs|social affairs minister]] [[Maggie de Block]], announced their intentions to re-evaluate the financial benefits professional players receive following news of the scandal. Since 1978, professional sports players are taxed at a reduced RSZ ([[Social security]]) rate, designed to promote the type of employment at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/politiek-wil-fiscale-voordelen-voetballers-herbekijken~a00a3ea4/ |title=Politiek wil fiscale voordelen voetballers herbekijken |date=2018-10-12 |access-date=2018-10-12 |publisher=[[Het Laatste Nieuws]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2018, the Pro League announced it will set up a commission consisting of three independent experts, tasked with proposing reforms to the board of directors. This commission will consist of renowned jurist [[Melchior Wathelet]], Wouter Lambrecht, and Pierre François, CEO of the Pro League.&lt;ref name="Pro League Announcement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coucke Testifies Committee"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/11/06/coucke-en-francois-vragen-parlement-behoud-fiscale-voordelen-van/ |title=Coucke en Francois vragen Parlement behoud fiscale voordelen van het voetbal en strengere reglementering makelaars |date=2018-11-06 |access-date=2018-11-20 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, a week after 2 sports journalists working for [[Het Laatste Nieuws]] were charged, the newspaper announced that its top sports journalist would be taking a leave of absence, to analyze whether any deontological rule was breached. Although the journalist was not charged, he came under scrutiny because of his close ties to one of the involved player agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://sporza.be/nl/2018/10/19/sportjournalist-hln-non-actief/ |title=Chef voetbal Het Laatste Nieuws moet tijdelijk afstand nemen |date=2018-10-19 |access-date=2018-10-22 |publisher=[[Sporza]] |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview on ''De Ochtend'', a [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|Radio 1]] programme, Sports Fraud Cell coordinator Eric Bisschop called for regulations for player agents in coordination with European directives, federal and regional laws, as well as collaboration with the RBFA, UEFA and FIFA.&lt;ref name="Bisschop Interview"/&gt;

On November 6, almost a month after the news of the raids broke, [[Marc Coucke]] and Pierre François, chairman and CEO of the Pro League respectively, testified before the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]]. During a session held by the Finances and Budget committee, Coucke defended the RSZ "[[tax shelter]]" for professional sports players. Politicians from all major Flemish parties announced intentions to revise these reductions, however Coucke mitigated this, saying the Belgian professional football industry could not afford the loss of this favorable rate and would need a different kind of subsidy.&lt;ref name="Coucke Testifies Committee"/&gt;

In the sport of [[Australian Rules Football|Australian rules football]], the '''50-metre penalty''' is applied by umpires to a number of different infractions when a [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]] or [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]] has already been paid.

Some (particularly amateur) leagues and competitions use a 25-metre penalty. Examples of this include the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL), [[Victorian Amateur Football Association]] (VAFA), [[Australian Football International Cup]] and the [[Australian Amateur Football Council]].

==Rules==
When the umpire pays a 50-metre penalty, he calls time-off, measures out approximately fifty metres from the spot of the mark by running in a straight line towards the goals, and setting the new mark, unless:
* the player is already within 50 metres of goal, in which case the mark becomes the exact centre of the goal line.
* in the [[Australian Football League]]'s (AFL's) [[NAB Cup|preseason competition]], where a goal kicked from beyond 50m scores [[Super Goal|nine points]] instead of six, a team may choose to cut short a fifty-metre penalty at the fifty-metre line and take the higher-value, longer-range set shot.&lt;ref&gt;St Kilda Football CLub, [http://www.saints.com.au/tabid/5315/default.aspx?newsid=106229 2011 NAB Cup Trial Rules] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002031759/http://www.saints.com.au/tabid/5315/default.aspx?newsid=106229 |date=2 October 2011 }}, 15 December 2010, Retrieved 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Players are given a short period of time to follow the play down the field before the clock is restarted. The player cannot play on while the umpire is measuring out the 50-metre penalty, and must wait for the field umpire to blow time-on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Umpire_AFL/Umpire_Education/Accreditation/Level_One_-_Umpires_Manual.pdf Field Umpire Accreditation Manual (Australian Football League)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152152/http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Umpire_AFL/Umpire_Education/Accreditation/Level_One_-_Umpires_Manual.pdf |date=28 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infractions which can result in a 50-metre penalty include:
* Arguing with, disputing the decision of, or using abusive language towards an umpire.
* ''Scragging'' the player who has taken a mark; that is, to tackle the player or impede him from taking the kick as quickly as he would like. This rule has been applied more stringently since 2006 to give defensive players less time to [[Flooding (Australian football)|flood]] the defence, and to keep the game more flowing.
* Failing to return the ball quickly and on the full to a player who has been awarded a free kick.
* Wasting time, deliberately or inadvertently, by kicking the ball forward after one's team has conceded a free kick.
* Using unnecessary roughness against a player who has already taken a mark.
* ''Running over the mark''; the man standing on the mark cannot move forward, and must respond if called to recede by the umpire.
* ''Running through the mark''; other defensive players who are not standing on the mark may not run across the imaginary line between the man standing the mark and the man taking the kick, unless following his direct opponent.
* ''Entering the protected zone''; defensive players may not impede an opponent by entering or remaining within the corridor of space extending ten metres either side of the imaginary line between the man standing the mark and the man taking the kick, and extending backwards, unless following his direct opponent.
* If any free kick is paid against the defensive team while a mark or free kick is to be taken, the umpire either pays the free kick to the violated player at the spot of the foul, or awards a 50-metre penalty to the player with the ball, depending upon which penalty brings the attacking team closer to goal.
* Any free kick resulting from an [[Interchange (Australian rules football)|interchange]] infringement or a line-up has an additional 50-metre penalty applied to it; these are the only circumstances under which a 50-metre penalty is automatically applied to a free kick without further infringement.

==History==
The fifteen-yard penalty was first introduced at senior level by the [[Victorian Football Association]] in 1939, as one of the rules included in its [[throw-pass era|rival code]] of Australian rules football. The rule was introduced to give the umpire a means of penalising a player who cribbed over the mark or wasted time on the mark;&lt;ref name="15yards"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Advocate|publication-place=Burnie, TAS|title=Interpretations of rules|page=9|date=5 August 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; under standard rules at the time, such infractions could only be policed by reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily News|publication-place=Perth, WA|page=14|date=4 May 1939|title=Cribbing on the mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian National Football Council]] introduced the rule into the national rules during 1954 (leagues began using it in 1955), which was applied to both time-wasting and to crude, late challenges on the player with the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The News|publication-place=Adelaide, SA|page=32|date=13 July 1954|title=Fos Williams on 15-yard penalty clause}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|author=Kevin Hogan|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=7 April 1955|page=33|title="Get tough" order given umpires on new rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length was increased to 50 metres in [[1988 VFL season|1988]] when it was determined that the fifteen metre penalty had become insufficient to deter time-wasting and scragging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|author=Daryl Timms|page=84|date=16 March 1988|title='Go' on footy rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Fifty metres is the average length of a long kick. As 50-metre penalties are awarded only to players who have already taken a mark or been awarded a free kick, the penalty is the equivalent of having made a long pass downfield (with the playing area being over 150m long). This interpretation allows the fifty metre length to be adjusted to appropriate values for lower age groups.

With the exception of interchange infringements, a player must already have a free kick or a mark to receive a 50-metre penalty. Often, crowds will call for "fifty!" when they see a player hurt behind play or in a marking contest. However, many fans are unaware that unless the mark is taken, fifty metres can never be awarded. There was an exception to this rule made in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], when a 50-metre penalty would automatically be awarded against any player who was reported for a non-wrestling offence; so unpopular was the change that it was repealed after seventeen rounds.

==Notable 50-metre penalties==

*The most famous 15-metre penalty occurred in the [[1987 VFL season|1987 preliminary final]], in an incident where [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]]'s [[Jim Stynes]] ran across the mark against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. [[Gary Buckenara]], needing a 55-metre goal [[After the siren kicks in Australian rules football|after the final siren]] for Hawthorn to steal the victory, was brought 15 metres closer to goal. Buckenara converted the goal, Hawthorn advanced to the [[1987 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], and Melbourne's long [[Curse of Norm Smith|premiership drought]] continued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130702082819/http://www.thestar.ie/star/afl-rule-is-well-worth-trying-here/ AFL rule is well worth trying here | Irish Daily Star]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[2005 AFL season|2005]] an incident where [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]'s [[Mark Johnson (footballer)|Mark Johnson]] called an opposition player from [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] a "weak dog" when he wouldn't get up and was playing for a free kick was rewarded with a 50-metre penalty to the Sydney player. It was also believed Johnson engaged in abusive language with the umpire which may have influenced the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redandwhiteonline.com/forum/showthread.php/9092-AFL-Response-to-MJ-Fifty AFL Response to MJ Fifty]&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the infamous [[AFL siren controversy|St Kilda vs Fremantle "Sirengate" match]] in round 5, [[2006 AFL season|2006]], [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] full-forward [[Fraser Gehrig]] abused and argued with the umpire, gave up five consecutive free kicks: a free kick in defensive goal square, three consecutive 50-metre penalties (spanning the entire length of the field, yielding a certain goal to Fremantle) and an additional free kick to Fremantle after the goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dockerland.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=254:qdockers-saints-and-sirengateq&amp;catid=8&amp;Itemid=103 "~Dockers, Saints and Sirengate~"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Round 1, [[2007 AFL season|2007]], umpire [[Stuart Wenn]] awarded a short fifty-metre penalty against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood's]] [[Heath Shaw]] after a mark by the [[North Melbourne Football Club|Kangaroos]]' [[Shannon Grant]] with three minutes remaining on the game. Wenn positioned Shaw approximately on the kick-off line when he should have been on the goal line. Grant missed the 15-metre set shot, and the Kangaroos lost the game by three points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/laidley-fumes-at-umpire-blunder/story-e6frfkp9-1111113262221 Laidley fumes at umpire blunder | News.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Round 11, [[2009 AFL season|2009]], triple 50-metre penalties occurred when [[Sydney Swans]]' [[Barry Hall]] put his arm around the neck of [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]'s [[Jarryd Roughead]], who ended up in his own goal square. Hall was benched beside his coach, and Sydney lost by just 11 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/barry-hall-brain-explosion-gifts-hawks-game/story-e6frf7jo-1225728808644 Barry Hall brain explosion gifts Hawks game | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[2017 AFL season#Round 15|Round 15, 2017]], late in the match between {{AFL Fre}} and {{AFL StK}} at [[Subiaco Oval|Domain Stadium]], St Kilda forward [[Tim Membrey]] took a mark inside 50, then teammate [[Nick Riewoldt]] asked for the ball back from Fremantle's [[Griffin Logue]], fooling the latter into thinking that it was Riewoldt who took the mark. Logue gave away a 50-metre penalty for time-wasting, then Membrey kicked the goal to give the Saints a nine-point win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.triplem.com.au/sport/afl/news/heartbreaking-player-profile-shows-nick-riewoldt-stitched-up-one-of-his-biggest-fans|title=Heartbreaking Player Profile Shows Nick Riewoldt Stitched Up One Of His Biggest Fans|publisher=Triple M|date=3 July 2017|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/st-kilda/footy-fans-furious-after-nick-riewoldt-tricks-fremantle/news-story/280329e5b6f6fd93a28f9a84a59410e6|title=Footy fans furious after Nick Riewoldt tricks Fremantle|publisher=Herald Sun|date=2 July 2017|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[British Honduras]]''' (now [[Belize]]) competed in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] for the first time at the '''[[1968 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. Seven competitors, all men, took part in six events in four sports.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/BIZ/summer/1968/ |title=Belize at the 1968 Mexico City Summer Games |accessdate=20 September 2014 |work=sports-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speculated that the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] would discourage British Honduras's participation in the Games, but the British Honduran athletes persevered. They won no medals, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4726">In [[association football]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]] and [[Australian rules football]], a '''dummy''' or '''feint''' is a player deceiving the opposition into believing he is going to pass, shoot, move in a certain direction, or receive the ball and instead doing something entirely different, thus gaining an advantage.

==Association football==
In association football, a dummy (feint) is often used when [[dribbling]], in offensive situations. Examples used in order to deceive an opponent into what direction you will move, include: the [[step over]] as used by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], the [[Flip flap (association football)|flip flap]] (also known as "elastico") used by [[Ronaldinho]], [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], the [[Marseille turn]] (also known as the "360" or "roulette") used by [[Zinedine Zidane]], the [[Rainbow kick|rainbow flick]] as used by [[Neymar]], the [[Cruijff Turn|Cruyff Turn]] named after [[Johan Cruyff]], and dragging the ball around a defender without it leaving your foot as used by [[Romário]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/sid_lowe/02/18/ronaldo.retirement/ "Ronaldo was simply a phenomenon"]. Sports Illustrated. Retrieved June 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/11/world-cup-stunning-moments-johan-cruyff-turn-1974 "World Cup: 25 stunning moments … No25: the Cruyff Turn is born in 1974"]. The Guardian. Retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Goldblatt (2009). "The Football Book". p. 129. D Kindersley Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Sid (2013). "Fear and Loathing in La Liga: The True Story of Barcelona and Real Madrid". p. 288. Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

The next most common instance is also an offensive situation, in which a player, in a reasonable shooting area, fakes a shot to trick a defender coming in for a tackle and have him flinch away. This allows the player to go around the defender and shoot from a closer distance. This dummy can also be used on a goalkeeper in a one-on-one situation: a notable example being [[Goal of the Century|The Goal of the Century]] scored by [[Diego Maradona]] where, having run half the length of the field past several outfield players, he faced goalkeeper Peter Shilton and left him on his backside with a feint, before slotting the ball into the net.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/6700645/Top-10-World-Cup-goals.html?mobile=basic "Top 10 World Cup goals"]. The Telegraph. Retrieved August 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another situation that is used often enough that "dummy" becomes a verb. In this scenario, a player goes toward the path of passing ball, pretends to trap it and lets it goes through the legs. This is to allow his team mate—who is also moving toward the ball but further away—can retrieve it. Another common scenario is the "dummying" player running after the ball after letting it go through the legs. This is very effective if the trap fake is convincing because the stop/start on the defending player is always slower than the attacking player who has the momentum.

==Rugby league and rugby union==
In rugby league football and rugby union football, a dummy has a similar meaning, but is generally confined to a player leading their opposing players into believing that they are about to pass or sometimes kick the ball, but instead retaining and running with the ball. This has the effect of drawing defending players to the apparent recipient of the dummy pass. One of the first rugby players to be credited with using the dummy, or at least taking the technique to New Zealand, was [[Tommy Haslam]]. Haslam played for [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] before the rugby schism and was a member of the 1888 [[British and Irish Lions|British Isles]] tour of [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|New Zealand and Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=John|coauthors= |title=British Lions |year=1990 |publisher=Crowood Press|page=14 |location=Swindon |isbn=1-85223-541-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==
In Australian rules football the term 'dummy' again has a similar meaning to other football codes. A dummy is used to evade a tackler by feigning a hand pass or foot pass to a teammate and then changing direction suddenly to escape the opponent who has been fooled by the move.

'''George Carter''' (dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played in [[first-class cricket]] during the 1740s, chiefly associated with [[London Cricket Club]]. He is first recorded playing for London in a [[single wicket cricket|single wicket]] match at the [[Artillery Ground]] on Monday, 22 August 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter took part in two more single wicket contests in 1749, both played for high stakes, and was then a member of [[Robert Colchin|Long Robin's XI]] against [[Tom Faulkner|Tom Faulkner's XI]] at the Artillery Ground on Monday, 28 August 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Carter had established his reputation by 1748, he must have been active for some years previously and his career may have begun in the 1730s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no further references to Carter after 1749.

'''''Gossaum''''' ({{korean|hangul=고싸움}}) is a traditional [[Sport in South Korea|Korean sport]] played in Chilseok village, [[Nam District, Gwangju|Nam-gu]] as part of the [[Korean New Year|New Year's celebrations]]. It is designated an [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property]].&lt;ref name="Kwalliguk2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Korea (South).

Haeoe Kongbogwan|title=Handbook of Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBpxAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=Korean Overseas Information Service|isbn=978-89-7375-005-4|page=630}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the game was commemorated on a postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WNS:KR057.02|publisher=Universal Postal Union|url=http://www.wnsstamps.ch/en/stamps/KR057.02|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setup==
===Go===
Each Go is around 15m long, and consists of a large straw loop at the end of a long, thick cylinder, supported on poles. Two "tails", at the opposite end of the structure from the loop, serve to provide a rudimentary steering mechanism. During play, the two Go are lifted above head height by the teams, and the loops are brought into contact and pushed against one another. Due to the ritual nature of the contest, one team's Go is larger than the other, making the contest somewhat one-sided.&lt;ref name="mycong"/&gt;

===Teams===
The teams are designated ''Dongbu'' ("East") and ''Seobu'' ("West"), and wear blue and red respectively. Each team consists of around 70-80 people; including the ''Julpaejang'' or leader, who sits astride the Go and directs his team; the ''Gomen-saram'' or carriers, who lift the Go; and the ''Kkorijul-jabi'' or tail-holders (predominantly women) who steer the Go using its two tails. Each team also has a number of standby players who sing and shout chants of encouragement to the players.&lt;ref name="mycong"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
At the command of the ''julpaejang'' the teams rush forward and ram the loops of their two Go against one another, attempting to drive the opposing team back or push its Go to the ground. If, after pushing, neither Go is dislodged, one of the ''julpaejang'' will give the order to retreat and the two Gos will separate before repeating the process. During such separations, the ''gomen-saram'' will raise and lower the Go to demonstrate their fighting spirit.

When one Go has been brought down four times, the game is over.&lt;ref name="mycong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanʼguk Munhwa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hanʼguk Munhwa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GycOAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=1984|publisher=Korean Cultural Service|volume=5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gossaumnori==
''Gossaum'' plays the central role in the ''Gossaumnori'' festival. Other aspects of this [[fertility rite]] include prayers to the spirits of the local mountains and forests, exorcism rite, and traditional music and dancing. Because the Western side of the village is thought to represent [[fecundity]], the ''Seobu'' Go is larger than the ''Dongbu'' one, since only if ''Seobu'' win will the villager's prayers for a prosperous year be granted. Historically, in the event that no clear winner emerged, the Go would be dismantled and their straw ropes used in a [[Juldarigi|tug-of-war contest]] instead.&lt;ref name="mycong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwalliguk2001"/&gt;

'''Hackney Wick Stadium''' was a sports stadium located at Waterden Road in the [[London Borough of Hackney]]

==Origins==
The site chose for the stadium was on land known as Hackney Marshes west of the River Lea and on the west side of the Waterden Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/537346/184983/13/101329|title=OS Plan 1948-1949|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was constructed from September 1931 until 1932 and cost £70,000 to build and after completion £18,000 in wages had been paid to the builders.&lt;ref name=HW&gt;{{cite news|title=Hackney's New Dog Racing Track, April 1932|year=1932|newspaper=Hendon and Finchley Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening==
Hackney opened On Friday 8 April 1932 under the affiliation of the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS) the rival to the larger [[National Greyhound Racing Club]]. Thirteen thousand people attended the first night and witnessed [[Marjorie Graves]], MP for South Hackney officially open the track. The capacity of the track was put between 30,000-50,000 and a [[Tote board|totalisator]] had been installed for the first night. A greyhound called Bullseye became the first ever winner at the track. Although the meeting was advertised as the first official meeting there had been a dress rehearsal two days previous on Wednesday 6 April which attracted 12,000 people.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;

The company responsible for the project was Hackney Wick Stadium Ltd headed by Managing Director Arthur Gilbert and Racing Manager Fred Whitehead with William Chandler also holding shares in the new company, Chandler would in due course buy the [[Walthamstow Stadium|Crooked Billet]] independent track and turn it into [[Walthamstow Stadium]] one year later.&lt;ref name=PHT&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarter|first=P Howard|title=Greyhound Racing Encyclopedia|year=1949|publisher=Fleet Publishing Company Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greyhound history==
After [[World War II]] [[Hendon Greyhound Stadium]] and Hackney Wick merged to become the Hackney and Hendon Greyhounds Ltd company. The resident kennels featured six ranges with each able to house up to fifty greyhounds, paddocks sat next to each range with cooking facilities and a veterinary surgeon on site. The kennel fees were 17s 6d for each greyhound.&lt;ref name=PHT/&gt;

In the early 1950s Mr S Pay became the Racing Manager after Fred Whitehead was promoted to Director of Racing for both Hackney and Hendon. Pay was later replaced by Hendon Racing Manager D G Lewis before Michael Marksbecame Racing Manager for three decades until the day the stadium closed. The stadium offered eight buffet and licensed bars during racing held on Thursday and Saturday nights at 7.45pm. The circuit had a circumference of 472 yards and the greyhounds raced behind an 'Outside Sumner' hare system. Trainers in the 1960s included Annetts, Reg Bosley, Brown, Colebrooke, Cox, Paddy Gordon, Hedley and Lionel Maxen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Greyhound and Racing Greyhound|page =116|year=1975|publisher=Page Brothers (Norwich)|isbn=0-85020-0474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s Mr G.Crookbank the tracks chief electrician had invented photoelectric timing gear that would revolutionise the sport. Hand timing would become a thing of the past after Crookbank came up with the idea that a greyhound’s race time could be recorded electronically. The invention known as 'Automatic Ray Timing' would remain as the timing method until the advent of modern computer timing. The Hackney sales became a major feature of business throughout the year, these sales became a prominent way for buying and selling greyhounds in London.&lt;ref name=RG&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 [[Park Royal Stadium]] and [[New Cross Stadium]] both closed resulting in the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) being switched to Hendon and Hackney, the racing image of Hackney would change forever as it became the number one BAGS track. Afternoon meetings were introduced and eventually there would be no evening meetings at the track with the Saturday matinee BAGS replacing the Saturday night.&lt;ref name=RG/&gt;

In 1970 businessman [[George Alfred Walker|George Walker]], brother of boxing champion [[Billy Walker (boxer)|Billy Walker]] arranged a reverse takeover of Hackney and Hendon Greyhounds Stadium Ltd. This meant his private company bought a public company and the new merger resulted in a new company called [[Brent Walker]]. This resulted in the end for the Hendon Greyhound Stadium because it was sold to make way for the UK’s first stand-alone shopping centre on the site that would soon be known as the Brent Cross shopping centre.&lt;ref name=RG/&gt;

It was not until the closure of sister track Hendon that Hackney Wick hosted a competition of note. The Guineas long associated with Park Royal had switched to Hendon in 1969 which in turn now found its way to Hackney. Three years later 'The Lead' was introduced and would also become a valuable addition to the calendar.&lt;ref name=RG/&gt; In 1976 local hound Westmead Champ trained by Pam Heasman reached the final of the [[English Greyhound Derby]] and was voted [[Greyhound of the Year Awards|Greyhound of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hackney fell out with the NGRC in 1987 when the governing body announced that they would charge £300 to a track staging a BAGS meeting covered by [[Satellite Information Services]] (S.I.S) plus ten percent of the tracks BAGS fees. Hackney refused and [[Ladbrokes]] took legal advice over the situation but all BAGS tracks would eventually pay a fee to the NGRC. Another race called the Lincoln was hosted by Hackney from 1986 and in 1988 Minnies Siren trained by Terry Duggan won the [[TV Trophy (greyhounds)|BBC Television Trophy]]. Brent Walker bought [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill/Mecca]] from [[Grand Metropolitan]] in 1989 and one year later leading trainer John 'Ginger' McGee Sr. joined the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|pages =29–44|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovation and closure==
During 1991 it transpired that Brent Walker had amassed debts of £1.2 billion, George Walker was removed from the board and the banker took control of the company’s assets. With the bank controlling matters there were numerous rumours about the future of the track. By 1994 the stadium had been acquired by a company called London Stadium Hackney Ltd who were in turn owned by Fleetfoot Racing formed in 1992. Work began on an ambitious project including a £12 million restaurant and state of the art facilities, leading trainers were recruited and the stadium was rebranded 'The London Stadium'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Paul|title=The Official NGRC Greyhound Racing Yearbook|pages =205–208|year=1995|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=186054-010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1994 ex-[[Lloyds Bank|Lloyds]] broker and racing journalist Robert Parker left the company as its director to be replaced by Stephen Rea. Beset with construction problems and internal disagreements the original £14 million scheme to develop the neglected stadium had run into serious problems. Extra cash was raised by rights issues with companies including Rothschild, Henderson Venture Managers and Samuel Montagu. In October 1995 the new stadium was finally ready offering first-class facilities and significantly high prize money. However on the reopening night and despite a capacity crowd the stadium went into receivership the same evening. Investigations began and Parker was pursued by Roger Cook on ITV’s television program ''[[The Cook Report]]''. Fleetfoot Racing Ltd had lasted just three years and the stadium was closed on 4 January 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://betting.betfair.com/greyhound-racing/lost-tracks/bankrupt-on-the-first-night-th-311007.html|title=Bankrupt on the first night - the desperate story of the 'new' Hackney Wick|publisher=Betfair}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hackneyreunion.com/A-Tale-of-Two-Stadiums-|title=A Tale of Two Stadiums|publisher=Hackney reunion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was left derelict for several years until it was bought by the [[London Development Agency]] and demolished in 2003. The site was the location of the [[London Olympics Media Centre]], the main media and broadcasting centre for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].

== Speedway history ==
[[Hackney Wick Wolves]] speedway team raced there before [[World War II]] . The [[Hackney Hawks]] speedway team rode at the venue from 1963 to 1983. [[Hackney Kestrels]] speedway team rode here from 1984 until 1990. In 1996, a speedway team under the name of [[London Lions (speedway)|London Lions]] rode but it was found to be financially unviable.&lt;ref&gt;Fenn, C.(2003). ''Hackney Speedway, Friday at Eight''.  {{ISBN|0-7524-2737-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain|British Speedway Grand Prix]] was held at the stadium in 1995 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, R. &amp; Shailes, G. (2002). ''A History of the World Speedway Championship''. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7524-2402-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9004">The '''history of [[orienteering]]''' begins in the late 19th century in [[Sweden]], where it originated as [[military training]]. The actual term "orienteering" was first used in 1886 at the Swedish [[Military Academy Karlberg]] and meant the crossing of unknown land with the aid of a map and a compass. The competitive sport began when the first competition was held for Swedish military officers on 28 May 1893 at the yearly games of the [[Stockholm]] garrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientering.se/Historia-och-statistik/Milstolpar-i-utvecklingen|title=Historiska milstolpar|publisher=Svenska Orienteringsförbundet|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first civilian competition, in [[Norway]] on 31 October 1897, was sponsored by the Tjalve Sports Club and held near [[Oslo]].  The course was long by modern standards, at 19.5&amp;nbsp;km, on which only three controls were placed.  The competition was won by Peder Fossum in a time of 1 hour, 47 minutes, and 7 seconds.&lt;ref name=palmer_18&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Peter|title=The Complete Orienteering Manual|publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd.|year=1997|edition=1|volume=1|pages=18–19|isbn=1-86126-095-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of [[World War I]] the first large scale orienteering meet was organized in 1918 by Major [[Ernst Killander]] of Stockholm, Sweden.  Then President of the Stockholm Amateur Athletic Association, [[Ernst Killander|Killander]] was a [[Scouting Movement]]&lt;!-- leave redirect;  destination page may need to be split --&gt; leader who saw orienteering as an opportunity to interest youth in athletics.  The meet was held south of Stockholm in 1919 and was attended by 220 athletes.&lt;ref name="palmer_18"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boga_1&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Killander|Killander]] continued to develop the rules and principles of the sport, and today is widely regarded throughout Scandinavia as the "Father of Orienteering".

[[Image:Baseplatecompass.jpg|thumb|left|[[Protractor compass]], first introduced in Sweden in 1933.]]
The sport gained popularity with the development of more reliable compasses in the 1930s.  The first international competition between orienteers of Sweden and Norway was held outside Oslo, Norway, in 1932.  In 1933, the Swedish compass manufacturer [[Silva compass|Silva Sweden AB]] introduced a new compass design, the [[protractor compass]].  Until the introduction of the [[thumb compass]], the protractor compass would remain the state of the art in the sport.  By 1934, over a quarter million Swedes were actively participating in the sport, and orienteering had spread to [[Finland]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Hungary]].  The nations of Finland, Norway and Sweden all established national championships.&lt;ref name="palmer_20"&gt;Palmer,

==Spread beyond Europe after World War II==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- needs content on Oceania and Asia --&gt;
Following [[World War II]], orienteering spread throughout Europe, and to North America, [[Oceania]], and Asia.  This spread was due in part to post-war travel by European orienteers, therefore more military people were using orienteering as part of a training method.

In North America, the first orienteering event took place in the [[United States]], at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in November 1941.  It was organized by Piltti Heiskanen, a visiting teacher from Finland.  Swedish orienteer and business man [[Bjorn Kjellström]], who moved to the [[United States]] in 1946, had a major influence on the sport there.  In 1967, Norwegian Harald Wibye founded the first U.S. orienteering club, the [[Delaware Valley Orienteering Association]], which 30 years later was the largest orienteering club in the United States.&lt;ref name=boga_3&gt;{{cite book|last=Boga|first=Steven|title=Orienteering: The Sport of Navigating with Map &amp; Compass|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, USA|year=1997|edition=1|volume=1|pages=3–4|isbn=0-8117-2870-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971, a group of orienteers led by members of the then four-year-old Quantico Orienteering Club founded the [[United States Orienteering Federation]].&lt;ref name="boga_3" /&gt;

The [[Canadian Orienteering Federation]] was founded in 1967, and the first Canadian national orienteering championship was held at Gatineau Park in [[Ottawa]] on August 10, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.ca/HISTORY.htm |title=History of the Canadian Orienteering Federation |last=Kirk |first=Colin |year=2006 |publisher=Canadian Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2006-02-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027180102/http://orienteering.ca/HISTORY.htm |archivedate=2005-10-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;    The only [[World Orienteering Championships|World Championship]] to be held in North America took place at [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]], [[New York (state)|New York]], USA, in 1993.

In Australia, the first orienteering event was held in 1955.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Establishment as a world sport==
&lt;!-- redundant content collected here, needs rewrite --&gt;
The first international governing body for orienteering was the [[International Orienteering Federation]], which was formed by Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, East Germany, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and West Germany in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/orienteering.shtml|title=Orienteering|date=2004-04-18|publisher=hickoksports.com|accessdate=2008-08-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522131709/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/orienteering.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- propose move:  see talk --&gt;
Eleven countries sent representatives to an international conference in [[Sandviken]], Sweden, in 1949 that aimed to bring more consistent rules and mapping standards to the sport.  The Norwegians and Swedes began producing new multi-color maps with [[cartography]] designed specifically for orienteering, in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  The International Orienteering Federation (IOF) was established in 1961 and the first world championships were held in 1966.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  The founding member societies represented the nations of [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], Finland, Hungary, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  By 1969, the IOF would represent 16 countries, including the first two non-European member societies representing [[Japan]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentech.com.au/droc/HistoryOrienteering.asp |title=Orienteering History |last=Dandenong Ranges Orienteering Club |publisher=Momentech Software Services |accessdate=2006-02-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108211727/http://www.momentech.com.au/droc/HistoryOrienteering.asp |archivedate=2006-01-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighty different national orienteering federations are member societies of the IOF today.&lt;ref name=iof_nations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/about-the-iof/national-federations/|title=National Federations|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  World championships were held biannually from 1961 to 2003, and are now held every year.

[[File:Kneeboarding.jpg|thumb|right|Kneeboarder]]
'''Kneeboarding''' is an [[water|aquatic]] [[sport]] where the participant is towed on a buoyant, convex, and hydrodynamically shaped [[boardsport|board]] at a planing speed, most often behind a [[motorboat]]. Kneeboarding on a surf style board with fin(s) is also done in waves at the beach. In the usual configuration of a tow-sport kneeboard, riders kneel on their heels on the board, and secure themselves to the deck with an adjustable [[Velcro]] strap over their thighs. Most water ski kneeboards do not have fins to allow for easier surface spins. As in [[wakeboarding]] or [[water skiing]], the rider hangs onto a tow-rope. The advantages of kneeboarding versus other tow-sports seems to be an easier learning curve and a sense of being closer to the water when falls occur.

==History==
Kneeboards were first produced commercially in the 1970s. While they were not widely popular at first, kneeboarding had become widespread by the mid-1970s. Today, kneeboarding remains popular, with sales of about 100,000 units per year.

As waterskiing gained popularity, riders also experimented with kneeling down on round plywood discs. Others tried kneeling on surfboards and some used purpose-built kneeboards designed specifically for riding waves, but the water ski kneeboard did not emerge as a product until the 1970s.

The first commercially available water ski kneeboard was Knee Ski, co-invented by Mike Murphy and Bud Hulst in 1972. Hulst had a background in surfing, manufacturing kneeboards for wave riding under the name of El Paipo. Murphy had been a professional show skier. The original Knee Ski was made from molded fiberglass, like a boat hull, and was neutrally buoyant. Each Knee Ski had a flat neoprene pad covering the entire deck, and a Velcro strap.

In 1973, John Taylor, a former Knee Ski employee, decided to make and sell his own boards under the name of Glide Slide. Taylor took a new approach, blow molding a plastic shell and filling it with foam. Unfortunately the teardrop design was unstable, and Glide Slide faltered as the [[1973 oil crisis]] slowed the water sports industry.

Danny Churchill, quarter mile speed ski record holder in 1974 and former Glide Slide employee, bought the company in the wake of the oil crisis. Churchill redesigned the Glide Slide to make it more stable and renamed the product Hydroslide in 1976. Churchill is most commonly known for popularizing the sport through advertising and promotions in the newly released full color water ski publications of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In the early 1980s the very first association for competition was formed called the International Kneeboard Association (IKA). Founded by Roland Hillier of Maitland, Florida, a former World Overall and Slalom Champion; National Slalom and Trick Champion; Masters Overall Water Ski Champion and three time Intercollegiate Overall Champion. Hillier created the rules and regulations for kneeboarding not only for boat towing method but also cableway towing.  In boat towing the three competition events were tricks, slalom and wake crossing.  A special event was also included to be called the "Flip-off" to see how many flips could be completed in twenty seconds.   This proved to be quite popular with the spectators.  In cableway competition, Roland designed the trick event which also included the use of  small ramps for doing spins and flips.  Calculations were needed to adjust for cableway towline length when the water levels changed.   Roland Hillier also wrote and published the first book on kneeboarding called "Kneeboarding A - Z". After several National Championships, he produced and broadcast on ABC and, later, PBS of "The International Kneeboard  Championships". This broadcast was the very first of its kind.  The next year, Sea World of Orlando approached the IKA to hold a National Championship at their park, however, the original sponsors to the IKA would not be allowed to participate and Hillier felt strongly that supporters should be included and did not accept. The American Kneeboarding Association (AKA) was founded by another group of people after the International Kneeboard Association rejected the Sea World offer, and created their own form of competition.   Eventually the AKA merged with USA WaterSki as one of its designated towable sports. ¹ [http://www.usawaterski.org/pages/divisions/kneeboard/kneeboardhist.htm Kneeboarding History]

One of the earliest types of kneeboarding is 'tourist kneeboarding'. In this type of kneeboarding, the rider begins on land, already strapped to the board. This type of kneeboarding is far easier than normal kneeboarding, usually done in a river or on a lake. Regular kneeboarding is far superior to "tourist kneeboarding" because you are already in the water and can take off faster.

==Description==
Required equipment includes a tow rope, a kneeboard and a boat that can go about 15-20&amp;nbsp;mph (28–32&amp;nbsp;km/h). Also, most importantly, a certified life vest for safety. Kneeboarding starts are relatively simple, and the rider does not need to travel very quickly.

There are two basic grips – the palms-down grip and the baseball bat grip. For the palms-down grip the hands facing downward while holding the ski rope. For the Baseball Bat grip kneeboarders hold the handle just like a baseball bat.

==Tricks==
Here is a list of kneeboarding tricks:

# Riding - Ride with your arms at full extension (this keeps your arms from tiring,) your knees in the divits, and the strap on relatively tight.
# Turning - While riding, hold on tightly to the tow rope, and lean your body to one side. This should put the kneeboard on its edge, and take you outside of the boat's wake. To come back straight behind the boat, lean in the other direction. To turn more aggressively, pull in on the rope with your arms (the handle should be close to the hip,the opposite side from the side your turning to) and lean harder.
# Side Slide/Butter Slide - Position yourself directly behind the boat with a palms-down grip. Rotate the board sideways without turning on edge - the board should slide. As you slide sideways, lean back so the boat doesn't pull you forward. It makes it much easier if you pull the handle and place it on your hip while you turn sideways. You should lean away from the boat just a little.
# "Jumping the wake"- To jump the wake while on a kneeboard, simply cut hard out of the wake, get as far away from the boat as possible (to one side,) then use a progressively harder cut back toward the wake. Lean back slightly, and you will launch off the wake of the boat, sending you into the air. Make sure you hold the board flat by using your stomach muscles.
# The ole - To perform this trick, you must combine the skills of balance and riding one-handed. You pull in the tow rope, pulling in hand-over-hand, until you are holding the rope roughly 6 feet beyond the handle. From there, you hold the rope in one hand, near your hip, and then swing the remainder of the rope, along with the handle, above your head
# Surface 360 - This trick is very similar to the side slide. Slightly rotate to one side to build momentum, and then fully rotate in the opposite direction. If you are spinning to the right, release the rope with your right hand, spin, grab the rope again behind your back, and then pull yourself through to finish the 360.
# Riding Backwards - You go through exactly the same motion as a 360, but instead of pulling yourself through the 360, you pause while both hands are behind your back. You must lean forward while riding backwards - leaning what is forward to the rider will push the nose down and the tail up. Otherwise, the tail could go under the water and flip the rider.
# Wake Front-to-Back - Make a hard cut from outside the wake, using the palms-down grip. Right before you hit the wake, stop cutting and pop up in a jump, focusing on pushing your knees away from your chest to give you added height. As soon as you are airborne, rotate your body to the right and pull the handle to your hip. As you spin, keep a tight grip on the rope, and lean forward slightly. Keep leaning forward (away from the boat) as you hit the water. Once you have landed, you should be riding backwards, and can continue to ride with both hands at your hip.
# Wake 360 front-to-front (wrapped) - While in the middle of the wake, pull yourself towards the boat, collecting the rope in one hand. Then, wrap the rope around your back, and hold onto the handle. Let go of the rope, and the friction of the rope straightening will spin you around.
# Air (Ollie) - similar to the skateboarding trick of the same name, or a bunny hop in BMX, it is possible to jump without utilizing the wake. By pushing down against the water with your knees and simultaneously pulling the handle in provides more tension on the rope. Then pulling upwards with your legs, you can make the entire board leave the water. If this is combined with 'jumping' the wake, much greater heights can be achieved.
# Back Roll - Make a hard cut toward the wake. One millisecond before you hit the wake, flatten out. Ride up the wake while resisting it (see wake jump). At the top of the wake, and not before, throw your shoulders sideways in the direction of your roll. At the same time, look back over your shoulder and pull the handle to your waist. Your momentum will take you around and then you just need to land. If you are coming up short, you are most likely throwing the trick too soon, letting your arms out, or not throwing the trick sideways. If you lean forward at all, you will lose your rotation momentum.
# Switch 3 - The switch 3 is basically a wake 360 back except that you change the direction of rotation after 180 degrees. Make a hard cut toward the wake with a palms down grip. When you reach the trough, spin around 180 degrees. Rotate to the left if you're cutting to the right and rotate to the right if you're cutting to the left. Tuck the handle into your hip. Ride up the wake while resisting it to get a good pop. Once you are in the air and not sooner, spin back to the front. As you come around, keep the handle low and let your arms extend out. Once you reach the forward position, pull the handle to your waist again and spin backward in the opposite direction. Land backwards and use your second pop to spin back to the front. It's very important to keep the handle at your waist and your head up when landing.
# Frontflip - Edge in hard, flatten out, pop off the wake and immediately throw your body straight down, keeping both hands on the handle and close to your hip. This will help with rotation and control.

The '''Latvia national rugby league team''' was established in 2008 to represent [[Latvia]] at [[rugby league football]], and initially competed in the [[Rugby League European Bowl|European Bowl]], for fourth-tier developing nations. They beat [[Estonia national rugby league team|Estonia]] in a two-game series and therefore won the inaugural tournament after Ukraine could not gain visas to travel. In 2009 they reached the second place after losing to [[Ukraine national rugby league team|Ukraine]] and defeating Estonia. In 2010 they played in the [[Rugby League European Shield|European Shield]], losing to [[Russia national rugby league team|Russia]] and Ukraine. After a hiatus of several years, Latvia will return to international competition on May 9, 2015 for the first match of the [[2017 Rugby League World Cup]] qualifying process, taking on [[Spain national rugby league team|Spain]] in a one-off knockout match to determine the final participants in the 'European C' section.

'''Mika Sports Arena''' ({{lang-hy|Միկա Մարզադահլիճ}}), is a multi-purpose [[arena|sports arena]] located in the [[Shengavit District]] of [[Yerevan]], the capital of [[Armenia]]. It has a capacity of 1,200 spectators.

The arena was constructed in 2009 by the Mika Corporation Ltd., the owners of the currently-defunct football club [[Mika FC]]. It is located near the [[Mika Stadium]].

Mika Sports Arena is currently home to the [[Armenia national basketball team]]. It was also home to the short-lived [[Urartu BC]] basketball team during 2016.

==History==
The construction of the Mika Sports Complex was launched in 2006 on the grounds of the former Araks sports complex. The football stadium was completed in 2008, while the indoor sports arena was put in service by 2009.

The arena was owned by the Mika Corporation until 2014. However, on August 28, 2014, due to the accumulated debts of the owners, the ownership of the entire sport complex was transferred to the Government of Armenia for [[Armenian dram|AMD]] 9.045&amp;nbsp;billion (US$22&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="arka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/sport/mika_sporting_facility_placed_under_management_of_armenian_finance_ministry/|publisher=arka.am|title=Mika sporting facility placed under management of Armenian finance ministry|accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena is basically used for [[basketball]] matches, but it may also host [[handball]], [[futsal]] and [[volleyball]] matches. 

Mika Arena is among the regular venues of the [[Pan-Armenian Games]].

'''''North Shore''''' is a 1987 American [[action film|action]] [[drama (film and television)|drama]] [[surf film]] about Rick Kane ([[Matt Adler]]), a young [[surfer]] from a [[wave tank]] in [[Arizona]], who heads to surf the season on the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore of O{{okina}}ahu]] to see if he has the skills to cut it as a pro surfer. As he progresses on his journey, he learns the qualities he possesses are not going to pull him through alone.

==Synopsis==
Rick Kane is approximately 18 years old at the start of the film, having just graduated high school. He uses his winnings from a wave tank surfing contest in his native state of [[Arizona]] to fly to Hawaii for the summer before the start of college, in order to try to become a professional surfer. He takes a plane to [[Honolulu]] with plans to stay with a surfer that he met in Arizona six months previously. He finds the friend tending bar at a seedy gentlemen's club. 

At the bar Rick meets up with two pro surfers, Alex (Robbie Page)&lt;ref&gt;https://encyclopediaofsurfing.com/entries/page-robbie&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark ([[Mark Occhilupo]]), and stays with them at the house of Lance Burkhart.  In the morning, he goes out surfing with Alex and Mark and realizes that surfing in the ocean is totally different to surfing in a wave tank. He is not as good as he had initially thought. During this scene he gets in the way of Vince, played by real surfing legend [[Gerry Lopez]], who is leader of a local group named "The Hui" (wave slider club). This causes Vince to wipe out and leads to a confrontation where Rick is chased off the beach, after he realizes his stuff was stolen from the beach by a member of "The Hui".  

With nowhere to go, he fortuitously runs into Turtle ([[John Philbin]]). Kane meets and falls in love with Kiani ([[Nia Peeples]]), a beautiful local girl, coincidentally the cousin of Vince, who helps him acclimate to the local culture and customs. Turtle introduces him to Chandler ([[Gregory Harrison]]), a shaper and soul surfer, who teaches Rick about soul surfing and Rick masters the art of appreciating and riding the waves.  Rick is a talented graphic artist who helps Chandler design a more contemporary logo for his surfboards.

The film's antagonist is Lance Burkhart ([[Laird Hamilton]]), a famous, top-ranked surfer whose competitive and materialistic values conflict with the spiritual teachings of Chandler ("You still have a single-fin-mentality").  The film climaxes with a surf contest on [[Banzai Pipeline]] as Rick ends up competing against Lance in a duel of skills and beliefs.

==Professional surfers==
North Shore features professional surfers [[Shaun Tomson]], [[Gerry Lopez]] ("Vince"), [[Laird Hamilton]] ("Lance Burkhart"), [[Mark Occhilupo]], [[Robbie Page]] ("Alex Rogers"), [[Mark Foo]], [[Derek Ho]], [[Hans Hedemann]], [[Ken Bradshaw]], [[Christian "the KID" Fletcher]], [[Lord James Blears]] and several others. The character of Rick Kane was loosely based on Connecticut born surfer Benjamin "Barney" Partyka. The first-ever professional surfer, [[Corky Carroll]], plays a competition announcer in the film.

==Connections to real life==
Laird Hamilton's adoptive father Bill Hamilton was a surfboard shaper and glasser on [[Oahu]] in the 1960s and 1970s and owned a small business. Bill was handmaking custom, high-performance surfboards for the Oahu North Shore big wave riders of the era, similar to the character Chandler in the film.  In reality, Laird is a big wave rider and loathes competition like the Chandler character does.

The '''Omega Dubai Ladies Classic '''is a professional [[golf]] tournament on the [[Ladies European Tour]] (LET) that was played for the first time in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladieseuropeantour.com/content/let_content_feature.php?Id=5786&amp;PHPSESSID=325909e49a36011bc15659eb8658fc14 |title=LET announces Dubai Ladies Masters |publisher=Ladies European Tour |first=Bethan |last=Cutler |date=26 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185013/http://www.ladieseuropeantour.com/content/let_content_feature.php?Id=5786&amp;PHPSESSID=325909e49a36011bc15659eb8658fc14 |archivedate=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its prize fund of [[Euro|€]]500,000 made it the fourth most valuable tournament on the LET. Promoted and organised by golf in Dubai, the tournament is played on the Majlis course at [[Emirates Golf Club]], which also hosts the [[Omega Dubai Desert Classic]] on the men's [[European Tour]].

Since 2009, [[Omega SA|Omega]], a luxury [[watch]] company based in Switzerland, has been the title sponsor of the tournament.

[[Annika Sörenstam]] won the event the first two times it was played. Sörenstam beat out [[Karrie Webb]] in 2006, and in 2007 defeated [[Iben Tinning]] by two shots. The 2008 event, which was Sörenstam's final tournament before her retirement, was won by [[Germany]]'s [[Anja Monke]].

The 2016 event was shortened to 54 holes after caddie Maximilian Zechmann collapsed and died during the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/18225583/caddie-dies-collapse-ladies-european-tour-event |title=Caddie dies, 1st round stopped and event shortened in Dubai |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedalinho.JPG|thumb|Pedalos in [[Brazil]] (called ''pedalinhos'')]]

A '''pedalo''' (British English) or '''paddle boat''' (U.S., Canadian, and Australian English) is a small [[human-powered watercraft]] propelled by the action of pedals turning a [[paddle wheel]].

The paddle wheel of a pedalo is a smaller version of that used by a [[paddle steamer]]. A two-seat pedalo has two sets of pedals, side by side, designed to be used together. Some models, however, have three pedals on each side to allow a person boating alone to pedal from a centrally seated position.

Pedalos, being particularly suited to calm waters, are often hired out for use on ponds and small [[lake]]s in [[urban park]]s.

The earliest record of a pedalo is perhaps [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s diagram of a craft driven by two pedals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumpleton|first=Bernard|title=Story of the Paddle Steamer|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84150-801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paddle Boat|url=http://www.msichicago.org/scrapbook/scrapbook_exhibits/leonardo/models/01_model.html|website=Leonardo da Vinci Exhibit: the Models|publisher=[[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)]]|accessdate=17 September 2015|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Poule d'Essai des Pouliches''' is a [[Conditions races|Group&amp;nbsp;1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[France]] open to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run over a distance of 1,600&amp;nbsp;metres (about 1&amp;nbsp;mile) at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]] in May.

It is France's equivalent of the [[1,000 Guineas Stakes|1,000&amp;nbsp;Guineas]], a famous race in England.

==History==
===Origins===
The [[Poule d'Essai des Poulains#Poule d'Essai|Poule d'Essai]], an event for three-year-old colts and fillies, was established in France in 1840. It was inspired by two races in England, the [[2000 Guineas Stakes|2000 Guineas]] (for colts and fillies) and the 1,000&amp;nbsp;Guineas (for fillies only).

The race was initially staged at the [[Champ de Mars]]. Its first running was over one full circuit of the track (about 2,000&amp;nbsp;metres). It was cut to a three-quarter lap (1,500&amp;nbsp;metres) in 1841. It was cancelled due to insufficient entries in 1843 and 1844.

The Poule d'Essai was transferred to Longchamp in 1857. It was extended to 1,600&amp;nbsp;metres in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1868 Poule d'Essai | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5-UNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA324&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U3c0zBqSudOQZDO2sjvQ6jM3c5nFQ&amp;ci=443%2C66%2C480%2C283&amp;edge=0 | work = Ruff's Guide to the Turf for 1869 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abandoned because of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871. It continued to be run until 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1882 Poule d'Essai | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k278179d.f3&amp;l=5&amp;r=3516,3384,712,422 | language = French | newspaper = [[Le Figaro]] | date = 24 April 1882 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern version===
The Poule d'Essai des Pouliches was created in 1883, when the Poule d'Essai was divided into two separate races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1883 Poule d'Essai des Pouliches | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k278547v.f3&amp;l=5&amp;r=776,3352,501,415 | language = French | newspaper = Le Figaro | date = 23 April 1883 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Pouliches" was restricted to fillies, and the [[Poule d'Essai des Poulains]] was reserved for colts.

The events were cancelled throughout World War&amp;nbsp;I, with no runnings from 1915 to 1918. There were two 1,800-metre replacement races at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Courses à Chantilly | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k537260b.f4&amp;l=5&amp;r=332,1228,340,488 | language = French | newspaper = [[Le Gaulois]] | date = 22 May 1917 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version for fillies was called the Critérium d'Essai des Pouliches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1917 Critérium d'Essai des Pouliches | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k537260b.f4&amp;l=5&amp;r=3402,1238,255,485 | newspaper = Le Gaulois | date = 22 May 1917 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Pouliches" and "Poulains" were not run in the spring of 1940, but a substitute combining both races took place at [[Auteuil Hippodrome|Auteuil]] in October. Titled the Prix d'Essai, it was won by the colt [[Djebel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Djebel enlève le Prix d'Essai | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k586908d.f3&amp;l=5&amp;r=3424,3632,1652,608 | language = French | newspaper = [[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]] | date = 28 October 1940 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Poule d'Essai des Pouliches was held at [[Tremblay Park|Le Tremblay]] in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Résultats de samedi, au Tremblay | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k587727c.f3&amp;l=5&amp;r=1396,3076,614,310 | newspaper = Le Matin | date = 17 May 1943 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse|Maisons-Laffitte]] in 1944 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = La journée des Poules d'Essai à Maisons-Laffitte | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/proxy?method=R&amp;ark=bpt6k5880305.f4&amp;l=5&amp;r=304,1892,612,602 | language = French | newspaper = Le Matin | date = 13 May 1944 | accessdate = 28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present race grading system was introduced in 1971, and the event was given Group&amp;nbsp;1 status. It was switched from Longchamp's middle course (moyenne piste) to the main course (grande piste) in 1987.

The leading horses from the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches sometimes go on to compete in the [[Prix de Diane]]. Twenty-six fillies have won both races. The most recent was Avenir Certain in 2014.

'''''Skeet Shoot''''' is a [[skeet shooting]] [[video game]] for the [[Atari 2600]] and the first game released by [[Games by Apollo]] in December 1981.&lt;ref name=gutmon/&gt; Players assume the role of a skeet shooter shooting [[clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeons]]. There is a two-player mode where the players alternate.

''Skeet Shoot'' was developed by programmer Ed Salvo&lt;ref name="giantlist"/&gt; in his [[Iowa]] home and purchased by Pat Roper under the newly formed Apollo. Despite negative reviews, it was a financial success, and led to Salvo's continuation with the company, where he became Director of Development.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Skeet Shoot gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay; the shooter is seen at the bottom.]]
The player controls a skeet shooter who is shooting clay pigeons. By pressing the button on the controller, a clay pigeon is sent out and pressing the button again will shoot; moving the joystick changes the gun's angle. A point is earned if the bullet hits. Difficulty varieties adjust the speed of the pigeons.&lt;ref name=Allgame&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeet Shoot|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8351|website=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=February 18, 2003|accessdate=July 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114184850/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=8351|archivedate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two two-player gameplay variations exist and are activated by modifying the Atari 2600's difficulty switches. There is an alternating version where players take turns shooting the clay pigeons, and another variation features one player shooting while the other controls the angle of the clay pigeons. Other variables that can be changed are the position of the shooter and the direction the bird will enter the screen from.&lt;ref name=Allgame/&gt;

==Development==
Ed Salvo developed ''Skeet Shoot'' independently. Salvo had self-taught himself to program for the 2600 after purchasing an [[Atari 800]]; the dealer wanted a [[flight simulator]] for the 2600 so he contracted Salvo to make one. The game was never released as the dealer had lost interest. According to Salvo, the development of ''Skeet Shoot'' took him around a month at night in his home to finish. After his friend sent him an advertisement from a Dallas newspaper by newly founded studio [[Games by Apollo]] that asked for programmers, he contacted Apollo founder Pat Roper and showed him ''Skeet Shoot''.&lt;ref name=salv&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stilphen|first1=Scott|title=DP Interviews... Ed Salvo|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_ed_salvo.html|website=Digital Press|accessdate=June 7, 2014|date=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roper decided that ''Skeet Shoot'' was a good enough game for a first time.&lt;ref name=gutmon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutmon|first1=Don|title=Trouble in a video game company|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_03_1983-01_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer__Games_Vol_01_No_03_1983-01_Fun__Games_Publishing_US#page/n61/mode/1up|website=[[Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games]]|publisher=Fun &amp; Games Publishing|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=January 1983|volume=1|number=3|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered Salvo a job at Apollo, which Salvo declined, believing it would be too risky. When Salvo returned to his Iowa home, Roper contacted him and told him he would buy ''Skeet Shoot'' for five thousand dollars which Salvo accepted.&lt;ref name=salv/&gt;

''Skeet Shoot'' still had [[glitch]]es when it was released; one caused the image to flip vertically. Salvo learned of the glitch and fixed it, and the only cartridges that bear the bug are European versions.&lt;ref name=salv/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews were negative, as Apollo's publicist Emmit Crawford acknowledged.&lt;ref name=Crawford&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo, like its namesake, shoots for the video-gaming stars!|url=https://archive.org/stream/Videogaming_Illustrated_1982-08_Ion_International_US#page/n5/mode/2up|website=[[Videogaming Illustrated]]|publisher=Ion International|accessdate=June 30, 2014|date=August 1982|page=7–8|issn=0739-4373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford believed that the reason people did not like ''Skeet Shoot'' was because it did not provide enough challenge for most video game players and that the company had distributed it in too much of a hurry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Shoots for the Moon|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_02_1982-10_Pumpkin_Press_US#page/n15/mode/2up|website=Video Games|publisher=Pumpkin Press|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=October 1982|volume=1|number=2|pages=16, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said that "All in all, Skeet Shoot wasn't a spectacular game to start off with."&lt;ref name=Crawford/&gt; Despite the poor publicity, the game sold very well.&lt;ref name=AGH&gt;{{cite web|title=AGH&amp;nbsp;– Third Party Profile: Apollo|url=http://www.atarihq.com/2678/3party/apollo.html|website=Atari Gaming Headquarters|accessdate=June 30, 2014|date=January 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Brett Alan Weiss wrote that ''Skeet Shoot'' was "a shoddily programmed, graphically primitive game" and said that the poor controls and difficulty levels rendered the game "virtually worthless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Brett|title=Classic Home Video Games, 1972–1984: A Complete Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzxTtml8Jq4C&amp;pg=PA104|date=March 7, 2012|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-7864-8755-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer for ''Atari HQ'' called it a mediocre game.&lt;ref name=AGH/&gt; Lee Peppas of ''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' remarked that "Atari &amp; Activision have nothing to fear from the graphics on this first release."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peppas|first1=Lee|title=VCS Update|url=https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-05/Analog_Computing_05_1982-01_Graphics#page/n39/mode/2up|website=[[ANALOG Computing]]|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=January 1982|number=5|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Gamer]]'' opined it was one of the worst games for the system, saying that it was boring and criticizing the fact that it was difficult to hit the skeet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeet Shoot|url=https://archive.org/stream/TV_Gamer_1983-06_Boytonbrook_GB#page/n29/mode/2up|website=[[TV Gamer]]|publisher=Boytonbrook|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=June 1983|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Androvich of ''Classic Gamer Magazine'' was similarly negative, writing "Games by Apollo released a couple of decent games before going bankrupt, but you never would have guessed that anyone at the company knew how to program the Atari 2600 judging by their debut game." Androvich opined that while the game was playable, it was not "a step in the right direction" for Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Androvich|first1=Mark|title=Five Atari 2600 Games Worse Than E.T.|url=https://archive.org/stream/Classic_Gamer_Magazine_Volume_3_Issue_1_2010_Classic_Gamer_US#page/n19/mode/2up|website=[[Classic Gamer]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014|year=2010||volume=3|issue=1|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After ''Skeet Shoot'', Salvo signed a contract that led to the creation of ''[[Spacechase]]''. Eventually, Salvo became Apollo's Director of Development and was given the job of hiring 25 programmers to work on Apollo's games.&lt;ref name=salv/&gt; Apollo went on to release seven other games after ''Skeet Shoot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Games By Apollo|url=http://www.allgame.com/company.php?id=102&amp;tab=developed|website=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|accessdate=July 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116160607/http://www.allgame.com/company.php?id=102&amp;tab=developed|archivedate=November 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, the studio eventually filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on November 12, 1982, due to pressure from its advertising agency, [[Benton &amp; Bowles]]. Apollo owed the company $2.5 million (half of its total debt). Although Roper expected Apollo to return in "smaller form",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vid Game Firm Apollo Files Chapter XI|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WiQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=June 30, 2014|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=December 4, 1982|volume=94|number=48|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed.&lt;ref name="AGH"/&gt;

'''Stadio Comunale Sant'Elia''' was a [[Association football|football]] stadium in [[Cagliari]], Italy. It is best known for having been the home of [[Cagliari Calcio]]. It hosted three matches during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The stadium had an initially capacity of 60,000 spectators, reduced to 40,919 in 1990, and then 23,834 and finally 16,000 spectators with a provisional stand.

Its construction began in 1970, following [[Cagliari Calcio]]'s first and so far only [[Scudetto]], thus taking the place of the old [[Stadio Amsicora|Amsicora Stadium]].

The stadium could accommodate up to about 60,000 spectators (the record attendance being approximately 70,000, was recorded against [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint Etienne]]). The stadium subsequently underwent major changes and restructuring for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The maximum capacity of Sant'Elia was reduced to 40,919 spectators.
[[File:Stadio Sant'Elia -Cagliari -Italy-23Oct2008.jpg|left|thumb|Aerial  view]]
The Sant'Elia was also used for sporting events outside football such as the Terra Sarda athletics meet.

Before the [[Serie B 2002-03|2002–03]] season, also due to the reduced number of fans following the poor form of the team, long reduced to yo-yoing between [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B|B]], the stadium was restructured again. Over the athletics track, a new stand was built, behind the goals so as to reduce the distance between the terrace and the playing field, with the central terraces remaining intact. The new format of the stadium, which almost halved its maximum capacity to 23,486 seats, came under harsh criticism.

[[Cagliari Calcio]] president [[Massimo Cellino]] had plans to build a new stadium for the football team to play in, however the council and mayor Emilio Floris refused to give consent for the project to go ahead, despite the fact that Cellino was willing to finance the new stadium himself.

Nonetheless, plans were drawn up and a draft was revealed in September 2007, with Cellino and Cagliari Calcio meeting all expenses. The project provided a stadium with 25,000 seats, with construction beginning in August 2009 and expected completion a year later. However, late in 2009, Cagliari Calcio proposed a revamped plan for the Karalis Arena in order to be added to the list of the [[Euro 2016]] candidature. The new stadium would accommodate about 30,000 spectators and have new Skybox, restaurants and café.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionesarda.it/articoli/articolo/158887 L'Uefa approva la Karalis Arena L'impianto avrà 33mila posti – Cronache dalla Sardegna – L'Unione Sarda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to disagreements with the new local administration headed by mayor [[Massimo Zedda]] and growing safety concerns regarding the venue, Cagliari left Stadio Sant'Elia in the final weeks of the [[2011–12 Serie A]] season, playing the remaining few home games at [[Stadio Nereo Rocco]], [[Trieste]]. For the [[2012–13 Serie A]] season, Cagliari played its home games outside its home city, at [[Stadio Comunale Is Arenas]] in [[Quartu Sant'Elena]], thus ultimately putting an end to its long-standing association with Stadio Sant'Elia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/cagliari/2012/05/21/news/rivoluzione_in_arrivo_is_arenas-35653028/ |publisher=[[La Repubblica]] |language=Italian |accessdate=21 May 2012|date=21 May 2012|title=Sant'Elia addio, 'Is Arenas' è realtà Ficcadenti in bilico, chi in panchina? |trans-title=Sant'Elia goodbye, Is Arenas is reality. Ficcadenti in danger, who's going to be the next coach?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Cagliari cancelled their contract at Stadio Is Arenas in April 2013 after having safety issues with local authorities all season, which forced them to play behind closed doors in several matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11872/8613682/serie-a-cagliari-cancel-contract-at-stadio-is-arenas-in-quartu-santelena|publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=2 April 2013|title=Serie A: Cagliari cancel contract at Stadio Is Arenas in Quartu Sant'Elena}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 19 October 2013 that Cagliari would return to the Stadio Sant’Elia for the remainder of [[2013-14 Serie A]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/10/cagliari-will-return-to-the-stadio-santelia-for-remainder-of-season/|publisher=[[Forza Italian Football]] |date=19 October 2013|title=Cagliari will return to the Stadio Sant’Elia for remainder of season}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2014, after a deal with the local council, new Cagliari President Tommaso Giulini announced that Stadio Sant’Elia would be expanded to hold at least 11,650 fans for the [[2014-15 Serie A]] season. The goal was to reach a capacity of 16,000 (or even 18,000) by 21 December 2014 (home match against Juventus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sardanews.it/news/37084-sant-elia-patto-di-ferro-tra-giulini-e-zedda-nel-2020-stadio-nuovo-con-negozi-e-museo-cronache-dalla-sardegna |publisher=[[Sarda News]] |language=Italian |accessdate=1 August 2014|date=1 August 2014|title=Sant'Elia, patto di ferro tra Giulini e Zedda "Nel 2020 stadio nuovo con negozi e museo" - Cronache dalla Sardegna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2014, the Provincial Supervision Committee gave the go-ahead for opening Curva Sud which has a capacity of 4,000 seats. Thus, it was expected that the stadium would have a total capacity of 16,000 when Cagliari Calcio took on AC Milan on 29 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gianlucadimarzio.com/cagliari/cagliari-riaperta-la-curva-sud-del-santelia-il-comunicato/|publisher=[[Gianluca Di Marzio]] |language=Italian|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=24 October 2014|title=Cagliari, riaperta la Curva Sud del Sant’Elia: il comunicato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2015 Cagliari Calcio presented a project of a new stadium which would have a capacity of 21,000, shops, and a restaurant. The project was approved by the local council on 21 February 2017 and by the region on 1 March 2017. Work started in April 2017 and the new stadium will be completed by 2020. During the construction of the new stadium Cagliari plays at the [[Sardegna Arena]], a provisional stadium built near old Sant'Elia.

==1990 FIFA World Cup==
The stadium was one of the venues of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Although it was denied by local and [[FIFA]] organisers, it was widely rumoured that the stadium had been chosen for all of [[England national football team|England]]'s group matches as a way to control their reputation at the time for [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/international/tournaments/fifa-world-cup/1990/1990-group-f.html FIFA World Cup 1990 – Group F – Historical Football Kits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following matches were held at the ground:

'''Stadion Hrvatski vitezovi''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Croatian Knights Stadium'') is a [[football]] [[stadium]] in [[Dugopolje]], near the city of [[Split (city)|Split]] in southern [[Croatia]]. The stadium has a capacity of 5,200 and is home to the [[Druga HNL|second-level]] side [[NK Dugopolje]]. The stadium was officially opened on 22 July 2009, with a friendly game between Dugopolje and [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]].&lt;ref name="24sata"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.24sata.hr/sport/dugopolje-spektakularno-otvorilo-svoj-novi-stadion/127278/|title=Dugopolje spektakularno otvorilo svoj novi stadion|last=Gabelić|first=Tomislav|date=22 July 2009|publisher=[[24 sata (Croatia)|24 sata]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's construction cost was 55 million [[Croatian kuna|kuna]]&lt;ref name="slobodna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Nogomet/tabid/84/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/28135/Default.aspx|title=U Dugopolju stadion prema uvjetima UEFA-e|last=Boban|first=Vesna|date=1 November 2008|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of a larger sports complex which includes club's administration buildings, several swimming pools and tennis courts.&lt;ref name="slobodna"/&gt;

In June 2009 the stadium was visited by [[UEFA]]'s stadium licensing inspection which gave it high marks, and approved the stadium to be used for European matches.&lt;ref name="slobodna2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Nogomet/tabid/84/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/57205/Default.aspx|title=UEFA oduševljena stadionom u Dugopolju|date=5 June 2009|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was confirmed in May 2010 that [[HNK Šibenik]], Croatian top-level side which had secured their European debut at the end of the [[2009–10 Prva HNL|2009–10 season]], will host their European matches in the following season at Dugopolje's ground, since their own [[Stadion Šubićevac]] did not meet UEFA licensing requirements.&lt;ref name="dulibic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportnet.hr/vijesti/396817/nogomet-1-hnl/dulibic-idemo-u-europu-u-dugopolje|title=Dulibić: "Idemo u Europu u Dugopolje"|last=Jurica|first=Ivana|date=9 May 2010|publisher=[[Sportnet.hr]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Summer Olympic Games''' ({{lang-fr|Jeux olympiques d'été}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://franceintheus.org/spip.php?article3788|title=Even in London, French is mandatory at the Olympics|publisher=''[[Embassy of France, Washington, D.C.]]''|date=8 August 2012|access-date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Games of the Olympiad''', first held in 1896, is a quadrennial international [[multi-sport event]]. The [[2016 Summer Olympics|most recent Olympics]] were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) organises the Games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each Olympic event, [[gold medal]]s are awarded for first place, [[silver medal|silver medals]] are awarded for second place, and [[bronze medal|bronze medals]] are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] were created due to the success of the Summer Olympics.

The Olympics have increased in scope from a 42-event competition with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]].

The Summer Olympics has been hosted on five continents by a total of nineteen countries. The [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] has hosted the Games four times (in [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]], [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]]); this is more times than any other nation. The Games have been held three times in [[Great Britain at the Olympics|the United Kingdom]] (in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]); twice each in [[Greece at the Olympics|Greece]] ([[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]), [[France at the Olympics|France]] ([[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]), [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]] ([[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]) and [[Australia at the Olympics|Australia]] ([[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]); and once each in [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] ([[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]]), [[Belgium at the Olympics|Belgium]] ([[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]), [[Netherlands at the Olympics|Netherlands]] ([[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]), [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] ([[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]]), [[Italy at the Olympics|Italy]] ([[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]]), [[Japan at the Olympics|Japan]] ([[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]), [[Mexico at the Olympics|Mexico]] ([[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]), [[Canada at the Olympics|Canada]] ([[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]]), [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] ([[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]]), [[South Korea at the Olympics|South Korea]] ([[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]), [[Spain at the Olympics|Spain]] ([[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]]), [[China at the Olympics|China]] ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]) and [[Brazil at the Olympics|Brazil]] ([[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]).

The IOC has selected [[Tokyo]], Japan, to host the Summer Olympics for a second time [[2020 Summer Olympics|in 2020]]. The [[2024 Summer Olympics]] will be held in [[Paris]], France, for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city's last Summer Olympics in 1924. The IOC has also selected [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to host its third Summer Games in [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].

To date&lt;!--March 2018--&gt;, only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games – Australia, France, Great Britain, Greece and [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]]. &lt;!--The only country to have won at least one gold medal at every Summer Olympic Games is Great Britain.--&gt; The United States leads the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Summer Olympics|all-time medal table]] for the Summer Olympics.

==Hosting==
[[File:Summer olympics all cities.PNG|thumb|upright=1.8|Map of Summer Olympic Games locations – countries that have hosted one Summer Olympics are shaded green, while countries that have hosted two or more are shaded blue]]
The [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] has hosted the Summer Olympic Games more times than any other nation: the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]] were held in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]; the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] Games were both held in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]; and the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Games]] were held in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028 Games]] in Los Angeles will mark the fifth occasion on which the Summer Games have been hosted by the U.S.

In [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]], the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]] hosted its third Summer Olympic Games in the capital city, [[London]], which became the first city ever to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games three times. The cities of Los Angeles, [[Paris]], and [[Athens]] have each hosted two Summer Olympic Games. [[2024 Summer Olympics|In 2024]], [[France at the Olympics|France]] will host its third Summer Olympic Games in its capital, making Paris the second city ever to have hosted three Summer Olympics. In 2028, Los Angeles will become the third city ever to have hosted the Games three times.

[[Australia at the Olympics|Australia]], France, [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]] and [[Greece at the Olympics|Greece]] have all hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice. The IOC has selected [[Tokyo]], Japan, to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], when it will become the first city outside the Western world to have hosted the Summer Olympics more than once, having already hosted the Games [[1964 Summer Olympics|in 1964]]. The other countries that have hosted the Summer Olympics are [[Belgium at the Olympics|Belgium]], [[Brazil at the Olympics|Brazil]], [[China at the Olympics|China]], [[Canada at the Olympics|Canada]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]], [[Italy at the Olympics|Italy]], [[Mexico at the Olympics|Mexico]], [[Netherlands at the Olympics|Netherlands]], [[South Korea at the Olympics|South Korea]], [[Spain at the Olympics|Spain]], [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], and [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]]; each of these countries has hosted the Summer Games on just one occasion.

[[Asia]] has hosted the Summer Olympics three times, in Tokyo, Japan ([[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]), [[Seoul]], South Korea ([[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]), and [[Beijing]], China ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]); Asia will host the Games for a fourth time in 2020 when Tokyo again becomes host city. Historically, the Summer Olympics has been held predominantly in [[English-speaking countries]] and [[Europe|European nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Kay|title=The Olympics at the Millennium: Power, Politics, and the Games|date=2000|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokyo will be the first city outside these regions to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice; it will also be the largest city ever to have hosted the Games, [[Tokyo#1943–present|having grown considerably since 1964]].

The [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, were the first Summer Olympics to be held in [[South America]] and the first that were held during the local [[winter]] season. The only two countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to have hosted the Summer Olympics have been Australia ([[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]) and Brazil ([[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]). [[Africa]] has yet to host a Summer Olympics.

[[Stockholm]], Sweden, has hosted events at two Summer Olympic Games, having been sole host of the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Games]], and hosting the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] (which they are credited as jointly hosting with [[Melbourne]], Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1956|title=Melbourne / Stockholm 1956|publisher=[[IOC]] |accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands, has also hosted events at two Summer Olympic Games, having been sole host of the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Games]] and previously hosting two of the [[Sailing at the 1920 Summer Olympics|sailing races]] at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], [[Hong Kong]] provided the venues for the [[Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]], which took place in [[Sha Tin New Town|Sha Tin]] and [[Kwu Tung]].

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|The opening ceremony of the first modern Olympic Games in the [[Panathenaic Stadium]]]]
The modern Olympic Games were founded in 1894 when [[Pierre de Coubertin]] sought to promote international understanding through sporting competition. He based his Olympics on the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games]], which had been contested in [[Much Wenlock]] since 1850.&lt;ref name=Wenlock&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Jeffrey |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/features/2004/08/william_penny_brookes.shtml |title=Father of the modern Olympics |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=6 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of de Coubertin's games, held in [[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens in 1896]], attracted just 245 competitors, of whom more than 200 were Greek, and only 14 countries were represented. Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. Female athletes were not allowed to compete, though one woman, [[Stamata Revithi]], ran the marathon course on her own, saying "If the committee doesn't let me compete I will go after them regardless".&lt;ref name=Revithi&gt;{{cite journal | author=Tarasouleas, Athanasios |date=Summer 1993 | title = The Female Spiridon Loues  | journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 11–12 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n3/JOHv1n3e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1896 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, was an international [[multi-sport event]] which was celebrated in [[Athens]], Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the [[Modern era]]. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although [[Greece]] had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. 11 Americans placed first in their events vs. the 10 from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Swifter, Higher, Stronger|last = Macy|first = Sue|publisher = National Geographic|year = 2004|isbn = 0-7922-6667-6|location = Washington D.C, United States|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greece]] was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a French [[pedagogue]] and historian, in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] was also established during this congress.

Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. [[Panathinaiko Stadium]], the first big stadium in the modern world, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.&lt;ref name="Y153"&gt;Young (1996), 153&lt;/ref&gt; The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spiridon Louis]], a water carrier. He won in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds, setting off wild celebrations at the stadium. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four gold medals.

After the Games, de Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures including Greece's [[George I of Greece|King George]] and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. However, the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] were already planned for Paris and, except for the [[1906 Intercalated Games]], the Olympics did not return to Greece until the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

Four years later the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris attracted more than four times as many athletes, including 20 women, who were allowed to officially compete for the first time, in [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|croquet]], [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics|golf]], [[Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics|sailing]], and [[Tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics|tennis]]. The Games were integrated with the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World's Fair]] and lasted over 5 months. It is still disputed which events exactly were ''Olympic'', since few or maybe even none of the events were advertised as such at the time.

[[File:Dorando Pietri 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Dorando Pietri finishes the modern marathon at the current distance]]

Numbers declined for the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States, due in part to the lengthy transatlantic boat trip required of the European competitors, and the integration with the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] [[World's Fair]], which again spread the event out over an extended period. In contrast with Paris 1900, the word ''Olympic'' was used for practically every contest, including those exclusively for school boys or for Irish-Americans.

[[1906 Intercalated Games|A series of smaller games]] were held in Athens in 1906. The IOC does not currently recognise these games as being official Olympic Games, although many historians do. The 1906 Athens games were the first of an alternating series of games to be held in Athens, but the series failed to materialise. The games were more successful than the 1900 and 1904 games, with over 900 athletes competing, and contributed positively to the success of future games.

The [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 London Games]] saw numbers rise again, as well as the first running of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] over its now-standard distance of 42.195&amp;nbsp;km (26 miles 385 yards). The first Olympic Marathon in 1896 (a male-only race) was raced at a distance of 40&amp;nbsp;km (24 miles 85 yards). The new marathon distance was chosen to ensure that the race finished in front of the box occupied by the British royal family. Thus the marathon had been {{convert|40|km|1|abbr=on}} for the first games in 1896, but was subsequently varied by up to {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} due to local conditions such as street and stadium layout. At the six Olympic games between 1900 and 1920, the marathon was raced over six distances.

At the end of the 1908 marathon the Italian runner [[Dorando Pietri]] was first to enter the stadium, but he was clearly in distress, and collapsed of exhaustion before he could complete the event. He was helped over the finish line by concerned race officials, but later he was disqualified and the gold medal was awarded to [[Johnny Hayes|John Hayes]], who had trailed him by around 30 seconds.

The Games continued to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to [[1912 Summer Olympics|Stockholm in 1912]], including the great all-rounder [[Jim Thorpe]], who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, and saw his medals stripped for this breach of [[Amateur sports#Olympics|amateurism]] after complaints from [[Avery Brundage]]. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 years after his death. The Games at Stockholm were the first to fulfill Pierre de Coubertin's original idea. For the first time since the Games started in 1896 were all five inhabited continents represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.

The scheduled [[1916 Summer Olympics]] were cancelled following the onset of [[World War I]].

===Interwar era===
The [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp games]] in war-ravaged Belgium were a subdued affair, but again drew a record number of competitors. This record only stood until 1924, when the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] involved 3,000 competitors, the greatest of whom was Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]]. The "[[Flying Finn]]" won three team gold medals and the individual 1,500 and 5,000 meter runs, the latter two on the same day.

The [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam games]] were notable for being the first games which allowed females to compete at track &amp; field athletics, and benefited greatly from the general prosperity of the times alongside the first appearance of [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of the games, from [[the Coca-Cola Company]]. The 1928 games saw the introduction of a standard medal design with the IOC choosing [[Giuseppe Cassioli]]'s depiction of Greek goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] and a winner being carried by a crowd of people. This design was used up until 1972.

The [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Los Angeles games]] were affected by the [[Great Depression]], which contributed to the low number of competitors (the fewest since the St. Louis games).

The [[1936 Berlin Games]] were seen by the German government as a golden opportunity to promote their ideology. The ruling [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party commissioned film-maker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] to film the games. The result, ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', was widely considered to be a masterpiece, despite [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s theories of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] racial superiority being repeatedly shown up by "non-Aryan" athletes. In particular, African-American sprinter and long jumper [[Jesse Owens]] won four gold medals. The [[1936 Berlin Games]] also saw the reintroduction of the Torch Relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7330949.stm|title=The Olympic torch's shadowy past|publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 August 2008 | date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to World War II, the [[1940 Summer Olympics|Games of 1940]] (due to be held in [[Tokyo]] and temporarily relocated to [[Helsinki]] upon the outbreak of war) were cancelled. The [[1944 Summer Olympics|Games of 1944]] were due to be held in London but were also cancelled; instead, London hosted the first games after the end of the war, in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]].

===After World War II===
The [[1948 Summer Olympics|first post-war Games]] were held in 1948 in London, with both Germany and Japan excluded. Dutch sprinter [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] won four gold medals on the track, emulating Owens' achievement in Berlin.

At the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Games]] in [[Helsinki]] the [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|USSR team]] competed for the first time and immediately became one of the dominant teams (finishing second both in the number of gold and overall medals won). Soviet immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete". The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|USSR]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis, hence violating amateur rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

Having first won both the 10,000 and 5,000 meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other leaders, Zátopek led from about half way, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.

The [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Games]] were largely successful, barring a [[water polo]] match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, which the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] caused to end as [[Blood in the Water match|a pitched battle between the teams]]. Due to a [[foot-and-mouth disease]] outbreak in Britain at the time and the strict quarantine laws of Australia, the equestrian events were held in Stockholm.

At the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]] a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as [[Muhammad Ali]], arrived on the scene. Ali would later throw his gold medal away in disgust after being refused service in a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] restaurant in his home town of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wallechinsky | first=David |author2=Jamie Loucky  | year=2008 | title=The Complete Book of the Olympics, 2008 Edition | publisher=[[Aurum Press]] | isbn=978-1-84513-330-6 | pages=453–454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a new medal 36 years later at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. Other performers of note in 1960 included [[Wilma Rudolph]], a gold medallist in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4 × 100 meters relay events.

The [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] held in Tokyo are notable for heralding the modern age of telecommunications. These games were the first to be broadcast worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites. The 1964 Games were thus a turning point in the global visibility and popularity of the Olympics. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka [[Anton Geesink]] created quite a stir when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating [[Akio Kaminaga]] in front of his home crowd.

Performances at the 1968 [[Mexico City]] [[1968 Summer Olympics|games]] were affected by the altitude of the host city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1968 |title=Games of the XIX Olympiad |work=olympic.org |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the long jump, in which American athlete [[Bob Beamon]] jumped 8.90 meters. Beamon's world record would stand for 23 years. The 1968 Games also introduced the now-universal [[Fosbury flop]], a technique which won American high jumper [[Dick Fosbury]] the gold medal. Politics took center stage in the medal ceremony for the men's 200 meter dash, where [[Tommie C. Smith|Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] made [[1968 Olympics Power to the People salute|a protest gesture]] on the podium against the segregation in the United States; their political act was condemned within the Olympic Movement, but was praised in the [[Black Power movement]].
[[Věra Čáslavská]], in protest to the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people, but was made an outcast by the Soviet dominated government.

Politics again intervened at [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]] in 1972, with [[Munich massacre|lethal consequences]]. A Palestinian terrorist group named [[Black September (group)|Black September]] invaded the Olympic village and broke into the apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held 9 others as hostages. The terrorists demanded that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused their demand, a tense stand-off ensued while negotiations continued. Eventually the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the firefight that followed, 15 people, including the nine Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists, were killed. After much debate, it was decided that the Games would continue, but proceedings were obviously dominated by these events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1972 |title=Games of the XX Olympiad |work=olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer [[Mark Spitz]], [[Lasse Virén]] (of Finland)'s back-to-back gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters (defeating American distance running great [[Steve Prefontaine]] in the former), and the winning of three gold medals by 16-year-old Soviet gymnastic sensation [[Olga Korbut]] - who thrilled the world with an historic backflip off the high bar. Korbut, however, failed to win the all-around, losing to her teammate [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]].

There was no such tragedy in [[Montreal]] in 1976, but bad planning and fraud led to the Games' cost far exceeding the budget. [[1976 Summer Olympics|The Montreal Games]] were the most expensive in Olympic history, until the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], costing over $5&amp;nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|CA|5|1976|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|CA}}). For a time, it seemed that the Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, the belief that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, may have contributed to the delays, poor construction and excessive costs. In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia "was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial."&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Stephen;(April 2009).Ice: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada. p.551. {{ISBN|0-470-83500-1}}:&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a boycott by African nations to protest against [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|a recent tour]] of [[apartheid]]-run South Africa by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]]. The Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Comăneci]] won the women's individual all-around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores, this giving birth to a gymnastics dynasty in [[Romania]]. She also won two other individual events, with two perfect scores in the balance beam and all perfect scores in the uneven bars. [[Lasse Virén]] repeated his double gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, making him the first athlete to ever win the distance double twice.&lt;!--

===End of the 20th century===
Following the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], 66 nations, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan, boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 games]] held in Moscow. Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games – the smallest number since 1956. The boycott contributed to the 1980 Games being a less publicised and less competitive affair, which was dominated by the host country.

In 1984 the Soviet Union and 13 Soviet allies reciprocated by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. [[Romania]], notably, was one of the nations in the Eastern Bloc that did attend the 1984 Olympics. These games were perhaps the first games of a new era to make a profit. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Tidningsref|title=NO BOYCOTT BLUES|url=https://www.olympic.org/los-angeles-1984|website=olympic.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, without the participation of the Eastern European countries, the 1984 Games were dominated by their host country. The Games were also the first time mainland China (People's Republic) participated.

According to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were "rescued with [these] tremendous efforts".&lt;ref name=DG2011&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 0292739575 |page= 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said "There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games."&lt;ref name= DG2011 /&gt;

Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.&lt;ref name=NYT160813&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html |title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to ’84 Olympics |last=Ruiz |first=Rebecca R. |date= 13 August 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2016-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=NYT160813/&gt;

The [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 games]], in [[Seoul]], were very well planned but the games were tainted when many of the athletes, most notably men's 100 metres winner [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]], failed mandatory [[drug test]]s. Despite splendid drug-free performances by many individuals, the number of people who failed screenings for performance-enhancing chemicals overshadowed the games.

The [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Games]] featured the admittance of players from one of the North American top leagues, the NBA, exemplified by but not limited to US basketball's "[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]". The 1992 games also saw the reintroduction to the Games of several smaller European states which had been incorporated into the Soviet Union since World War II. These games also saw gymnast [[Vitaly Scherbo]] equal the record for most individual gold medals at a single Games set by [[Eric Heiden]] in the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Winter Games]], with five.

By then the process of choosing a location for the Games had itself become a commercial concern; there were widespread allegations of corruption potentially affecting the IOC's decision process. 

In the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta games]] in 1996, the highlight was [[200 meters]] runner [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] annihilating the world record in front of a home crowd. Canadians savored [[Donovan Bailey]]'s recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when [[Muhammad Ali]], clearly affected by [[Parkinson's disease]], lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place not at the boxing ring but in the basketball arena, at the demand of US television. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb exploded]] during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], was arrested.

[[File:Sydney olympic stadium track and field.jpg|left|thumb|The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney, Australia, known as the "Games of the New Millennium".]]

The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] were held in Sydney, Australia, and showcased individual performances by local favorite [[Ian Thorpe]] in the pool, Briton [[Steve Redgrave]] who won a rowing gold medal in an unprecedented fifth consecutive Olympics, and [[Cathy Freeman]], an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] whose triumph in the [[400 meters]] united a packed stadium. [[Eric Moussambani|Eric "the Eel" Moussambani]], a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, received wide media coverage when he completed the 100 meter freestyle swim in by far the slowest time in Olympic history. He nevertheless won the heat as both his opponents had been disqualified for false starts. His female compatriot [[Paula Barila Bolopa]] also received media attention for her record-slow and struggling but courageous performance. The Sydney Games also saw the first appearance of a joint North and South Korean contingent at the opening ceremonies, though they competed as different countries. Controversy occurred in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics, when the vaulting horse was set to the wrong height during the All Around Competition. Several athletes faltered, including [[Russians|Russian]] [[Svetlana Khorkina]], who had been favored to win gold after qualifying for the competition in first place.

===Start of the 21st century===
In [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]] the Games returned to their birthplace in [[Athens]], Greece. Greece spent at least $7.2&amp;nbsp;billion on the Games, including $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion on security. Michael Phelps won his first medals in Olympic Games tallying 6 gold and 2 bronze medals. Pyrros Dimas, winning a bronze medal, became the most decorated weightlifter of all time with 3 golds and 1 bronze in Olympic Games. Although unfounded reports of potential terrorism drove crowds away from the preliminary competitions of the first weekend of the games (14–15 August), attendance picked up as the games progressed. A third of the tickets failed to sell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2008-07-28-olympics-tickets_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Tickets to Olympic events in Beijing sold out | date=28 July 2008 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ticket sales still topped figures from Seoul and Barcelona Olympics.{{fact|date=October 2017}} IOC President Jacques Rogge characterised Greece's organisation as outstanding and its security precautions as flawless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/3609818.stm | publisher=BBC | title=Rogge hails Athens success | date=29 August 2004 | accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Athens Games witnessed all 202 NOCs participate with over 11,000 participants.

The [[2008 Summer Olympics]] were held in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Several new events were held, including the new discipline of [[BMX]] for both men and women. For the first time, women competed in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]]. The fencing program was expanded to include all six events for both men and women. Women had not previously been able to compete in team foil or saber events, although women's team épée and men's team foil were dropped for these Games. Marathon swimming events, over the distance of {{convert|10|km|1|abbr=on}}, were added. In addition, the doubles events in table tennis were replaced by team events.&lt;ref name=2008program&gt;{{cite news |url = http://olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=1797 |title = Beijing 2008: Games program Finalized |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date = 27 April 2006 |accessdate =10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; American swimmer [[Michael Phelps]] set a record for gold medals at a single Games with eight, and tied the record of most gold medals by a single competitor previously held by both Heiden and Scherbo. Another major star of the Games was Jamaican sprinter [[Usain Bolt]], who became the first male athlete ever to set world records in the finals of both the 100 and 200&amp;nbsp;metres in the same Games. Equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.

London held the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], becoming the first city to host the Games three times. In his closing address Jacques Rogge described the Games as "Happy and Glorious". The host nation won 29 gold medals, the best haul for Great Britain since the 1908 Games in London. The United States returned to the top of the medal table after China dominated in 2008. The IOC had removed [[baseball]] and [[softball]] from the 2012 program. On a commercial level the Games were successful as they were the first in history to completely sell out every ticket, with as many as 1 million applications for 40,000 tickets for both the Opening Ceremony and the 100m Men's Sprint Final. Such was the demand for tickets to all levels of each event, there was controversy when seats set aside for sponsors and National Delegations went unused in the early days. A system of reallocation was put in place so the empty seats were filled throughout the Games.

[[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil hosted the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], becoming the third city in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to host the Olympic Games after Melbourne, Australia, in 1956 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000, and the first South American city to host the Olympics. The preparation for these Games was overshadowed by [[Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics|controversies]], including the instability of Brazil's federal government; the country's economic crisis; health and safety concerns surrounding the [[Zika virus]] and significant pollution in the [[Guanabara Bay]]; and a [[Doping in Russia|state-sponsored doping scandal]] involving [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]], which affected the participation of its athletes in the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8282518.stm |title=BBC SPORT, Olympics, Rio to stage 2016 Olympic Games |publisher=BBC News |date=2 October 2009|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokyo]], Japan will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], making it the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.

==Sports==
{{Main article|Olympic sports}}
Forty-two sports, spanning 55 disciplines, have been part of the Olympic program at one point or another. Twenty-eight sports have comprised the schedule for three of the recent games, [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], and [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Due to the removal of baseball and softball, there was a total of twenty-six sports in the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Games]].&lt;ref name=26sports&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4658925.stm | title = Fewer sports for London Olympics |work=BBC Sport  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | date = 8 July 2005 | accessdate =5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various Olympic Sports federations are grouped under a common umbrella association, called the [[Association of Summer Olympic International Federations]] (ASOIF).

===Qualification===
Qualification rules for each of the Olympic sports are set by the [[sport governing body|International Sports Federation]] (IF) that governs that sport's international competition.&lt;ref name="olympians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Commissions/Athletes-Commission/Olympians/|title=Olympians|work=Olympic.org|publisher=[[IOC]]|access-date=21 June 2010|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616053715/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Commissions/Athletes-Commission/Olympians/|archivedate=16 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individual sports, competitors typically qualify by attaining a certain place in a major international event or on the IF's ranking list. There is a general rule that a maximum of three individual athletes may represent each nation per competition. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) may enter a limited number of qualified competitors in each event, and the NOC decides which qualified competitors to select as representatives in each event if more have attained the benchmark than can be entered.&lt;ref name="olympians"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Governance/National-Olympic-Committees/|title=National Olympic Committees (NOCs)|work=Olympic.org|publisher=[[IOC]]|access-date=21 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074558/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Governance/National-Olympic-Committees/|archivedate=15 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations most often qualify teams for team sports through continental qualifying tournaments, in which each continental association is given a certain number of spots in the Olympic tournament. Each nation may be represented by no more than one team per competition; a team consists of just two people in some sports.

===Popularity of Olympic sports===
Summer Olympic sports are divided into five categories (A – E) based on popularity, gauged by six criteria: television viewing figures (40%), internet popularity (20%), public surveys (15%), ticket requests (10%), press coverage (10%), and number of national federations (5%). The category of a sport determines the share of Olympic revenue received by that sport's International Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Athletics to share limelight as one of top Olympic sports |url=http://www.qt.com.au/news/atheltics-share-limelight-one-top-olympic-sports/1889097/ |newspaper=The Queensland Times |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Winners Include Gymnastics, Swimming - and Wrestling - as IOC Announces New Funding Distribution Groupings  | work=The Association of Summer Olympic International Federations | url=http://asoif.com/News/News_Article.aspx?ID=3392  | accessdate=2013-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports that were new to the 2016 Olympics (rugby and golf) have been placed in Category E.

[[File:2002 Austrian GP.jpg|thumb|A team order at the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix|2002 Austrian GP]]. [[Rubens Barrichello]]'s #2 status at Ferrari was made obvious after he moved over to let [[Michael Schumacher]] win just a few metres before the finish line.]]

In [[motor racing]], '''team orders''' is a [[motorsport]] term for the practice of teams issuing instructions to drivers to deviate from the normal practice of racing against each other as they would against other teams' drivers. This can be accomplished either in advance, simply by establishing a [[pecking order]] between the two drivers within the team, or instructing a driver to let his teammate overtake or to hold position without the risk of collision.

This is generally done when one driver is behind in a particular race but ahead overall in a championship season. The team will then order their drivers to rearrange themselves on the track so as to give more championship points to the driver who is ahead in the championship. Another reason for team orders is where both drivers are in a position far ahead of the field, being all but assured of the win. Team orders are issued to prevent the drivers from racing each other; the aim is to have them drive cautiously to save fuel, reduce the chance of mechanical problems, and avoid a collision. This has happened on countless occasions in the history of the sport, sometimes causing great acrimony between the team and the second-placed driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rivalry-fuels-mcrae-in-his-title-pursuit-1537135.html|title=Rivalry fuels McRae in his title pursuit|date=3 November 1995|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team orders in Formula One==
Such orders were legal and accepted historically in motor racing.  In the early years of the [[Formula One World Championship]], it was even legal for a driver to give up his car during the race to the team leader if the latter's car had broken down.  In 1955, the Mercedes team asked Juan Manuel Fangio to let his teammate [[Stirling Moss]] win his home Grand Prix at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].  Fangio obliged, refusing to attack Moss in the closing stages of the race, and came home in second place, less than a second behind Moss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/automobiles/excerpt-fangio-mercedes-benz.html|title=Excerpt: ‘Fangio &amp; Mercedes-Benz’|first=Hartmut|last=Lehbrink|date=7 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[1964 Formula One season|1964 season]] saw a dramatic finale in which [[Lorenzo Bandini]] moved over to [[John Surtees]] during the [[1964 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]], allowing Surtees to get the necessary points to beat [[Graham Hill]] to the World Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr131.html|title=Grandprix.com|first=Grandprix.com - First &amp; fastest: The original online F1 news|last=service|website=www.grandprix.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1979 German Grand Prix]] [[Clay Regazzoni]] was instructed by the Williams pits not to attack his teammate [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] for the lead, despite Regazzoni being ahead in the championship.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Bounay and Clay Regazzoni, Le Combat, Solar, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The status of Jones as number one driver at Williams lasted until 1981, when [[Carlos Reutemann]] deliberately ignored team orders at the [[1981 Brazilian Grand Prix]] and did not allow him to pass. This resulted in a long feud between the two that eventually led to Jones' retirement at the end of the season, with Reutemann missing on the World Championship for one single point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://f1greatestdrivers.autosport.com/?driver=34|title=Formula 1's Greatest Drivers - AUTOSPORT.com - Carlos Reutemann|website=f1greatestdrivers.autosport.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 [[René Arnoux]] enraged [[Renault]] by refusing to give way to his teammate [[Alain Prost]] at the [[1982 French Grand Prix]], who at the time was ahead in the championship;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr368.html|title=Grandprix.com|first=Grandprix.com - First &amp; fastest: The original online F1 news|last=service|website=www.grandprix.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those three points had no impact, as Prost ended up losing the 1982 championship to Keke Rosberg by ten points and even ranking fourth.

During the [[1983 South African Grand Prix]], the [[Brabham|Brabham-BMW]] team asked driver [[Riccardo Patrese]] to cede [[Nelson Piquet]] the race win if it ensured Piquet would win the driver's championship. However, this did not prove to be necessary as Patrese won the race while Piquet clinched a third place, sufficient to secure him the championship.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN coverage of the South African Grand Prix. Patrese was asked "If there was a situation where you had to give up the victory for Nelson to win the championship, what would you have done?", Patrese's response was "Yes, that was already planned. ... Nelson started with less fuel and my role was to slow the field to give him a big lead." Available on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrese found himself in a similar situation again in 1992, when he blatantly waved his Williams teammate Nigel Mansell around him during the [[1992 French Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19920707&amp;id=8pVUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3775,2806090|title=New Straits Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, at the [[1991 Japanese Grand Prix]], Ayrton Senna was already world champion and conceded the victory to [[Gerhard Berger]], saying after the race that he had given the 1st place to Berger because "he had been very helpful".

In the late 1990s incidents of team orders began to be reported more prominently by the media. Public reaction to the more blatant examples of their use became extremely negative. In the [[1997 European Grand Prix]], [[Jacques Villeneuve]], already with the title in the bag (after the controversial collision with Michael Schumacher, which Villeneuve's Williams survived), was asked by his engineer via radio to let the [[McLaren]] cars pass as "They've been very helpful",&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Collings, The Piranha Club: Power and Influence in Formula One, Virgin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; while at the [[1998 Australian Grand Prix]], the McLaren drivers [[David Coulthard]] and [[Mika Häkkinen]] caused a stir by switching position at the end of the race in order to respect a previous agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHd8n1D4wkM&amp;noredirect=1|title=David Coulthard allows Mika Hakkinen|first=|last=AzeemClark|date=20 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[1997 Japanese Grand Prix]] saw a more sophisticated use of team orders, where [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Eddie Irvine]] began the race light on fuel, allowing him to get ahead of the superior [[Williams-Renault]] cars and hold them up, to the benefit of teammate [[Michael Schumacher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasf1.com/97/jpn/gordon2.html|title=Japanese Grand Prix Review|website=www.atlasf1.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix]], the two Jordans of [[Damon Hill]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]] found themselves unexpectedly in the lead after a collision between Michael Schumacher and David Coulthard. Ralf Schumacher was subsequently ordered not to overtake Hill, to assure [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] of a 1-2 finish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Driving Ambition - A Season with Eddie Jordan |series=1|date=1999-03-02 |network=ITV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1999 German Grand Prix]], [[Mika Salo]], driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in place of injured [[Michael Schumacher]], was leading the race when he was told to allow teammate [[Eddie Irvine]] to pass. Salo complied, giving up what would have been his only Formula One victory in 109 career races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/99/ger/lupini.html|title=German Grand Prix Review|website=www.autosport.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]], [[Rubens Barrichello]] was ordered to allow [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] teammate [[Michael Schumacher]] to pass to obtain the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Barrichello Admits Team Orders |publisher=www.gpupdate.net |date=2008-11-25 |url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/203773/barrichello-admits-ferrari-team-orders/|accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This received huge amounts of negative attention from the media, as the order was issued shortly before both drivers crossed the finish line. Both drivers were unhappy about the situation. Schumacher refused to take the top step of the podium and the centre seat, normally reserved to the winner, during the post-race press conference, and the team was punished for breach of podium procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official FIA Press Release - The 2002 Austrian Grand Prix |publisher=www.fia.com |date=2002-06-26 |url=http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/The_FIA/2002/260602-01.html |accessdate=2006-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017081855/http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/The_FIA/2002/260602-01.html |archivedate=2006-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2002 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] the very same year, Schumacher appeared to have returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by the record smallest margin of 0.011 seconds on the finishing line, though it is assumed Schumacher was trying to trigger a [[Dead heat|dead-heat finish]].

{{Quote box

Barrichello said "To win, it was very, very, very good.... I got to the last corner, I didn't know what to do and nothing has been said. Michael was just very kind to, you know, let us finish equally. I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?" Schumacher said "The end of the race was not planned. We tried to cross the line together but failed by a tiny bit and in fact we did not know who had won until we got out of the cars. I just felt Rubens deserved to win this race."}}

After the 2002 season, FIA announced that "Team Orders that could influence the outcome of a race" were banned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/07images/f1/fia/033007_2008_F1_SPORTING_REGULATIONS.pdf|title=2008 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were sometimes still implemented discreetly. For example, this has sometimes been achieved as easily as a team getting on the radio to the slower driver and pointing out that his teammate is quicker. The slower driver then lets the quicker driver through without the need for an overt "directive" from the team.&lt;ref name="alonso_massa_2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8852780.stm|title=Alonso secures controversial win|date=26 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened, for example, at the [[2010 Turkish Grand Prix]], where [[Mark Webber]] was asked to slow down when his [[Red Bull]] teammate [[Sebastian Vettel]] was closing in. Webber disregarded the order, and the pair collided, each refusing to accept blame for the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/30/mark-webber-sebastian-vettel-turkish-grand-prix|title=Mark Webber furious after 'disaster' crash with Sebastian Vettel|first=Paul|last=Weaver|date=30 May 2010|website=the Guardian|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, at the [[2010 German Grand Prix]], [[Felipe Massa]]'s race engineer [[Rob Smedley]] was heard to say to his driver "[[Fernando Alonso|Fernando (Alonso)]] is faster than you. Can you confirm you understand that message?". Moments later, Massa eased back and allowed Alonso past.&lt;ref name="alonso_massa_2010"/&gt;

At the end of the season, the FIA conceded that the team orders rule was not working and needed to be reviewed. As of 2011, the team orders rule no longer appeared in the sporting regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/9A195FD4A47DA4E1C12577F8004AA63E/$FILE/1-2011%20SPORTING%20REGULATIONS%2010-12-2010.pdf|title=2010 Formula One Sporting Regulations|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2012 United States Grand Prix]], Ferrari broke the FIA seal on the gearbox of Felipe Massa's car to trigger a 5 place grid penalty, to move him behind Fernando Alonso, and move both cars onto the "clean" side of the race track, to ensure Alonso the fastest start possible on the slippery asphalt on the brand new [[Circuit of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/104364|title=United States GP: Ferrari incurs penalty for Massa to boost Alonso|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2013 Malaysian Grand Prix]], Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel was criticised for passing his team-mate Mark Webber to win the race against "Multi 21", an order from his team to hold position.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/21917254 |title=Sebastian Vettel in Mark Webber apology after Malaysia win |date=24 March 2013 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2017 Hungarian Grand Prix]], the Mercedes team ordered [[Valtteri Bottas]] to yield his third position for [[Lewis Hamilton]], who had better chance to attack second-placed [[Kimi Räikkönen]]. When it was clear that Hamilton was not able to overcome Räikkönen, Hamilton gave back the position to Bottas in the last corner of the race, costing him three points in the Drivers' Championship. Those three points did not matter in the end, as Hamilton clinched the title in [[2017 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]] after surviving a turn three incident on the opening lap with title rival Sebastian Vettel.

In the [[2018 Russian Grand Prix]], Valtteri Bottas qualified for pole position and subsequently led the race until the Mercedes cars team ordered him to yield the lead position to Lewis Hamilton, who was ahead in the Drivers' Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.opinion-why-mercedes-used-team-orders-and-why-they-were-right-to-do-so.1VZaX1iWz284gcGia6mmC6.html|title=OPINION: Why Mercedes used team orders – and why they were right to do so|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perhaps the most controversial use of team orders was the [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix]], where the [[Renault F1]] team used team orders to cause [[Nelson Piquet, Jr]] [[Renault Formula One crash controversy|to crash deliberately]] on the fourteenth lap of the race so safety car could be triggered, to allow teammate Alonso to win the race.  Similar team orders came into play in the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400]] at Richmond in the final race of the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series' regular season, when [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] driver [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] was aided by the spin of teammate [[Clint Bowyer]] and a slow pit stop for [[Richard Childress Racing]] driver [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] to overtake Newman for the second Chase wild card spot; further team orders between [[Front Row Motorsports]] and [[Penske Racing]] saw Penske driver [[Joey Logano]] take the final guaranteed spot in the Chase over [[Jeff Gordon]], whose [[Hendrick Motorsports]] teammate [[Kasey Kahne]] had already clinched the first wild card ahead of the race.

== Team orders in NASCAR ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Team orders became a serious issue during the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400]] on 7 September 2013, when [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400#Race manipulation controversy|an elaborate scheme]] involving the last race of the regular season before the [[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Sprint Cup]] erupted, causing officials to make serious rule changes.

With five teams involved in the race for the final two regular and both wild card slots -- [[Richard Childress Racing]] satellite [[Furniture Row Racing]], [[Hendrick Motorsports]] and its respective satellite [[Stewart-Haas Racing]], [[Michael Waltrip Racing]], and [[Penske Racing]]—for the ten-race playoff, an elaborate scheme erupted in the waning stages of the race.

[[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] (Stewart-Haas) was leading the race with less than ten laps remaining, and the standings had [[Kurt Busch]] (Furniture Row) in ninth, [[Jeff Gordon]] (Hendrick) in tenth by two points, with the two wild cards being [[Kasey Kahne]] (Hendrick) and Newman, both of which would have two race wins.  This would shut out [[Joey Logano]] (Penske), who was in the top ten prior to the race but struggling and now trailing Gordon by two points, and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] (Michael Waltrip), who also has one win.

Logano, down two laps, talked with fellow Ford team [[Front Row Motorsports]] driver [[David Gilliland]] about allowing Logano to pass him to gain points, as he was two points behind Gordon for tenth place in the points.  With Newman leading, Logano had to be in tenth or Logano would be out of a Chase position. Truex's teammate [[Clint Bowyer]] intentionally spun and caused a caution in an effort to assist his teammate.  Ensuing pit stops knocked Newman to third. Logano, who was two laps behind, did not pit and was able to advance ahead one lap as the leader must be the first car on the restart.

In order to allow the team orders for Michael Waltrip Racing to succeed, the elaborate scheme, which was independent of each other, took place. Bowyer pitted after the restart to go down laps in order to allow Logano to have one point, and teammate [[Brian Vickers]] did the same thing, and go very slow in the final lap, possibly below NASCAR's minimum speed requirement. This would allow Logano to pass Gordon, who without a win loses a tiebreaker to Logano. Logano then passes Gilliland. Truex races hard and ties Newman, tying Newman on the first count (most wins, one), and the second count (points), winning the third count (most second-place finishes).

Such penalties may include but are limited to disqualification and/or loss of finishing points and/or fines and/or loss of points and/or suspension and/or probation to any and all members of the teams, including any beneficiaries of the prohibited actions.
'Artificially altered' shall be defined as actions by any competitor that show or suggest that the competitor did not race at 100 percent of their ability for the purpose of changing finishing positions in the event at NASCAR's sole discretion."
|source= Section 12, Rule 4, Article L in the current NASCAR rule book }}

Immediately after the race, the ESPN television broadcast aired Bowyer's radio transmission in the laps leading to the safety car situation, before signing off the broadcast. This led to an immediate investigation where NASCAR uncovered via team radios the complex team orders scheme, suspending Michael Waltrip Racing officials, stripping Truex of his playoff position, a $100,000 fine per car on the team, and a 50-point penalty each on all three teams (driver and owner except the #55 of Vickers, a Nationwide Series driver ineligible for Sprint Cup points, which was penalised as owner only). Probations were assessed on Front Row and Penske teams after NASCAR uncovered the radio chatter for that team orders scheme. Gordon and Newman were each reinstated to the twelve-car playoff, which increased to thirteen after Gordon was added.

A complex series of rules were announced on 14 September 2013 by NASCAR to prevent such team orders from taking place. Among the rules to prevent team orders include different teams on the spotter's stand brokering deals in exchange for the concession of a position, private team communication that cannot be detected by officials on digital radios (teams must use analog channels that can be accessed by spectators at the circuit, audio and visual media broadcasts, and officials - in previous years some teams had scrambled signals), and a limit of one spotter per spotter's stand at the circuit. At circuits where there are multiple spotters' stands used (mainly the road courses and [[Talladega Superspeedway]]), the rule will only limit one spotter to being in each post (there are often multiple posts at road courses and Talladega because it is impossible for the entire track to be seen by one spotter). NASCAR will also mandate a video camera on the stand, which will observe radio chatter among spotters (networks may install a camera on the spotter's stand for broadcast positioning also).

NASCAR also added Section 12, Rule 4, Article L in the NASCAR rule book, with the rule indirectly referencing a ban on team orders.

In [[gridiron football]], a '''turnover''' occurs when the team with the ball loses possession of the ball without kicking it, which is then gained by the other team. In [[American football]], the two events that are officially classified as "turnovers" are [[fumble]]s (accidental physical loss of a live ball a player has possession of) or [[interception]]s (passes intended for a member of the passing team, but caught by a member of the opposing team).

In addition, the term "turnover" is often used to refer to a [[turnover on downs]], when a team attempts to gain a [[first down]], [[touchdown]] or [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] on a fourth down play (known as a [[fourth down conversion]]), but is unsuccessful. When this occurs, the opposing team automatically gains possession at the spot to which the ball was advanced at the end of the play, unless a [[penalty (American football)|penalty]] has occurred (every defensive penalty, if accepted, results either in an automatic first down or a replay of down). In this event, the team that has lost possession is not permitted an opportunity to advance the ball any further.

[[National Football League]] game statistics recording turnovers only include lost fumbles and intercepted passes; turnovers on downs are not included (e.g., a team whose only turnovers are turnovers on downs is credited with having "no turnovers").

In [[Canadian football]], turnovers generally occur in a similar manner to American football, except that a turnover on downs will occur after three downs instead of four. In addition, [[Canadian Football League]] statistics record turnovers on downs on an equal basis to turnovers caused by fumbles and interceptions.
