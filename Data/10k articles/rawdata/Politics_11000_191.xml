The '''Fascist International Congress''' was a meeting held by deputies from a number of [[Europe]]an [[Fascism|Fascist]] organizations. The conference was held on 16–17 December 1934 in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]]. The conference was organised and chaired by ''Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalità di Roma'' ('''CAUR'''), or the [[Action Committees for the Universality of Rome]].

==Background==
CAUR was a network founded in 1933 by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian fascism|Fascist Regime]]. CAUR's director was [[Eugenio Coselschi]], and its stated goal was to act as a network for a "Fascist International"&lt;ref name="Stanley G page 105"&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne|Payne, Stanley G.]] "Fascist Italy and Spain, 1922–1945". ''Spain and the Mediterranean Since 1898'', Raanan Rein, ed. page 105. London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Major obstacles arose in the organisation's attempt to identify a "universal fascism" and the criteria that an organisation must fulfil in order to qualify as "fascist".&lt;ref name="Stanley G page 105"/&gt; Nevertheless, by April 1934 the network had identified "fascist" movements in 39 countries, including all European countries except [[Yugoslavia]], as well as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], five countries in [[Asia]] and six in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Stanley G page 105"/&gt; As different groups tried to obtain subsidies all manners of conflicts arose on issues such as [[racism]], [[anti-Semitism]], [[corporatism]] and state structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne|Payne, Stanley G.]] "Fascist Italy and Spain, 1922–1945". ''Spain and the Mediterranean Since 1898'', Raanan Rein, ed. page 105.
London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==

[[File:Conferenza di Montreux.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Countries of Origin for Montreux Conference Participants.]]

The first world conference of the CAUR convened at Montreux on 16 December. Participants from fascist organisations in 13 European countries attended, including [[Ion Moța]] of [[Romania|Romania's]] [[Iron Guard]], [[Vidkun Quisling]] of [[Norway|Norway's]] [[Nasjonal Samling]], [[George S. Mercouris]] of the [[Greek National Socialist Party]], [[Ernesto Giménez Caballero]] of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]] movement, [[Eoin O'Duffy]] of the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Blueshirts]], [[Marcel Bucard]] of the [[France|French]] ''[[Mouvement Franciste]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, John.

''The Nature of Fascism'' St. Martin's Press, New York. 1991, page 121&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Acção Escolar Vanguarda]] (''Vanguard School'' Action) and [[União Nacional]] of [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]], were headed by [[António Eça de Queiroz]] (son of [[Eça de Queiroz|the famous writer]], and future head of the Emissora Nacional, the National Radio Station of Portugal),&lt;ref&gt;Cordeiro, Filipe. [http://www.angelfire.com/pq/unica/forum_arquivo_1_ns_en.htm Nacional Sindicalismo / Estado Novo / ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115012343/http://www.angelfire.com/pq/unica/forum_arquivo_1_ns_en.htm |date=2009-01-15 }}. Unica Semper Avis, website of the Causa Real (federation of Portuguese Monarchist associations), 18 October 2001 09:58:07 PM&lt;/ref&gt; as well as delegates from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Notable in their absence were any representatives from [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,754480,00.html Pax Romanizing]". TIME Magazine, 31 December 1934&lt;/ref&gt; The conference in Montreux occurred only six months after the assassination of the [[Austrofascist]] Austrian chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] by [[Nazi]] agents and the resulting diplomatic [[Benito Mussolini#Rome-Berlin relations|crisis]] between [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. Likewise, Mussolini did not allow any official representative of the Italian [[Fascist Party]] to attend the meeting, ostensibly in order to see what the conference could achieve before lending full official support.&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"/&gt; [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], while allowing members of the [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]] to participate, stated that the Falange as an organisation would not be represented, as the ''CAUR'' was "not a Fascist movement".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne|Payne, Stanley G.]] "Fascist Italy and Spain, 1922–1945". ''Spain and the Mediterranean Since 1898'', Raanan Rein, ed. page 106. London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable absences included the Austrian [[Ernst Rudiger von Starhemberg]] and any representatives from the [[British Union of Fascists]].&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"/&gt;

==Proceedings==
From the outset, the conference was marred by serious conflicts between the participants. Coselschi, acting as President of the Conference, clashed with Quisling over the importance of [[Nazi Germany]] to international fascism.&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"/&gt; Moța, supported by the Danish and Swiss delegates, likewise created a rift by underlining the centrality of anti-Semitism to fascist movements, a move opposed by Coselschi and O'Duffy.&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"/&gt; The Romanian Iron Guard stressed the need for race to be an integral component of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Philip. ''Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945''. London, UK; New York, USA: Routledge, 2003. Pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the matter of anti-Semitism, several compromise resolutions were adopted. These declared that "the [[Jewish question]] cannot be converted into a universal campaign of hatred against the Jews" while also stating, "Considering that in many places certain groups of Jews are installed in conquered countries, exercising in an open and occult manner an influence injurious to the material and moral interests of the country which harbors them, constituting a sort of state within a state, profiting by all benefits and refusing all duties, considering that they have furnished and are inclined to furnish, elements conducive to international revolution which would be destructive to the idea of patriotism and Christian civilisation, the Conference denounces the nefarious action of these elements and is ready to combat them.".&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"/&gt;

The delegates at the conference also unanimously declared their opposition to [[communist]] movements and the [[Third International]].&lt;ref name="Pax Romanizing"/&gt;

==Results==
A second and final conference was held in Montreux in April 1935. José Antonio Primo de Rivera made a brief appearance at this conference, using the opportunity to express sympathies with the movement while stating that Spain was not ready to participate in any venture of international fascism because his movement was ''estrictamente nacional'' (strictly national).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne|Payne, Stanley G.]] "Fascist Italy and Spain, 1922–1945". ''Spain and the Mediterranean Since 1898'', Raanan Rein, ed. page 107. London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was not able to bridge the gulf between those participants who proposed achieving national integration by a [[corporatism|corporative]] socio-economic policy and those who favored an appeal to race.&lt;ref name="Cassels, Alan page 158"&gt;Cassels, Alan. ''Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World'' Routledge, New York. page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Pretensions to "universal fascism" could not survive this rift, and the movement did not meet its goal of acting as a counterbalance to international communism.&lt;ref name="Cassels, Alan page 158"/&gt;

The ''CAUR'' did not win official endorsement from the Italian Fascist Party or the Spanish Falange. It was unsuccessful either to present a commonly agreed definition as to what "fascism" was or to unite most major fascist parties into one international movement.

Aziz was released from custody by the Pakistani supreme court in 2009 and acquitted in 2013. Besides being the Imam of [[Lal Masjid, Islamabad]] he is also the chancellor of [[Jamia Hafsa]]

In 2014, Aziz named a library at one of the mosque's seminaries after [[Osama Bin Laden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2014/04/18/pakistani-madrassa-names-library-after-bin-laden |title=Pakistani madrassa names library after bin Laden |first=Munir |last=Ahmed |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=18 April 2014 |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IMG-20151113-WA0010.jpg|thumb|Maulana Aziz Ghazi Addressing His Supporters]]

==Background==
{{Deobandi}}
Aziz came to [[Islamabad]] as a six-year-old boy from his home town in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Punjab]], when his father was appointed khateeb of Lal Masjid in 1966. He grew up in [[Islamabad]].{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Aziz is the son of [[Muhammad Abdullah Ghazi|Muhammad Abdullah]], the first prayer leader of Lal Masjid, and elder brother of [[Abdul Rashid Ghazi|Abdul Rashid]], who was killed in a government raid.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

Aziz is descended from [[Sadwani]] [[clan]] of [[Mazari tribe|Mazari]] [[tribe]] in the town of [[Rojhan]] at the border of southern [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Pakistan's military ruler, [[General Zia-ul-Haq]], was said to be very close to Abdullah.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

==Education==
After studying for few years in a public school, he was later sent to [[Karachi]] to study in a religious seminary. {{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}
He is a graduate of [[Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia]] Banuri Town, a [[Madrassah]] in Karachi, where he studied the customary [[Dars-e-Nizami]], which is taught at the most elementary level of religious education in [[Pakistan]].{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

After Graduating, The Government Appointed Him As [[Imam]] Of Islamabad's Mujaddiya Masjid In Sector F-8/2 , Where He Led Prayers Up Till (His Father) [[Muhammad Abdullah Ghazi|Maulana Abdullah Ghazi]]'s Assassination in 1998

==Lal Masjid==

Abdul Aziz served as officially designated prayer leader in Lal Masjid From 1998 until 2005 when he was dismissed from service (but never removed) after he issued a "[[fatwa]]" (religious decree) against the army officers who were fighting against the Taliban and their supporters in the tribal areas close to the Afghan border.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} In the fatwa he declared that none of the army officers who were killed in the fighting in tribal area was a [[martyr]] and religious sanctions were not available for their funeral. His fatwa irked the government and he was dismissed from service.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}  But in fact, the government has not attempted to remove him from his post. A replacement cleric was appointed for Lal Masjid, but local Residents refused to pray behind anyone other than Aziz.

He closely followed the supreme leader of the [[Taliban]], [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], and typically resisted being photographed.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

Tensions between the government and religious students led by Abdul Aziz had simmered over the demolition of mosques. However, [[Islamabad]] was shaken out of its political stupor by the female students and teachers of the seminary in the last week of March.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} They announced the launch of a "moral drive" against all "immoral activities" in the federal capital.

He also warned the government of attacks in the case of a violent police operation launched against the seminary. "If the government fails to eradicate all these moral evils from the society within the specified period of one month the students of the seminary would themselves take actions against all the people involved in such activities," said Abdul Aziz while addressing Friday Prayer congregation at Lal Masjid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=&amp;no=354646&amp;rel_no=1 |title=Religious Cleric Threatens Suicide Attacks |first=Umer |last=Farooq |work=[[OhmyNews International]] |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005909/http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=&amp;no=354646&amp;rel_no=1 |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech the cleric declared [[drugs]], music, movies, and photographs of women as moral evils.

=== Final Showdown ===

{{Main|Siege of Lal Masjid}}

The Lal Masjid brigade came to public notice when they kidnapped women (who they accused of being prostitutes) from Islamabad's residential areas and then later kidnapped several police officers.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} The brigade increased their activities and took to the crime of kidnapping Chinese workers from  massage centres. This particular event created international pressure on Pakistan, especially from the Chinese government.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

On 3 July 2007, the standoff with the government ended in bloody gun battles in which more than 1,000 Students were killed and scores wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/04/pakistan.declanwalsh |title=Red Mosque leader attempts to flee in burka |first=Declan |last=Walsh |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 July 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

on 4 July 2007 at 8.05, Aziz was arrested while leaving the complex disguised in a [[burqa]]. , the reason for his cross-dressing escape was Latter Revealed To be that he was called 'by a senior official of an intelligence agency with whom he has been in touch for a long time'   (Aziz admitted that he and his brother Ghazi had done this many times before when they were declared wanted by the government). Since this man could not enter into the mosque to meet him. He asked Maulana Aziz to come down to Aabpara police station, situated on a walking distance from the mosque and asked him to wear a burqa to avoid identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IG07Df01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Aziz was released on 16 April 2009 by the Pakistani supreme court as he awaited trial on Alleged charges of murder, incitement, and kidnapping. He was greeted by throngs of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/17/red-mosque-pakistan-cleric-bail |title=Red Mosque siege leader walks free to hero's welcome |first=Declan |last=Walsh |date=17 April 2009 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, 27 different cases have been filed unsuccessfully against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawn.com/news/1045051/lal-masjid-cleric-acquitted-in-all-cases |title=Lal Masjid cleric acquitted in all cases |first=Malik |last=Asad |date=24 September 2013 |work=[[Dawn News]] |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aboriginal People's Party''' was a [[political party]] in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Saskatchewan]] that nominated 10 candidates in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1982|1982 elections]] for the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref name="web"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turtleisland.org/news/abparty.ppt |title=Background on APP |work=ABORIGINAL PEOPLES PARTY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the party was to promote the interests of [[First Nations]] and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] people in the province.

The party fared poorly: it collected only 1,156 votes, 0.22% of the provincial total.  It won no seats in the legislature, and did not nominate candidates in any subsequent election.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt;

London: Hurst, 1999. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to the Youth of the Lictor there were also groups of university fascists, but these groups were rather marginal as Albania had few universities.&lt;ref name="w45"/&gt;

The Italian authorities built a marble palace for the GLA in [[Tirana]], in the same complex as the ''Casa del Fascio'', one of a series of lavish façades that popped up in the city during Italian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Bernd Jürgen.

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8J9exOJ01RcC Albania]''. Milan, 1940. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's press organ was ''Liktori'' (Lictor) newspaper, with [[Ligor Buzi]] as editor.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/BUZI,%20LIGOR_0008.pdf| year=1985| publisher=CIA| title=Trace Results on Alleged Nazi War Criminals| page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anchored Instruction''' is a technology centered learning approach, which falls under the [[social constructionism]] paradigm. It is a form of [[situated learning]] [http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/situated-learning.html] that emphasizes [[problem-solving]] within an integrated learning context, which can be examined from multiple perspectives. "In other words, the learning is contextualized to provide students with realistic roles that serve to enhance the learning process", (Fried, Zannini, Wheeler, Lee, &amp; Cortez, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Fried, A., Zannini, K., Wheeler, D., Lee, Y., &amp; Cortez, a. J. (2005). Theory Name: Anchored Instruction. Retrieved from Suny Cortland: http://web.cortland.edu/frieda/id/idtheories/41.html&lt;/ref&gt; During teaching, activities are designed or tied around an "anchor", such as an adventure or story, with a problem at the end, that needs to be resolved. The connection made between the content and the authentic context is referred to as "anchoring". These models typically embed all the information needed for the problem to be solved, such data and hints. Anchored instruction is akin to [[Problem-based learning]] (P.B.L.) with the exception of its open-endedness.

==Principles for designing anchored instruction==
The seven principles outlined, are used to govern the design of anchored instruction (Biswas, Goldman, &amp; Bransford, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Biswas, G., Goldman, S., &amp; Bransford, J. (1997). Anchored Interactive Learning Environments. Intl. Journal of AI in Education, vol 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

#	'''Generative Learning Format''' - An appropriate anchor should be selected for the instruction. This is usually a story that leads to a problem, which is of interest to the students. The end of the story needs to be generated by the learner, which is the solution to the problem. This method provides [[Intrinsic motivation]], through [[Active learning]], because the students take ownership of the problem.
#	'''Video-Based Presentation Format''' - This format allows learner to understand the complex and intertwined problems better than a text or audio format. It solidifies what is taught in textbooks and other literature through a dynamic, visual and spatial representation [http://www.niu.edu/facdev/_pdf/guide/learning/howard_gardner_theory_multiple_intelligences.pdf]. The video medium gives life to the characters and depicts an authentic storyline. This format appeals to students who may have difficulty reading, or understanding written text and allows them to develop pattern recognition skills
#	'''Narrative Format''' - The video is narrated to give an account for the characters, the event, and subsequent events. The problem occurs naturally which give the students the impression they are resolving a real problem and not responding to a lecture on a video. The narrative format also makes it easier to embed information into the story.
#	'''Problem Complexity''' - The story or adventure used should have a high level of complexity to demand the full attention and stimulate the curiosity of the learner. The problems or issues should require several steps to be solved. This is based on the Anchored Interactive Learning Environment's (Ihlström &amp; Westerlund, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Ihlström, J., &amp; Westerlund, F. (2013). Interactive Learning environments: The effects of interactivity in online learning environments. Institutionen för informatik.&lt;/ref&gt; premise; learners must be trained to deal with complex problems that are more realistic.
#	'''Embedded Data Design''' - The story includes seamlessly embedded information that is needed to solve the issues. It should also include a great deal of extraneous information. When formatted in this manner, the learner would need to understand the question and determine what information is pertinent to answering the question. (Goldman, et al.; Sherwood, et al., 1995).
#	 '''Opportunities for Transfer''' - Learners are able to transfer knowledge from one subject, example [[Geometry]], to the topics in the same subject. This increases [[deep learning]] and skill transfer.
#	'''Links Across the Curriculum''' - In addition to containing all the necessary information, to solve the issue, the story may also introduce topics from other subjects, to provide a holistic learning approach.

==Roles==
Anchored instruction highlights the use of [[Instructional technology]].  Teachers are moved from the source of information to a coach. It is widely used at primary levels, and is applied to Mathematics, Reading and Language skills.

===Role of the Learner===
Anchored instruction, promotes [[active learning]], by motivating and challenging learners. The story or anchor contains embedded data along with other extraneous information; it is the learner's responsibility to decipher, extract and organize pertinent information. The problem that needs to be solved, often requires the learner to take multiple steps, by generating a man smaller questions, that ought to support and guide their thinking. Small groups of learners are the appropriate size for this type of instruction. Members of the group often provide multiple opinions, thus having multiple solutions to the problem. Students are responsible for establishing their learning goals

===Role of the Facilitator===

The facilitators are responsible for providing the anchor, the problem statement and embedded data in the story. Anchored stories also contain hints that act as [[instructional scaffolding]] to resolve problems. Scaffolding provides a temporary framework to support learning. The facilitator coaches and guides the learners through the learning process. They assist students to establish their own learning goals. And accept that they are no longer the major source of knowledge.

==Overview==
According to its website, the Boston Public Library has a collection of over 23.7 million items, which makes it one of the largest municipal public library systems in the United States. The vast majority of the collection – over 22.7 million volumes — is held in the Central Branch research stacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Boston Public Library Fact Sheet |url=https://www.bpl.org/general/about/BPL_Fact_Sheet.pdf |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902113030/http://www.bpl.org/general/about/BPL_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between July 2012 and June 2013, the annual circulation of the BPL was 3.69 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Boston Public Library|url=http://www.bpl.org/general/about/stats.htm|accessdate=2014-01-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202125225/http://www.bpl.org/general/about/stats.htm|archivedate=2014-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the strength and importance of its research collection, the Boston Public Library is a member of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), a not-for-profit organization comprising the research libraries of North America. The [[New York Public Library]] is the only other public library that is a member of the ARL. The library has established collections of distinction, based on the collection's depth and breadth, including subjects such as Boston history, the Civil War, Irish History, etc. In addition, the library is both a federal and state depository of government documents.

Included in the BPL's research collection are more than 1.7 million rare books and manuscripts. It possesses wide-ranging and important holdings, including medieval manuscripts and [[incunabula]], early editions of [[William Shakespeare]] (among which are a number of Shakespeare quartos and the [[First Folio]]), the [[George Ticknor]] collection of Spanish literature, a major collection of [[Daniel Defoe]], records of colonial Boston, the personal 3,800 volume library of [[John Adams]], the mathematical and astronomical library of [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], important manuscript archives on [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], including the papers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], and a major collection of materials on the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] case. There are large collections of prints, photographs, postcards, and maps. The library, for example, holds one of the major collections of watercolors and drawings by [[Thomas Rowlandson]]. The library has a special strength in music, and holds the archives of the [[Handel and Haydn Society]], scores from the estate of [[Serge Koussevitzky]], and the papers of and grand piano belonging to the important American composer [[Walter Piston]].

For all these reasons, the historian [[David McCullough]] has described the Boston Public Library as one of the five most important libraries in America, the others being the [[Library of Congress]], the [[New York Public Library]], and the university libraries of [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]].

==History==

===Founding and expansion===
In the mid-19th century, several people were instrumental in the establishment of the Boston Public Library. [[George Ticknor]], a Harvard professor and trustee of the [[Boston Athenaeum]], raised the possibility of establishing a public library in Boston beginning as early as 1826. At the time, Ticknor could not generate enough interest.

[[Image:George Ticknor, by Martin Milmore, Boston Public Library.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of [[George Ticknor]]]]

In 1839, [[Alexandre Vattemare]], a Frenchman, suggested that all of Boston's libraries combine themselves into one institution for the benefit of the public.&lt;ref&gt;McCrann, Grace-Ellen (2005): "Contemporary Forces That Supported the Founding of the Boston Public [[Library]]." ''Public Libraries'', Vol. 44, no. 4, July/August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was presented to many Boston libraries, however, most were uninterested in the idea. At Vattemare's urging, Paris sent gifts of books in 1843 and 1847 to assist in establishing a unified public library. Vattemare made yet another gift of books in 1849.

[[Josiah Quincy, Jr.]] anonymously donated $5,000 to begin the funding of a new library. Quincy made the donation while he was [[mayor of Boston]]. Indirectly, [[John Jacob Astor]] also influenced the establishment of a [[public library]] in Boston. At the time of his death, Astor bequeathed $400,000 to New York to establish a public library there. Because of the cultural and economic rivalry between Boston and New York, this bequest prompted more discussion of establishing a public library in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;McCrann, Grace-Ellen (2005): "Contemporary Forces That Supported the Founding of the Boston Public Library." Public Libraries, Vol. 44, no. 4, July/August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, a statute of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court of Massachusetts]] enabled the creation of the library.  The library was officially established in Boston by a city ordinance in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;For context, see: [[List of libraries in 19th-century Boston, Massachusetts]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Benjamin Seaver recommended to the city council that a librarian be appointed. In May 1852 the city council adopted the recommendations of the mayor and Edward Capen was chosen to become Boston Public Library's first librarian.&lt;ref&gt;International Dictionary of Library Histories, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Eager to support the library, [[Edward Everett]] collected documents from both houses of Congress, bound them at his own expense, and offered this collection to help establish the new library. At the time of Everett's donation, [[George Ticknor]] became involved in the active planning for the new library.&lt;ref name="McCrann 2005"&gt;McCrann 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, financier [[Joshua Bates (financier)|Joshua Bates]] gave a gift of $50,000 to establish a library in Boston. After Bates' gift was received, Ticknor made lists of what books to purchase. He traveled extensively to purchase books for the library, visit other libraries, and set up book agencies.&lt;ref name="McCrann 2005"/&gt;

[[Image:2350781505 BPL BoylstonSt.jpg|thumb|left|Public Library, Boylston Street, 1858–1895 (demolished 1899).]]

To house the collection, a former schoolhouse located on Mason Street was selected as the library's first home. On March 20, 1854, the Reading Room of the Boston Public Library officially opened to the public. The circulation department opened on May 2, 1854.
[[Image:Reading Room of the Boston Public Library.jpg|thumb|'''Reading Room''' in 1871 at the first Boylston Street building, the library's location between 1858 and 1895.]]

The opening day collection of 16,000 volumes fit in the Mason Street building, but it quickly became obvious that its quarters were inadequate. So in December 1854, the library's commissioners authorized the library to move to a new building on [[Boylston Street]]. Designed by [[Charles Kirk Kirby]] to hold 240,000 volumes, the imposing [[Italianate]] edifice opened in 1858. But eventually the library outgrew that building as well; in 1878, an examining committee recommended replacing it with a new one at another location.

By 1880, the Massachusetts legislature authorized construction of an even grander library building. A site selected was in [[Back Bay (Boston)|Back Bay]] on [[Copley Square]] – the prominent corner of Boylston Street and Dartmouth Street, opposite [[H. H. Richardson|Richardson]]'s [[Trinity Church, Boston|Trinity Church]] and near the first [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]. After several years of debate over the selection of the architects and architectural style for the new library, in 1887 the prestigious [[New York City|New York]] firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] was chosen to design the new library. In 1888, [[Charles Follen McKim]] proposed a design based on the [[Bibliotheque Nationale]] in Paris, in a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] which met approval from the trustees of the library, and construction commenced. The vast new reading room was called Bates Hall.

In 1870, the library opened the East Boston branch, the first branch library in America. With the aim of increasing its reach throughout the city, the library opened 21 more branches in Boston neighborhoods between 1872 and 1900.&lt;ref name="BPL - History and Description"&gt;{{cite web|title=BPL - History and Description|url=http://www.bpl.org/general/history.htm|accessdate=2014-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626114123/http://www.bpl.org/general/history.htm|archivedate=2014-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the Johnson building opened at the central Copley Square location, adjacent to the McKim building. The addition was designed by Philip Johnson. In 1986, the National Park Service named the McKim building a National Historic Landmark.&lt;ref name="BPL - History and Description"/&gt;

===Recent history===
{{As of|2006}}, the Library has had staffing and funding levels for conservation below that of its peers: the BPL's staff of two full-time conservators is significantly less than the New York Public Library's thirty-five. Many colonial records and John Adams manuscripts are brittle, decaying, and so in need of attention that the Library's acting Keeper of Rare Books and Manuscripts said that "they are falling apart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacQuarrie |first=Brian |title=Library lacks means to repair old tomes |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2006-10-06 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/10/06/library_lacks_means_to_repair_old_tomes?mode=PF |accessdate=2006-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322054913/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/10/06/library_lacks_means_to_repair_old_tomes?mode=PF |archivedate=March 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the library completed a strategic plan, the BPL Compass, which featured eight community-identified Principles for Excellence. The principles in the plan and all of the related outcomes came as the result of a two-year community engagement process for which Boston Public Library received national recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compass Strategic Plan|url=http://www.bpl.org/compass/strategic-plan/|publisher=BPL|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiscal year 2012, the city of Boston spent 1.26% ($27,836,648) of its budget on the library, or $43.74 per person.&lt;ref&gt;July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013; cf. {{cite web | url = http://mblc.state.ma.us/advisory/statistics/public/repmunicpie/repmp12_report.pdf | title = FY2012 Municipal Pie Report | author = Commonwealth of Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners | year = 2014 | accessdate = 2014-06-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140728010916/http://mblc.state.ma.us/advisory/statistics/public/repmunicpie/repmp12_report.pdf# | archive-date = 2014-07-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the library unveiled its Collections of Distinction, an initial group of 18 collections that represent the most outstanding, expansive, and renowned of its holdings, Boston Public Library gives priority to Collections of Distinction with respect to public access, acquisition, digitization, preservation, and staff development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections of Distinction|url=http://www.bpl.org/distinction/|publisher=BPL|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2013, the library began a renovation of the Central Library's Johnson building.&lt;ref name="bpl.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=BPL - Central Library Renovation Fact Sheet|url=http://www.bpl.org/compass/files/2013/12/BPL-central-library-renovation-fact-sheet-11.2013hr.pdf|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, the first phase of renovation opened on the Johnson building's second floor, including the new Children's Library, Teen Central, a community reading area, and the Adult Reference area. The renovated second floor cost a total of $18 million. The second phase of the Johnson building renovations opened in the summer 2016 and included the first floor, mezzanine, and exterior.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite web|last = Cook|first = Greg| title = Research: First Look Inside The Boston Library's Astonishing, Colorful Renovation| url = http://artery.wbur.org/2015/02/21/boston-library-renovation| accessdate = 26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the library had 3,818,883 visitors to all locations, 4,933,786 items borrowed, and 9,839,461 visits to its website. The library also gained 82,911 new library card holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpl.org/general/about/stats.htm|title=BPL - BPL by the Numbers|website=www.bpl.org|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Library==
The Boston Central Library is located in [[Copley Square]] in Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] neighborhood. The central library consists of McKim Building and Johnson Building, and the two buildings are attached and interconnected with interior passageways. The central library as a whole with the two buildings combined contains {{convert|930000|sqft|m2}} of space and houses 21,000,000 items in its collections as of 2015.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Public Library : Fact Sheet |url=https://www.bpl.org/general/about/BPL_Fact_Sheet.pdf |website=Boston Public Library |publisher=Boston Public Library |accessdate=6 July 2015 |date=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010141601/http://www.bpl.org/general/about/BPL_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Johnson building===
[[Image:Johnson building bpl.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson Building, Boylston St. near Copley Square, Boston, 2008]]

Designed by [[Philip Johnson]], a late [[modernism|modernist]] addition (which somewhat anticipated [[Postmodern architecture|postmodernist architecture]]) was built in 1967–1971 and opened in 1972. The Johnson building reflects similar proportions, and is built of the same pink [[Milford granite (Massachusetts)|Milford granite]] as the McKim building. Critics have likened it to a [[mausoleum]], citing the small percentage of windows relieving the massive walls in its exterior façade.

Upon opening, the Johnson building became the home for the BPL's main circulating collection, which includes works in many languages. It also serves as headquarters for the Boston Public Library's 24 branch libraries.&lt;ref name="BPL - History and Description"/&gt;

In 2013, the library began a major renovation project on the Johnson building. The first phase of the renovation opened in February 2015 on the Johnson building's second floor and features a new Children's Library, Teen Central, a community reading area, and Adult Reference area. The second phase includes renovations to the buildings first floor, mezzanine, and exterior and opened in the summer 2016.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; The $78 million renovation includes a new business innovation center and business library, a radio broadcasting studio for [[WGBH (FM)]], a [[3D printing|3D printer]], and a café.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodwin |first= Jeremy D. |url=http://www.wbur.org/artery/2016/07/08/boston-public-library-renovations |title=With $78M Renovation, Boston Public Library Aims For Friendlier Vibe |work=[[WBUR-FM]] |date=2016-07-08 |accessdate=2016-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital partners===
Boston Public Library has two digital partners-in-residence at the Central Library in Copley Square. The first is [[Internet Archive]], a nonprofit digital library that offers permanent access to historical collections in digital format for researchers, historians, and the general public. The [[Digital Public Library of America]] provides access to digital content from American libraries, archives, museums, and historical societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpl.org/general/about/BPL_FY14_Accomplishments.pdf |publisher=Bpl.org |title= Boston Public Library Accomplishments - FY14 |accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branch library system==
In the latter half of the 19th century, the library worked vigorously to develop and expand its branch library system. Viewed as a means to extend its presence throughout the city, the branch system evolved from an idea in 1867 to a reality in 1870, when the first branch library in the United States was opened in [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]]. The library currently has 24 branches serving diverse populations in the city's neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpl.org/branches/ |publisher=Bpl.org |title= BPL - Neighborhood Branch Libraries |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** '''Connolly Branch''', 433 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain. "Library service to the Hyde Square area of Jamaica Plain began in 1897 with a small book deposit in the rear of a neighborhood pharmacy at the corner of Lamartine and Paul Gore Streets. Eventually, in 1905 the Boylston Branch, named for the Boylston Railroad Station, opened its doors. Responding to the need for larger space, a beautiful white limestone building was built and opened in 1932. Designed by Maginnis and Walsh in the Jacobean style, the large arched entrance leads to a large interior space with wood and glass partitions dividing the adult and children's area. The ceilings, decorated with plaster moldings, are reputedly inspired by the Rufford Abbey Library in England. On December 12, 1940, the name of the branch was officially changed to the Monsignor Arthur T.

The '''Bureau of Ghana Languages''' is an agency of the government of [[Ghana]] that focuses on [[Languages of Ghana|Ghanaian languages]], including publication of materials in them.

It was founded in 1951, originally as the '''Vernacular Literature Bureau''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaculture.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=331#602 Ghana, National Commission on Culture, "About Us - Cultural Institutions and Agencies"]&lt;/ref&gt; and later given its current name. It has two offices, one in [[Accra]] and the other in [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]].

It focuses on 11 languages: [[Akuapem Twi]], [[Twi|Asante Twi]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Fante language|Mfantse]], [[Ga language|Ga]], [[Adangme language|Dangme]], [[Nzema language|Nzema]], [[Dagbani language|Dagbani]], [[Dagaare language|Dagaare]], [[Gonja language|Gonja]] and [[Kasem language|Kasem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaculture.gov.gh/index1.php?linkid=331&amp;page=2&amp;sectionid=602 Ghana, National Commission on Culture, "The Bureau Of Ghana Languages-BGL" (Page 2 of 6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision==
An institution that provides effective and excellent services for the
promotion, orthographic control and learning of Ghanaian languages and other cultural aspects through pragmatic strategies and influencing government policies.

==Mission==
The mission of the Bureau of Ghana Languages is to provide services in Ghanaian languages to individuals, organizations, institutions and the general research into Ghanaian languages, writing, translation of non-local language documents, assessment, editing and publication of documents in Ghanaian languages and to influence government policies on Ghanaian languages.

==Profile==
The Bureau of Ghana Languages (BGL) is the focal point for the development, promotion, orthographic control and learning of Ghanaian languages and other cultural aspects. It also influences Government Policies on Ghanaian languages through the co-ordination of all agencies involved in promoting Ghanaian languages.

==History==
In 1958 it was converted into a Department under the Ministry of Information. It was later transferred from the Ministry of Information to the Ministry of Education in 1963. The Bureau has since 1 December 1989 been under the National Commission on Culture by the PNDC Law 238. The Bureau of Ghana Languages is a government institution involved in the educational and cultural effort of the nation. It is a unique institution because, as a government publishing house, it is the only institution of its kind that publishes exclusively in Ghanaian languages.

{{PoliticsUK}}

The '''Chief Whip''' is a political office in some [[legislature]]s whose task is to administer the [[Whip (politics)|whipping system]] that tries to ensure that members of the [[Political party|party]] attend and vote as the party leadership desires. In British [[Politics of the United Kingdom|politics]], the Chief Whip of the governing party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is usually also appointed as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury]], a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] position. The Government Chief Whip has an official residence at [[12 Downing Street]]. However, the Chief Whip's office is currently located at [[9 Downing Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339750/Campbell-ousts-the-Chief-Whip.html|title=Campbell ousts the Chief Whip | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=7 September 2001|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief Whip can wield great power over their party's MPs, including cabinet ministers, being seen to speak at all times with the voice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. [[Margaret Thatcher]] was famed for using her Chief Whip as a "cabinet enforcer".

The role of Chief Whip is regarded as secretive, as the Whip is concerned with the discipline of their own party's [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] and never appears on television or radio in their capacity as whip. An exception was [[Andrew Mitchell]], the Government Chief Whip in 2012, who appeared on television to deny remarks made about himself.

Whips in the House of Commons do not speak in debates.

The Government Chief Whip is assisted by the Deputy Chief Whip, other Whips, and Assistant Whips. In order to give them a salary for what is in essence a party office, the government whips are appointed to positions in [[HM Treasury]] and in the [[Royal Household]] under the [[Lord Steward|Lord Steward of the Household]]. The whips are not fully active in either of these departments, though do undertake a number of responsibilities. The Deputy Chief Whip is [[Treasurer of the Household|Treasurer of HM Household]], the next two Whips are [[Comptroller of the Household|Comptroller of HM Household]] and [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household|Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household]], and the remaining Whips are [[Lord High Treasurer|Lords Commissioners of the Treasury]]. Assistant Whips, and Whips of opposition parties, generally do not receive such appointments.

Outside the government, the Official Opposition Chief Whip in the Commons, like the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], receives a stipend in addition to their parliamentary salary, because their additional responsibilities will make them unable to hold down another job.

The whips, although superficially dictatorial, do act as communicators between the [[backbencher]]s and the party leadership. Ultimately if backbenchers are unhappy with the leadership's position they can threaten to revolt during a vote and force the leadership to compromise.

While the whip was formally introduced to British politics by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] in the 1880s,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} in 1846 the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] advised the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] to ensure that his "whippers-in" were personally loyal.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==The whip as a party line==

In the UK Parliament the importance of a vote is indicated by underlining of items on the "whip", which is the name of the letter the Chief Whip sends to all the MPs in their party at the start of the week. This letter informs them of the schedule for the days ahead, and includes the sentence, "Your attendance is absolutely essential" next to each debate in which there will be a vote. This sentence is underlined once, twice or three times depending on the consequences that will be suffered if they do not turn up, hence the origin of the terms ''one-line whip'', ''two-line whip'' and ''three-line whip''. The actual vote they are to make is communicated to them in the chamber by hand signals during the division when the time comes (usually after the [[division bell]] has been rung). Even though it is more important to the result of any division than the debate, neither these instructions, which are visible to everyone in the chamber, nor the "whip" letter at the start of the week, are recorded in ''[[Hansard]]'', as they are considered a matter internal to the [[political party]]; indeed, the system exists because any explicit direction to an MP as to how they should vote would be a breach of [[parliamentary privilege]].

The consequences of defying the party whip depend on the circumstances, and are usually negotiated with the party whip in advance. The party whip's job is to ensure the outcome of the vote, so the situation is different and more important for a party which holds the majority,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} because if their members obey the whip they can always win.

If the party has a large Commons majority, it can make allowances for MPs who are away on important business, or whose political circumstances require them to take a particular issue very seriously. Theoretically at least, expulsion from the party is an automatic consequence of defying a three-line whip.

Other such offences include betraying party loyalties. An example of this during [[John Major]]'s government was when nine Conservative MPs had the whip removed after voting against the government on its stance on the [[Maastricht Treaty]], becoming known as Eurosceptics. In practice they remained Conservative MPs supporting the government on other issues. Sir Bill Cash, John Redwood and [[Iain Duncan Smith]] are still Conservative MPs. This was also the only time when MPs who were being whipped were cooperating with the opposite side's whips. In most cases the 'pairing' system enables one from each side to cancel out the other's vote if absent simultaneously. Yet despite the whip, individuals are entitled to vote according to their own beliefs, particularly when there is a "free vote" on a matter of conscience.{{efn| example of this can be a vote to bring back Hanging as a Death Penalty.}} There are some cases in which the whip is removed because an issue is a matter of conscience. These include adoption, religion and equal opportunities. The impact of a whip being imposed on a matter of conscience can be damaging for a party leader. One such case was that of Iain Duncan Smith, who imposed a three-line whip against the adoption of children by unmarried couples (which at the time meant gay couples could never adopt). Several [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs voted against the official party line, and Smith's authority was weakened.

Whips can often be brutal to backbenchers to secure their vote, and will resort to a mixture of promises, cajoling and persuading to force an unpopular vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalchange.com/taw/TAW-Chapter7.htm Whipping and the Death of Political Conscience]&lt;/ref&gt; A good whip will know secrets and incriminating information about MPs.{{cn|date=November 2018}} A whip should know major figures in an MP's local [[constituency]] party and the MP's agent. There have been cases where sick MPs were wheeled into the House from far afield to vote for the government on a crucial vote. Former MP [[Joe Ashton]] recalled a case from the dying days of [[James Callaghan]]'s government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember the famous case of [[Leslie Spriggs]], the then-Member for St. Helens. We had a tied vote and he was brought to the House in an ambulance having suffered a severe heart attack. The two Whips went out to look in the ambulance and there was Leslie Spriggs laid there as though he was dead. I believe that [[John Stradling Thomas]] said to [[Joseph Harper (English politician)|Joe Harper]], 'How do we know that he is alive?' So he leaned forward, turned the knob on the heart machine, the green light went around, and he said, 'There, you've lost—it's 311.' That is an absolutely true story. It is the sort of nonsense that used to happen. No one believes it, but it is true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970604/debtext/70604-49.htm#70604-49_para20|title=Hansard 14 July 1997, Column 507, Paragraph 20.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a [[Minister (government)|minister]], the consequences of defying the party whip are absolute: they are dismissed from their job immediately if they have not already resigned, and return to being a backbencher. Sometimes their votes in Parliament are called the "[[payroll vote]]", because they can be taken for granted. The consequences for a back-bencher can include the lack of future promotion to a government post, a reduction of party campaigning effort in his or her constituency during the next election, deselection by his or her local party activists, or, in extreme circumstances, "withdrawal of the whip" and expulsion from the party.

A similar arrangement exists for Whips in the [[House of Lords]]. The Government Chief Whip is usually appointed [[Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]], while the Deputy Chief Whip is usually appointed [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard|Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard]]. Other Whips, who are fewer in number due to the decreased importance of party discipline in the Lords, are appointed as [[Lord-in-waiting|Lords in Waiting]] if men and Baronesses in Waiting if women. As well as their duties as whips, Lords whips speak in the Chamber (unlike Commons whips) to support departmental ministers or act as a spokesperson for government departments with no minister in the Lords.

Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party's discipline and behaviour on the floor of the [[Parliament of India|house]]. Usually, he/she directs the party members to stick to the party's stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members.&lt;ref name="Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha"&gt;{{cite news|title=Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770815|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook India]]|date=2 Aug 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014225153/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770815|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leaders and chief whip act"&gt;{{cite web|title=leaders and chief whips of recognised parties and groups in parliament (facilities) act, 1998 |url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/msa_section/leader_chief1998.pdf |publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat |accessdate=3 August 2012 |archivedate=3 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69dRYMQuE?url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/msa_section/leader_chief1998.pdf |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some cases such as Indian presidential election where no whip can be issued directing [[Member of Parliament]] or [[Member of Legislative Assembly]] on whom to vote.&lt;ref name="Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/india/32617646_1_presidential-poll-mps-and-mlas-electoral-college|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=10 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Citizens' Action Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Acción Ciudadana}}; commonly abbreviated as '''PAC''') is a center-left [[political party]] in [[Costa Rica]]. 

Its platform is based on encouraging citizen participation and involvement in politics.  One of its guiding ideals is to fight against corruption, arguing that it is one of the main causes of under development and voter apathy. The party took a leading role in the failed campaign against Costa Rica's membership of the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]].

==History and elections==

===Founding and 2002 election===
{{main|Costa Rican general election, 2002}}
PAC was founded in December 2000 by several dissidents from Costa Rica's two traditional parties, the [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)|National Liberation Party]] and the [[Social Christian Unity Party]]. Originally an anti-corruption party, it startled the Costa Rican political arena with a very strong showing in the [[Costa Rican general election, 2002|2002 general elections]].  In the presidential vote, party founder and candidate [[Ottón Solís]] was able to secure 26% of the votes &amp;ndash; an unprecedented amount for a third party in Costa Rica &amp;ndash; and force a runoff between the PLN and PUSC.

The party won 21.9% of the popular vote and 14 out of 57 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]], making it the third strongest political force in the legislature.  A few months later, however, after a series of internal disputes, six of the party's 14 [[Chamber of Deputies|deputies]] resigned from the party, leaving PAC with only eight seats.

===2006 election===
{{main|Costa Rican general election, 2006}}
In the February 5, 2006 [[Costa Rican parliamentary election, 2006|parliamentary election]], the party won 17 out of 57 seats. Ottón Solís ran for [[Costa Rican presidential election, 2006|president]] again, losing to the PLN's [[Oscar Arias Sanchez]] by less than .2% of the votes. Arias only won by a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff.  The number of [[spoiled ballot]]s was larger than the margin between Solís and Arias.
[[File:Asamblea General de Juventud PAC 2016, Liceo de Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|PAC's Youth General Assembly, 2016]]
After the 2006 election, Ótton Solís took a year away from politics to teach in the [[United States]]. Former PLN Secretary General [[Luis Guillermo Solís|Luis Guillermo Solís']] name began being circulated at meetings of the "ungroup," an informal gathering of PAC officials, led by former deputy Alberto Salom.&lt;ref name="desconocido"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oviedo|first=Estaban|title=Luis Guillermo Solís: El profesor desconocido que, en tres años, llegó a ser el presidente|trans-title=Luis Guillermo Solís: The unknown professor who, in three years, became president|url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/elecciones2014/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-desconocido-presidente_0_1407059351.html|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=La Nación (San Jose)|date=8 April 2014|location=San José|language=Es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several PAC officials wanted Luis Guillermo Solís to run as a deputy in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] and as a vice presidential candidate in 2010.&lt;ref name="desconocido" /&gt;

Future President Luis Guillermo Solís joined the party in 2009.&lt;ref name=CIDOB&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortiz de Zárate (editor)|first=Roberto|title=Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, CIDOB|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/costa_rica/luis_guillermo_solis_rivera|publisher=Barcelona Centre for International Affairs|accessdate=1 April 2014|location=Barcelona|language=es|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended meetings of the "ungroup" shortly thereafter in anticipation of the 2014 election.&lt;ref name="desconocido" /&gt;

===2010 election===
{{main|Costa Rican general election, 2010}}
In the 2010 election, Ottón Solís ran for his third and final time as president. [[Laura Chinchilla]] of the PLN won, but Ottón Solís finished with 25.2% of the votes. PAC won the second fraction in the Legislative Assembly with 11 deputies elected. Six candidates won municipal elections in the rural communities of [[Aserrí]], Matina, Hojancha, [[Cañas (canton)|Cañas]], Los Chiles y Guatuso.

===2014 election===
{{main|Costa Rican general election, 2014}}
[[File:PAC Plaza Roosevelt 2.jpg|thumb|PAC supporters wave their traditional colors to celebrate [[Luis Guillermo Solís]]' victory on 6 April 2014]]
In 2013, PAC held its [[Citizens' Action Party presidential primary, 2013|second national convention]]. It was an open convention in which any citizen could vote, despite party affiliation. Four candidates vied for the primary to represent PAC in the 2014 national elections: [[Epsy Campbell Barr]], [[Juan Carlos Mendoza]], [[Luis Guillermo Solís]], and [[Ronald Solís Bolaños]], with Luis Guillermo Solís winning 35% of the votes.

On 6 April 2014, Luis Guillermo Solís became the [[president elect]] of Costa Rica. PAC candidates won 13 seats in the Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Agüero R.|first=Mercedes|title=Diálogo y acuerdo, las palabras de moda en futuros diputados|url=http://www.nacion.com/elecciones_2014/Dialogo-acuerdo-palabras-futuros-diputados_0_1403059747.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=La Nacion (Costa Rica)|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 election===
{{main|Costa Rican general election, 2018}}

The [[Citizens' Action Party presidential primary, 2017|third national convention]] was held between only two candidates, both former ministers on PAC's first cabinet; Minister of Economy [[Welmer Ramos]] and Minister of Labor [[Carlos Alvarado Quesada|Carlos Alvarado]]. Ramos was an economist, more socially conservative and close to the "ottonista" faction, whilst Alvarado was writer and political scientist, much more socially liberal and younger, close to the "progresista" faction. Alvarado won the primary election becoming PAC's first time candidate during government. 

Despite suffering from a diminished popularity due to the ''Cementazo'' scandal affecting the image of [[Luis Guillermo Solis]]' government, Alvarado's progressive positions boost him into the second round as a counter-reaction after the growth of [[Evangelical Christian]] [[Christian music|singer]] and ultra-conservative candidate [[Fabricio Alvarado]] after the backlash against the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights|IACHR]]'s ruling ordering the country to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], winning by a wide margin in the second round with 60% of the votes and more than 1.300.000 votes over the 39% and around 800.000 votes of his rival, becoming the second time that the party achieves more than a million votes in second round.&lt;ref name="Garcia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=David Alire|last2=Pretel|first2=Enrique Andres|title=Costa Rica center-left easily wins presidency in vote fought on gay rights|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-costarica-election/costa-rica-center-left-easily-wins-presidency-in-vote-fought-on-gay-rights-idUSKBN1H80XC|accessdate=2 April 2018|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanley|first1=Katherine|title=Carlos Alvarado wins Costa Rica’s presidency in a landslide|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2018/04/01/carlos-alvarado-will-be-costa-ricas-48th-president|accessdate=2 April 2018|agency=The Tico Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform==
While cleaning up corruption has been one of PAC's main goals since its creation, Solís has added to the party's platform. He wants to build infrastructure, bolster Costa Rica's [[universal health care]] and [[social security]] systems and push for environmentally friendly policies.&lt;ref name="tico-2013-11-03"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dyer |first=Zach |title=Costa Rican presidential candidate Luis Guillermo Solís: 'It's not going to be business as usual' |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2013/11/04/costa-rican-presidential-candidate-luis-guillermo-solis-it-s-not-going-to-be-business-as-usual |accessdate=3 February 2014 |newspaper=The Tico Times |date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Díaz |first=Luis Edo. |title=Luis Guillermo Solís llama a sus seguidores a 'cambiar la historia' patria |trans-title=Luis Guillermo Solís calls on his supporters to 'change history' for the country |language=es |url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/elecciones2014/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-seguidores-historia_0_1393060748.html |accessdate=3 February 2014 |newspaper=La Nación |place=San José |date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, PAC has opposed free trade agreements such as [[Central American Free Trade Agreement|CAFTA]], which Solís claims is improperly implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sequeira |first=Aaron |title=Luis Guillermo Solís propone evitar firma de nuevos tratados comerciales |trans-title=Luis Guillermo Solís proposes avoiding the signing of new free trade agreements |language=es |url=http://www.nacion.com/nacional/elecciones2014/Luis-Guillermo-Solis-tratados-comerciales_0_1397860268.html |accessdate=20 February 2014 |newspaper=La Nación |place=San José |date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, PAC claims that the country's tax system is inadequate, saying that more "progressive" system is needed.&lt;ref name="Leiton"&gt;{{cite news |last=Leiton| first=Patricia |title=PAC haría reforma fiscal, impuesto por impuesto|trans-title=PAC will make fiscal reforms, tax by tax| language=es |url=http://www.nacion.com/economia/politica-economica/PAC-haria-reforma-fiscal-impuesto_0_1404259568.html| accessdate=24 March 2014| newspaper=La Nacion| place=San José| date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3997">'''Command and influence''' is a component of Military C2 ('[[Command and control]]') and is a key aspect of [[Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures]].

== Definition ==
[[Terrorism Research Center|Chris Flaherty]] in 2003 distinguished the concept of command and influence is a component of Military C2 ('[[command and control]]'), in the following terms: "Influence, is fundamental to effective Command where forces manoeuvre. Thus, recognition of "Influence" is an important element in any future warfighting concept. As an alternative to relying on Command and Control (C2) based effective Command there should be utilization of command and "influence" (CI) based effective Command.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C.J. (2003) The Role of Command and Influence in Australian Multidimensional Manoeuvre Theory, Defence Force Journal. (162): 31-38. URL: http://www.adfjournal.adc.edu.au/UserFiles/issues/162%202003%20Sep_Oct.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2010) Command, Influence and Information in 3D Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. (9)1: 18-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of influence in military theory ==
Notionally, 'influence' is definable as the effect of one person or thing on another.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2010) Command, Influence and Information in 3D Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. (9)1: 18-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular military [[information operation]]s (IO) implicitly incorporates a variety of influence strategies, in order to shape the military and political spheres in conflict.

== Relevance of Arquilla and Ronfeldt work ==
The work of [[John Arquilla]] and [[David Ronfeldt]], on the [[netwar]] actor,&lt;ref&gt;Arquilla,J. Ronfeldt, D.F. (1996) The Advent of Netwar. RAND, Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; was used as the basis for developing the 'command and influence' model. In particular, their characterization of the network based organisation, as these routinely employ non-hierarchical based decision structures:
* An archetypal netwar actor consists of a web (or network) of disperse, interconnected 'nodes' (or activity centres).
* A network based organisation is structurally flat, meaning there is no single central leader or commander, and with little or no hierarchy.
* Decision making and operations are decentralized and depend on consultative consensus-building that allow for local initiative and autonomy.
* A mobilizing factor for decision making depends on a powerful doctrine, ideology, or narrative.
This later dictum clearly identifies 'Influence' as the enabling mechanism allowing actors/agents to disperse, devote to different tasks, as well as coordinate from a ground level up emulating operational centrality.

== Relationship swarming tactics ==
[[Swarming]] attackers or defenders take advantage of any happenstance they can manipulate (to their own advantage); and are able to overcome coordination barriers, as these adopt the following strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2012) Dangerous Minds: A Monograph on the Relationship Between Beliefs –Behaviours – Tactics. Published by OODA LOOP (7 September 2012). URL: http://www.oodaloop.com/security/2012/09/07/dangerous-minds-the-relationship-between-beliefs-behaviors-and-tactics/&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no discernible communication between swarming attackers (who operate completely without organisation or an apparent plan).
* [[Netwar]] organisation is described as structurally flat. There is no central leader or commander and little or no hierarchy.

== Cohesive factors ==
The key command and influence cohesive factors, are:
* Actions are independent;
* Coordinated collaboratively and consultatively;
* 'Influence' operates as the attractor and motivator for human-to-human organisation;
* The swarmers rely on broad ideologies to motivate and direct (which operate as unifying and directing precepts); and,
* The swarmers rely on [[opinion leaders]] or [[intermediaries]], who organize, coordinate, and suggest direction.

The '''Cudgel War''' (also '''Club War''', {{lang-fi|Nuijasota|links=no}}, {{lang-sv|Klubbekriget|links=no}}) was a 1596/97 peasant uprising in the kingdom of Sweden (in the part that is now [[Finland]]). The name of the uprising derives from the fact that the peasants armed themselves with various blunt weapons, such as [[cudgel]]s, [[flail]]s and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, as they were seen as the most efficient weapons against their heavily armoured enemies. The yeomen also had [[sword]]s, some [[firearm]]s and two [[cannon]]s at their disposal. Their opponents, the troops of [[Klaus Fleming|Clas Eriksson Fleming]], were professional, heavily armed and armoured men-at-arms.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chain.eu/?m3=24258 |title=Finnish peasant history|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Finnish historiography sees the uprising in the context of the conflict between Duke [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles]] and [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]], King of Sweden and Poland ([[War against Sigismund]]). Charles agitated the peasants to revolt against the nobility of Finland, who supported Sigismund in the conflict. 

==War==
[[File:Nuijakivi.JPG|thumb|A memorial plaque dedicated to the fallen peasants]]

An uprising began on Christmas Eve 1595 and was initially successful, but shortly thereafter was crushed by cavalry.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland9&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamma.nic.fi/~jaakkoil/history.htm|title=Jaakko Ilkka's Descendants|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1596, the Cudgel War began.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaakkoilkka.fi/Jaakko%20Ilkka%20-%20Rebellion%20.htm|title=Jaakko Ilkka's biography|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peasants won a number of encounters with infantry.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland2/&gt; [[Klaus Fleming]] began negotiating a truce that required the surrender of peasant leader Jaakko Ilkka. Ilkka fled to avoid being handed over and the peasant army scattered, pursued by the soldiers. At least 1500 were killed within the next two months.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland2/&gt; Along with [[Jaakko Ilkka]], five other rebellion leaders were executed on January 27, 1597.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland13&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.kokkola.fi/historia/nuijasota/nokian.htm|title=Battle Map (Finnish)|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final part of the rebellion==
[[File:Nuijasodan muistomerkki.JPG|thumb|A Cudgel War memorial]]

[[Israel Laurinpoika]] was named as the new governor of central and northern Ostrobothnia, and planned to support the rebellion. However, he fled rather than face Fleming. Leaderless, the peasants opened battle with Fleming on February 24, 1597. Over 1000 were killed and 500 captured.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland2/&gt;

The insurgents were mostly Finnish peasants from [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]], Northern [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] and [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo]]. The events can also be seen as a part of a larger power struggle between [[Sigismund III Vasa|King Sigismund]] and [[Charles IX of Sweden|Duke Charles]].&lt;ref name=EB_Finland/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB_Finland88&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiede.fi/artikkeli/jutut/artikkelit/jaakko_ilkka_suomen_kyseenalaisin_julkkis|title=Charles (Finnish)|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In his work ''Nuijasota, sen syyt ja tapaukset'' (1857–1859) ({{lang-en|Club War, its reasons and causes}}), historian and [[fennoman]] [[Yrjö Koskinen]] (né Forsman) saw the peasants as fighting for freedom and justice. [[Fredrika Runeberg]]'s ''Sigrid Liljeholm'' (1862), one of the first historical novels in Finland, depicts women's fates during the war. [[Albert Edelfelt]]'s painting ''Poltettu kylä'' (1879) depicts a woman, a child, and an old man hiding behind a rock as a village burns in the background.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland42&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.kokkola.fi/historia/nuijasota/images/edelf.jpg|title=Painting|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Kaarlo Kramsu]] praised the insurgents and lamented their defeat in patriotic poems such as ''Ilkka'', ''Hannu Krankka'', and ''Santavuoren tappelu'', published in ''Runoelmia'' (1887). After the [[Finnish Civil War]], the debate has centered on an interpretation that emphasizes Duke Charles's role in inciting the revolt, as found in [[Pentti Renvall]]'s ''Kuninkaanmiehiä ja kapinoitsijoita Vaasa-kauden Suomessa'' (1949); and an explanation that stresses the roots of the rebellion in social injustice and class conflict, as argued by [[Heikki Ylikangas]] in ''Nuijasota'' (1977). A [[historical reenactment]] of the Cudgel War is conducted yearly in the Kavalahti scout camp.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cudgelwar.org/english.php?pid=frontpage |title=Cudgel War Reenactment|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaakko Ilkka took the 75th place in the [[Suuret suomalaiset|''Great Finns'']] TV show. A commemorative [[silver]] [[coin]] was also minted to mark the occasion.&lt;ref name=EB_Finland92&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matinmarkka.com/WebRoot/OVK/Shops/MatinMarkka/4A50/4DE9/5CB7/4FDA/FD72/0A28/1028/6A0F/Nuijasota.jpg|title=Coin|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethical leadership''' is [[leadership]] that is directed by respect for [[ethics|ethical]] beliefs and values and for the [[dignity]] and [[rights]] of others.{{r|watts|page=22}} It is thus related to concepts such as [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[honesty]], [[Equal consideration of interests|consideration]], [[charisma|charisma,]] and [[Social justice|fairness]].{{r|r3}}

Ethics is concerned with the kinds of values and morals an individual or a society finds desirable or appropriate. Furthermore, ethics is concerned with the virtuousness of individuals and their motives. A leader's choices are also influenced by their moral development.&lt;ref&gt;Northouse, Peter G.(2016)Leadership Theory and Practice Seventh Edition Los Angeles, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hawaii]] '''Gas Cap Law''' is a [[state law]] setting a [[price ceiling]] on [[wholesale]] [[gasoline]] prices, the maximum amount that may be charged for producing gasoline and delivering it to a [[filling station|service station]]. Under the law, the gas cap was set weekly by the [[Hawaii Public Utilities Commission]] (PUC) based on average [[spot price]]s for regular unleaded gasoline in three U.S. markets, [[New York Harbor]], the [[Gulf Coast]], and [[Los Angeles]].

The gas cap had a baseline price that is the same throughout Hawaii, but the total wholesale price varied depending on seven zones, reflecting the differing costs of delivery to various locations throughout the state.

'''Geological Survey of Norway''' ({{lang-no|Norges geologiske undersøkelse}}), abbr: '''NGU''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[government agency]] responsible for [[geology|geologic]] mapping and research. The agency is located in [[Trondheim]] with an office in [[Tromsø]], with about 200 employees. It is subordinate to the [[Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries]].&lt;ref name=Government.no&gt;Government.no: Subordinate agencies and institutions. [http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/nhd/about-the-ministry/Subordinate-agencies-and-institutions/ngu-.html?id=435112] 2012-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
[[File:Coat of arms of the Norwegian Geological Survey.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms]]
NGU's main work is related to collecting, processing and impart knowledge related to the physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the countries [[bedrock]], mineral resources, [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] and [[groundwater]].&lt;ref name="ngu"&gt;Geological Survey of Norway. [http://www.ngu.no/en-gb/tm/About-NGU/ About NGU] 2008-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Important areas include the [[Arctic]], [[Antarctica]], [[Svalbard]] and the [[continental shelf]]. With the motto "Geology for the Society", NGU provides maps and geological information in national databases. The activity is organized after five key principles:&lt;ref name="Annual report 2008"&gt;NGU - Annual report 2008. [http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/data/filer/aarsmeldinger/AE_2008_55910.pdf] 2008-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Long-term value creation from geological resources&lt;br&gt;
2. Increase use of geoscience knowledge in spatial planning and development&lt;br&gt;
3. Enhanced knowledge of the country’s construction and geological processes&lt;br&gt;
4. Good communication, management and customization of geological knowledge&lt;br&gt;
5. Increased quality and efficiency through good interaction internally and externally

==History==
[[File:Theodor Kjerulf.png|thumb|right|Theodor Kjerulf, 1908]] The Geological Survey of Norway was established on 6 February 1858 by [[Order in Council]]. A few years earlier, the geology student [[Theodor Kjerulf]] had submitted the idea of a Norwegian geological survey to the Norwegian [[interior ministry]].&lt;ref name="Letter from Kjerulf"&gt;Document from the establishment of NGU, letter from Th. Kjerulf to the Interior ministry of Norway, 8 August 1856.&lt;/ref&gt; The survey would serve to map the country´s agricultural areas and mineral deposits, as well as systematically study how the Norwegian landscape had been formed. In the mid-19th century [[Norway]] was modernizing quickly by developing industry and knowledge, along with evolving cultural life. An institution such as a Norwegian geological survey would be "convenient, scientifically necessary and honorable for the nation". The first years of its existence, mapping the bedrock, superficial deposits and mineral resources was its principal task, but it contributed to a Norwegian sense of ownership to the land, something that was especially important around 1905, after the Union with [[Sweden]] was dissolved. The manager Theodor Kjerulf, and his assistant, [[Tellef Dahll]], shared the mapping of Norway. They purchased equipment, planned the work and trained their field assistants to carry out the surveys.

[[Management|Manager]] Kjerulf along with Dahll and several assistants had, after about twenty years of work, completed three impressive sets of maps. ''Det sødenfjeldske'' in 1:400 000, ''Trondheim stift'' in 1:800 000 and ''Det nordlige Norge'' in 1:1 million. The maps and their descriptions gave new and valuable knowledge about the Norwegian landscape, and showed that it was possible to combine the scientific, economical and cultural ambitions Kjerulf had fronted when he set out to create the survey.

==Organization==

There are five support divisions within the agency:

*Geological Mapping
**Solid Earth Geology
**Quaternary Geology
**Marine Geology
**Geochemistry and Hydrogeology
**Geohazard and Earth Observation

The '''governmental learning spiral''' is a technique used to solve specific governance challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Blindenbacher and Watts 2003, pp. 19–20; Blindenbacher and Saunders 2005, p. 4; Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, p. 15, p.178&lt;/ref&gt; It is used during prearranged educational events such as [[Academic conference|conferences]], [[e-learning]], and trainings to improve performance in [[democratic governance]].&lt;ref&gt;March and Olsen. 1995; Doornbos, 2003. p. 3–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finer 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The governmental learning spiral—a [[heuristic]] and [[multidisciplinary]] tool—has been developed and implemented at international governmental learning events throughout the past decade.

==Concept==
The technique consists of a nine-stage [[learning process]] divided into three phases, which include the planning and aftermath as well as the learning event itself.

A major characteristic of this type of governmental learning event is [[Facilitation (business)|facilitation]] by a ''learning broker''&lt;ref&gt;Rose 1991 pp. 3–30; Dolowitz and Marsh 2000. p. 9. Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt; who oversees all aspects of event organization. These include logistics, content preparation, drafting and implementation of the agenda, moderation of the learning sessions, and follow-up activities. The learning broker designs the learning process according to the specific governance challenge at hand.

The event must be structured based on several factors:
* The specific challenge a government is facing
* An analysis of the kind of knowledge a government needs to address it
* The particular political and institutional environment, which determines who will participate in the activity&lt;ref&gt;Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 84–88&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants invited to the event must represent different substantive and organizational perspectives and play a precisely defined role as both knowledge holders and knowledge seekers. When this is achieved, participants have unlimited access to the collective wealth of the shared [[tacit]] and [[explicit knowledge]].

The effects of applying the governmental learning spiral technique are threefold: The primary effect is that governments gain access to the latest knowledge in democratic governance, which they can then apply to specific governance challenges with concrete, practical action. A second effect is that—because of the iterative character of the learning process—the knowledge being learned is always validated and updated in real time to include the latest experiences on the subject. A third effect is that participation in the learning process evokes a sense of social belonging among the learning actors, which often leads to the creation of [[business networking|networks]] and [[communities of practice]] where governments continue to share their latest experiences and by doing so launch the next spin of the Governmental Learning Spiral.

==Template==
The governmental learning spiral technique consists of a nine-stage template.&lt;ref&gt;Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 69–73&lt;/ref&gt; The stages of the learning process are organized chronologically in the template and split into three distinct sequences for a particular learning event.

1. Before (framing phase): The ''conceptualization'', ''triangulation'', and ''accommodation'' stages are the preparatory stages, where the specific governance challenge is defined, existing knowledge on the topic is framed, participants are selected and inivited, and trust is established between the learning actors and the event facilitator and between participants and the learning process itself.

2. During (reflection phase): The ''internalization'', ''externalization'', ''reconceptualization'', and ''transformation'' stages represent the core of the educational process, where learning actors review and adapt new knowledge according to their personal needs. Thereafter the actors change their individual and organizational thinking and behavior in an elaborate inter- and intrapersonal procedure.

3. After (projection phase): The follow-up to the learning activity occurs in the ''configuration'' stage, where all the knowledge acquired during the event is made available and accessible to everyone involved in the event as well as to a wider audience. This new knowledge further serves in the final ''iteration'' stage as a frame for the next spin of the governmental learning spiral, as well as a [[feedback loop]] in the context of a new learning system.

Because knowledge in [[governance]] has a short half-life and has to be updated constantly, the learning process itself must also be ongoing. This iterative procedure, where knowledge is constantly reviewed, renewed, and transformed into political action in a real-time, multi-turn process, can be illustrated as a spiral. Each of the nine stages of the learning process is bound together by a "spin," which ends with the last iteration stage and restarts the next spin with its first configuration stage.

{{Main article|Green Party of the United States}}

The Green Party is a United States political party. It has its origins dating back to 1984, when 62 people from around the U.S. came to St. Paul, MN to found the first national Green organization - the Committees of Correspondence. Since then, U.S. Greens have gone through several evolutions, from debating theory and praxis in the 1980s, to starting state parties in the 1990s, to the founding of a national political party (recognized by the Federal Elections Commission) in the 2000s.

==History==

===Initial===
At the first [[North American Bio-regional Congress]] in May 1984, (convened by [[David Haenke]] of the [[Ozark Area Community Congress]] and in Missouri),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagreens.org/pix/nabc_1984_proceedings.jpg |format=JPG |title=North American Bioregional Congress Proceedings |publisher=Cagreens.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group met to discuss the need for a green movement in the U.S.. They approved a Green Movement Committee statement "concerning the formation of a Green political organization in the USA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagreens.org/pix/nabc_1984_green_nov_statement.jpg |format=JPG |title=Green Movement Committee Statement |publisher=Cagreens.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this initial gathering, a larger meeting was planned for August 1984.

===Green Committees of Correspondence===
In August 1984, 62 people met at [[Macalester College]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] and founded the Committees of Correspondence (or CoC, so named after the [[Committees of Correspondence]] of the [[American Revolutionary War]]).

The three-day meeting included activists from peace, ecology and justice groups; veterans of the women's, civil rights, and community movements; and farmers, community leaders, church activists and teachers. There were social ecologists, deep ecologists, eco-feminists, anarchists, socialists and more.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The organizing committee was made up of professor [[Charlene Spretnak]] of [[California]], [[Harry Boyte]], Catherine Burton, [[Gloria Goldberg]] and [[David Haenke]]; and they invited 200 people from 27 issues areas.

The CoC was broadly formed to organize local Green groups and work toward creating a Green political organization in the U.S, including the forming of an interim Inter-Regional Committee (IC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/14/14-03.html |title=A Historical Look at Green Structure: 1984 to 1992 |publisher=Greens.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summer 1985 CoC newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2016}}

The meeting also started the creation of the Green [[Ten Key Values]], as the new organization's guiding principles. Differing accounts of this process have been written by Mark Satin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalmiddle.com/ten_key_values.htm |title=Birth of the Green Party's Ten Key Values |publisher=Radicalmiddle.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spretnak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green-horizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GHM_27_web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Green Horizon Magazine |date=2013 |publisher=Green-horizon.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first CoC clearinghouse was established in late 1984 in St. Paul with [[Harry Boyte]], but was hampered by a division at the Macalester meeting as to its role, with a division between those who favored coordinated decentralization and those favoring radical decentralization, to the degree that the clearinghouse be a mail drop and information resource, but not an outreach vehicle.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

At the December 1985 IC meeting in Kansas City, the decision was taken that both the IC and the clearinghouse should actively support organizing efforts through a number of services. The clearinghouse was moved to Kansas City where there was a local organisation (the Prairie Greens) to actively support it. At that time IC Bulletin, the CoC newsletter and the ''Green Letter'', a newsletter published by [[Jerry Gwathney]], were the main channels of information.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===First National Green Gathering, 1987===
The first "National Green Gathering" was held July 1987, at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA and was entitled "Building the Green Movement - A National Conference for a New Politics." The conference brochure stated it as an educational conference, not as a decision making conference.

Over 600 were in attendance. Some of the tensions within the U.S. Green movement were on display at the time - 'party vs. movement', 'deep ecology vs. social ecology' and 'New Left vs. New Age.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalmiddle.com/greens1.pdf |format=PDF |title=New Options |date=June 30, 1987 |publisher=Radicalmiddle.com |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured speakers included [[Grace Lee Boggs]], [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Walt Bresette]], [[Guy Chichester]], [[Barbara Epstein]], [[Danny Moses]], [[John Rensenbrink]] and [[Ynestra King]]. Workshops included a session on Independent Political Action. Other well-known Greens in attendance included [[Dee Berry]], [[Kathy Christensen]], [[Greta Gaard]], [[Gerald Goldfarb]], [[Howie Hawkins]], [[Phil Hill]], [[Myra Levy]], [[Roberto Mendoza]], [[Lorna Salzman]], [[Brian Tokar]] and [[Nancy Vogl]].

ink]] of Maine were selected principal coordinators of what would come to be called the SPAKA process - Strategic Policy Approaches in Key Areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The process started with a call for subjects, which went out to all the Green locals, and many others. The responses to were bundled into 11 major categories. Later they were bundled in 19 categories: Energy, Forest and Forestry, Life Forms, Materials Use and Waste Management, Water/Air, General Economic Analysis, Finance, Land Use, Politics, Social Justice, Eco-Philosophy, Spirituality, Education, Food and Agriculture, Health, Peace and Non-violence, Community, Organizing, and Strategy. 190 position papers (SPAKAS) were received.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

At the "Green Program Gathering" in [[Eugene, Oregon]], policy approaches were provisionally approved by delegates, in order to send them back to the Green locals (GCoCs) for an additional year of review and input. The final document was approved at the Third Green Gathering, held in [[Estes Park, Colorado]] in September 1990.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Greening the West, 1988===
The Greening the West conference was held in ([[San Mateo County]]), California in September/October 1988. It was hosted by the Northern California Greens. More than 1,000 people attended.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The conference featured a workshop entitled "Towards a Green Party of the West: Local and Regional Electoral Strategies", which would turn out to be an early stepping stone in the development of a U.S. Green electoral politics. Some 150 people attended the workshop and moved ahead with forming [[Green Party of the West]], a support network. That network form the nucleus for the founding of the [[Green Party of California]] 15 months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagreens.org/history/founding|title=Founding of the Green Party of California - Green Party of California (GPCA)|work=cagreens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 31, 1991 [[California Secretary of State]] [[March Fong Eu]] announced that the California Green Party had registered the prerequisite number of voters to be qualify for the 1992 ballot, becoming the California's seventh political party with ballot access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weintraub|first1=Daniel M.|title=Environmentalist Green Party May Have Ballot Spot|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 3, 1992|location=Los Angeles, California|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second National Green Gathering, 1989===
The Second National Green Gathering was held in June 1989 in Eugene, OR. It was entitled 'Green Program Gathering', because it centered upon the SPAKA process (Strategic Policy Approaches in Key Areas), to craft a nationally agreed upon set of Green policy approaches for the GCoC. The local GCoC in Eugene produced a daily Green Tidings, reporting on the Gathering, and contained a daily report on all changes in the 19 subject areas.

Afterward, the Politics Working Group issued a statement encouraging Green electoral activity but recommending that Greens begin running candidates at the local level and only proceed to the state and then to the national level when there were a substantial number of Green officeholders at the level immediately below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/14/14-03.html |title=S/R 14: A Historical Look at Green Structure: 1984 to 1992 |publisher=Greens.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greens/Green Party USA===
The [[Greens/Green Party USA]] (Greens/GPUSA) was founded at the August 1991 Green Gathering in [[Elkins, West Virginia]] restructuring the Green Committees of Correspondence with the idea that the Green movement and Green Party would operate as part of a single organization. A press conference was held in Washington, DC to announce the new organization, featuring [[Charles Betz]] (G/GPUSA Coordinating Committee member), [[Howie Hawkins]] and [[Joni Whitmore]] (Chair, Green Party of Alaska), as well as [[Hilda Mason]] of the D.C. Statehood Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?20897-1/official-formation-green-partyusa|title=Official Formation of the Green Party-USA|work=c-span.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association of State Green Parties===
In the aftermath of the first Green presidential campaign in 1996, 62 Greens from 30 states gathered in November 1996 to found the [[Association of State Green Parties]] (ASGP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/1996-founding-meeting]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2016}} The meeting was held in [[Middleburg, Virginia]].

After the Elkins meeting in 1991, there was a committee tasked with examining the options for an eventual Green Party. The committee produced a report with contributions from 6 authors. [[Greg Gerritt]]'s suggestion was to create an Association of State Green Parties based on sovereign state parties, as all political parties are organised in the USA. The reaction of the GPUSA to this suggestion was to throw Gerritt out of the GPUSA.  What was founded in 1996 in Middleburg generally followed the proposal Gerritt had submitted in early 1992.

Green Parties from 13 states were the founding members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Rensenbrink |url=http://www.mainegreens.org/directaction/voices/jrensen/middle.htm |title=Maine Greens - John Rensenbrink - Report on the ASGP Middleburg Meeting 1996 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015061938/http://www.mainegreens.org/directaction/voices/jrensen/middle.htm |archivedate=October 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and approved its mission: (1) Assist in the development of State Green Parties and (2) Create a legally structured national Green Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/greenpages/content/volume1/issue1/article6.php |title=Green Pages |publisher=Gp.org |date=1996-11-17 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding meeting also established a national newsletter ''Green Pages''.

The concept of the ASGP began in 1992 with those involved in the establishment of the [[Green Politics Network]]. The ASGP was predominantly focused on establishing state Green Parties and running and electing Greens for public office, even while its member state parties and the individual Greens involved remained involved in issue activism. From 1997 to 1999, both the ASGP and the Greens/GPUSA aimed to win affiliation of the newly form state parties.

In December 1999, [[Mike Feinstein]] and [[Howie Hawkins]] met in New York and wrote the ''Plan for a Single National Green Party'', which was more generally known as the Feinstein/Hawkins Proposal. Its idea was to create a single national Green Party from among the ASGP and GPUSA. It had support in both organisations but stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenparty.org/gatheringminutes.php |title=The Greens/Green Party USA |publisher=Greenparty.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2000, the Feinstein/Hawkins proposal was revived and renamed the "Boston Agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greens.org/~jsutter/boston.html |title=See full text of the Boston Agreement |publisher=Greens.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston agreement was approved was by the ASGP at its December 2000 meeting in Hiawasee, GA, but did not pass at the April 2001 G/GPUSA Congress. This caused a schism in membership among the G/GPUSA from which they never recovered.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In an article on the G/GPUSA’s website, the organization characterized the split between itself and the ASGP as akin to the [[fundi (politics)|fundi]]–realo split in the [[German Greens]], with itself being the fundi wing and ASGP the realos.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenparty.org%2Fwhy.php&amp;date=2015-05-31&lt;/ref&gt;

At its July 2001 meeting in Santa Barbara, the ASGP voted to change its name to "The Green Party of the United States" and apply for recognition of National Committee status by the [[Federal Election Commission]], which it was granted later that year and has retained since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/2001-national-conference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gp.org/fec-recognition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral participation==
The first U.S. Greens to run for public office, 1985, were [[Wes Hare]] for Mayor of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]] and [[Joel Schecter]] for Mayor and Alderman of [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greens.org/elections |title=Green Elections |publisher=Greens.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first U.S. Greens to be elected were [[David Conley (politician)|David Conley]], County Board of Supervisors, [[Douglas County, Wisconsin]] and [[Frank Koehn]], County Board of Supervisors, [[Bayfield County, Wisconsin]]. Also in 1986, [[Greg Gerritt]] would become the first Green to run for a state legislature, running for the Maine House of Representatives.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The first state Green party to achieve ballot status was Alaska in 1990, based upon [[Jim Sykes]] receiving 3.4% for governor of [[Alaska]]. The next state parties to qualify came in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Hawaii in 1992, and Maine in 1994.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The first Green to be elected to a state legislature was [[Audie Bock]], who won a March 1999 special election as a state legislator in the [[California Assembly]] from the Alameda/Oakland area. In 2000, Bock lost re-election, running as an independent after leaving the Greens just five months after taking office.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In November 2002, [[John Eder]]'s election to the [[Maine House of Representatives]] marked the first Green Party state legislator in the United States elected in a regular election. His party designation was "[[Maine Green Independent Party|Green Independent]]". In 2004, he won re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/greenpages/content/volume8/issue4/article3.php |title=Green Pages |publisher=Gp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2016}} However, he was defeated in 2006.

In January 2003, New Jersey Democrat [[Matt Ahearn]] became the first sitting state legislator to change affiliation to Green. He was defeated in November 2003 in his bid for re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Kornacki, Steve.

In November 2008, [[Richard Carroll (politician)|Richard Carroll]] was elected to the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]]. However, Carroll announced on April 29, 2009 his departure from the Greens and registering as a Democrat, citing ideological differences that were more in line of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greenpartywatch.org/2009/05/01/arkansas-greens-discuss-richard-carroll/|title=Arkansas Greens discuss Richard Carroll|date=May 1, 2009|publisher=Green Party Watch|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 Presidential Election===
At the 1995 national Green Gathering in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], a proposal to put a candidate for president on 40 states was adopted. A significant minority of Greens voiced strong ideological objections (based on the principle of decentralization) to the proposal to become involved in such a large-scale political arena for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lloyd Strecker |year=1996 |title=A Green President? |journal=Synthesis/Regeneration |volume=10 |url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/10/10-15.html |accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who wished to run a candidate for president continued to pursue the possibility. Working within their state parties, as well as through an independent organization called Third Parties '96,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/spc/tp96/ |title=Third Parties '96|accessdate=2008-09-18 |publisher=Third Parties '96}}&lt;/ref&gt; they convinced [[Ralph Nader]] to accept placement on the [[Green Party of California|Green Party of California's]] March 1996 primary ballot. Eventually he accepted placement on more ballots, but ran a limited campaign with a self-imposed campaign spending limit of $5,000 (which allowed him to avoid being subject to the obligation to file campaign finance statements with the FEC). He chose [[Winona LaDuke]] as his vice-presidential candidate. A convention was held at UCLA in Los Angeles on August 20, 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gp.org/convention1996.shtml |title=Green Party 1996 Convention|publisher=Gp.org|accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Nader accepted the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y11hsopqmlU   |title=Green Party 1996 Convention Ralph Nader Acceptance Speech|accessdate=2008-09-18 |publisher=Green Party of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2016}} Nader/LaDuke were on the ballot in twenty-two states and received 685,297 votes, or 0.7% of all votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1996&amp;f=0 |title=1996 Presidential General Election Results |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=Atlas of US Presidential Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000 Presidential Election===
In September 1998, the New Mexico Green Party proposed that an ASGP Presidential Exploratory Committee be established for the 2000 elections. The ASGP Coordinating Committee agreed and in December the ASGP Steering Committee appointed a seven-person committee. In February 1999 it sent out a letter questionnaire to potential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/greenltr.html|title=ASGP letter sent on Feb. 22, 1999|first=|last=jdoe|work=gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair appeared on 44 state ballots and received 2,883,105 votes, or 2.7 percent of all votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0&amp;f=0 |title=2000 Presidential General Election Results |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=Atlas of US Presidential Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Republican candidate [[George W. Bush]]'s tiny margin of victory in Florida and New Hampshire,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amarkfoundation.org/pdf/ralph-nader-potential-impact-2000-election-mar-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; some Democrats accused Nader of "[[Spoiler effect|spoiling]]" the election of [[Al Gore]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee.

===2004 Presidential Election===
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], the candidate of the Green Party of the United States for [[President of the United States|President]] was [[Texas]] attorney and GPUS legal counsel [[David Cobb]], and its candidate for vice-president was labor activist [[Pat LaMarche]] of [[Maine]].

In the Summer of 2003 the  Greens began an debate on party presidential strategy. Interest groups were pressuring the Green Party and Ralph Nader not to run a presidential ticket. In response, a section of U.S. Greens issued the statement "Green &amp; Growing: 2004 in Perspective".&lt;ref&gt;Manski, Ben. "[http://www.greens.org/s-r/greengrow2004.html Green &amp; Growing: 2004 in Perspective]". Greens.org. June 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Christmas Eve]] 2003, Ralph Nader declared that he would not seek the Green Party's nomination for president in 2004, and in February 2004 announced his intention to run as an independent. However he did seek endorsement (rather than the nomination) of the Green Party and other third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nader won't run for Green Party {{!}} StAugustine.com|url = http://staugustine.com/stories/122403/nat_2019597.shtml|website = staugustine.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = ELIZABETH|last = WOLFE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cobb-LaMarche ticket in 2004 appeared on 28 of the 51 ballots around the country, down from the Greens' 44 in 2000; the Nader-Camejo ticket in 2004 appeared on 35 ballots.  In 2004, Cobb was on the ballot in California (and Nader was not), whereas Nader was on the ballot in New York (and Cobb was not).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Cobb-LaMarche received 119,859 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History Highlights {{!}}|url = http://greenpagesnews.org/2014/07/22/history-highlights/|website = greenpagesnews.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Greens were not discouraged by the relatively low presidential vote yield in 2004 for Cobb and for Nader, because the Green Party continued to grow in many parts of the country, increasing Green Party affiliation numbers and fielding Green candidates for congressional, state, and local offices. Nader, running in most states as an independent (but with high-profile Green Party activist Peter Camejo as his running mate), received 465,650 votes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The number of registered Greens declined by about 23,000 between January 2004 and March 2005, in contrast to a previous period of uninterrupted growth from 1998; the number of Green candidacies declined compared to 2002, and these candidates fared worse than in the past, particularly during the presidential campaign cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Steve (March 20, 2005) [http://www.counterpunch.org/greenfield03192005.html "The Decline of the Green Party."] CommonDreams.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endorsement versus nomination controversy====
Nader announced that he would run as an independent candidate (he had never become a party member).  Later he explained that he was not seeking the Green Party's nomination, but would (as an independent) seek the party's "endorsement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USATODAY.com - Green Party debates picking own candidate or endorsing Nader|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-05-27-green-party_x.htm|website = usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factions within the party which had been lining up behind potential candidates solidified into a camp favoring a Nader endorsement and a camp favoring nominating an actual Green Party member (the latter favoring primarily David Cobb).

On June 26, 2004, the Green National Convention nominated Cobb, who promised to focus on building the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USATODAY.com - Greens reject Nader endorsement, back one of their own|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-06-26-greens_x.htm|website = usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nader vs. the Green Party?|url = http://www.salon.com/2004/06/24/cobb_campaign/|website = Salon|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = Jeff|last = Horwitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just over a third of the delegates voted "No Nominee" with the intent to later vote for a Nader endorsement.  Pat LaMarche of Maine was nominated for vice-president.  Cobb and Nader emphasized different strategies. Cobb promised to run a "strategic states" campaign based on the preferences and needs of the individual state Green parties; as a result, Cobb campaigned heavily in some battleground states and not in others.  Nader intended to run a national multiparty ticket uniting the Greens with other parties.

After David Cobb received the party's 2004 presidential nomination at the Green National Convention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gp.org/convention2004/ |title=Green National Convention |publisher=Gp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102210335/http://www.gp.org//convention2004/ |archivedate=2010-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Milwaukee]], apparently in a show of unity, Nader's [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] running mate, [[Peter Camejo]], said, "I'm going to walk out of here arm in arm with David Cobb."  However, the nominating convention and the political discussions and maneuvering before it generated considerable controversy within the party. At issue was the apportionment of delegates and the method used to determine how many delegates each state received. The group Greens for Democracy and Independence, inspired by the principles in Peter Camejo's [[Avocado Declaration]] (in part a response to Nader's declaration not to seek the Green nomination), arose and became an organizing group for Greens disaffected with the internal policies and procedures of the GPUS, and sought reforms.

Two supporters of Camejo, Carol Miller and [[Forrest Hill (politician)|Forrest Hill]], wrote one of a number of articles printed after the convention, including ''Rigged Convention; Divided Party''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://counterpunch.org/miller08072004.html |title=Rigged Convention; Divided Party' |publisher=Counterpunch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810172241/http://www.counterpunch.org/miller08072004.html |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that the convention elections had been undemocratic. Many Green Party members were upset at the nomination convention's process and results, and some expressed "embarrassment" that Nader was not the party's 2004 candidate.

Other Green Party members responded&lt;ref&gt;[http://greensrespond.org/?q=node/6 "Response to Hill/Miller"] GreensRespond.com&lt;/ref&gt; that the analysis they gave in the article was fundamentally flawed&lt;ref&gt;[http://greensrespond.org/?q=node/2 "Forrest Hill (I)"] GreensRespond.com&lt;/ref&gt; to produce skewed results.  One such response was that of the national party Secretary, Greg Gerritt, who self-published a book on the subject, ''Green Party Tempest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpartytempest.org/ |title=Green Party Tempest |publisher=Green Party Tempest |date= |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 Elections===
The Greens fielded candidates in a number of races in 2006. The party won 66 races nationwide, including 21 in California and 11 in Wisconsin. One of the biggest victories included the election of [[Gayle McLaughlin]] as mayor in [[Richmond, California]]. Richmond now has become the first city with over 100,000 residents to have a Green mayor. In [[Maine]], [[Pat LaMarche]] received nearly 10% of the vote in the [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2006|state's gubernatorial race]] and the [[Maine Green Independent Party]] also won two seats on the Portland City Council. In the [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2006|Illinois governor's race]], candidate [[Rich Whitney]] received 10%, making the Green Party one of only three legally ''established'', statewide political parties in Illinois.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In [[Colorado's 1st congressional district|Colorado's First District]], Tom Kelly received 21% of the vote in his run for the [[U.S. Congress]].  However, the party lost its only elected state representative, [[John Eder]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Green Party of Pennsylvania]], faced with an exceptionally high ballot access petition requirement, chose to run Green Party [[organizer (party)|organizer]], [[Green Party of Pennsylvania|Carl Romanelli]], for U.S. Senate.  The race between incumbent, [[Rick Santorum]], and the son of a former Governor, [[Bob Casey, Jr.|Bob Casey]], was already prominent on the national scene.  Although a strong volunteer petition effort gathered 20,000 to 30,000 signatures, it was clear that paid petitioners would be needed to clear the 67,000 signature threshold.
After Romanelli filed 99,000 signatures the Democrats challenged the petitions, and the Judge ordered the lawyers and nine representatives from each side to work full-time reviewing signatures line by line, which continued for six weeks.  Near the end of September the Judge abruptly ruled that Romanelli would be removed from the ballot.  Following the controversial precedent set in the 2004 challenge to Nader's petitions in [[Pennsylvania]],  Romanelli and his lawyer were later assessed $81,000 for court costs and the challenger's expenses.  The Green Party, having no statewide candidates on the ballot to get the required vote threshold, lost its "minor party" status in Pennsylvania, leaving only two parties still recognized by the state.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Approximately 8.7 million Americans voted for withdrawal of U.S. troops from [[Iraq]] and for [[impeachment]] resolutions on local and state ballots that were initiated or supported by Greens. Troop withdrawal initiatives won in 34 of 42 localities in [[Wisconsin]], including [[Milwaukee]], [[Madison, WI|Madison]], and [[La Crosse, WI|La Crosse]], and all 11 communities in [[Illinois]], including [[Chicago]]. Of 139 cities and towns in [[Massachusetts]] voting on the troop withdrawal measures, only a handful voted nay on initiatives demanding that Congress and the [[White House]] end the war immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2006_11_09.shtml |title=Greens Advance on November 7, Prepare for 2008 National Run |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=Green Party of the United States |date=2006-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Presidential election===
In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], the Green Party nominated former six-term Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]] of Georgia as its 2008 [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nominee and [[Rosa Clemente]] as its 2008 [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] nominee at the party's 2008 National Convention on July 12, 2008 in Chicago, IL. McKinney received 161,797 votes [0.12%] nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orvetti |first=Peter |url=http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2009/08/fec-releases-official-popular-vote-count-from-2008-presidential-election/ |title=FEC releases official popular vote count from 2008 presidential election |publisher=Independentpoliticalreport.com |date=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Party of Minnesota]] hosted a Green Party Presidential Forum on Saturday January 5 in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mngreens.org/node/166 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121072644/http://www.mngreens.org/node/166 |date=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a January 13 presidential debate in [[San Francisco]], co-sponsored by the Green Party of [[Alameda County]], the San Francisco Green Party and the National Delegates Committee of the [[Green Party of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acgreens.wordpress.com/events/ |title=Green campaign 2008: a presidential debate that matters! |accessdate=2009-01-19 |publisher=Green Party of Alameda County }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 800 people attended, with most paying a suggested donation of $10 to $20 to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Delfin |last=Vigil |title=Green Party holds presidential debate in San Francisco |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/14/MNMOUEQ25.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc. |location=San Francisco, CA |page=A-8 |date =2008-01-14 |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-hour event was co-moderated by [[Cindy Sheehan]] and [[Aimee Allison]].

However, Nader and Gonzalez declined to seek the Green Party's nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alexovich |first=Ariel |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/nader-announces-vp-pick/ |title=Nader Announces Pick for Vice President - The Caucus - Politics - New York Times Blog |publisher=Thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not being a formally announced candidate at the time, Nader won the Feb. 5th California and Massachusetts Green Party primaries.

[[Samoa]], formally the [[samoa|Independent State of Samoa]], has a population of approximately 188,000 people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154400.htm|title=Samoa|author=|date=|website=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samoa gained independence from [[New Zealand]] in 1962&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Samoa A/HRC/WG.6/11/WSM/1 (2–13 May 2011), para 2, 11-12, 43-44, 46, 49, 51-53, 57, 69, 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; and has a Westminster model of Parliamentary democracy which incorporates aspects of traditional practices.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights, Pacific Humanitarian Protection Cluster, Human Rights Monitoring of Persons Internally Displaced by the 2009 Tsunami in Samoa (2010) at p 8, 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights Protection Party ([[Human Rights Protection Party|HRPP]]) is currently in government and has been so for over 20 years. In 2016, Samoa ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [[CRPD]] and the three optional protocols to the CRC &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

While the [[Constitution of Samoa|Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa]] provides for the protection of certain fundamental human rights, there continue to be several major issues. Major areas of concern include the under-representation of women, domestic violence and poor prison conditions. 
Reports issued under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] have noted that societal attitudes towards human rights tend to be sceptical, this is attributed to concern that that enforcement of such rights will be at the detriment of Samoan customs and tradition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; Another point of concern is [[LGBT rights in Samoa|Gay rights in the country]] as homosexuality is illegal.

Samoa is a member of the [[United Nations]] and has also ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]), the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]), the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ([[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|ICC]]) and the eight fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization ([[International Labour Organization|ILO]]).&lt;ref&gt;These include Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No. 87); Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98); Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29); Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105); Equal Remuneration Convention, 1950 (No. 100); Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111); Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) see  [http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?%28Samoa%29]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Samoa ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ([[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance|CPPED]]).

Due to limited resources, Samoa has previously failed to issue reports within the designated time frames of the conventions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"&gt;New Zealand Law Commission, Converging Currents: Custom and Human Rights in the Pacific (2006) at 5.35&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Samoa submitted its initial, second and third periodic reports under [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]] as one document in May 2003 when they were due in 1993, 1997 and 2001 respectively.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"/&gt;

Concern has been expressed in regard to Samoa’s limited incorporation of treaty obligations into its national law. For example, in 2005 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]] voiced concern over the lack of a time frame for reform of domestic legislation in conformity with the convention.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Thirty-second session 10–28 January 2005 at [19] [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/CEDAW-CC-WSM-0523820e.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to recommendations,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Summary of Stakeholder Submissions: Samoa A/HRC/ WG.6/11/WSM/3 (2–13 May 2011), para 7, 12-13, 15-16, 21, 27-29&lt;/ref&gt; Samoa issued a standing invitation to all [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Constitutional protection==
The [[Constitution of Samoa|Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa]] 1960 came into force in 1962&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/ws/legis/consol_act/cotisows1960535/ The Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708171858/http://www.paclii.org/ws/legis/consol_act/cotisows1960535/ |date=2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides for the protection of fundamental human rights such as:
*[[Right to life]] (section 5)
*Right to personal liberty (section 6)
*Freedom from inhuman treatment (section 7)
*Freedom from [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] (section 8)
*[[Right to a fair trial|Right to fair trial]] and [[due process]] (sections 9,10)
*[[Freedom of religion]] (sections 11,12)
*Rights regarding [[freedom of speech]], [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], [[Freedom of association|association]], [[Freedom of movement|movement]] and residence (section 13)
*Property rights (section 14)
*Freedom from discriminatory legislation (section 15)
While freedom from discrimination is provided for in regards to descent, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, social origin, place of birth and family status there is no protection from discrimination on the basis of disability or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

A noteworthy omission from the constitution is the right to be free from [[torture]].

==The Office of the Ombudsman==
Section 11 of the ''Komesina o Sulufaiga'' (Ombudsman) Act 1988 establishes the [[Ombudsman|Office of the Ombudsman]] as an independent body authorised to investigate complaints concerning the actions of governmental authorities within the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Komesina o Sulufaiga (Ombudsman) Act 1988, s 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In Samoa’s 2011 Universal Periodic Review ([[Universal Periodic Review|UPR]]), the Samoa Umbrella for Non-Governmental Organisations (SUNGO) was concerned that the office lacked accessibility due to minimal public awareness of the office’s functions and its limitation to the public sector.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==National human rights mechanisms==
While Samoa has no overarching human rights legislation or institution, there has been movement towards the creation of a Human Rights Commission ([[Human Rights Commission|HRC]]).
In 2009, a joint ‘Samoa Declaration’ was agreed upon amongst several Pacific island states.&lt;ref&gt;Samoa, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration emphasised the importance of national human rights institutions and encouraged states to establish such bodies.
Samoa has undertaken a Law and Justice Sector Plan 2008-2012 which is intended to include the establishment of a [[Human Rights Commission|HRC]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Samoa reiterated its intention to do so in the [[Universal Periodic Review|UPR]] in 2011 and received recommendations that it initially be established within the [[Ombudsman|Office of the Ombudsman]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; In 2013, the Parliament of Samoa passed the [http://www.parliament.gov.ws/images/ACTS/Acts_2013/Ombudsman_Komesina_o_Sulufaiga_Act_2013_-_Eng.pdf Ombudsman (Komesina O Sulufaiga) Act] to include human rights as part of the functions of the existing Ombudsman.

==Political participation==

===Electoral system===
[[Universal suffrage]] was achieved in 1991 for all Samoan citizens aged 21 years and over.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Samoan tradition is incorporated into the electoral system. Through consensus, a single person is nominated as the chief (''[[Fa'amatai|Maitai]]'') of each village and only those with a chieftain title may then stand for election of the 47 Samoan seats. Two seats are reserved for non-Samoans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

SUNGO has recommended that the electoral system be altered so as to allow any citizen to stand for election rather than restricting to only those nominated by the village.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

== Women's rights in politics ==
The level of female participation in [[Samoa]] politics is ranked as one of  the world's lowest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women's right to vote granted through the inception of universal suffrage in 1991 did little to improve women's participation  as the prerequisite to become a candidate in Parliament is being a ''[[Fa'amatai|Matai]]'' (chiefs)  and most  ''matais'' are men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Therefore, political participation has been a very slow process because women are constantly confronted with challenges and barriers created by traditions, social perceptions, lack of education, measures, policy interventions and much more.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; To address gender inequality and encourage women's rights in politics, interventions, advocate groups, legislation and treaties have been established. These include the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) and the Constitution Amendment Act (2013).

=== Right to vote ===
Since Samoa's independence in 1962, only [[Matai, Samoa|''matais'']] (chiefs) were granted voting rights for various elections at both national and local level.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women in Samoa: A country profile|last = United Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|first =|publisher = United Nations|year = 1997|isbn =|location = New York|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal suffrage was introduced in 1991 which granted both women and men aged 21 years and over with voting rights.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This was first executed in the 1991 elections.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Lafoa'i|first = Ioane|date = 1991|title = Universal Suffrage in Western Samoa: A Political Review|jstor=25169098|journal = The Journal of Pacific History|pages = 67–73|doi =10.1080/00223349108572684|issn = 0022-3344|pmid =|access-date =|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political participation ===
An issue exists in regards to the under-representation of women in Parliament. Although there are no legal barriers at the national level, in practice women rarely obtain chief titles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Compilation: Samoa A/HRC/ WG.6/11/WSM/2 (2–13 May 2011), para 27, 41-41&lt;/ref&gt; Following the general election of 2006, four women became members of the 49-member Parliament. This represented 8.1% of the available seats.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;Millennium Development Goals, Samoa’s Second Progress Report, 2010 at p 6, 28 [http://www.mof.gov.ws/Portals/195/Services/Aid%20Coordination/mdg_report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This low representation is thought to be influenced by socio-cultural attitudes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD" /&gt;  Some villages do not allow women to possess chieftain titles,&lt;ref name="ReferenceH" /&gt; while others such as [[Malie]], [[Letogo]], [[Tanugamanono]] and [[Saleimoa]] restrict female chieftain by prohibiting their participation in village councils. This reduces their ability to obtain village consensus for their candidacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

Despite the inception of universal suffrage, women's representation in the political realm in both local and national levels remain marginalized by chiefs in political decision-making processes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Electoral Act of 1963 imposes that only a ''matai'' is eligible to run or serve as a Member of Parliament.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = So'o|first = Asofou|last2 = Fraenkel|first2 = Jon|title = The role of ballot chiefs ( matai pälota ) and political parties in Sämoa's shift to universal suffrage|journal = Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics|volume = 43|issue = 3|pages = 333–361|doi = 10.1080/14662040500304973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In which case a large majority of ''matais'' are men.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tapuai: Samoan Worship|last = Le Tagaloa|first = Fanaafi|publisher = Malua Printing Press|year = 2003|isbn =|location = Malua Samoa|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limited number of women ''matais'' hinders the opportunity for women to  participate in politics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, despite male domination of chief titles, women ''matai'' numbers in 1993 were reported as 1,261 which was considered to be an improvement from earlier years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Norton|first = R|date = 1993|title = Annual Report of the Land and Titles Department: Titles, Wealth and Faction; Politics in a Samoan Village|url =|journal = Oceania|page = 102|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Local level ====
Male ''matais'' dominate most of the decision-making in village councils.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A limited number of female ''matais''  are a part of the village councils and women are gradually entering the village councils.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; There are 240 villages in Samoa with an average of 56 ''matais'' per village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Pulenu'u'' (village mayors) are elected by the village councils and are remunerated by the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, five pulenu'u were women which equated  3 per cent of the total pulenu'u population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As for women in village councils, one woman out of 229 village council members was recorded in 1994.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In 2011, an overall 10.5 per cent of chiefs were women and in the village councils, women made up the 36 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://asiapacific.unwomen.org/en/countries/fiji/co/samoa|title = Samoa|website = Field Office ESEAsia|access-date = 2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from research on women's participation in politics found that a low participation of women at the local level translates into the low population in national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture and the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development|first =|date = 2015|title = Village Government in Samoa: Do Women Participate|url = http://www2.pazifik-infostelle.org|journal =|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National level ====
Early evidence of women's representation in Parliament began in 1970 (see table below).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Honorable Taulapapa Faimaala was the first woman Member of Parliament (MP) in Samoa and served two terms. She was a pioneer for Samoan women as she was also the first Deputy Speaker of the House in 1973 until 1976.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Ten years later, her daughter [[Fiame Naomi Mata'afa|Honorable Fiame Naomi Mata'afa]] was elected as a MP and  is the longest standing woman in Parliament serving 30 years.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In 1998, Fiame became the first female Cabinet Minister who has served as the Minister for Education, Women, Community and Social Development. At present, Fiame is the Minister of Justice and Courts Administration.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Over the years there has been a notable increase of female candidates.There were 22 candidates in 1996 where 3 women were selected as cabinet members.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Most recently in [[Samoan general election, 2016|March 2016 elections]], a record breaking total of 24 candidates came forward in which 4 were elected.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samoaelection.ws/winners.cfm |title=Election 2016 |website=www.samoaelection.ws |access-date=2016-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309183120/http://www.samoaelection.ws/winners.cfm |archivedate=2011-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In adherence  to the 10 per cent quota codified in the Constitutional Amendment Act 2013, an additional woman will be added to Parliament due to the results of the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-05/samoan-ruling-party-set-for-landslide-victory-in-election/7223890|title = Samoan ruling party set for landslide victory in general elections|date = 2016-03-05|website = ABC News|language = en-AU|access-date = 2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table indicates that despite the relatively low number of female ''matais'', some women have been successful in national politics.

==== Limitations ====
Many academics have attempted to investigate the challenges women face entering politics  at all levels.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; These include cultural and circumstantial barriers and lack of policy interventions which have been reported to bring hindrance to women obtaining support from the villages,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; traditional leadership knowledge,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; mentor assistance and political networking.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Martire|first = Kiki|date = 2014|title = Challenges to Women in Political Leadership in Samoa|url = http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/1823|journal = Independence Study Project (ISP) Collection|series = Paper 1823|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cultural  barriers''' about a women's place in political spheres in both community and Parliament level are one of the major factors influencing women participation and public life.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Their primary traditional role was restricted to enhance and uphold family status.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Shardake|first = Andrew|last2 = Peter|first2 = Van Diermen|date = 1998|title = Influence of Culture and Gender Roles on Women Small Businesses in Western Samoa|url =|journal = Working paper|issue = 98/2|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic methods of upholding their customary role was through producing the ''ie toga'' (fine mats) which were the most valuable currency in Samoan social, economic and political sphere.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; More so, women are referred to as ''"o le pae ma le auli''" or the shell and the iron referring to their role as peacemakers who resolve conflicts within their family which is still evident today.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Latai|first = Latu|date = 2015|title = Changing Covenants in Samoa?

* '''Social perceptions''' of villages  in Samoa view women as supporters, organizers and campaign managers for their spouse or male relatives who are decision makers or political candidates.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
* '''A need of education and training measures''' to challenge social attitudes about women and decision making are necessary remedies to assist women's perspectives.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; There is a lack of educational opportunities to help promote young women attitudes and self-belief  as potential leaders or to introduce them to the concept of national politics.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Women who are not exposed to the ''matai'' language and protocols during their upbringing will play a vital role into future roles in politics.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In turn, does not provide women with the right resources and preparations to be involved in decision-making in ''matai'' council meetings.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Such knowledge and meaningful contribution to village rules and governance acquires mentorship and education from active women politicians.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* '''A lack of policy''' to initiate positive change to the low numbers of female participation was stated by [[UNICEF]] as a fundamental contributing factor.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Promoting women's representation ===
Ratification of certain treaties, legislation and establishment of a Ministry for Women are among many efforts that Samoa has taken to promote women roles and rights in politics.

==== Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development ====
The Samoan government established the Ministry of Women's Affairs  now referred to as the '''Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development (MWCSD)'''.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mwcsd.gov.ws/|title = Home {{!}} MWCSD - Ministry of Women Community  and  Social Development|website = www.mwcsd.gov.ws|access-date = 2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose according to the '''Ministry of Women's Affairs Amendment Act 1998''' was to empower women to fulfill their role in society and in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.palemene.ws/new/parliament-business/acts-regulations/acts-1998/|title = Acts 1998 {{!}} Parliament of Samoa|website = www.palemene.ws|access-date = 2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A division of women has been established under the governance of MWCSD, to act as the  "focal point" for the CEDAW that works in partnership with NGOs and other government departments.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = UNICEF|first =|date = 2006|title = A Situation Analysis of Children, Women &amp; Youth|url = http://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/Samoa_sitan.pdf|journal =|publisher = UNICEF|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ====
In September 1991, Samoa ratified the '''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)]]'''  to provide a human rights framework based on gender equality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tckqy2TMjqoC|title = Samoan Women: Widening Choices|last = Fairbairn-Dunlop|first = Peggy|date = 2003-01-01|publisher = {{no spam|editorips|usp.ac.fj}}|isbn = 9789820203600|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samoa was the first Pacific Island Country to become a party to CEDAW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Plmrana|first = Jalal|date = 2009|title = Why do we need a Pacific Regional Human Rights Commission?|url =|journal = Victoria University of Wellington law Review|series = 1|issue = 40|pages = 177–194|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In execution of Samoa's commitment to CEDAW, it must submit a report on the legislative, judicial, administration or other measures which it has adapted to give effect to CEDAW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ombudsman.gov.ws/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=115&amp;Itemid=147|title = CEDAW|last = Lova|first = Sialafua|website = www.ombudsman.gov.ws|access-date = 2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNICEF]], members and leaders of judicial, legal, management and community in Samoa society must understand CEDAW  to better implement and adhere to this convention.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Relevant to women participation in politics, Article 7 of CEDAW imposes governments to grant women with the right to vote, participate in forming and implementing government policies and to join public and political organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article7 |title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003 |website=www.un.org |access-date=2016-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=1 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Constitution Amendment Act (2013) ====
In June 2013, in response to recommendations for policy interventions to address gender imbalance, the Samoan government ratified  the Constitution Amendment Act (2013) (CAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.palemene.ws/new/parliament-business/acts-regulations/acts-2013/|title = Acts 2013 {{!}} Parliament of Samoa|website = www.palemene.ws|access-date = 2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established a 10 per cent quota system to reserve seats to women electoral candidates into the national legislative assembly.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pacwip.org/future-elections/samoa/|title = Pacific Women in Politics|website = Pacific Women in Politics|access-date = 2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It guarantees women representation if there is less than five seats elected, up to five seats will be reserved for women and if there are only two, then the three women with the next highest number of votes will be granted seats.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In adaptation of such constitutional mandate for female Parliamentarian seats,  Samoa has become the first independent country in the Pacific to do so.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  The Prime Minister [[Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi|Honorable Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi]] announced the Parliament's intention when seeking to implement the legislation:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"If we do not put in the necessary stipulation in our legislation one never knows whether in the next elections there [will] be absolutely no women in Parliament.

On the one hand, the amendment demonstrates a positive change for Samoa as it will improve women participation in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.idea.int/asia_pacific/samoa-new-quota-system-for-women-in-parliament-disguises-discriminatory-features.cfm|title = Samoa: Positive outcome for women disguises discriminatory features of reserved seats|website = International IDEA|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly referred to it  as  ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'a new dawn for women'''.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2013/July/Bill_to_reserve_seats_for_women_passed_by_Samoan_Parliament|title = Bill to reserve seats for women passed by Samoan Parliament|website = www.aph.gov.au|access-date = 2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However at the preliminary discussions before passing of the Bill, the opposition party  [[Tautua Samoa Party|Tautua Samoa]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; contended that there was a need to gather a consensus  and views from the villages  because some villages have banned women from holding ''matai'' titles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The quota was described as being 'minimal' and 'not enough' to make a real difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Baker|first = Kerryn|date = 2014|title = Explaining the outcome of gender quota campaigns in Samoa and Papua New Guinea|url =|journal =Political Science|doi = 10.1177/0032318714531428|pmid =|volume=66|pages=63–83}}&lt;!--|access-date = 1 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the amendment, annterview with a MP before  March 2016 elections stated that Samoan government are not actively executing their duty to address women's representation in politics despite their wish to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://asiapacificreport.nz/2016/03/08/equal-rights-but-were-not-using-it-says-new-samoan-woman-mp/|title = ‘Equal rights but we’re not using it,’ says new Samoan woman MP {{!}} Asia Pacific Report|last = Editor|first = P. M. C.|access-date = 2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view argued that although the amendment is a good start to counter political involvement, intervention is more needed to address cultural and tangible barriers to women as political leaders.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In adherence to the new law, the results of the March 2016 elections activated 10 per cent quota system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Four candidates were elected and as such a fifth female candidate will be added to Parliament using the highest votes percentage ratio as required by the amendment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Women's Rights ==

===Domestic violence===
[[Domestic violence]] against women remains a prominent issue in Samoa as recognised by its government&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; The ''Crimes Act 2013'' criminalizes rape, including marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.gov.ws/images/Acts_2013/Crimes_Act_2013_-_Eng.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accurate statistics are difficult to obtain as often cases are not reported or recorded due to societal attitudes that discourage this.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Altering such perspectives is identified as important in combating this problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, there has been a rise in the number of cases reported in recent years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This increase has been attributed to governmental departments and non-governmental organisations ([[Non-governmental organization|NGO’s]]) in implementing programmes that have created greater awareness of the issue and encouraged reporting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Samoa has established measures to aid in combating this problem such as:
*A National Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women (2008–2012) which outlines a strategic approach for the advancement of women’s rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
*The Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development (MWCSD) whose mandate focuses on the social and economic development of the community with an emphasis on the role of women. The ministry also undertakes awareness programmes on issues of domestic abuse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Samoa A/HRC/18/14 (2–13 May 2011), para 11, 16, 70&lt;/ref&gt;
*The finalisation of the Family Safety Bill 2009 is intended to give greater effect to CEDAW and CRC in relation to domestic violence issues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The enactment of the bill has been criticised as taking too long.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
*The Domestic Violence Unit operates within the Ministry of Police and Prisons and handles issues of violence against women and children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

{{See also|Outline of domestic violence}}

===Employment rights===
While women enjoy many of the same rights as men in terms of employment opportunities, there remain areas of discrimination. In 2007 it was reported that under national legislation women were restricted from undertaking night time work or manual labour that is deemed ‘unsuited to their physical capacity.’&lt;ref name="ReferenceI"&gt;UNDP Pacific/UNIFEM, Translating CEDAW Into Law, CEDAW Legislative Compliance in Nine Pacific Island Countries, Suva, Fiji, 2007, p. 302 [http://www.undppc.org.fj/_resources/article/files/TCL_Samoa_s.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen as inconsistent with article 11 of [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]] which prohibits discrimination in employment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceI"/&gt;

==Prison conditions==
The prison conditions in Samoa, most notably the main prison at ''Tafaigata'', are of low quality and the Samoan government has recognised the need to remedy the situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Prison facilities lack sufficient resources in regards to funding and the availability of trained personnel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  SUNGO reported that a number of prisons failed to adequately provide a sufficient quantity of basic necessities such as water, food and basic sanitation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; It has been noted that prison cells are holding large groups of prisoners beyond their capabilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While the Office of the [[Ombudsman]] is authorised to receive complaints from prisoners, this avenue has not yet been utilised.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Under the Law and Justice Sector Plan, the government is reviewing the Prison Act 1967&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and drafting legislation to move responsibility for the review of prisons away from the Ministry of Police and establish it within an independent authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

==Freedom of Religion==
Article 11 of the Constitution of Samoa&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa 1960&lt;/ref&gt;  guarantees Freedom of Religion.  The preamble to the 1960 Constitution enunciates Samoa as “an independent State based on Christian principles and Samoan custom and traditions”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The major issues concerning freedom of religion throughout the years gave rise to international criticism and international media coverage as well as legal battles.&lt;ref name=schaer/&gt;  These issues stem from the inconsistencies in theory, including a clear definition of what religious freedom is, the interpretation of Article 11 and practices in the local level in villages.

===Background and social structure===
Prior to its independence in 1962, Samoa underwent a lot of struggle through civil wars and the arrival of colonial powers in the 18th century further exacerbated the problem of [[tribal rivalry]].&lt;ref&gt;[An Account of Samoan History up to 1918]http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-TuvAcco-tl-body1]&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the rivalry between the colonists forced the indigenous groups to take sides creating further conflict between the indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Durix, [https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen/id/BLCP%3ACN044100435/The-Sky-Piercers-Lions-and-Aitu-Missions-and-Traditions/ The Sky-Piercers, Lions and Aitu Missions and 'Traditions' in Albert Wendt's Vision of a New Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt;   Colonisation came in the form of missionaries and traders in the 1830s and the arrival of the missionaries brought Christianity. However, it also generated change to Samoa not only of its traditional beliefs but also its world viewpoint.&lt;ref name=account/&gt;  Colonisation, eurocentrism and Christianity influenced Samoa tremendously; through westernisation of systems but also overtime; the erosion of traditional beliefs replaced by modernised Christian concept&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Durix, The Sky-Piercers, Lions and Aitu, Missions and 'Traditions' in Albert Wendt's Vision of a New Pacific, pp393-394&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as corruption of thought. The quick succession and acceptance of Christianity concomitant with the fulfilment of the prophecy of the legendary warrior goddess [[Nafanua]].  “…foretelling that chief Malietoa would gain power from heaven”.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Durix, The Sky-Piercers, Lions and Aitu, Missions and 'Traditions' in Albert Wendt's Vision of a New Pacific, p391&lt;/ref&gt;  Religion quickly became the core of Samoan life and the cornerstone of the villages. The three main denominations in Samoa are Congregational Christian Church, Methodist and Catholic since these were the first three arrived in Samoa, therefore the villages have a sense of loyalty to these three denominations giving rise to their dominance.&lt;ref name=account/&gt; Church ministers gain the highest prestige and in most villages; acquire the elite equivalent to the highest chief, with the villagers’ conviction that the true blessings from God is through subservient to the church. Almost all Samoans identify themselves as Christians.&lt;ref name=saada&gt;Saada Angelica, [http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1546&amp;context=isp_collection Samoa: A Truly Religious Place? Views Towards Religion in Samoa], S.I.T. Samoa, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schaer/&gt;   A Parliamentary Democracy with its legal system based on English Common law, Samoa was admitted to the [[United Nations]] in 1976. Samoa is made up of villages and each village has its own bylaws. These bylaws include which religion the village would accept for villagers to worship.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Ming C. Leung Wai, Attorney General of Samoa, Presentation at the 22nd Annual International Law and Religion Symposium, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been the traditional political system enshrined in their culture for 3,000 years and still practised today.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The village system comprises the ‘fono a matai’, or ‘fono a ali’i ma faipule’ the matai council literally meaning ‘the council of titled men’;&lt;ref name=account&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-TuvAcco-tl-body1|title=An Account of Samoan History up to 1918|author=|date=|website=victoria.ac.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ‘fono a matai’ underpins Samoan culture. This council is seen as the law in the villages making the fono the most powerful system in Samoa. They are responsible for making bylaws in which all the villagers abide, regulating the bylaws and rules and setting standardised penalties for violations of village bylaws. Communalism is deeply rooted in village life hence the fono is also accountable for peace and harmony of the village.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  The fono is governed under the “Village Fono Act 1990”.&lt;ref name="samoagovt.ws"/&gt;

===Freedom of Religion Versus Village Fono===
The Constitution of Samoa Article 11 guarantees protection of freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="samoagovt.ws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samoagovt.ws/|title=iPage|author=|date=|website=www.samoagovt.ws}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been under scrutiny with much heated debates for years, in its application versus the village fono bylaws.&lt;ref name="pireport.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pireport.org/articles/1998/11/11/samoan-church-leaders-disagree-religious-persecution-salamumu|title=SAMOAN CHURCH LEADERS DISAGREE WITH RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN SALAMUMU - Pacific Islands Report|author=|date=|website=www.pireport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Fepa'i Fiu Kolia, Secretary, National Council of Churches Samoa: The church and development, Samoan National Human Development Report, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although these rights are guaranteed; time and time again, violations of these rights are a norm in the local level with most incidents gone unreported; perhaps out of fear of reparations if they oppose the fono openly, or, the value of va-fealoa’i (relationships based on respect of age, gender, status) and so conformity and compliance out of respect for the fono is the usual individual response to rights violations. This is because almost all villages have agreed to the mainline denominations (CCC, Methodist, Catholic) to be the only denominations for the villagers to attend.&lt;ref name=saada/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Religious Freedom Report for 2013, United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor&lt;/ref&gt; In the village of Gataivai in Savai’i (Samoa’s biggest island), Methodist is the only denomination allowed whereas in Satupa’itea in Savai’i also where Catholic is the only denomination permitted. But, in the cases that have made the media limelight, for example the village of Salamumu;&lt;ref name="pireport.org"/&gt; where a new denomination was banned from holding bible studies in the village as Methodist is the only denomination allowed; four men of an evangelic church were hog-tied; carried to the public road and left there until rescued by a church minister who pleaded for the men’s lives.  The new church members’ houses were burnt by the village, their possession destroyed and members beaten including a pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="samoaobserver.ws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samoaobserver.ws/|title=Samoa Observer |author=|date=|website=www.samoaobserver.ws}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Sovita v Police,&lt;ref name=zoe/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; the defendants were chiefs and untitled men (taulele’a) of Salamumu village; who argued that they were acting on order and command from the decision made by the fono.  The case of Mau Sefo &amp; others v Attorney General, the village of Saipipi banished the plaintiffs from the village for executing bible studies and worship services other than the three (mainline denominations) sanctioned. Furthermore, in the case of Tariu Tuivaiti v Sila Faamalaga &amp; Others, “the plaintiffs were banished from the village of Matautu Falelatai for failing to attend church”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samlii.org/ws/indices/cases/WS_LR_Vol6.html|title=Samoa - Index to Western Samoa Law Reports - 1980-1993|author=|date=|website=www.samlii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Courts are ruling in favour of fundamental rights including freedom of religion under the Constitution, only a few cases make it to court.

There are a number of reasons why people refrain from seeking legal remedies or advice. It is clear that at the village fono and on the local level, article 11 of the Constitution is hardly appreciated.&lt;ref name=schaer&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=3005797|title=The religious clashes disturbing a Pacific Island paradise|first=CATHRIN|last=SCHAER|date=22 November 2002|publisher=|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned issues between Christian denominations raises questions of “How religious are Samoans?” and “what Christian principles practised?” as Samoa claim to be a religious nation and these problems contradict the Constitution; of “Samoa is founded on God based on Christian principles and Samoan custom and tradition”. The survey by Angelica Saada titled ‘Samoa: A truly Religious Place? Views Towards Religion in Samoa’,&lt;ref name=saada/&gt; is an endeavour to provide answers to a conflicting Constitution. The lawsuits and village bylaws prove that the individual rights are indeed unprotected. There is an immense gap between the Constitution and the village bylaws. The media also must be commended,&lt;ref name="samoaobserver.ws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pireport.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radionz.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/|title=Radio New Zealand|author=|date=|website=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they bring these delicate issues into the public sphere.  In the most publicized Salamumu 1998 incident opened discussions, and, the response to the citizens outcry and international denunciation sparked the Cabinet to set up a Commission of Inquiry in 2010 “…to inquire and report on the working of Article 11 of the Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa in relation to the right to freedom of religion”,.&lt;ref&gt;Freedom of Religion in International Human Rights Law, Human Rights Law Resource Centre Ltd, Melbourne, Australia, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ming C. Leung Wai, Attorney General of Samoa&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, critics must not shift the blame to the village fono, as the key to understanding is education. This is where the government is lacking. It is well enough to have guarantee on the protection of fundamental rights, but understanding on application of these rights on the local level have never been clear. It is the government’s responsibility therefore to provide and facilitate discussion and education for the villages on how these rights can be protected and how they can be enhanced by the fono. Bryan Zoe, in her study on “Prosecution of Religious Minorities in Samoa: The Baha’i Struggle to Face a Common Problem”, provide a lot of insight into gaining understanding of the different beliefs and education in other religions other than Christianity.&lt;ref name=zoe&gt;Bryan Zoe, [http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1926&amp;context=isp_collection Persecution of Religious Minorities in Samoa: The Baha'i's Struggle to Face a Common Problem], S.I.T Graduate Institute, Digital Collection, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Imam Mohammed Yahya also suggests the importance of gaining knowledge into other faiths will create greater understanding.&lt;ref name="radionz.co.nz"/&gt; Dr Bin Yahya also said that ‘the only Christian church to invite him to talk about Islam was the Methodist Theological College’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samoa’s constitutional amendment and its international obligations===
There is another dangerous issue lurking in Samoa’s Constitution. In December 2016, a bill to amend the Constitution was introduced to Parliament and in 2017, the Constitutional Amendment passed.&lt;ref name="samoaobserver.ws"/&gt; In the preamble, religious freedom was open to interpretation whereas the Constitutional Amendment now is more specific; and enshrined into law. It is now definite to: “Samoa is founded on God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit”.&lt;ref name="samoagovt.ws"/&gt; While village bylaws are now more lenient to religious freedom of Christian individuals; due to a lot of negative publicity and criticism, they are still intolerant to religious freedom of minority non-Christian beliefs. The Constitution Amendment further suppress religious freedom of these communities.&lt;ref name="radionz.co.nz"/&gt; In the 2013 Samoa International Religious Freedom Report, it is clear that the vast majority of Samoa are unwilling to accept non-Christian beliefs let alone their religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Samoa, 2013 International Religious Freedom Report, United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor&lt;/ref&gt; Section 3 of the same report states; "Prominent societal leaders repeatedly emphasized in public that the country was Christian. Public discussion of religious issues sometimes included negative references to non-Christian religions". Although there are limitations to the freedom, there has never been any issues or conflicts from the non-Christian community like the Baha’i Faith and Islam; that would pose any threats to Christians in Samoa. Their principles in particular the Baha’i Faith, consist of universal peace, oneness, equality, the abolitions of religious, racial, political and patriotic prejudice;&lt;ref name=zoe/&gt; to name a few. These are the true attributes and values towards peace and harmony in any society. What is more critical is the role of the Samoan National Council of Churches as they put a lot of pressure on the government to ban non-Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name=radionz2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/304203/call-to-ban-islam-in-samoa-put-down-to-ignorance|title=Call to ban Islam in Samoa put down to ignorance|author=|date=19 May 2016|website=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Samoa parliament is a one-party government and even more contradictory is the religious freedom issue and the mandate of the reigning party;&lt;ref name=littleproblem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samoaobserver.ws/en/30_12_2016/editorial/15405/Only-a-complete-elimination-of-bureaucratic-corruption-can-solve-Samoa%E2%80%99s-little-problem.htm|title=Only a complete elimination of bureaucratic corruption can solve Samoa’s little problem|publisher=samoaobserver.ws|date=30 December 2016|author=Gatoaitele Savea Sano Malifa|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP). The new amendment not only threatens the core principles of democracy, it allows violation of religious freedom of non-Christian communities,&lt;ref name=radionz2/&gt; a breach of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in which Samoa acceded in 2008. Also, under democracy, wouldn’t something so significant like amendment to a constitution be done through a citizens referendum? Part XI, General and Miscellaneous provision, Article 109(1) of the Samoa Constitutional, states: (1) “Any of the provisions of this Constitution may be amended or repealed by Act, and new provisions may be inserted in this Constitution by Act, if a bill for any such purpose is supported at its third reading by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total Members of Parliament…”, this provision legitimises the Parliaments actions but further violates the citizens political rights. What is more concerning is there is no opposition party and so any Acts of Parliament would not be voted against unless it is a conscious vote.&lt;ref name=littleproblem/&gt; A Constitution amendment without a citizens' referendum is justifiable under the above provision.&lt;ref&gt;Article 109 of the Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Religious freedom for the non-Christian minorities are not guaranteed under the New Constitution Amendment. Christians have the new amended Constitution to support and protect them (hence the National Council of Churches are calling to ban Islam from Samoa); whereas non-Christians will be challenged in courts.  Imam Mohammed Bin Yahya raised another valid question: “Will the new amendment jeopardise Samoa’s relationships and aid from non-Christian countries like China and Japan?” Meanwhile, despite the Prime Minister saying that the amendment “would unlikely touch Article 11”, there is an international outcry and calls from scholars in Samoa and abroad with concern over the Samoa Constitution Amendment. In the Samoa Observer editorial 30/2/2016, Gatoaitele Savea Sano Malifa stated that “The aim of Prime Minister Tuilaepa’s Constitution Amendment is to declare the dominance of Christianity in Samoa”. Therefore, religious freedom of non-Christian minorities faces uncertainty under the amended Constitution and it appears that violation of fundamental human rights like freedom of religion will soon be lawful in Samoa.

==Disabled persons==
Based on statistics from 2006, there are approximately 2100 persons living with disabilities in Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.gov.ws/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xZE7Ip3423g%3D&amp;tabid=3615&amp;language=en-NZ|title=Samoa National Population and Housing Census 2006|author=|date=|website=sbs.gov.ws|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308224619/http://www.sbs.gov.ws/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xZE7Ip3423g%3D&amp;tabid=3615&amp;language=en-NZ|archivedate=2010-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of persons with [[Disability|disabilities]] and nor is it a basis for freedom from discrimination in Samoa’s constitution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Samoa is not a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ([[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|CRPD]]) yet has indicated that they would consider acceding to it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Samoa has set up a National Disabilities Taskforce which constructs programmes that provide assistance to persons with disabilities. This is guided by the National Policy and National Plan of Action for Persons with Disabilities set up in 2009.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Rights of the child==
The issue of [[Hawker (trade)|child street vendors]] in Samoa has been acknowledged with growing concern.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; SUNGO submits that by allowing this issue to continue, Samoa is acting contrary its obligations under both the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] in regards to the right to education and the convention of the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] in regards to freedom from exploitative labour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Reports suggest that issues of poverty and hardship contribute to the existence of child street vendors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; Samoa has a National Policy for Children 2010-2015 which is aimed at alleviating poverty and providing protection to children through programmes and services.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

'''Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956''' (IPR 1956) is a resolution adopted by the Indian Parliament in April 1956. It was the first comprehensive statement on industrial development of India.&lt;ref&gt;http://eaindustry.nic.in/handbk/chap001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 1956 policy continued to constitute the basic economic policy for a long time. This fact has been confirmed in all the Five-Year Plans of India. According to this resolution the objective of the social and economic policy in India was the establishment of a socialistic pattern of society. It provided more powers to the governmental machinery. It laid down three categories of industries which were more sharply defined. These categories were:
# Schedule A: those industries which were to be an exclusive responsibility of the state.
# Schedule B: those which were to be progressively state-owned and in which the state would generally set up new enterprises, but in which private enterprise would be expected only to supplement the effort of the state; and
# Schedule C: all the remaining industries and their future development would, in general be left to the initiative and enterprise of the private sector.
Although there was a category of industries left to the private sector (Schedule C above), the sector was kept under state control through a system of licenses. In order to open new industry or to expand production, obtaining a license from the government was a prerequisite. Opening new industries in economically backward areas was incentivised through easy licensing and subsidization of critical inputs like electricity and water. This was done to counter regional disparities that existed in the country. Licenses to increase the production were issued only if the government was convinced that the economy required more of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncert.nic.in/ncerts/textbook/textbook.htm?keec1=0-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Fair and non-discriminatory treatment for the private sector, encouragement to village and small-scale enterprises, removing regional disparities, and the need for the provision of amenities for labor, and attitude to foreign capital were other salient features of the IPR 1956.

The Industrial Policy of 1956 is known as the economic constitution of the country.

'''Inequalities in rural and inner city education''' are large scale systemic [[Social inequality|inequalities]] between differing spatial [[education system]]s. The study of these differences, especially within [[rural area]]s, is relatively new and distinct from the study of [[educational inequality]] which focuses on individuals within an educational system.

== Academic achievement ==
Rural and inner-city students in the United States are under-performing academically compared to their suburban peers. Factors that influence this under-performance include funding, classroom environment, and the lessons taught.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Truscott|first=Diane M.|last2=Truscott|first2=Stephen D.|date=2005|title=Differing Circumstances, Shared Challenges: Finding Common Ground between Urban and Rural Schools|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=123–130|doi=10.1177/003172170508700208|issn=0031-7217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waxman|first=Hersholt C.|last2=Huang|first2=Shwu-Yong L.|date=1997|title=Classroom Instruction and Learning Environment Differences between Effective and Ineffective Urban Elementary Schools for African American Students|journal=Urban Education|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=7–44|doi=10.1177/0042085997032001002|issn=0042-0859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Low achievement rates can also be attributed, in part, to the schools themselves. Inner-city and rural students are more likely to live in low-income households and attend schools with fewer resources compared to suburban students.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Samuel S.|last2=Wang|first2=Margaret C.|last3=Walberg|first3=Herbert J.|date=1992|title=Demographic Disparities of Inner-City Eighth Graders|journal=Urban Education|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=441–459|doi=10.1177/0042085992026004008|issn=0042-0859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roscigno|first=Vincent J.|last2=Crowle|first2=Martha L.|date=2009-10-22|title=Rurality, Institutional Disadvantage, and Achievement/Attainment*|journal=Rural Sociology|language=en|volume=66|issue=2|pages=268–292|doi=10.1111/j.1549-0831.2001.tb00067.x|issn=0036-0112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roscigno|first=V.

When compared to suburban students, rural and inner-city students face similar achievement issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teacher-student interactions, the lessons taught, and knowledge about the surrounding community have shown to be important factors in helping offset the deficits faced in inner-city and urban schools.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; But drop-out rates are still high within both communities, as a more substantial number of minority students, who often live in these areas, drop-out of high school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study on inner-city, high school students showed that academic competency during freshman year has a positive impact on graduation rates, meaning that a students' early high school performance can be an indicator of how successful they will be in high school and if they will graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-05-01|title=Academic Risk Among Inner-City Adolescents: The Role of Personal Attributes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440500000327|journal=Journal of School Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=277–298|doi=10.1016/S0022-4405(00)00032-7|pmid=24839305|pmc=4023637|issn=0022-4405|last1=Ripple|first1=Carol H|last2=Luthar|first2=Suniya S}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the correct knowledge and understanding of the issues faced by these students, the deficits they face can be overcome.

=== Standardized Test ===
Achievement in the United States is often measured using [[standardized test]]s. Studies have shown that low performance on standardized tests can have a negative effect on the funding the school receives from the government, and low-income students have been shown to underperform on standardized tests at higher rates than their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Frank|date=2005|title=How do rural schools fare under a high-stakes testing regime?|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9778/6683b2a25e4ee65d69c892cea1016289f134.pdf#page=64|journal=Journal of Research in Rural Education|volume=20|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Jennifer|last2=Sohn|first2=Heeju|date=2014-04-01|title=Measure for Measure: How Proficiency-based Accountability Systems Affect Inequality in Academic Achievement|journal=Sociology of Education|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=125–141|doi=10.1177/0038040714525787|issn=0038-0407|pmc=4843844|pmid=27122642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study looking at how low test performance affected schools&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; found that schools that perform below average and are in low income areas can face repercussions that affect school funding and resources.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herman|first=Joan L.|last2=Golan|first2=Shari|date=2005-10-25|title=The Effects of Standardized Testing on Teaching and Schools|journal=Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=20–25|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3992.1993.tb00550.x|issn=0731-1745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that the material taught to students is affected by test performance, as schools that have low test scores will often change their curriculum to teach to the test.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Spatial inequalities ==
When looking at spatial inequalities, it is important to look from multiple [[Point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Some factors that are commonly included are [[demographics]], community atmosphere, school and family resources, dropout rates, spending per student, and family traits such as parental education. Currently, these, and other dimensions, are broadly grouped into two categories, "available resources" and "investment decisions". They each have their own effects, but also may cause and reinforce each other's existence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Available resources ===

==== School resources ====
In the same way some regions of the world have so called "[[brain drain]]", or the loss of wealthy, skilled, and educated individuals and their families to other countries through immigration, rural and inner city regions of the United States experience brain drain to sub-urban regions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGranahan|first=David A.|date=1980|title=The Spatial Structure of Income Distribution in Rural Regions|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=45|issue=2|pages=313–324|doi=10.2307/2095128|jstor=2095128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been shown that people become more likely to leave rural areas as their education level increases and less likely as they increase in age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Urban inner city areas have been decentralizing since the 1950s, losing their human capital. This flight of human capital leaves only the poor and disadvantaged behind to contribute to school funding resulting in school systems that have very limited resources and financial difficulty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Education in the United States|American public school system]] is one in which the amount of wealth in a school district shapes the quality of the school because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Condron|first1=Dennis|title=Disparities Within: Unequal Spending and Achievement in an Urban School District|journal=Sociology of Education|date=2003|volume=76|issue=1|pages=18–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the school system's funding decreases, they are forced to do more with less. This frequently results in decreased [[student faculty ratio]]s and increased class sizes. Many schools are also forced to cut funding for the arts and enrichment programs which may be vital to academic success. Additionally, with decreased budgets, access to specialty and advanced classes for students who show high potential frequently decreases. A less obvious consequence of financial difficulty is difficulty in attracting new teachers and staff, especially those who are experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Family resources ====
It has been shown that the socioeconomic status of the family has a large correlation with both the academic achievement and attainment of the student. "The income defecate for inner city students is approximately $14,000 per year and $10,000 per year for the families of those living in the respective areas compared to the average income of families in sub-urban areas."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though, even within rural areas, there are differences in education and job choisis respective to demographics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

More well off sub-urban families can afford to spend money on their children's education in forms such as: private school, private tutoring, home lessons, and increased access to educational materials such as computers, books, educational toys, shows, and literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sub-urban families are also frequently able to provide larger amounts of [[social capital]] to their kids, such as increased use of "proper English", exposure to plays and museums, and familiarity with music, dance, and other such programs. Even more, inner city students are more likely to come from single parent homes and rural students are more likely to have siblings than their sub-urban peers decreasing the amount of investment per child their families are able to afford. This notion is called ''resource dilution'' which posits that families have finite levels of resources, such as time, energy and money. When sibship (amount of siblings) increases, resources for each child becomes diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downey|first1=Douglas|title=When Bigger is Not Better: Family Size, Parental Resources, and Children's Educational Performance|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1995|volume=60|issue=5|pages=746–761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Investment decisions ====
Even if families and schools have the same resources available to them, that doesn't mean they will use them in the same way, or to the same extent. Often, people need proof that there is a connection between investing resources and academic success before they do it. Investment decisions are a function of both resources available and political processes, in regards to distribution of public funds.

===== To the family =====
The investment a family puts into their child's education is largely reflective of the value the parent puts on education. The value placed on education is largely a combination of the parent's education level and the visual returns on education in the community the family lives in.

Sub-urban families tend to have parents with a much larger amount of education than families in rural and inner city locations. This allows sub-urban parents to have personal experience with returns on education as well as familiarity with educational systems and processes. In addition, parents can invest and transmit their own cultural capital to their children by taking them to museums, enrolling them in [[extracurricular activity|extra-curriculars]] or even having educational items in the house. In contrast, parents from rural and urban areas tend to have less education and little personal experience with its returns. The areas they live in also put very little value on education and reduce the incentive to gain it. This leads to families that could afford to invest greater resources in their children's education not to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== To the school =====
In the same way that a region or community that places little value on education may decrease a parent's willingness to invest in the education of their children, that community can reduce a school's willingness to allocate funding to provide advanced and in depth educational opportunities for its students. [[School board]]s tend to invest resources in response to the demands of the community, and their communities values have been changed due to the "brain drain" mentioned previously.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4243">The '''International Tin Council''' (ITC) was an organisation which acted on behalf of major [[tin]] producers and consumers to control the international tin market.

An ''International Tin Study Group'', which was established in 1947 to survey world supply of and demand for tin, led to the treaty, the '''International Tin Agreement''', signed in 1954, and the formation of the ITC in 1956.

The objectives were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1956/15.html&lt;/ref&gt;
#to prevent or alleviate widespread unemployment or under-employment and other serious difficulties which are likely to result from maladjustments between the supply of and the demand for tin;
#to prevent excessive fluctuations in the price of tin and to achieve a reasonable degree of stability of price on a basis which will secure long-term equilibrium between supply and demand;
#to ensure adequate supplies of tin at reasonable prices at all times; and
#to provide a framework for the consideration and development of measures to promote the progressively more economic production of tin while protecting tin deposits from unnecessary waste or premature abandonment.

After the 1954 agreement, 5 more agreements were signed every five years, in 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/world/agreements/prepareCreateTreatiesWorkspace/treatiesGeneralData.do?step=0&amp;redirect=true&amp;treatyId=8268&lt;/ref&gt;

By the sixth agreement, established at the United Nations Tin Conference, 1980,  new consumers included [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Ireland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], and [[Sweden]].  New producers were Australia, Brazil and [[Zaire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1283&amp;context=njilb&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times [[Guinea]], [[Mexico]], [[Republic of Korea]], the [[United Arab Republic]], [[Israel]], [[Liberia]], [[Panama]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], [[Poland]], the [[Philippines]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Romania]], [[Nicaragua]], [[German Democratic Republic]], and [[Austria]] held membership.

==Collapse==
With the advent of [[aluminium]] containers, the use of protective [[polymer]] lacquers inside cans, and increased recycling by industry, the demand for tin decreased considerably by the early 1980s, and in October 1985 the ITC could no longer maintain the price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tin/660798.pdf Tin Prices 1998 - Minerals, United States Geological Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually ran out of money buying up tin on the metals markets. Attempts to refinance the ITC were eventually abandoned, and since then, as with many other raw materials, the price has generally declined as alternatives become more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martha|first1=Rutsel Silvestre J|title=The Financial Obligation in International Law|date=31 May 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191055966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of Tin Producing Countries==
In 1984 an ''Association of Tin Producing Countries'' was created with members: Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, and Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1984/10.html “Agreement establishing the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATS 10 of 1984"].

City junctions are a major accident blackspot.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The collisions here can mostly be put down to driver distraction or misjudgement. Whereas humans often react too slowly, assistance systems are immune to that brief moment of shock.

The system monitors cross traffic in an intersection/road junction. If this anticipatory system detects a hazardous situation of this type, it prompts the driver to start emergency braking by activating visual and acoustic warnings and automatically engaging brakes.

[[File:Its-time-poster-small.gif|thumb|Campaign poster]]
'''It's Time''' was a successful political campaign run by the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) under [[Gough Whitlam]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1972|1972 election]] in Australia. Campaigning on the perceived need for change after 23 years of conservative ([[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]]) government, Labor put forward a raft of major policy proposals, accompanied by a television advertising campaign of prominent celebrities singing a jingle entitled "It's Time".&lt;ref name=ASO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/ads/alp-its-time/|title=Video Overview ALP: It’s Time (1972) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ultimately successful, as Labor picked up eight seats and won a majority. This was the first time Labor had been in government since it lost the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 election]] to the Liberal Party.

==Origins==
In the [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969 federal election]], the endorsed ALP candidate for the blue-ribbon Liberal seat of [[Division of Ryan|Ryan]], John Conn, then a lecturer at the University of Queensland, had employed a highly successful door-to-door campaign. For this, he had devised a pamphlet headed: 'It's Time for a Change' followed by a dot-point list of reasons, including education, the war in Vietnam, urban renewal, etc. He managed a swing of 19 per cent, by far the biggest in Queensland, forcing the incumbent, [[Nigel Drury]], to [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]] preferences for the first time. Soon afterwards, at a post-election occasion in Brisbane, John Conn was approached and congratulated by Gough Whitlam and [[Mick Young]] together. They enquired about the likely reasons for the successful local campaign. John Conn gave each of them a copy of his pamphlet. Mick Young asked if Labor could expect to see a similar effort in 1972. He was told yes but that a shorter, snappier version, 'It's time ...', might be more effective for the next campaign. The originator of the idea heard no more about it until the revamped slogan re-emerged in 1972. John Conn ran again for Ryan in 1972, gaining a further swing but not quite enough to win.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Campaign==
The slogan "It's Time", around which the three-stage campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitlam.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/185456/1_-_Full_1972_Campaign_Proposal_z.pdf|title=Full 1972 Campaign Proposal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built, was conceived by Paul Jones, at the time creative director at Sydney ad agency Hansen-Rubensohn–McCann-Erickson which was handling ALP's advertising account.&lt;ref name=ASO/&gt;&lt;ref name=CampaignBrief&gt;[http://www.campaignbrief.com/2007/02/its-time-to-rock-on-paul.html 'It's Time' to 'Rock on' Paul] ''Campaign Brief'', 8 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;[[Little Pattie|Patricia Amphlett]]: [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/timely-campaign-signalled-start-of-whitlams-cultural-sea-change-20121111-296bi.html Timely campaign signalled start of Whitlam's cultural sea change] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 12 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the campaign's first stage was to popularise the phrase while the television commercial served as the core element of the second stage.

As well as reaching its target demographic—loosely speaking, women and young people—, "the ad reached a far wider and probably quite unexpected segment of the electorate."&lt;ref name=ASO/&gt;

===Launch===
The ''It's Time'' campaign was first launched in [[Blacktown]], [[New South Wales]] in 1972. According to Whitlam himself, Blacktown was chosen because it "represented &amp;ndash; symbolised even &amp;ndash; the new outer suburbs of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Brisbane]] where we were building a new [[constituency]]. It typified all the [[Urban area|urban]] policy failures of the time, through lack of planning and misallocation of resources at both [[Government of Australia|Federal]] and [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|State]] government level."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bancroft.uws.edu.au:20018/logicrouter/servlet/LogicRouter?PAGE=object&amp;OUTPUTXSL=object.xsl&amp;pm_RC=REPOWPMDB&amp;pm_OI=7109&amp;pm_GT=Y&amp;pm_IAC=Y&amp;api_1=GET_OBJECT_XML&amp;num_result=0 ''Speech at Blacktown Expo Opening, 16 September 1993] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235216/http://bancroft.uws.edu.au:20018/logicrouter/servlet/LogicRouter?PAGE=object&amp;OUTPUTXSL=object.xsl&amp;pm_RC=REPOWPMDB&amp;pm_OI=7109&amp;pm_GT=Y&amp;pm_IAC=Y&amp;api_1=GET_OBJECT_XML&amp;num_result=0 |date=26 September 2007 }} The launch at Blacktown is generally seen as the beginning of the end for the Liberal Party led by [[William McMahon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech that [[Gough Whitlam]] delivered to the audience in the Blacktown Civic Centre was written for the Labor Party by [[Graham Freudenberg]], the advisor and speech writer to several successive Labor governments.

===Themes and policies===
The campaign concentrated heavily on the mistakes made by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] of the day, [[William McMahon]], with a special focus given to the areas of the [[Economic system|national economy]], [[health care]], [[city planning]] and the [[Vietnam War]], as well as Whitlam's ideas for governmental reform.

====Economic policy====
Whitlam put forward an [[Planned economy|economic plan]] as part of his ''It's Time'' speech that advocated strong, productive relationships between the public, industry and employees. He contended that only if strong economic growth was maintained, would policies in other areas be feasible. A restoration of genuine full employment along with a projected 6-7% growth of industry were predicted. He argued that his government need not increase taxation to achieve its goals.

====Health care reforms====
The Labor party planned to introduce a universal health insurance scheme, to which contributions would be made according to income, thus turning the old [[Health care|system]] on its head.

Gough Whitlam declared that the Labor party would set up an Australian Hospitals Commission to promote the modernisation and regionalisation of hospitals. The Commission would be concerned with more than just hospital services. Its concern and financial support would extend to the development of community-based health services and the sponsoring of preventative health programs. Labour encouraged sponsoring public nursing homes, and development of community health clinics.

====City planning====
Labor under Whitlam proposed co-operation with the States, local government and semi-government authorities in a major effort to reduce land and housing costs, and to retard rises in rates and [[local government]] charges. To this end they advocated the establishment of a new Ministry of Urban Affairs to analyse, research and co-ordinate plans for each city and region and to advise the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] on grants for urban purposes.

Whitlam claimed that the average cost of housing could be reduced by up to 20% by merely standardizing the reticulation and building and lending authority regulations. He also sought to lower interest payments by making them [[tax deduction|tax deductible]]. Labor committed itself to reducing the waiting time for a commission home to under twelve months.

====Vietnam War====
Whitlam promised an end to Australian involvement in the war in [[Vietnam]] and an end to [[conscription]] into the Australian [[armed forces]]. He underscored the relevance of treaties such as [[ANZUS]] to the [[defense (military)|defence]] of Australia, but also noted that beginning serious relations with China was in the country's best interest.

It was also announced that all of those previously imprisoned under the [[National Service Act 1964|National Service Act]] would be released.

====Social justice====
Whitlam asserted that education was to be the fastest growing [[public sector]] in Australia, should Labor gain power. In furtherance of this goal, he proposed the establishment of an Australian Schools Commission to examine and determine the needs of students in Government and non-government primary, secondary and technical schools. He promised to increase funding to schools, and to allocate it based on need, accusing his predecessor of having neglected some schools in favour of more prestigious ones.

Whitlam announced that [[pre-school]] education would be paid for by the state, and that child care would be heavily subsidised under a Labor government. He also said that university fees would be abolished from 1974.

The ALP saw a great weakness in Australian social welfare in that it relied almost wholly on the provision of cash benefits. Whitlam said he would establish an Australian Assistance Plan with the emphasis on providing social workers to provide advice, counselling and above all the sheer human contact that the under-privileged in the community needed. He also sought to unify the different social justice systems that were in place at that time. Under Labor, the pension rate would be raised to 25% of the average Australian male's earnings.

==Political climate==

===Leadership===
By 1972 Australia had been governed by the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal-Country coalition]] for 23 years. However, the Coalition had barely avoided a humiliating defeat when it suffered an 18-seat swing in the [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969]] [[Political campaign|election campaign]]—one of the largest swings against a government that still managed to keep power.  Labor actually won a majority of the two-party vote; had it been able to overcome [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]] preferences in four [[Melbourne]]-area seats, Whitlam would have become [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].

After the election, Liberal Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] was unable to get the better of Whitlam.  Over the next two years, the Coalition fell further behind Labor in the polls, and Gorton resigned in 1971 after a tied [[vote of no confidence]] in the Liberal caucus. However, his successor, [[William McMahon]], was indecisive, and failed to deliver on many of the Coalition's campaign promises.  McMahon was also unable to get the better of Whitlam; his skills as an [[orator]] were no match for Whitlam's abilities. One of his own most cited quotes pointed out his indecisive nature.

===Foreign relations===
The Coalition had focused heavily on relations with the United States since the [[World War II|Second World War]] to bring Australia under their defence umbrella. Under the auspices of [[ANZUS]], Australia had sent over fifty thousand troops to [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] in support of the South Vietnamese forces. The Australian government did not recognise the sovereignty of several [[communist bloc]] states including the [[German Democratic Republic]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].

[[Apartheid]] in South Africa was becoming a huge source of controversy, and there was wide public support in Australia to increase sanctions against the white government there, particularly with respect to their sports teams.

===Economy===
Unemployment was 2.5% and inflation was sitting on 6.1%. The [[Australian Dollar]] bought 1.93 [[US Dollars]], 362 [[Yen]] or 1.97 Pounds Sterling. A general downturn in the western economies of the world, and the rising price of oil were contributing to a poor financial situation for Australia.

==Success==
Labor received 49.7 per cent of the primary vote, leaving the Liberal-[[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] coalition with just 41.4 per cent. Labor, with 67 of 125 seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], now controlled Australia's [[lower house]] of [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] by a margin of nine seats. The overall swing to Labor on 2 December was 2.5 per cent. Labor lost four seats while gaining twelve.

The 1972 election was the first ALP victory since [[Australian federal election, 1946|1946]]. Its success is usually attributed to both the ''It's Time'' campaign, and Whitlam's skills as an orator, though [[Graham Freudenberg]] had a major influence on many speeches given by members of the ALP during the ''It's Time'' campaign. The campaign helped the ALP to establish new voter constituencies, particularly in outer lying areas of Australia's major population centres, who until then were to a large extent marginalised by the major parties.

On his first day in office as Prime Minister of Australia, Whitlam declared an end to [[conscription]] and began arranging for those imprisoned for avoiding the draft to be released and compensated. During the next few weeks he implemented a range of new measures including the establishment of an [[Order of Australia|Australian honours system]] and the banning of racially selected sporting teams, a move intended to impede the South African Apartheid policy. [[East Germany]] and the People's Republic of China were also recognised for the first time by an Australian government.

==Reforms==

During its time in office, the Whitlam Government embarked on an ambitious program of social reform in keeping with the promise of change that the ALP campaign emphasised. The social radicalism of the Whitlam Government was such that, during its first thirteen days in office, some forty important decisions had been made.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The death of social democracy: political consequences in the 21st century by Ashley Lavelle&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by one historian, "Labor’s extensive reforms during its first term in office were the high water mark of Australian postwar social democracy."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Labor's Conflict: Big Business, Workers and the Politics of Class by Tom Bramble and Rick Kuhn&lt;/ref&gt; On coming to office, the Whitlam Government granted federal public servants paid maternity leave, a thirty-six-and-a-quarter-hour workweek, large wage rises and four weeks annual leave. Free tertiary education was introduced, together with a [[universal health care]] system and a sole parent pension. Laws were also passed providing for [[equal pay for women]] and national land rights, divorce laws were made more liberal, and legislation against racial discrimination was introduced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In addition, the principle of equal pay was extended, occupational health and safety was improved, annual leave loading was introduced, trade union education was established, four weeks of annual leave was achieved as a national standard,&lt;ref&gt;hawke government.&lt;/ref&gt; military conscription was abolished and Australian troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, a separate ministry responsible for Aboriginal affairs was established, controls on foreign ownership of Australian resources were put in place, laws against sexual discrimination were passed, maternity leave and benefits for single mothers were extended, an attempt was made to democratise the electoral system through the introduction of one-vote-one-value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/whitlam/policies.shtml|title=The Whitlam Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Community Health Program was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-xe_JxQmgYC&amp;pg=PA140|title=The People's Health: Public Health in Australia, 1950 to the Present, [Part ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social services were also significantly expanded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BtMQsESYcWwC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=gough+whitlam+welfare+state+expansion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_t89U4ueNKPY7Aar04EQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gough%20whitlam%20welfare%20state%20expansion&amp;f=false|title=The Welfare State as Crisis Manager|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with big improvements in the real value of social security payments,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2012/no.6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; spending on housing quadrupled, education outlays doubled, and federal health expenditure rising by 20%&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; A Department of Aboriginal Affairs was also established, while Australia's first federal legislation on human rights, the environment and heritage was initiated.&lt;ref&gt;http://static.moadoph.gov.au/ophgovau/media/images/apmc/docs/21-Whitlam-Web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant amount of legislation was passed altogether from 1972 to 1975, with 221 acts passed by parliament in 1973 alone,&lt;ref&gt;Australia's Prime Ministers: From Barton to Howard by Brian Carroll&lt;/ref&gt; while the welfare state was significantly extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1301.01974?OpenDocument|title=1301.0 -  Year Book Australia, 1974|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/EBDEF85F8B618262CA2573A9001E1BA5/$File/13010_1974_chapter13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facs.gov.au/about/publicationsarticles/research/occasional/Documents/op12/sec2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322172641/http://www.facs.gov.au/about/publicationsarticles/research/occasional/Documents/op12/sec2.htm |archivedate=22 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public spending was raised significantly, with the 1973 budget quadrupling spending on housing, tripling outlays on urban development, and doubling spending on education.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Through initiatives such as the Australian Assistance Plan and the Regional Employment Development scheme, employment opportunities were expanded and funds allocated towards improving services and amenities in deprived areas, as characterised by the construction of new health centres, community houses, legal services, footpaths, sewers, streetlights, and public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QRzB9UOECQC&amp;pg=PA54|title=The Lowest Rung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, one observer praised the Australian Assistance Plan for generating

“much more general acceptance of the concepts of welfare for the community and local participation. Moreover, a great deal had actually happened. During the year 1975-76, 1408 grants for community welfare projects were approved by the Social Security Department. A detailed list of AAP projects includes projects relating to citizens’ advice bureaus, community centres, and resource centres, projects to aid families, women, children, young people, the aged, the handicapped, migrants and the needy. It would be difficult to refute the conclusion that the sum of $6.6 million granted to Regional Councils of Social Development in 1975-76 promoted a very large amount of constructive welfare activity because it was spent in support of local and often voluntary efforts.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Broadcast and television license fees were abolished,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/A-year-of-change/2004/12/31/1104344989892.html|title=A year of change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a wide range of new benefits were introduced, such as a handicapped child's allowance, a special orphan's pension, and the Supporting Mothers Benefit. Rates of sickness and unemployment benefits were increased to bring them in line with other social security benefits, while funding was provided for child care, women's refuges, and community health programs. The means test for pensioners over the age of seventy-five was abolished in 1973, and in 1975 the means test was abolished for all pensioners over the age of seventy. As a result of the welfare measures undertaken by the Whitlam Government, social expenditures as a percentage of GDP rose from 12.5% to 17.6% during its time in office.&lt;ref&gt;''Developments in Australian Politics'' by Judith Brett, James A. Gillespie, and Murray Goot&lt;/ref&gt;

Needs-based funding for schools was implemented, spending on technical colleges (including the construction of residential accommodation for students) was significantly increased, and special initiatives for the handicapped, Aborigines, and isolated children were introduced. Farmers benefited from tariff cuts and additional markets established by the Whitlam Government's trade and diplomatic initiatives, together with higher spending on regional education and health, rural research, and other upgraded country facilities. A number of measures were also undertaken to enhance women's rights. International conventions on equal pay, discrimination, and the political rights of women were ratified. New health centres and many women's refuges were established throughout Australia, together with a pre-school and child care program which catered for 100,000 children.&lt;ref&gt;Ross McMullin, The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891-1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1973, the service pension was extended to war widows, and in September that year the means test on service pensions was abolished for recipients over the age of 74. In May 1975 the means test was abolished for the age group 70–74 years. Free artificial limbs were also made available through the repatriation artificial limb and appliance centre to all amputees, while free medical and hospital treatment was introduced for veterans of both the Great War and the Boer War and for ex-prisoners of war. The Mental Health and Related Community Services Act of 1973 made grants available to the states for the provision of community-oriented services for drug, alcohol, and mental problems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;The Whitlam Government 1972-1975 by Gough Whitlam&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the age limit of 21 years was removed for the payment of additional pension for full-time students and for the payment of guardian's allowance or mother's allowance, and provision was made for payment of additional benefit for a child to continue after their 16th birthday and without limitation on age if the child was a dependent full-time student.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/05_2012/op12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The government introduced reforms for the superannuation arrangements of its own employees. In July 1973, for instance, the government financed element of pensions was properly indexed against changes in the cost of living for the first time. In August 1973, fair rent provisions for houses and flats were introduced, while a separate housing list for needy families was introduced. In 1974, a generous rental rebate scheme and improved concessions on government loans were introduced to benefit low income earners. Funds were provided to improve the education of handicapped children, while money was also made available for upgrading accommodation in homeless persons’ centres, while finance was also made available to centres on a pro rata basis for the provision of meals and accommodation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; An Office of Women's Affairs was established to help women achieve equality, while the Legal Aid Office was set up to provide legal representation for those who couldn’t afford it.&lt;ref name="stage6.pbworks.com"&gt;http://stage6.pbworks.com/f/Whitlam+Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Trade Practices Act, passed in 1974, was aimed at promoting competition in the economy and to improve consumer safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/gough-whitlams-life-and-legacy-experts-respond-33228|title=Gough Whitlam's life and legacy: experts respond|author=Anne-marie Boxall|date=21 October 2014|work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding on the arts was doubled, and both FM radio and radio station 2JJ were introduced, the latter in Sydney as part of a plan for a national youth radio network.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-29699576|title=Gough Whitlam: Five ways he changed Australia|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were also made. The Act was revised to require the democratic control of unions by their rank-and-file members, to require that a union's rules should provide for full participation of its members in its affairs, and prohibited the dismissal of an elected official “unless he is found guilty of misappropriation of funds, gross misbehaviour or gross neglect of duty.” The Act was also revised to prevent returning officers from rejecting a defective nomination “without giving the candidate seven days in which to correct the defect,” to debar union officials from rejecting a rival's nomination for office, and to prohibit a union official or employee “being appointed as that union’s returning officer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C3TWOl3cNuAC&amp;pg=PA202-IA14&amp;dq=clyde+cameron+conciliation+and+arbitration&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD7_P2nPPKAhWEPRoKHUTOCPYQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=clyde%20cameron%20conciliation%20and%20arbitration&amp;f=false|title=A Life on the Left|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tariffs for farming implements and equipment were reduced, and farm incomes more than trebled during Whitlam's time in office. In 1973, a payment of emergency adjustment assistance was initiated to benefit canning-fruit growers and growers of pears and apples, while the Dairy Adjustment Act of 1974 provided generous assistance for financially unsound dairy farms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; A number of environmental measures were also implemented by the Whitlam Government. In 1974, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act was passed, which was the first piece of Commonwealth legislation to specifically address environmental issues, and set up procedures to review the environmental impact of development proposals which involved Commonwealth Government decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZvjzHSlR70C&amp;pg=PA402|title=Year Book Australia, 1992 No. 75|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the federal government awarded $100,000 in grants to environmental centres throughout Australia, the first action of its kind in Australia. In 1975, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act was passed, which allowed for the establishment of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTSV0kXgQzYC&amp;pg=PA219|title=Australia, Oceania, and Antarctica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supporting Mother's Benefit was introduced in 1973 to alleviate financial deprivation among women whose de facto husbands were in jail, deserted de facto wives, unmarried mothers and other wives separated from their husbands who, for other reasons, were not eligible for the widows’ pension. The Double Orphans’ pension was introduced that same year, providing $10 a week to the guardian of an orphan who had lost both parents. The Handicapped Children's Allowance, introduced a year later, provided $10 a week to the guardians of severely physically or mentally handicapped children who had not been placed in an institution. A special discretionary benefit was introduced for lone fathers in August 1974, payable at the unemployment benefit rate. In February 1973, eligibility for the standard rate of pension, payable to widow pensioners with children and single age and invalid pensioners, was extended to Class B widow pensioners (those over the age of fifty with no dependent children). A change was also made ensuring that pensioners would not lose their extra benefits when a student turned twenty-one. The standard age pension rate was increased from 19.5% of average weekly earnings in September 1972 to 24.4% by December 1975. Social welfare administration was also made more efficient and equitable via the establishment of a Social Welfare Commission and benefit appeals tribunals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

The sales tax on artificial contraceptives was removed, while grants were made for family planning organisations. Maternity leave provisions for the Public Service were introduced consistent with the requirements of ILO Convention No. 103 – Maternity Provisions (Revised), 1952. The Aged or Disabled Persons’ Homes Bill of 1974 increased the Federal subsidy for aged persons’ homes from two dollars for every dollar provided by a non-profit or local government association to four dollars, while also extending the provisions of the Aged Persons’ Homes Act of 1954 to handicapped adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Issues in Gerontology: Promoting Positive Ageing edited by Victor Minichiello, Irene Coulson&lt;/ref&gt; The Handicapped Persons’ Assistance Bill of 1974 extended the government's program of assistance to voluntary organisations responsible for the welfare of handicapped people. While spending on education increased from 4.83% of GDP in 1972-73 to 6.18% in 1974-75, the Federal government's share of funding went up from 22.6% in 1972-73 to 42.5% in 1975-76. The Defence Service Homes Act of 1973 extended eligibility for a loan to current servicemen who had not served overseas but who had served for more than three years, to those who had served overseas under the banner of recognised welfare organisations, and to certain unmarried females with qualifying service. In addition, the maximum loan available under the scheme was increased from $9000 to $12000. For veterans, an expanded system of repatriation benefits was introduced, together with improved resettlement allowances, wider eligibility for defence service housing loans, a $1000 free-tax bonus for re-engagements, an attractive new retirement and death benefit scheme, and a more generous system of remuneration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

The Whitlam Government also sought to extend to Federal public servants the conditions that their State counterparts had long enjoyed. Among the benefits that the Whitlam government introduced for Federal public servants included a reduction in the qualifying time for long-service leave from 15 to 10 years, the removal of job discrimination provisions against women, ample redundancy provisions, a minimum of 12 weeks paid maternity leave with six weeks of paid leave following confinement, one week of paid paternity leave for any employee required to stay at home to care for his wife during or following her confinement, and entitlement to four weeks of annual leave with a 17.5% loading.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

The government also financed a wide range of new local government programs through the State, including tourism, urban transport, national estate, leisure facilities, sewerage backlog, flood mitigation, area improvement, growth centres, and senior citizens’ centres. Outlays on Aboriginal affairs programs were significantly increased with expenditure rising in real terms by 254.6% for legal aid, employment by 350.9%, education by 97.1%, health by 234.6%, and housing by 103.7%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; The Australian Citizenship Act of 1973 established Australian citizenship for the first time on the basis of “one criteria, one national allegiance, one citizenship and one ceremony,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsVloR2ty7IC&amp;pg=PA107|title=Critical Years in Immigration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Roads Grants Act 1974 provided funds for the building of rural arterial roads, urban arterial roads, minor traffic engineering and road safety improvements, rural local roads, developmental roads, urban local roads and beef roads.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

In 1973, an improved scheme of allowances was introduced to assist parents of children who did not have reasonable access to school services as a result of their geographic location. The quality of health care in rural areas was also improved via the development of a regional hospitals program and promotion of community-based health services. The Trade Union Training Authority Act of 1975 set up a national college and state centres designed to educate trade union leaders in various aspects of industrial relations. The Commonwealth Secondary Scholarship Scheme was replaced by a system of secondary allowances which were made available on the basis of financial need. An isolated children's allowance was introduced to compensate the educational disadvantages faced by children living in remote parts of the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; Greater spending was allocated to the arts, while spending on urban and regional development was accelerated, which contributed to a significant rise in the number of Australian households connected to a sewerage services. A School Dental Service Scheme was also introduced, providing free dental care for schoolchildren. Via grants to the states, the Whitlam Government funded the construction of 18,500 homes for low income earners from 1973 to 1975.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Various measures were also introduced to enhance educational opportunities. A disadvantaged school program was introduced that provided additional financial assistance for more than 1,000 schools whose students suffered special socio-economic disadvantages. In 1973, capital funds and assistance with running costs were made available for the education of handicapped children while a large training program was initiated for teachers and basic training and research financed for the area of special education. A program of innovative educational projects was successful in providing parents, teachers, and community groups with the first opportunity to try out their ideas for improving education. Over 1,000 projects were funded, ranging from bee-keeping and remedial reading to computers, while a network of educational innovators was set up to exchange experiences and to provide mutual support among people who wanted to be active in improving schools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; In 1975, the quality of school curricula was enhanced by the establishment of the Curriculum Development Centre. For those in higher education, the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme was abolished and replaced by the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, which offered means-tested and non-competitive financial assistance for all tertiary students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Initiatives were introduced to assist teacher training. Following the delivery of a report by the Special Committee on Teacher Education in March 1973, the Whitlam Government introduced various measures to implement its recommendations for special grants to the States for the building of teachers’ college libraries, fostering research into teacher education, increasing the number of students training to become teachers of handicapped children, and improving facilities in existing colleges of advanced education. The States Grants (Advanced Education) Act (No. 3) 1973 allocated $188 million for the development of teacher education in pre-school teachers’ colleges, State teachers’ colleges, and colleges of advanced education throughout 1973-75, while the States Grants (Advanced Education) Act of 1974 provided recurrent financial assistance for non-government teachers’ colleges for 1974 and 1975.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; The first national program for technical and further education resulted from the recommendations of the Committee on Technical and Further Education, established in early 1973. This committee produced an interim report in April 1974 which led to the payment of capital and recurrent grants to the States for building and planning new technical colleges and improving facilities at existing ones, especially with respect to teacher training, library services, research facilities, and student accommodation. The sum total of Federal grants increased from $18.1 million in 1972-73 to $81.1 million in 1975-76.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; Expenditure on state government schools increased more than sixfold, and more than doubled on non-government schools.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

Resources were also allocated towards a program for migrants. In August 1973, an Immigration (Education) Act was introduced to provide (as an emergency measure under the child migrant education program) supplementary class-room accommodation in schools with special programs for migrant children. In 1973-74, the number of teachers for special migrant classes increased from 1,000 to 1,500 and the number of children receiving instruction went up from 40,000 to 60,000. Migrant education centres were established in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, while a home tutoring scheme was established, designed to instruct migrant women in the English language. In migrant communities in all the states, 48 multilingual welfare officers were employed to overcome the social isolation of underprivileged groups. Portable benefit rights were also introduced, with respect to age, invalid, wives’ and widows’ pensions. Whereas under previous arrangements a pensioner had to live in Australia for 20 years after reaching the age of 16 and only had portability rights in Malta, Turkey, Greece, and Italy, the new provisions allowed a person drawing a pension to take up that benefit anywhere in the world after 10 years of Australian residence in the case of an age pension and after 5 years for most invalid pensions, while no period of residence was required for widows permanently resident in Australia when their husbands died.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

The voting age was also lowered to eighteen, and grant programs for regional development were introduced, which provided for urban renewal, the construction of sewerage systems in unserviced urban areas, tourist and leisure facilities, and flood prevention. During its last year in office, the Whitlam Government carried out measures such as the introduction of a national employment and training scheme, the first no fault divorce procedure in the world via the Family Law Act 1975, and a welfare payment for homeless Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/whitlam/in-office.aspx |title=In office |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419124214/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/whitlam/in-office.aspx |archivedate=19 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of communications, the Whitlam Government removed the limitations on the amount of non-English-language programming on radio and television and established the experimental ethnic radio stations 2EA in Sydney and 3EA in Melbourne. In addition, emergency telephone interpreter services were initiated in all community languages.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

A number of initiatives were also carried out to improve socio-economic conditions for Aborigines. The rate of training Aboriginal teachers and teachers’ aides was increased, while the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme was introduced to provide allowances to all students of Aboriginal descent attending secondary schools. An Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme was introduced to assist Aboriginal students in tertiary education institutions, while a scheme was introduced for Aboriginal children living in Aboriginal communities to receive primary school instruction in their own language and in their traditional arts and crafts. To grant Aborigines fairer representation within the legal system, the Whitlam Government significantly expanded the terms of the Aboriginal Legal Service established in 1970. $7.8 million was allocated between 1973 and 1976 to establish 25 offices throughout the country which provided free legal aid to Aborigines irrespective of the seriousness of the case. The offices had a majority of Aborigines on their governing bodies and, as a result, were integrated into local Aboriginal communities and provided trustworthy and effective legal representation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; In addition, a change was made whereby Aborigines no longer needed to acquire permission to leave the country.&lt;ref name="stage6.pbworks.com"/&gt; Outlays on Aboriginal affairs programs were considerably increased, with expenditure increasing from $61.44 million in 1972-73 to $185.79 million in 1975-76, representing a real increase of 105.8%. Expenditure in real terms went up by 254.6% for legal aid, 350.9% for employment, 97.1% for education, 234.6% for health, and 103.7% for housing. Federal grants to the States for the purpose of Aboriginal health care increased from $4.4 million in 1972-73 to $21.5 million in 1975-76. An Aboriginal Health Service was set up, whereby health and social workers were trained to provide community-based services either at local clinics or as mobile teams in the field. According to Whitlam, this initiative was successful “in eliminating the barriers that exist between Aborigines and primary health institutions.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

The Housing Society Scheme allowed Aboriginal communities to formulate their own budgets in spending departmental grants (taking into account the importance of Aborigines determining their own housing needs), and by June 1975 over 100 housing societies had been set up and 450 houses had been completed under the scheme. The Aboriginal Loans Commission was set up in December 1974 to make personal and housing loans to Aborigines at a discounted rate of interest, and encouraged the incidence of Aboriginal home ownership while helping to overcome discrimination in finance markets whereby Aborigines with steady employment and incomes were often refused loans for reasons related to their race. In June 1973, the Whitlam Government set up Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. as a public enterprise designed to provide the Aboriginal population with essential and urgent accommodation. By 1975, 74 hostels had been set up, with a combined capacity of 1,677 beds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

The budget presented on 17 September 1974 included a 173% increase for urban and regional development, a 30% increase for health, and a 78% increase for education. In addition, a revised income-tax scale reduced tax payable for people on incomes less than $10,500 a year. The 1975 budget provided funding for the new Medibank health scheme, together with a 2% increase in education, a 5% increase in urban and regional development, a 15% real increase in social security expenditure, and a restructuring of personal income tax.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Despite being in office for only three years, the Whitlam Government was able to carry out a radical programme of progressive social reform, and arguably came far in meeting the promises of change envisioned by its electoral slogan. According to one historian,

“If many Labor supporters regard the Curtin and Chifley governments as a period of great achievements and greater ambitions frustrated by conservative forces, their illusions in the Whitlam government are even more heroic. After nearly a quarter of a century of stagnant conservative rule during which Australia seemed to be a backward looking outpost of the British empire run by monarchists and reactionaries, Gough Whitlam, the Mighty Gough, broke through and during his first 12 months in office remade Australia forever.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The words ''It's Time'' have become an important contribution to the lexicon of Labor's constituency since their first use in [[Blacktown]] in 1972. An updated version of the ''It's Time'' song was used in advertisements for the 'Yes' vote in the [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|republic referendum]] in 1999, which ended with Whitlam saying: "Yes. It's time." In 2000, after another period of Liberal dominance, the phrase had an unsuccessful short-lived recurrence, with Whitlam speaking on behalf of the Leader of the Labor Party, [[Kim Beazley]].  Labor's 2015 Marriage Equality initiative used the phrase "It's Time. Marriage Equality". 

The Anti Poverty Network of South Australia in 2018 with the Choir of Hard Knocks of Port Adelaide recorded a revised version of the It's Time song, it included lyrics such as: 

"It’s time for changing, not deck-chair rearranging." "Time for poor folk, not rich folk." "It’s time for us folk, yes it’s time." and "It’s time for Newstart, to give a real start, One hundred more a week start, yes it’s time.”"

The song is a campaign to the [[Australian Labor Party]] to commit if elected at the next federal election to raising [[Newstart]], the Australian Governments Welfare and Social Safety Net for those who are unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2018/06/newstart-choir-campaign-masterstroke/|title=Newstart Choir Could be a Campaign Masterstroke {{!}} PBA|work=Pro Bono Australia|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Portal|1970s}}

'''KH-9''' ([[Byeman Control System|BYEMAN]] codename '''HEXAGON'''), commonly known as '''Big Bird'''&lt;ref name="Yenne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yenne, Bill|title=''The Encyclopedia of US Spacecraft''|publisher=Exeter Books (A Bison Book), New York|year=1985|isbn=0-671-07580-2}}p.32 '''Big Bird'''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Keyhole-9''', was a series of [[photographic]] [[reconnaissance satellite]]s launched by the United States between 1971 and 1986. Of twenty launch attempts by the [[National Reconnaissance Office]], all but one were successful.&lt;ref name="failure"&gt;{{cite web |title=34D-9: Titan rocket with last KH-9 explodes after liftoff (18.4.86) (F) |via=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXBl03wVHOY }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photographic film]] aboard the KH-9 was sent back to Earth in recoverable film return capsules for processing and interpretation. The best ground resolution achieved by the main cameras was better than 0.6 meters.&lt;ref name="NRO_US_Security"/&gt;

They are also officially known as the Broad Coverage Photo Reconnaissance satellites (Code 467), built by [[Lockheed Corporation]] for the [[National Reconnaissance Office]].&lt;ref name="Yenne"/&gt;

The KH-9 was declassified in September 2011 and an example was put on public display for a single day on September 17, 2011 in the parking lot of the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] of the [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2011/09/nro_50th/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/12996-secret-spy-satellites-declassified-nro.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, John M., Big Bird, uncaged, Air and Space, December 2011/January 2012, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2012 the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] put a KH-9 on public display along with its predecessors the [[KH-7]] and [[KH-8]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Aubrey, [http://www.seattlepi.com/business/boeing/article/Three-former-spy-satellites-go-on-display-2736911.php "Three former spy satellites go on display"], ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', Thursday, January 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:KH-9 HEXAGON satellite.jpg|thumb|350px|right|KH-9 profile and dimensions]]
The KH-9 was originally conceived in the early 1960s as a replacement for the [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] search satellites.  The goal was to search large areas of the earth with a medium resolution camera.  The KH-9 carried two main cameras, although a mapping camera was also carried on several missions.  The [[photographic film]] from the cameras was sent to recoverable re-entry vehicles and returned to Earth, where the capsules were caught in mid-air by an aircraft.  Four re-entry vehicles were carried on most missions, with a fifth added for missions that included a mapping camera.

Between September 1966 and July 1967, the contractors for the Hexagon subsystems were selected. [[Lockheed Missiles and Space Company|LMSC]] was awarded the contract for the Satellite Basic Assembly (SBA), [[PerkinElmer|Perkin Elmer]] for the primary Sensor Subsystem (SS), [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell]] for the Reentry Vehicle (RV), RCA Astro-Electronics Division for the Film Take Up system, and [[Itek]] for the Stellar Index camera (SI). Integration and ground-testing of Satellite Vehicle 1 (SV-1) was completed in May 1971, and it was subsequently shipped to [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in a 70&amp;nbsp;ft container. Ultimately, four generations ("blocks") of KH-9 Hexagon reconnaissance satellites were developed. KH9-7 (1207) was the first to fly a '''Block-II''' panoramic camera and SBA. '''Block-III''' (vehicles 13 to 18) included upgrades to electrical distribution and batteries. Two added tanks with [[Ullage#Rocketry|ullage control]] for the Orbit Adjust System (OAS) and new thrusters for the Reaction Control System (RCS) served to increase KH-9's operational lifetime. In addition the nitrogen supply for the film transport system and the camera vessel was increased. '''Block-IV''' was equipped with an extended command system using [[plated wire memory]].&lt;ref name="NROHexagonStory"/&gt; In the mid 1970s, over 1000 people in the [[Danbury, Connecticut]] area worked on the secret project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Decades Later, a Cold War Secret Is Revealed |date=December 25, 2011 |work=Associated Press |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/12/26/decades-later-cold-war-secret-is-revealed/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reentry vehicle from the first Hexagon satellite sank to 16,000 feet below the Pacific Ocean after its parachute failed. The {{USS|Trieste II|DSV-1}} retrieved its payload in April 1972 after a lengthy search but the film disintegrated due to the nine months underwater, leaving no usable photographs.&lt;ref name="shachtman20120809"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/historical-collection-publications/underwater-ice-station-zebra/ice-station-zebra.pdf| title=An Underwater Ice Station Zebra: Recovering a Secret Spy Satellite Capsule from 16,400 feet Below the Pacific Ocean| work=Historical Collection Publications| date=2013-05-28| accessdate=2013-06-29| author=Walthrop, David| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028153210/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/historical-collection-publications/underwater-ice-station-zebra/ice-station-zebra.pdf| archivedate=2013-10-28| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the duration of the program the lifetime of the individual satellites increased steadily.  The final KH-9 operated for up to 275 days.  Different versions of the satellite varied in [[mass]]; most weighed 11,400&amp;nbsp;kg or 13,300&amp;nbsp;kg.

==Main camera==

[[File:Kubinka3.jpg|thumb|KH-9 image of a [[Russians|Russian]] airfield]]
The main camera system was designed by Perkin-Elmer&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, John M., Big Bird, uncaged, Air &amp; Space, December 2011/January 2012, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; to take stereo images, with a forward looking camera on the port side, and an aft looking camera on the starboard side. Images were taken at altitudes ranging from 90 to 200 miles. The camera optical layout is an f/3.0 folded [[Wright Camera]], with a focal length of {{convert|60|in|m|abbr=on}}. The system aperture is defined by a {{convert|20|in|m|abbr=on}} diameter [[Aspheric lens|aspheric]] corrector plate, which corrects the [[spherical aberration]] of the Wright design. In each of the cameras the ground image passes through the corrector plate to a 45 degree angle flat mirror, which reflects the light to a {{convert|0.91|m|in|abbr=on}} diameter [[concave mirror|concave]] main mirror. The main mirror directs the light through an opening in the flat mirror and through a four-element lens system onto the film [[platen]]. The cameras could scan contiguous areas up to 120 degree wide, and achieved a [[NIIRS|ground resolution]] better than {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} during the later phase of the project.&lt;ref name="NRO_US_Security"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nro.gov/history/csnr/gambhex/index.html|title=Critical to US Security: the development of the GAMBIT and HEXAGON satellite reconnaissance system|publisher=National Reconnaissance Office|year=1997|author=Gerald K.

==Mapping imagery==
Missions 1205 to 1216 carried a "mapping camera" (also known as a "frame camera") that used 9 inch film and had a moderately low resolution of initially {{convert|30|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, which improved to {{convert|20|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} on later missions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=NRO's Review &amp; Redaction Guide (RRG), 2008| publisher=NRO| url=http://nro.gov/foia/NRO_RRG_redacted.PDF}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (somewhat better than [[LANDSAT]]).  Intended for mapmaking, photos this camera took cover essentially the entire Earth with at least some images between 1973 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;NARA ARC database description of "Keyhole-9 (KH-9) Satellite Imagery", accession number NN3-263-02-011&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all the imagery from this camera, amounting to 29,000 images, each covering 3400 square km, was declassified in 2002 as a result of Executive order 12951,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Archives Releases Recently Declassified Satellite Imagery| date=2002-10-09 | publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] press release| url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2003/nr03-02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same order which declassified [[CORONA]], and copies of the films were transferred to the [[U.S. Geological Survey]]'s Earth Resources Observation Systems office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIMA Sponsors Historical Imagery Declassification Conference America's Eyes: What We Were Seeing|publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=9535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KH-9 was never a backup project for the KH-10 [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]].  It was developed solely as a replacement for the Corona search system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==ELINT subsatellites==
Missions 1203, 1207, 1208, 1209, and 1212 to 1219 included Ferret [[ELINT]] subsatellites, which were launched into a high earth orbit to catalogue Soviet air defence radars, eavesdrop on voice communications, and tape missile and satellite telemetry.

The '''Konkani language agitations''' were a series of agitations that happened in the Indian state of [[Goa]] (formerly the union territory of [[Goa, Daman and Diu]]) during the post-Independence period. The agitations involved several mass protests, riots, student and political movements in Goa, and concerned the official status of [[Konkani language|Konkani]] in the state and in the [[Indian Republic]].

==History==

===Pre-Portuguese and Portuguese Goa===

Since early times, Konkani language and literature took a beating due to persistent invasions on Goa by:
*General [[Malik Kafur]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultans]] [[Alauddin Khalji]] and [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammed bin Tughlaq]] in 1312-1327.
*The [[Bahamani]] annexation of 1470, and subsequently in 1492 by Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]]
*The [[Persecution of Hindus|persecution]] and [[Christianization of Goa|proselytisation]] of Hindus by Portuguese [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] missionaries subsequent to 1500

The final death knell for Konkani was the Inquisition which sought to root out Konkani from Portuguese territories in India.&lt;ref name="teotonio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgweb.org/unethicalconversion/GoaInquisition.htm | title=The Goa Inquisition | accessdate=11 March 2011 |author1=de Souza |author2=Teotonio R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Konkani, the language of communication between the Portuguese authorities and the local population was, amongst other Hindu practices, declared heretic. Portuguese was declared to be the sole language; a move supported by [[Franciscan]] missionaries. It was made the sole language of official communication and a pre-requisite for government jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of loanwords in Konkani]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Church edict in 1684 directed a change over of the ''lingua franca'' from Konkani to Portuguese. This unsuccessful language policy was revoked in 1761 by the Minister of the Kingdom ( Prime Minister) [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo]], better known as the [[Marquês de Pombal]]. However, the Inquisition had taken its toll. Konkani manuscripts and literature, in the Nagari and Goykanadi, were consigned to the flames as heretic literature. This led to extermination of Konkani from the ''velhas conquistas''.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;coastal areas of Goa conquered at the beginning of the 16th century CE&lt;/ref&gt; However, Konkani survived in the Hindu majority ''novas conquistas'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;hinterland of Goa conquered at the beginning of the 18th century CE&lt;/ref&gt; who, in view of the edict against written Konkani continued using Konkani as the language at home. They also used Marathi translations of sacred Hindu texts. This was followed by the arrival of Marathi speaking Brahmins to serve in Hindu temples. This episode in history was an important event in the struggle for the status of Konkani vis a vis Marathi amongst the Hindu population of Goa. Konkani also survived amongst the Saraswat Brahmins, Gaud Saraswat and Bhanap, the Daivajnas, the Kudumbis, the Catholics who migrated to Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. Konkani received no patronage in her homeland, Goa during the Portuguese period. Occasional books written by Fr. Agnelus F.X. Maffei in 1882 and the book on Konkani grammar by Fr. Thomas Stevens in 1622 were published with Konkani being rendered in the Roman script.

The first attempt for the revival of Konkani as a language of literature was by Rao Saheb Dr. V.P. Chavan, the former vice-president of the Anthropological Society Bombay through his book ''Konkan and the Konkani Language''&lt;ref name="Chavan"&gt;{{cite book | title=Konkan and the Konkani Language | author=V.P. Chavan | year=1923 | publisher=Asian Educational Services | location=India | isbn=81-206-0666-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which presented Konkani in the Devanagari script.

This still did not improve the status of Konkani in 19th century Goa where the Catholic élite admitted their wards to Portuguese medium schools with the idea of enabling them to pursue a professional career or a career in the colonial administration. Marathi and English medium schools emerged in the private sector. Konkani, the ''mā̃yabhās'' (mother tongue) retreated to the confines of the household in favour of the ''poṭācī bhās'' (language of commerce). Multiple dialects emerged not only within Goa, but also in Karnataka and Kerala where Konkani speakers had settled. The anti-Konkani movement of the Portuguese had long ceased and gave way to the Hindu populations cynical view of the status Konkani over Marathi. The ripples of this episode of the language controversy are still prevalent in contemporary Goa.

By the 1950s, middle class Goans, both Catholic and Hindu, were sending their wards to English medium schools and the Hindu population was catered to by Marathi Medium schools.

===Goa after Indian annexation===

The annexation of Goa in 1961 saw the decline of Portuguese and the rise of English for administrative purposes. Better off Goans, both Christian and Hindu, started sending their wards to English medium schools. Marathi medium schools remained popular with the Hindu population, who looked at Marathi with reverence as the language in which Hindu scriptures, translated from Sanskrit, could be accessed. An argument of Konkani being a Marathi dialect and Konkani speakers being Marathis began to take shape. Although ''Konkani preserved an older stage of phonetic development, and showed a greater variety of verbal forms than standard Marathi'',&lt;ref name="grierson"&gt;{{cite book | title=Linguistic Survey of India. Vol. VII. Indo-Aryan Family. Southern Group. Specimens of the Marathi language. | author=GRIERSON, GEORGE ABRAHAM, SIR. | year=1905 | publisher=Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, India | location=Calcutta | pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indian linguists like Prof. Anant Kakaba Priolkar and European linguists like John Leyden looked at Konkani as a Marathi dialect which branched off from a common Prakrit parent.

Post 1958 saw the birth of a definite pro-Konkani camp that, at different times,  included [[Joaquim Heliodoró da Cunha Rivara]], whose essay on Konkani ''O Ensaio Historico da Lingua Concani'' provides considerable information on the language during the first three hundred years of Portuguese rule in Goa, Fr. Agnelus F.X. Maffei, Dr. Sumitra Mangesh Katre, Dr. S. B. Kulkarni, French linguist Jules Bloch and the English scholar John Wilson.

==Shenoi Goembab==

Aware of the looming danger of Konkani being sidelined, ''vāman vardē śeṇai vaḷavalikār'', popularly known as'' śeṇai goyẽbāb''  gave a clarion call for the revival of Konkani in the early 20th century. Under his guidance,  a steady movement was getting built up and the effort was on to initiate a rejuvenation of Konkani language and heritage, by means of establishing a common cultural identity among the Konkani people.

==Konkani versus Marathi==

{{quote|The innate conservation of the people of India has given a vitality to some of the dialects, which is truly wonderful. Take, for example, the Konkani dialect, which is spoken at present by at least a million and half people in Western India. Though it has had no alphabet of its own and no literature worth mentioning, it has continued to live even in a vigorous condition at times, for nearly 1500 years, and this, in spite of the fact that a sister language very closely allied to it, namely Marathi, with an alphabet and a literature of its own, has been trying to crush it out of existence by the sheer force of its wider popularity with the governing class. The study of the origin, growth and vicissitudes of such dialect, therefore, cannot be lacking in interest to the students of anthropology, and Indian history.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bombay Chronicle | date=1924-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The root of the Konkani Language agitation laid in the denial of Konkani as an independent language and the opposition to merge Goa into Maharashtra.  Konkani was not taken seriously as a potential official language except by a few stalwarts. By 1960, pro-Konkani and pro-Marathi groups started a propaganda war through distribution of pamphlets. In 1962, the All India Konkani Parishad held its eighth session for the first time at'' Maḍgā̃v'' (Margao) in post-liberation Goa and passed a resolution urging the Kendra Sahitya Akademi to recognise Konkani. Simultaneously, the referendum in 1967 thwarted the merger of Goa into Maharashtra and paved the way for its statehood in the Union of India. Goan statehood gave a further boost to the pro-Konkani camp.

Earlier in 1966, the then Chief Minister of Goa, Dayanand Bandodkar appointed a committee to examine the feasibility of declaring Marathi as the official language of Goa. Attempts were made by some members of the ''Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party'', a party formed before the referendum proposing merger into Maharashtra, and a splinter group to pass a Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Bill in 1966 which was thwarted by the Chief Minister. On 22 August 1970, Bandodkar declared Konkani, written in the Devanagari script, as the official language of Goa along with Marathi.

In 1973, chief minister of Goa, Dayanand Bandodkar died, and his daughter Shashikala Kakodkar ascended to the post. Under Kakodkar, government policies favouring Marathi were framed. Marathi was made compulsory in English medium schools whilst Konkani was excluded. This policy was met with severe criticism from Konkani organisations, both, within Goa and outside. Although promises were made by Kakodkar in 1977 and thereafter by then Congress Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane in 1980 to treat Konkani at par with Marathi, the matter was kept in abeyance till 1986.

==koṅkaṇī prajētso āvāz==

In their election manifesto, the Congress party had stated that once statehood was achieved Konkani would be recognised as an official language and demands would be made to include it in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. In 1980, the Congress came into power under Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane. Rane, despite the promises made, procrastinated on the issue. This led to an agitation in 1986 on the streets popularly called  ''koṅkaṇī prajētso āvāz'' (voice of the Konkani people).  Goa witnessed the bloodiest agitation ever, the Language agitation, in which seven pro-Konkani agitators lost their lives and several were injured{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The violence only halted when the Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language bill was presented to the legislative assembly.

==Government action==

The Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language bill, presented to the legislative assembly in 1986, was passed on 4 February 1987 declaring Konkani the sole official language of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu with provisions for Marathi and Gujarati for Daman and Diu. On 30 May 1987 Goa got statehood with Konkani as the sole official language.The Kendra Sahitya Academy recognised Konkani, in the Devanagari script, as an independent language on 26 February 1975. This paved the way for the decision to include Konkani in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution making Konkani one of the official languages of India.

==Karnataka and Kerala==

The struggle for Konkani in Goa, did not go unnoticed in Canara and Travancore. The Konkani speakers in Canara (currently Uttara Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada) and Travancore (currently Cochin and Ernakulam), inspired by the writings of Shenoi Goembab were getting increasingly aware on the issue of mother tongue.

The first public pro-Konkani gathering was held outside Goa and by non Goan Konkanis. In 1939, the All India Konkani Parishad was founded by the efforts of Manjunath Shanbhag and the first session was held. This was followed by the second session at Udupi organised by Dr. T.M.A. Pai. The liberation and subsequent statehood of Goa bolstered Konkani's status in Karnataka. In 1962, the Konkani Bhasha Prachar Sabha, Cochin, took up the issue of inclusion of Konkani in the Eighth schedule with the Government of India and the Linguistic Minorities Commission. In 1976, the Konkani Bhasha Mandali was founded at Mangalore enhance the status of Konkani in the state. In 1994, the Government of Karnataka founded the Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Academy at Mangalore to propagate Konkani literature.  The first Vishwa Konkani Sammelan was held in Mangalore in 1995 wherein 5,000 delegated from 75 centres from India, the middle east, the US, UK, etc. participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Brief History of Konkani Movement | author=Bhembre, Uday | journal=Konkani Mirror |date=Oct–Dec 2009 | pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the foundation was laid for a [[World Konkani Centre]]  to further the cause of Konkani on a global scale. From the academic year 2007-2008 Konkani has become an optional subject in the schools of Karnataka.

Settlements were set up in rural areas where each successful applicant’s family would be given a small-holding of approximately {{convert|5|acre|km2}}, livestock and a newly built cottage.

This article is about [[military law]] literature in [[India]].

== General ==
[[Military law]] provisions govern the role of [[India Army]] during peace and war formulated in the form of [[Statutes, Rules and Regulations]].  It is a written code which has seen periodic changes and review, apart from conventions (read customs) of service.

Official publications mainly take the form of the Army Act, 1950, Army Rules 1954 and the Regulations for the Army, 1987 (in short RA).  [[Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007]] and the [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act]] are also relevant legislation.  Another significant but obscure provision is Notes to [[Indian Military]] and [[Air Force Law]] (commonly referred as [[NMAFL]]).  Strangely for reason not known, RA and NMAFL continue to be not accessible to the scholars and public at large.

There are two aspects significant for the purpose of this discussion.  Firstly, military law publications were called by different names in the earlier years.  However, these were all official publications.  Law being complex and technical in nature, these text were not easy to comprehend and apply.  The same called for a need to draft ‘notes’ or ‘comments’ thereto.  These were prepared and duly inserted by the authorities, whose identity was not indicated.  Secondly, military law was included in the syllabus for retention and promotion examinations for military officers.  This was done with a view to make the officers study and assimilate relevant legal provisions necessary for enforcement of a disciplinary code amongst the men under their command. A need therefore, existed for publication of books that could explain, guide and amplify the rules.  Thus such handbooks were required not only for application of law  by the officers for unit routine but also for their understanding while preparing for obligatory examinations.

Infrequent actions were also taken to bring out précis and other publications at command and corps level for dissemination of military law.  These too were all in-house publications.

== Early Works ==
The growth of [[military law literature]] emerged from sheer necessity.  It was acknowledged by General C.H. Harrington GBE, KCB, DSO, DCL, the then General Officer Commanding in Chief of Quetta-based Western Command on 28 October 1930 in a foreword to the book titled Handbook of Military Law by Capt. R.J. Wilkins and W.S. Chaney.  He wrote,

“There are two main reasons why an officer should be at home in his Military Law.

One of them, the less important, is that he may pass his promotion examinations.

The other, by far the more important, is that he may avoid injustice towards his countrymen whom it was his privilege to command.”

Military and Cantonment Law&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in India is perhaps the oldest publication still available on military law.  The author in his preface clarified the object of his work was to supply what is believed to be a want by supplementing for India the Manual of Military published by the war office in England.

== Between the Two Wars ==
Courts martial in India&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was authored by Major LM Peet, officiating Assistant Judge Advocate General, Eastern Command.  This publication was a pocket edition of about 4" by 5" in size.  The publication carries valuable inputs for the conduct of courts martial.  It would amaze one to find that common mistakes listed in the book are still often repeated today.

Indian Military Law&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by Lt. Col. ST Banning, CBE was printed in Great Britain.  It was published “on the urgent request of several officers of the Indian Army who had studied the subject with (the author) while preparing for their examinations.”  Author’s other book “Military Law” had by then already run into 18th edition.  Yet another notable work by the author was titled “Military Law Made Easy.”

Notes on Military Law 1935 (Reprint 1942) was issued by General Headquarters, India. It carried a preface by General AB Haig, Adjutant General in India.

== Post Independence ==
Handbook of Military&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Law by C. Sanjeevarow Nayudu was perhaps the first book post independence on military law.  The author had declared in the preface that he was induced to write the book driven by the extreme need and usefulness of a military handbook.  The foreword was written by Mr. [[B.R. Ambedkar]], the then Minister for Law, Government of India.  Ambedkar admitted that “for some reason Military Law has not attracted the attention of students of India Law and there are very few books on the subject”

Capt. K.K. Pradhan came up with Text Book of Military Law&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; in 1956.  The book running in nine chapters dealt with military law enforcement provisions, evidence, duties in aid of the civil power and lastly National Cadet Corps Act and Rules.

Privileges of the Military Personnel in Courts of Law&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; was written with a very concise aim.  Its main feature was a very detailed and exhaustive treatment of the topic.  A notable feature of the book was its coverage of the provisions concerning defence of mechanical transport drivers in claims for damages arising out of accidents.  Perhaps a book of this nature duly updated is needed even now.

‘Guide to Courts Martial’ by B.L. Goswami was a concise work directed solely at the procedures to applicable at the trial stage.  Another book by the same author dealt with the topic of courts of inquiry.

SC Consul, Advocate came up with his book Law Relating to Military Service, Conditions, Privileges and Restrictions&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; in 1965.  A number of its chapters related to matters like conditions of service, penal deductions, service privileges, The Indian Soldiers (Litigation) Act, 1925; choice between criminal court and court martial and restrictions on fundamental rights.

The next book worthy of note and written by a military lawyer was Military Law in India&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;  Rear Admiral OP Sharma, the author, in his book first published in 1973 had disclosed that text was the doctoral dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Law to the Bombay University.  It was an exposition of the principles and procedures of military law as they had developed over the last few centuries.  The foreword to the book was written by Justice PB Gajenderagadkar, a former Vice Chancellor of the Bombay University and formerly the Chief Justice of India.

O.P. Sharma’s effort is to be specially commended because it pointed out the shortcomings and the gaps in the Indian Military Law.  It indicated the ways in which it could be reformed so as to be in line with the role of a soldier in a democratic socialist set up.  The work had taken into account more than 200 judgments of Indian High Courts and the Supreme Court.  The publication was a scholarly work of merit and made a definite contribution to the knowledge of the law relating to the armed forces.

Military Law at a Glance&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; was a concise book which came in the form of a handbook for army promotion examinations.  The author claimed that the publication should serve as a help book to find the solution of confronting problems without going into the voluminous material from which it may have to be dug out.

Regimental Officer’s Handbook on Military Law (Questions &amp; Answers) was an invaluable book authored by Brig. AC Mangala.  The book running into 160 pages was printed by Army Printing Press, Lucknow in November, 1984.  This was a revised edition of the same title first brought out in January 1976.  The author in his preface had pointed out that the object of the book was to make readily available to regimental officer’s answers to such practical problems which they have to tackle during the course of their duties in the units and on the staff.  Lt. Gen. R.D. Hira, Adjutant General in his foreword to the first edition had hoped that the publication would be useful to officers preparing for promotion and DSSC entrance examination.

Military Law in India was a joint effort&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; by Dr. D.C. Jain, Dr. N.K. Indrayan and Maj. C.G. Goel.  The work was in the form of a section wise narration of the Army Act provisions with a commentary for each clause.  A significant feature of the book was incorporation of relevant case law.

The main utility of Study and Practice of Military Law11 by Col. G.K. Sharma, first published in 1988, was for assisting regimental officers in dealing with disciplinary cases.  The author claimed that his work was a means to find ready answers to the day to day legal problems, faced by commanders, staff officers and persons interested in the study and practice of military law.

== Beyond Exams Study Material ==
The higher judiciary of law need to consult compilation of case laws on some or similar legal issues.  Need for such a compilation was long felt by the judges, lawyers and military authorities.  Relating to the Armed Forces in India12 was the first and only book covering rulings given by Supreme Court and various High Courts on military law and service conditions of the armed forces as well as civilians paid from the defence estimates and ex servicemen. All the important judgments, reported or unreported were classified under main headings and sub headings and were listed subject wise in a chronological order.

Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw in his foreword to the book wrote, “I am sure that their (authors) efforts would be of immense use not only to those in the legal profession but to the staff officers in the Army units and formations as we&lt;sup&gt;ll&lt;/sup&gt;.”  The book has since come out in five editions with substantial increase in its contents.
 
A publication titled Compendium of Law for Defence Services&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; came up in 1991.  It was essentially a reproduction of Manual of Military Law.  Merit of special note were however to portions running into four pages that covered a brief appraisal of trial by courts martial and drawbacks in system of trials by courts martial.

Major L.J. Obheroi’s his book Questions Answered on Military Law&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; was released in May 1994.  The author in the preface declared the main objective to present a useful and accurate guide to commanding officers, formation commanders and staff and regimental officers in regard to their powers and functions under the Army Act.  This book was claimed by him to be, the only book which explains how to be refer to MML and RA, with practical examples to get, at the right answers.  The book was divided in 20 chapters including specimen charges.

A significant step with regard to military law publications is the Military Law Journal&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.  First started in 1996 as a news letter of the Judge Advocate General’s Department, it later took the shape of a reproduction of case law concerning military law.  It is now a bi-annual journal brought out by the Institute of Military Law, Kamptee.  It is a priced publication bearing an ISIN No.  It is divided in two parts.  While the first contains articles and book reviews, the second one carries decisions of the high Courts, Supreme Court, High Courts in India and different benches of the Armed Forces Tribunal on different aspects concerning the Army.  Yet another notable feature is its historical section in which earlier cases of relevance are also reproduced.  With its maiden appearance in 1996, the annual law journal carries complete text of relevant judgments of the Supreme Court.  It also carries review of new books.

Court Martial and Military Matters&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; by Brig. (now Maj. Gen.) Nilendra Kumar as an attempt to discuss the complexities of modern legal thought as pertaining to military canvas.  It took into account a thorough overview of military law.  It did not merely described the law but pointed the way ahead.  The book in its 15 articles did not present merely abstract legal theory but a discussion of legal principles as well as ground realities.  It took stock of practical infirmities in the law.

The History of the Department of Judge Advocate General&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; was an attempt at the official narration of JAG’s Department history.  The text traced the origin of the department and system of courts martial in India.  Suitably divided in 10 chapters, the text dealt with pre and post independent eras, revision of publications, legal cells, origin of Corps Day and Institute of Military Law.  It also carried a list of the officers serving in the department at the time of publication.  The book came in time with the first reunion of the JAG Department.

Military Law Handbook for Commanders&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; was published with a firm belief of the author that sound administration and personnel management calls for due emphasis on fair play, adherence to laid down norms and humane treatment of the subordinates. The work was indeed of practical help to commanders at various levels. The second edition of the book in 2011 took into account new changes like setting up of the Armed Forces Tribunal, The Right to Information Act and adoption of information technology by the armed forces.

Pension Regulations for the Army 1961 (including 1940)&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; was the title chosen by Captain R.S. Dhull for his first book.  The effort was indeed praiseworthy for it made available Pension Regulations to the courts, lawyers and litigants that were otherwise almost never to be found.

2007-2008 Armed Forces20 by Captain R.S. Dhull was a compilation of decisions of higher judiciary in India.  It also carried up-to-date orders and information relating to pension.  It took into account &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; judgments of the Supreme Court and 47 of various High Courts.

Soldiers invalided out from service on medical grounds are entitled to the award of disability pension when the disability recorded is found to be attributable to or aggravated by the service conditions.
 
Law Relating to the Disability Benefit&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; in the Armed Forces was a compilation of case law where the higher judiciary had examined the legality of executive decisions taken in the matter of award of disability pensions.  It also discussed various dimensions of the provisions relating to award of disability benefits to the men in uniform.

Case Studies on Military Law&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; by Maj. Gen. Nilendra Kumar was first published in 2003. It presented live cases relating to investigations and enquiries, disciplinary and administrative action decisions starting with hearing of charge and leading on to disposal of cases.  The identity of the offenders, witnesses and those who dealt with the matter as well as units and formations had been concealed. The case studies compiled in the book were intender to help the commanders by drawing suitable lessons by way of an opportunity to carry out a critical analysis of actual and him situations.  A review of the book in USI Journal hailed it as a “valuable contribution for proper understanding of the subject through live case studies.”

Courts Martial Under Scrutiny&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; by Maj. Gen Nilendra Kumar appeared as a discourse on divergent issues concerning operations, procurements litigation, human resource management, low intensity conflicts, international terrorism and peace enforcement operations.  It was an exercise to analyse critical areas showing crucial deficiencies in the existing legal procedures as noted from academic scrutiny and actual application.

Military Law and Writs&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; was brought out by Major J.L. Obheroi in 2003 as an author and publisher.  The voluminous work spread over 30 chapters was meant to assist the practitioners of military law by providing them with a ready reckoner to deal with writ petitions.  It also contained relevant case law.  It covered the whole spectrum of one’s service conditions, rights, duties and obligations.

== Then Now &amp; Beyond ==
Military Law then, now &amp; beyond&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; was brought out by the Judge Advocate General’s Department at the time of their second Re-union in 2005. This was a unique publication in the form of interviews, articles, poems and pictures.  The work was conceived, designed and produced by Maj. Gen. Nilendra Kumar.

The book was suitably divided into portions dealing with reminiscences; izzat, honour &amp; ethics; courts martial; litigation; law of war, gender justice and human rights, legal training, media and other issues, recollections from the past; armed forces tribunal, reforms in military law, empowerment and way ahead.  Elegant layout and superbly printed the book carried interviews with General JJ Singh, Chief of the Army Staff and with Justice Brigadier DM Sen, the first Judge Advocate General of free India.  The contributors to the book were some of the well known experts on military and legal issues e.g. Lt. Gen. V.R. Raghavan, Justice DP Wadhwa formerly of the Supreme Court, Dr. Manoj Kumar Sinha, Dr. Manish Arora, Dr. Shyamlha Pappu, Maj. Gen. V.K. Singh, SV Thapliyal and AB Gorthi; Maria Teresa Dutli, Krister Thelin, KPD Samanta, Diane Guillemette, Dr. N.M. Ghatate, PH Parekh etc.

Military Law Lexicon&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; was a joint effort by Maj. Gen. Nilendra Kumar and Kush Chaturvedi.  It was a lexicon of military legal terms a necessary step for understanding military terms.  Various terms were explained by a combination of means i.e. some times by their dictionary meaning or by statutory definition, and at places by a combination of both.  Terms of foreign usage were also included.

The Military Justice System in India&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; by Wg. Cdr. U.C. Jha was a critical study of existing military justice system in India and its comparison with that of the UK and the USA.  It enumerated the deficiencies in the Indian military justice system.  It articulated that limitations on human rights must be provided for by law and should be consistent with international treaty obligations.  The author strongly called for drafting a common code for the three services.  He was in favour of the judicial branch of the armed forces to be headed by a Chief Judge Advocate General, of the rank of Lieutenant General, under the Ministry of Defence.

Courts on Military Law&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; by Col. G.K. Sharma and Col. M.S. Jaswal came in the form of voluminous work.  It is a narration of the Army Act and Army Rule provisions.  Each section or rule was followed by a commentary which was essentially a case law relevant to the text thereof.  The book had drawn upon 954 decided cases to build up its text.  This number included the rulings on pension matters.

Wg. Cdr. U.C. Jha came up with a work titled Armed Forces Tribunal&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; in 2010.  The book critically examined the jurisdiction and powers of the Armed Forces Tribunal.  It gave an insight into the problems that were likely to be encountered by the tribunal when it started functioning.  It also carried a resume of the existing system of grievances redressal.

The other book by Wg. Cdr. U.C. Jha in 2010 was titled The South Asian Military Law Systems&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;.  It was a comparative study of the military law systems of the five South Asian countries viz. Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.  It also included certain portions on law of Armed Conflict and International Human Rights Law, relevant to the activities of the Armed Forces.  The author devoted a separate chapter to conclusions and recommendations.  He advocated separation of the Judge Advocate branch of the respective services and its placement under the Ministry of either law or justice.

A Handbook of Military Law&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; by Wg. Cdr. Dr. U.C. Jha was claimed by the author to have been written with an aim to serve as a ready reference for the officers of the Indian Army who would like to know something about their legal rights and responsibilities.  The handbook also covered the syllabus of Part B and D promotion examinations and DSSC entrance examination.  The portion on Right to Information had information on a matter otherwise little known to the military.  The last chapter dealt with military contingents in peacekeeping.

Court Martial Process : Empirically studied&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; was the work of Brigadier Rama Gopal Vidhu.  It was based on the award of Ph.D by the University of Delhi.  The text had drawn heavily on the responses of 200 military and civilian personnel to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the court martial process.  The book carried a number of useful suggestions to streamline the procedures at different stages of courts martial.

The '''National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections''' or '''NAMFREL''' is an election watchdog in the [[Philippines]]. It was the first and one of the most famous election watch campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hedman|first=Eva-Lotta E.|title=In the name of civil society : from free election movements to people power in the Philippines|year=2006|publisher=Univ. of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0824829212|chapter=1. In the Name of Civil Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to have introduced non-partisan national election monitoring to the Philippines after exposing the issues involved with the [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|1986 Snap Elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bjornlund|first=Eric C.|title=Beyond free and fair : monitoring elections and building democracy|year=2004|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0801880483|pages=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAMREL was co-founded by Jose S. Concepcion, Jr., and was its first National Chairperson. NAMFREL was formally organized in October 1983 as an offshoot of the New Voters Registration Committee, which was formed in the 1960s. It currently has the support of more than 140 benefactors and 125 organizations. Its current national chairperson is Corazon Dela Paz-Bernardo.

NAMFREL's goal is to ensure "free, orderly and honest elections" in the Philippines. It is a non-partisan organization with over 250,000 member-volunteers from different religious, civic, business, professional, labor, youth, educational, and non-government organizations.

The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (Comelec) has accredited NAMFREL as its "citizens' arm" since 1986 to conduct manual parallel counts, which it called "Operation Quick Count." In 1986, NAMFREL mobilized 500,000 volunteers nationwide to guard the snap presidential elections. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared himself the winner of the election; the NAMFREL count, however, showed that [[Corazon Aquino]] won. In the days that followed, the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA People Power revolt]] took place, sweeping Aquino to power.

For the May 2010 automated Philippine presidential elections NAMFREL was not accredited to conduct its own count. Instead, the organization conducted a nationwide election observation mission called "Bantay ng Bayan" ("sentinels of the people").

Presently, NAMFREL is also active internationally, its officers and volunteers having worked as trainers, observer team members, election administrators and resource persons in 35 countries, and have sent its volunteers as the official Philippine observer delegation to [[Cambodia]] during [[Cambodian parliamentary election, 1998|the 1998 parliamentary elections there]], as well as in Indonesia in 1999 for the Presidential elections after the fall of Suharto.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namfrel.com.ph/v2/aboutus/history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, NAMFREL representatives attended the [[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|International IDEA]] conference in [[Copenhagen]].

One example of an overvote would be voting for two candidates in a single race with the instruction "Vote for not more than one." ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' notes that such votes are illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|title = RONR|edition = 11th|year = 2011|pages = 416-417}}(RONR)&lt;/ref&gt;

While an overvote in a [[plurality voting system]] is always illegal, in certain other [[Voting system|electoral methods]] including [[approval voting]], this style of voting is valid, and thus invalid overvotes are not possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.approvalvoting.org/glossary.html Citizens for Approval Voting - Voting definitions and examples]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the corporate world, the term "overvote" describes a situation in which someone votes more proxies than they are authorized to, or for more shares than they hold of record.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxyprocess/proxyvotingbrief.htm Briefing Paper: Roundtable on Proxy Voting Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the EP by Yashin|Pay to Play (EP)}}
'''Pay to play''', sometimes '''pay for play''', is a phrase used for a variety of situations in which [[money]] is exchanged for services or the privilege to engage in certain activities. The common denominator of all forms of pay to play is that one must pay to "get in the game", with the sports analogy frequently arising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nyobserver.com/node/44883 |author=Golway, Terry |title=Nothing Innocent About Pay-to-Play|newspaper= The New York Observer|date= August 26, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In broadcasting==
{{Main|Brokered programming}}

The term also refers to a growing trend in which individuals or groups may purchase radio or television airtime, much like [[infomercial]]s, to have their views heard on broadcast stations. While these types of shows are typically shows that have little sponsor support and have no substantiated audience, some major program producers do purchase airtime to "clear" their programs in certain major markets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} This type of format is particularly common among religious broadcasters ([[televangelism]]), where the related term '''pay for pray''' is used.

==In corporate finance==
Pay to play is a provision in a corporation's [[Corporate charter|charter documents]] (usually inserted as part of a [[preferred stock]] financing) that requires stockholders to participate in subsequent stock offerings in order to benefit from certain [[Stock dilution|antidilution]] protections. If the stockholder does not purchase his or her pro rata share in the subsequent offering, then the stockholder loses the benefit(s) of the antidilution provisions. In extreme cases, investors who do not participate in subsequent rounds must convert to [[common stock]], thereby losing the protective provisions of the preferred stock. This approach minimizes the fears of major investors that small or minority investors will benefit by having the major investors continue providing needed equity, particularly in troubled economic circumstances for the company. It is considered a "harsh" provision that is usually only inserted when one party has a strong bargaining position.

==In engineering, design, and construction==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Pay to play in the engineering, design, and construction industry can refer to:
#monetary and gift exchanges to persuade decision makers such that they make decisions in favor of those offering the money or gifts;
#exchanges of money or gifts and providing sponsorships such that the engineering, design, or construction company gets considered for work that would not otherwise be available (this in essence becomes a type of pre-qualification for work – contracts; and
# illegal acts of bribery.
Pay to play might also be used to explain the appearance of engineering, design, and construction public work being done not in an open and fair manner.

==In finance==
In the finance industry, the term "pay-to-play" describes the practice of giving gifts to political figures in the hopes of receiving investment business in return.

In the U.S., after discovering that this practice was not uncommon and was undermining the integrity of the financial markets, [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)]], the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] and the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board|Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)]] severely regulated and limited the interactions and gifts-giving practices between the investment industry personnel and politicians and candidates. This can be seen most notably in Rule 206(4)-5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules G-37 and G-38 of the MSRB Rule Book.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers'', §§ 2:190 to 2:192 (Thomson West, 2014 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pay-to-play occurs when investment firms or their employees make campaign contributions to politicians or candidates for office in the hope of receiving business from the municipalities that those political figures represent. It usually applies to investment banking firms that hope to receive [[municipal bond|municipal securities]] underwriting business in return or to investment management firms that hope to be selected for the management of government funds such as state pension funds.

An example of this form of corruption or bribery is the 2009 probe by then New York State Attorney General [[Andrew Cuomo]] into [[private equity fund]]s payments to [[private placement agent|placement agents]] with political connections to obtain business with the [[New York State Common Retirement System]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/business/15leuschen.html Go-Between Tied Funds to Carlyle].

{{Main|Payola}}

The term also refers to a growing trend, where venue owners charge an up-front fee to performing artists for the use of their facilities. The practice began in [[Los Angeles, California]], during the 1980s. It has become common in many U.S. cities at low-turnout all-ages shows where performers are required to guarantee a minimum attendance through pre-show ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3308/8387/ Wweek.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106033254/http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3308/8387/ |date=2007-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pay-to-play gigs are a contentious practice in the UK, and some of the largest pay-to-play gig organisers have generated large amounts of discussion and criticism.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The term "Pay to Play" was also used as the title to [[Pay to Play (song)|a song]] by the band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] (later renamed to "Stay Away"). The refrain referred to the practice of a band or their record label paying radio stations to put a song into [[heavy rotation]]. The phrase is also the title to a song by the band [[Cringer (band)|Cringer]], in which they denounce the practice.

[[Music Supervision]] is a booming field in the music industry, whose professionals place music in many kinds of film, television, commercial, web-based and other live and recorded media cues. While some music supervisors are paid only by their employer or per-project, some companies use a "pay to play" model wherein artists "pay" to "submit" tracks for consideration to a variety of media concerns, only to have to pay the Music Supervision intermediary again at a cost of half of its earning for the track placement should it win a placement.

==In online gaming==
{{see also|Pay to win}}
The term is also used as slang to refer to Internet services that require that users pay to use them. Usually, it refers to [[MMORPG]]s, where players must pay to maintain a playing account, as is the case with ''[[Eve Online]]'' or ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. This is in contrast to [[free-to-play]] games.  Many formerly pay-to-play MMORPGs have switched to a free-to-play model, including ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', ''[[Aion: The Tower of Eternity]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.  The game ''[[RuneScape]]'' features both free accounts for no money or pay-to-play accounts, with a much larger list of features.

The term may also refer to something like the online game ''[[Habbo Hotel]]'', where there are games inside the game, which you may "pay to play" to join into a game whilst it is in progress.

==In politics==
{{See also|Political corruption}}

In politics, ''pay to play'' refers to a system, akin to [[payola]] in the music industry, by which one pays (or must pay) money to become a [[Player (political)|player]].

Typically, the payer (an individual, business, or organization) makes [[Campaign finance|campaign contributions]] to public officials, [[Political party|party]] officials, or parties themselves, and receives political or pecuniary benefit such as [[no-bid contract|no-bid government contract]]s, influence over legislation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0107-01.htm J.

The phrase, almost always used in criticism, also refers to the increasing cost of elections and the "price of admission" to even run and the concern "that one candidate can far outspend his opponents, essentially buying the election".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2007/pay_to_play_5091 M.

While the direct exchange of campaign contributions for contracts is the most visible form of pay to play, the greater concern is the central role of money in politics, and its skewing both the composition and the policies of government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://illinoisissues.uis.edu/features/2007may/dollar.html C. Canary and E.

Both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties have been criticized for the practice. Many seeking to ban or restrict the practice characterize pay-to-play as legalized [[Political corruption|corruption]].

The opposite of a pay-to-play system is one that is "fair and open"; the [[New Jersey]] [[The Citizens Campaign#Pay to Play Reform|Pay to Play Act]] specifically sets out bid processes that are or are not considered fair and open, depending upon who has contributed what to whom.{{Cite NJSA|title=19|chapter=44A|section=20.4|citeonly=true}} 

Because of individual federal campaign contribution limits in the wake of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold), pay-to-play payments of "[[soft money]]" (money not contributed directly to candidate campaigns and that does not "expressly advocate" election or defeat of a candidate) donations to state parties and county committees have come under greater scrutiny. This method refers to money that is donated to an intermediary with a higher contribution limit, which in turn donates money to individual candidates or campaign committees who could not directly accept the payor's funds.

Pay-to-Play practices have come under scrutiny by both the federal government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/congress/campaign/state_local/pay_to_play/articles.cfm?ID=10974 Public Citizen ''Pay-to-Play and the Federal Government,'' 02-03-2004], retrieved 2008-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/congress/campaign/state_local/pay_to_play/articles.cfm?ID=10982 Public Citizen, ''Pay-to-Play and State Governments,'' 02-03-2004], retrieved 2008-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Illinois]], federal prosecutors in 2006 were investigating "pay-to-play allegations that surround [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Illinois Gov.

Many agencies have been created to regulate and control campaign contributions. Furthermore, many third-party government "watchdog" groups have formed to monitor campaign donations and make them more [[Transparency (humanities)|transparent]].

In a series of academic research articles, Christopher Cotton shows how selling access may lead to better policy decisions compared to other means of awarding access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.04.005 | volume=93 | title=Should we tax or cap political contributions?

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created a rule that puts some restrictions on asset managers when they make campaign contributions. The New York and Tennessee Republican parties filed a lawsuit against the SEC in August over the 2010 rule, arguing that it impedes free speech, seeking a preliminary injunction against the rule. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell questioned whether the parties have standing to bring the case, noting they failed to name the potential donors and did not cite any investment advisers who are upset about the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Sarah|title=U.S. judge questions Republican challenge to pay-to-play rule|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/12/us-court-sec-campaign-idUSKBN0H727420140912|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In stand-up comedy==
In a pay-to-play gig, the performer will either pay the promoter some money to be allowed to perform at the show, or will have to offer some in-kind payment. In a conventional comedy club, the promoter will pay the acts for their performance, and will raise the money to stage the gig by charging the audience. Some clubs offer open mic slots, where newer acts are allowed to learn the craft, unpaid; this is not the same as pay-to-play. Many comedians are against pay-to-play schemes, which they consider exploitative.&lt;ref name="pearshapedcomedy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearshapedcomedy.com/CRAPP.htm|title=C.R.A.P.P.! Comedians Rail Against Pay-to-Play Comedy Gigs|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pay-to-play was cited as a cause of major damage to the quality of the New York comedy scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/features/2006/07/27/3556/making_more_capital_out_of_comedy|title=Features 2006 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economic terms, a pay-to-play strategy elevates those people who can afford to perform for nothing, or can afford to pay for their stage-time, which has nothing to do with their quality as an act. The pay-to-play promoter is able to profit from the goodwill and desire to perform of the acts, while discouraging appearances by those who cannot afford to perform without payment.

In some shows, the performer is asked to bring a certain number of paying audience members. As a payment in kind policy, this has caused similar controversy to pay-to-play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/01/05/10284/stop_this_monkey_business|title=Stop this monkey business! : News 2010 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A show where the acts are obliged to bring the audience is called a ''bringer''.&lt;ref name="pearshapedcomedy" /&gt;

==In the visual arts==

Similar to the trend cited above in music, pay to play is the practice of visual artists paying gallery owners, dealers, curators, publishers, festival and contest sponsors, and better-established artists to critique, review, judge, exhibit, collect, or publish works created in such disparate media as painting, photography, video, and sculpture. Pay to Play is a type of [[vanity gallery]]. Pay to Play is characterized by [[cash flow]] that moves away from visual artists. Pay to Play is sold to visual artists and justified by visual artists as "an investment in future sales"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj5IV23g-fE Harlan Ellison – Pay the Writer], retrieved 2008-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and may be [[self-victimization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbusiness.com/osoqutscawas.html Artist &amp; Art Competitions, Contests, Opportunities, Gallery Show Scams, Pay to Play], retrieved 2008-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Palazzo dell accademia ecclesiastica Roma.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|The entrance of the Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica. The coat of arms on the left is that of Cardinal Sodano, Cardinal Protector of the PEA.]]

The '''Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy''' ({{lang-la|Pontificia Ecclesiastica Academia}}, {{lang-it|Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica}}) is one of the [[Roman Colleges]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. The academy is dedicated to training priests to serve in the diplomatic corps and the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] of the Holy See. 

Despite its name, the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy is not one of the ten [[Pontifical Academy|Pontifical Academies]] of the Holy See.

The patron of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy is Saint [[Anthony the Great]].

==History==
The diplomatic service of the Holy See can be traced back to 325 AD when [[Pope Sylvester I]] sent legates to represent him at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. The academy was created as the '''Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles''' in 1701 by [[Abbot]] Pietro Garagni, in close collaboration with Blessed [[Sebastian Valfrè]] of the [[Turin]] [[Oratory of St. Philip Neri|Oratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdeccles/documents/storia_it.htm | title=Cenni Storici | publisher=[[Holy See]] | accessdate=8 April 2015 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy was forced to close between 1798 and 1803, the first years of the [[French occupation of Rome]].

==Function==
Located inside Palazzo Severoli on the [[Piazza della Minerva]] in central Rome, the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy trains Catholic priests sent by their bishop from different parts of the world to study ecclesiastical and international diplomacy, particularly in order that the alumni may later be selected to serve in the Diplomatic posts of the [[Holy See]]—ultimately as a papal [[nuncio]], or ambassador. Many leaders of the church have been alumni of the academy, including Popes [[Pope Clement XIII|Clement XIII]], [[Pope Leo XII|Leo XII]], [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]], [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdeccles/documents/pontefici-ex.htm | title=Pontefici ex-alunni (''Italian'') | publisher=[[Holy See]] | accessdate=2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students spend four years at the academy; two years earning a ''licentiate'' in [[canon law]] (J.C.L.) from a Roman University (such as the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]), then two years earning a doctorate in [[canon law]] (J.C.D.). If the students that have been recruited already have a J.C.D. then their time at the PEA is shortened to two years. The courses are usually in diplomatic history, languages and diplomatic writing and are considered not to be academic, but rather focus on the practical skills needed to serve as a diplomat. By the end of his studies, each student has to possess a working knowledge of at least two languages in addition to his mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomasaquinas.edu/news/interview-archbishop-migliore "An Interview with Archbishop Migliore", St. Thomas College, Sant Paula, California]&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the academy is Archbishop [[Giampiero Gloder]], who was previously an official in the Secretariat of State of the Holy See. He succeeded Archbishop [[Beniamino Stella]] on September 21, 2013, when Archbishop Stella was named by [[Pope Francis]] as the Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Clergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://attualita.vatican.va/sala-stampa/bollettino/2013/09/21/news/31719.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925090539/http://attualita.vatican.va/sala-stampa/bollettino/2013/09/21/news/31719.html |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Power to the people'''" is a cultural expression and [[political slogan]] that has been used in a wide variety of contexts.

==Uses==

===In politics===
During the 1960s in the [[United States]], young people began speaking and writing this phrase as a form of rebellion against what they perceived as the oppression by the older generation, especially [[The Establishment]]. The [[Black Panthers]] used the slogan "All Power to the People" to protest the rich, [[ruling class]] domination of society. Pro-democracy [[student]]s used it to protest America's [[Vietnam War|military campaign in Vietnam]].

In his 1974 book ''[[Computer Lib]]'', [[Ted Nelson]] connected computer use with political freedom with the rallying cry "Computer power to the people! Down with the cybercrud." In the mid-1980s the [[People Power Revolution|People Power movement]] arose in the [[Philippines]] to oust [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. In the late 20th century and early 21st century the phrase has been used with regard to [[energy policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/2008/741/38348|title=Power to the People! Keep energy public!|last=Nichols|first=Dick|date=2008-02-22|publisher=Green Left|accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] has as its creed, "Islam is our faith; democracy is our politics; socialism is our economy; all power to the people."

During the Anti Apartheid struggle in South Africa, the terms Amandla and Matla were used frequently during speeches and rallies, this was followed by the crowd responding with Awethu or Kee A Rona. These terms respectively mean "Power" and "To the people".  These terms are still frequently used in ANC meetings and conferences as well as among student activist groups such as SASCO and the ANC Youth League.

[[Margaret Thatcher]] criticised the use of the slogan by the left in a 1986 speech: "Socialists cry 'Power to the people', and raise the clenched fist as they say it. We all know what they really mean - power over people, power to the State."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/106348|title=Margaret Thatcher Speech to Conservative Central Council|publisher=[[Margaret Thatcher Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In television===
The 1970s television series ''[[Citizen Smith]]'' had the title character use the slogan in the title sequence.

===In music===
"Power to the people" is the title of [[Power to the People (song)|a song]] by [[John Lennon]] and a lyric by [[James Brown]]: "Power to the people, people power!". "Power to the people, 'cause the people want peace" is also chanted on the [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] album ''[[New Whirl Odor]]''. [[Rage Against the Machine]] quoted the slogan in their song "[[Year of tha Boomerang]]". The Jamaican [[reggae]] band [[Rootz Underground]] wrote a song entitled "Power to the People" in which they quote this slogan in both English and South African versions.

One of the more politically extreme singer-songwriters is Quino, the lead singer of the reggae band [[Big Mountain (band)|Big Mountain]] who also wrote a song entitled "Power to the People" and then had a tattoo of "Power to the People" along with the fist placed on his chest.

The electronic house music artist [[Basement Jaxx]] released a song titled "Power to the People" on their album ''Junto'' in 2014.

===In advertising===
"Power to the People" was spoken by an actress in a Progressive Auto Insurance advertisement in heavy television rotation during 2009.

==Variations of the slogan==
A popular variation of the slogan is "Power to the Poor People!" Amongst others, the South African social movement the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]] uses the slogan to express the need for poor people to control their own movements rather than have wealthy donors or NGOs control or speak for them.  The divide between South Africa's independent social movements and many leftist and vanguard organisations in South Africa has become a point of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://antieviction.org.za/2007/02/12/african-movements-continue-their-fights-against-ngo-authoritarianism/| title=African movements continue their fights against NGO authoritarianism| publisher=Anti-Eviction Campaign| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501130830/http://antieviction.org.za/2007/02/12/african-movements-continue-their-fights-against-ngo-authoritarianism/| archivedate=2009-05-01| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abahlali.org/node/4015| title=Backyard-dwellers attempt to occupy vacant land and then march on Housing MEC's posh home in Gugulethu| publisher=Abahlali baseMjondolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African slogan "[[Amandla (power)|Amandla]] Ngawethu" or "Amandla Awethu" is also a popular variation of the Power to the People.  It literally means "The power is ours" but is used in a similar way as "Power to the People". It is often used in a call and response format, with the speaker shouting "Amandla" and the crowd replying "Awethu".

'''The Program on Intrastate Conflict and Conflict Resolution''' is a program of the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] at Harvard’s [[Kennedy School of Government]], Cambridge, Massachusetts. The program analyzes the causes of ethnic, religious, and other intercommunal conflict, and seeks to identify practical ways to prevent and limit such conflict. It is concerned with the vulnerability of weak and failed states, with [[good governance]], with improving leadership, with peace building and peace enforcement capabilities in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, and with the role of truth commissions in conflict prevention and conflict resolution.

One of the more recent aims of the program, headed by its Director, [[Robert I. Rotberg]], is to develop an Index of African Governance. The Index evaluates the governance of 48 African nations as a continuation of the program’s ongoing efforts to assist Africans in strengthening governance and leadership throughout the continent.

The Program on Intrastate Conflict has published a number of books including ''Building a New Afghanistan''; ''When States Fail''; and ''Worst of the Worst: Dealing with Repressive and Rogue Nations''.

The program supports and sponsors an international group of fellows whose research focuses on all aspects of conflict within states; ethnic/religious/linguistic conflict; peacekeeping and peace building; conflict prevention in general; conflict resolution, especially in divided states; all aspects of state failure and the prevention of state failure.

'''Public Netbase''' was a cultural media initiative, open access internet platform, and advocate for the development of electronic art. The project increasingly came into conflict with the Austrian political establishment{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} during the 1990s. It received awards and recognition by [[UNESCO]].

==Early development==
Public Netbase was founded by [[Konrad Becker]] and Francisco de Sousa Webber in Vienna's Messepalast (later renamed to [[Museumsquartier]]) in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use and critical analyses of information and communication technology. Its parent organization was the ''Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0'', founded in 1993.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Public Netbase / t0 |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the Institute's activities after 1994 occurred through Public Netbase, leading to the names and establishment dates being loosely applied, even in the organization's official material. The name of its [[World Wide Web]] server, ''t0'', was often appended to either name as well. During the first years of its existence, Public Netbase shared a space in [[Museumsquartier]] with the initiative ''Depot – Kunst und Diskussion''.&lt;ref&gt;http://depot.or.at/index.php?article_id=1&amp;clang=1. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; After it relocated to own rooms (also in [[Museumsquartier]]), the number of wokshops and instruction courses increased and the program of discursive events was now realized on an almost daily basis.

==Art and culture==
[[Image:Netbase 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2]]
Public Netbase focused on aiding the development of electronic art and the impact of the nascent World Wide Web on culture.  Its own online presence earned it an award for distinction at the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Prix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Ars Electronica 1995 World Wide Web Distinction |url=http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528# |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129084500/http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528 |archivedate=November 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the web space provided through Public Netbase supported Austrian artists, although some hosted projects, such as the [[Transformation Story Archive]], had wider recognition.  The physical location in the Museumsquartier was also used for sponsored events, ranging from art symposia to a conference of the [[Association of Autonomous Astronauts]]&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Association of Autonomous Astronauts' Intergalactic Conference in Vienna, Earth, June 21-22 1997 |date=1997-06-06 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1274&amp;page=1#660 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a "lecture/performance/event" by [[Critical Art Ensemble]] about biotechnology &lt;ref name="CAE"&gt;{{cite press release |title=FLESH MACHINE: A Genexploitation Project |date=1997-11-17 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1475&amp;page=1#940 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of conferences/exhibitions such as ROBOTRONIKA&lt;ref&gt;http://robot.t0.or.at/ Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; (1998) and SYNWORLD&lt;ref name="synworld.t0.or.at"&gt;http://synworld.t0.or.at/. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; (1999).

==Involvement in politics==
When the right-wing [[Austrian Freedom Party]] (FPÖ) and its leader [[Jörg Haider]] began to rise in power in Austria, Public Netbase took an increasingly political activist role while facing increasing government pressure.  Haider accused Public Netbase of sponsoring child pornography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.medialounge.net/lounge/workspace/crashhtml/cc/29.htm| publisher=Crash Media| title=Sex slaves to public opinion - Public Netbase kicks back...| first=Micz| last= Flor| date=1998-11-27| accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conflated Christina Göstl's hosted erotic art with a commercial porn site run from the British Virgin Islands during a speech in parliament.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | publisher=Salon | title=Is it Sex or is it Art? | first=Janelle | last=Brown | date=1998-09-06 | accessdate=2006-10-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901125303/http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | archivedate=2006-09-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Public Netbase sponsored a "virtual alternative to Austria's far right government" that offered Austrian Web Resistance Awards to web sites dedicated to opposing Haider's government.&lt;ref name="GAA"&gt;{{cite web |title=About government-austria.at |url=http://government-austria.at/index.php3?lang=&amp;menuid=about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute for Applied Autonomy]], recipient of an award for distinction in interactive art at the Prix Ars Electronica 2000,&lt;ref name="PAE2000"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Ars Electronica 2000 Interactive Art Distinction |url=http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2175 |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325043635/http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2175 |archivedate=March 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated their award to Public Netbase for its political efforts.&lt;ref name="PAE2002-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Netbase t0 ist überraschender Preisträger des Prix Ars Electronica 2000 |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about/press/20000905 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another t0-project begun during this period, World-information.org, described as "an ongoing effort to critically observe and investigate new technologies in a societal, economic and artistic context"&lt;ref name="WIO"&gt;{{cite web | title=World-information.org |publisher=Public Netbase |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/projects/wio |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to involvement with the UNESCO ''Digi-Arts'' program&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |title=World-information.org |publisher=UNESCO |date=2004-10-11 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23603&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of conventions across Europe.

However, the organization's successes were insufficient to stave off problems.  Its lease at the Museumsquartier was not renewed after the controversial remodelling period in 2000,&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wassermair |first=M. |title='In Austria, the Clock Ticks with a Different Beat': Short Story of Public Netbase t0, its International Success and Recent Political Struggles |journal=Cultivate Interactive |issue=2 |date=2000-10-16 |issn=1471-3225 |url=http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue2/netbase/ |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it faced a series of audits and other bureaucratic obstacles.  Financial difficulties and an inability to secure a permanent replacement location could not be resolved.&lt;ref name="Support"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Open letter to Michael Häupl, Mayor of Vienna, and the Vienna City Government |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about/press/20040506 |date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite significant community support and a reorganization effort in 2005 that shortened its name to Netbase, the City of Vienna stopped all funding effective January 11, 2006, leading to the immediate shut down of the organization.

The ''Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0'' is still active: Its projects are now mainly conducted through World-Information.Org and World-Information Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/en/. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 it has also been organizing Austria's most prominent online "polling booth" wahlkabine.at &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wahlkabine.at.

*Dark Markets (2002)
This strategic conference examined current relations between media politics, information technologies and political theories of democracy. Central questions for the conference were: "Has the Internet still its original potential to foster a 'network democracy from below'? Aren't new media already too much compromised by the ever growing state and corporate influence? Can the Internet be reclaimed as a 'digital commons' or has the current crisis already reached a meta media level, beyond propaganda and its mirror counter-campaigns?"

==Overview==
Resistência Galega is the continuation of several Galician separatist groups active in the 1970s and 80s such as the [[Loita Armada Revolucionaria]], "Liga Armada Galega" or "Exército Guerrilheiro do Povo Galego Ceive". The organisation was reportedly created by the Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista ({{lang-en|Assembly of Independentist Youth}}) in 2005 and it became known to the public with a manifesto published on the Internet on November 20 of that same year. In it, several attacks against political party offices, the [[Spanish Army]], and incidents which occurred during the [[Prestige oil spill]] crisis were claimed.&lt;ref name="periodistadigital"&gt;{{cite news

According to [[Law enforcement in Spain|Spanish police]], the group has three active cells with each one consisting of four members. Two of them based in the cities of Santiago and Vigo, and another one moving around Galicia. The group also has around 200 sympathizers and supporters. Its leader is suspected to be Antonio García Matos, former member of the extinct organization "Exército Guerrilheiro".&lt;ref name="20minutos_rega"/&gt; Also known as "Toninho", he was arrested in November 2005 and was soon released, being on the run since then. He is believed to be hiding in Portugal, from where he orders the organisation's attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7360">'''Scăieni Phalanstery''' (Romanian: ''Falansterul de la Scăieni'') was a utopic experimental community ([[phalanstery]]) created in 1835&amp;ndash;36 by Romanian [[boyar]] [[Teodor Diamant]] in the town of Scăieni, [[Prahova County]], [[Wallachia]] (today part of [[Boldești-Scăeni]] Commune) based on the ideas of the French socialist [[Charles Fourier]]. The experiment was forcefully closed down by the authorities.

==Origins==

Before the 1848 Revolutions, [[Teodor Diamant]], a member of the lower nobility, together with other Wallachian intellectuals learnt about the ideas of [[Charles Fourier]], an early French utopian socialist, during Diamant's studies in Paris in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="hitchins"&gt;Keith Hitchins, ''Rumania, 1866-1947''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-19-822126-6}}, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

He presented his social and economic views in three articles that were published in June 1834 in [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]'s ''[[Curierul Românesc]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="marxists"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/romana/dictionar/d/Diamant_Teodor.htm Dicționar Politic: Teodor Diamant] at ''[[Marxists Internet Archive]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dohotaru, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

In 1835, a year after Diamant returned to Wallachia, he established a [[phalanstery]] (an agricultural-industrial community based on Fourier's principles)&lt;ref name="hitchins"/&gt; at the estate in Scăieni owned by [[boyar]] [[Emanoil Bălăceanu]]. The estate, ridden with debts, had already been put under [[Sequestration (law)|sequester]] and the ongoing debt problem prevented the society from acquiring better equipment.&lt;ref name="Dohotaru, p.133"&gt;Dohotaru, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attestation of the society was on March 10, 1835, when Bălăceanu leased the estate to the society, the date being mentioned by Bălăceanu as the start of the phalanstery.&lt;ref name="lespromesses"/&gt; The preparations took the rest of the year 1836 and the society began functioning in early 1836.&lt;ref name="lespromesses"/&gt;

==The community==

The earliest members of the phalanstery were Roma people [[Slavery in Romania|liberated from slavery]] by the boyar,&lt;ref name="Marushiakova"&gt;Marushiakova, Elena and Vesselin Popov. 2009. "Gypsy Slavery in Wallachia and Moldavia" In: Kamusella, Tomasz and Krzysztof Jaskulowski, eds. ''Nationalisms Today''. Oxford: Peter Lang, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; but the first recruits moved to Scăieni in January 1836. Another group of ten young people who joined the phalanstery on August 18, 1836.&lt;ref name="lespromesses"/&gt;

It produced both agricultural and handicraft goods, the workday was of only 8 hours, at a time when many peasants worked up to 14–16 hours a day, however there were no days of rest.&lt;ref name="Dohotaru, p.133"/&gt; The produce of the commune was distributed according to the amount of work performed and the level of skill, assessed through vote by the members of the community and according to the quantity of capital contributed.&lt;ref name="lespromesses"&gt;Ioncioaia, "Les promesses de l’Harmonie..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dohotaru, p.137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ending==

The community came into the eyes of the authorities in August 1836 and one of their representatives visited the phalanstery in Scăieni. The report discusses a group of 24 people, wearing odd clothing and who were not very willing to talk about their community.&lt;ref name="lespromesses"/&gt; The fact that so many men and women lived in a common household made the authorities presume that it was a [[brothel]]. The authorities desired a more thoroughly visit to the community, but Bălăceanu refused.&lt;ref name="lespromesses"/&gt;

The Phalanstery was terminated in 1836 by the authorities which feared that this kind of experiments would encourage communist beliefs in the country,&lt;ref name="hitchins"/&gt; although the official reason was that the community was not registered properly with the authorities.&lt;ref name="lespromesses"/&gt;

Although the era's documents say that there was no violence at the disbanding of the phalanstery, some romanticized accounts talk about an exile of the founders (according to [[Ion Ghica]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Ghica]], ''[[wikisource:ro:Scrisori către Vasile Alecsandri:Teodor Diamant|Scrisori către Vasile Alecsandri : Teodor Diamant]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or clashes between the phalanstery members and the authorities (according to [[Ştefan Greceanu]]).&lt;ref name="Dohotaru, p.133-134"&gt;Dohotaru, p.133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Emanoil Bălăceanu was arrested at the order of Hospodar [[Alexandru Ghica]], but it seems that the reason was that he refused to change the name of the Agricultural and Manufactural Society, which sounded too similar to an Agricultural Society of the Hospodar. Another reason was the insolence of asking the Hospodar in a petition dated November 1, 1836 for a modern [[plough]].&lt;ref name="lespromesses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dohotaru, p.133-134"/&gt;

Following the disbanding of the phalanstery, 14 of the former members of the phalanstery filed a complaint at the judicial [[divan]] against Manolache Bălăceanu, accusing him of [[breach of contract]] and requesting back the money invested, complaining about the living conditions in the phalanstery.&lt;ref&gt;Dohotaru, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, Teodor Diamant continued envisioning the creation of new phalansteries ("agricultural-industrial colonies") for the newly liberated slaves in [[Moldavia]] in 1841, for this purpose preparing a memorandum to the Administrative Consul of Moldavia,&lt;ref name="Marushiakova"/&gt; but this was not accepted.&lt;ref name="marxists"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Being the earliest socialist movement in Romania, during the rule of the Communist Party in Romania, the authorities promoted Diamant as a visionary. In 1958, his work, ''Scrieri economice'' (Economic Writings) was posthumously published at [[Editura Științifică]]&lt;ref name="marxists"/&gt; and in 1979 a movie called ''Falansterul'', inspired from the Scăieni Phalanstery, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0157611|Falansterul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''senate''' is a [[deliberative assembly]], often the [[upper house]] or chamber of a [[bicameral]] [[legislature]]. The name comes from the [[Ancient Rome|ancient]] [[Roman Senate]] (Latin: ''Senatus''), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: ''senex'' meaning "the elder" or "old man") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the [[society]] or [[ruling class]]. Thus, the literal meaning of the word "senate" is '''Assembly of Elders'''.

Many countries have an assembly named a ''senate'', composed of ''senators'' who may be [[election|elected]], appointed, have [[inheritance|inherited]] the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of "sober second thought" to consider [[legislation]] passed by a [[lower house]], whose members are usually elected. Most senates have asymmetrical duties and powers compared with their respective lower house meaning they have special duties, for example to fill important political positions or to pass special laws. Conversely many senates have limited powers in changing or stopping bills under consideration and efforts to stall or veto a bill may be bypassed by the lower house or another branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Bicameral Legislatures: An international Comparison. Betty Drexhage. The Hague. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The modern word ''Senate'' is derived from the [Latin] word ''senātus'' (senate), which comes from ''senex'', “old man”.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com Unabridged Based on the Random House Dictionary: ''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/senate senate]''&lt;/ref&gt; The members or legislators of a senate are called '''senators'''.  The Latin word ''senator'' was adopted into English with no change in spelling.  Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of social organization, in which advisory or decision-making powers are reserved for the eldest men.  For the same reason, the word ''senate'' is correctly used when referring to any powerful authority characteristically composed by the eldest members of a community, as a deliberative body of a faculty in an institution of higher learning is often called a senate.  This form adaptation was used to show the power of those in body and for the decision-making process to be thorough, which could take a long period of time. The original senate was the [[Roman Senate]], which lasted until at least AD 603,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1047|author=Levillain, Philippe|title=The Papacy: Gaius-Proxies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VDcmDeLuV4C&amp;pg=PA1047|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-92230-2|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although various efforts to revive it were made in Medieval Rome. In the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Senate]] continued until the [[Fourth Crusade]], circa 1202–1204.

Modern democratic states with [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliamentary system]]s are sometimes equipped with a senate, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel [[lower house]], known variously as the “[[House of Representatives]]”, “[[House of Commons]]”, “[[Chamber of Deputies]]”, “[[National Assembly]]”, “[[Legislative Assembly]]”, or "[[House of Assembly]]", by electoral rules.  This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or [[Majoritarianism|majoritarian]] or [[Plurality voting system|plurality system]], and an electoral basis or ''collegium''.  Typically, the senate is referred to as the upper house and has a smaller membership than the lower house.  In some [[federal state]]s senates also exist at the subnational level. In the [[United States]] all states with the exception of [[Nebraska]] (whose legislature is a unicameral body called the “Legislature” but whose members refer to themselves as “senators”) have a state senate. There is also the [[US Senate]] at the federal level. 
Similarly in [[Argentina]], in addition to the [[Senate of Argentina|Senate]] at federal level, eight of the country's [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Corrientes]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] (since 1987) and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], have bicameral legislatures with a Senate.  [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] changed to [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] systems in 2001 and 2003 respectively.

In [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], only the upper house of the federal parliament is known as the Senate. All [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] other than [[Queensland]] have an upper house known as a [[Legislative council]]. Several Canadian provinces also once had a Legislative Council, but these have all been abolished, the last being [[Quebec]]'s [[Legislative Council of Quebec|Legislative council]] in 1968.

In [[Germany]], the last Senate of a [[States of Germany|State]] parliament, the [[Bavarian Senate|Senate]] of [[Bavaria]], was abolished in 1999.

Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments.  For example, elections are held every three years for half the membership of the [[Senate of the Philippines]], the term of a senator being six years.  In contrast, members of the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] upon the recommendation of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75.

== Alternative meanings ==
The terms ''senate'' and ''senator'', however, do not necessarily refer to a second chamber of a legislature:
* The [[Senate of Finland]] was, until 1918, the executive branch and the supreme court.
* The [[Senate of Latvia]] ([[:lv:Latvijas Senāts|lv]]) fulfilled a similar judicial function during the interbellum (1918-1940).
* In German politics:

In the ''[[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]'' (Federated States) of Germany which form a [[City State]] (in German: ''Stadtstaat''), i.e. [[Berlin]] ([[Senate of Berlin]]), [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] ([[Senate of Bremen]]) and [[Hamburg]] ([[Senate of Hamburg]]), the senates (''[[:wikt:Senat|Senat]]'' in [[German language|German]]) are the executive branch, with senators (''Senator'') being the holders of ministerial portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Senate of Berlin]], [[Senate of Bremen]] and [[Senate of Hamburg]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of cities which were former members of the ''[[Hanse]]'' (a medieval confederacy of port cities mainly at the shores of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea), such as [[Greifswald]], [[Lübeck]], [[Rostock]], [[Stralsund]], or [[Wismar]], the city government is also called a Senate.

However, in  [[Bavaria]], the Senate was a second legislative chamber until its abolition in 1999.

* In German jurisdiction:

The term Senat (senate) in higher [[court of appeal|courts of appeal]] refers to the "[[Bench (metonymy)|bench]]" in its broader [[metonymy]] meaning, describing members of the [[judiciary]] collectively (usually five [[judge]]s), often occupied with a particular [[subject-matter jurisdiction]]. However, the judges are not called "senators". The German term ''Strafsenat'' (literally "Penal Senate") in a German court translates to ''Bench of [[Criminal jurisdiction|penal-law jurisdiction]]'' and ''Zivilsenat'' (literally "Civil Senate") to ''Bench of [[Private law|private-law jurisdiction]]''. The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] consists of two senates of eight judges each. In its case the division is mostly of an organizational nature, as a matter of dividing the work load; both senates handle the same kind of constitutional cases. At some points in the past, one senate was considered more conservative and the other more liberal, but that is not the case as of 2011.
* In [[Scotland]], judges of the [[High Court of Justiciary]] are called [[Senators of the College of Justice]].
* In some, mostly federal countries with a unicameral legislature, some of the legislators are elected differently from the others and are called senators. In federal countries, such senators represent the territories, while the other members represent the people at large (this device is used to allow a federal representation without having to establish a bicameral legislature); this is the case with [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Comoros]] and [[Micronesia]]. In other, non-federal countries, the use of the term ''senator'' marks some other difference between such members and the rest of the legislators (such as the method of selection); this is the case with the [[States of Jersey|States]] of [[Jersey]], [[Dominica]]'s [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]] and the [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]] [[House of Assembly of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|House of Assembly]].
* In [[Wales]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]] debating chamber is called the [[Senedd]], pronounced 'Seneth'.
* An [[academic senate]] is the governing body of some universities.
* In [[Greece]] during the early stages of the [[Greek War of Independence]], various local legislative and executive bodies were established by the Greek rebels. Two of them were styled "senate": the [[Peloponnesian Senate]] and the [[Senate of Western Continental Greece]].

[[File:Smallwhatisclingov.jpg|thumb|Governance Technique]]
'''Service governance''' is a means of achieving good [[corporate governance]] through governing internal corporate [[Service (business)|services]] across, and throughout, an enterprise{{fact|date=October 2018}}. Even though the initial focus was on IT services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10799-015-0239-z|title=Defining the relationships between IT service management and IT service governance|first1=Marko|last1=Jäntti|first2=Virpi|last2=Hotti|date=30 June 2015|journal=Information Technology and Management|volume=17|issue=2|pages=141–150|accessdate=17 October 2018|doi=10.1007/s10799-015-0239-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} it can include accounting, business administration, and other internal service sectors. Institutionalizing these services enables the monitoring and control of risk, value, and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=AXELOS|title=Adopting Service Governance: Governing Portfolio Value for Sound Corporate Citizenship|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780113314652|page=6|date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principle among the issues is the fair funding for each service and the allocation system for scarce services. 

Institutionalizing internal corporate services is the corporate management equivalent a [[General Ledger|general ledger]], only with the line items reflecting the services, not simply departments. The service portfolio allows the governance of services as a means to govern the organization by [[Value (ethics)|value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Betz |first1=Charles T. |title=Architecture and patterns for IT service management, resource planning, and governance : making shoes for the cobbler's children |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann |isbn=9780123705938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service portfolio==
The portfolio of services is a list of all internal services within the organization that is available outside their own department. The portfolio describes each service, how it is funded, associated costs, ownership boundaries, along with its current performance and identified conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://service-governance.org/index.php?title=Best_Practice/Service_Portfolio |title=Service Portfolio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222074953/http://service-governance.org/index.php?title=Best_Practice/Service_Portfolio |archivedate=December 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2018}} This portfolio contains all services in the organization, including those which have been [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] and are now supplied to the organization by third parties.

The portfolio provides a map of the organization that provides directors with a different way of understanding the dynamics of the organization than that received from financial reports, and, thus, makes it easier for the board to make decisions based on accurate, contemporaneous information.

==Value==
Service governance uses the methods described in the management of value (MoV) to discover the requirements of the organization and to use those on design services, and their measures to deliver those values.&lt;ref&gt;Vásquez, W. (2013). An economic valuation of water connections under different approaches of service governance. Water Resources and Economics, 2-3, 17-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of research on service-oriented systems and non-functional properties : future directions |publisher=IGI Global (701 E. Chocolate Avenue, Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033, USA) |isbn=978-1-61350-432-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and compliance==
Well established best practice methods are used to design measures and metrics for the organization. These are designed to meet the requirements of the corporate mission, charter, and policy. This ensures that they measure what is required by the organization and, thus, supply accurate real-time information to the board for strategic governance decisions, and to management for operational decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cai |first1=Hongming |last2=Xu |first2=Lida |last3=Xu |first3=Boyi |last4=Zhang |first4=Pengzhu |last5=Guo |first5=Jingzhi |last6=Zhang |first6=Yuran |title=A service governance mechanism based on process mining for cloud-based applications |journal=Enterprise Information Systems |date=22 February 2018 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1080/17517575.2018.1442933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gómez-Baggethun |first1=Erik |last2=Kelemen |first2=Eszter |last3=Martín-López |first3=Berta |last4=Palomo |first4=Ignacio |last5=Montes |first5=Carlos |title=Scale Misfit in Ecosystem Service Governance as a Source of Environmental Conflict |journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources |date=October 2013 |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=1202–1216 |doi=10.1080/08941920.2013.820817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also ensures compliance with the requirements of Audit as well as enabling the production of the financial and sustainability report and reporting on good corporate citizenship.

== Enterprise service management ==
Enterprise service management (ESM) is a means of extending service management across an entire organization, often from IT service management ([[ITSM]]). It is a component of service governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://service-governance.org/index.php?title=Enterprise_Service_Management] {{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESM provides an integrated view of core service business processes, often in real-time, using common databases. ESM systems track business resources—people, parts, assets—and the status of customer commitments: service requests, orders, repairs, and SLAs. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (customer service, technical support, sales, field service, etc.) that use the information for their work. ESM facilitates information flow between departments and coordinates activities with external resources involved in the service business process.

Enterprise service management is also a term used to sometimes generically describe the use of [[Service (business)|service]] processes and technologies across an organization. It is meant to be a broader term (like ERP and EAM) in contrast to [[IT Service Management|IT service management]] which only concerns the management of IT services.  

==History==
The term has been used to describe the success that a number of organizations have had in using the ''Best Practice'' advice, found in frameworks such as [[ITIL]], [[The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework|TOGAF]], and others, for company-wide service design and operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240184788/Cern-uses-ITIL-to-rethink-facilities-management|title=CERN uses ITIL to rethink facilities management|website=Computerweekly.com|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}}

The '''Special Security Force Command''' ({{lang-ar|قيادة قوة الأمن الخاصة}}) is a [[paramilitary]] law enforcement body in [[Bahrain]] under the command of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Bahrain)|Ministry of the Interior]]. The SSFC is more commonly referred to as the "Special Security Forces", the "Special Forces", "Bahrain Special Security Forces (BSSF) or as the "riot police" ({{lang-ar|الشغب}}).

==Accusations==
{{see|Human rights in Bahrain}}
The Special Security Forces have been accused of [[human rights abuse]]s, in trying to suppress pro-democratic activity in Bahrain. The SSFC has been at the front line of the Bahrain government's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters during the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]] in the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brutal crackdown on demonstrators in Bahrain|url=http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/14480|accessdate=4 September 2011|newspaper=[[Front Line (NGO)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Bahrain signed a cooperation agreement with France under which French police officers working in the [[Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité]] have provided training to Bahrain's SSFC.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite news|title=Torture Redux|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/88200/section/5|newspaper=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=8 February 2010|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company of the SSFC were deployed to [[Afghanistan]] to provide base security at the [[United States]]'s [[Camp Leatherneck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain troops to lead Afghan special forces|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=294605|newspaper=[[Gulf Daily News]]|date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State Department cables detail U.S. links to Bahrain|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/21/AR2011022104313.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Taylor Grazing Act of 1934'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publiclandscouncil.org/CMDocs/PublicLandsCouncil/Taylor%20Grazing%20Act%20-%201934.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} | 43 ''U.S. Code'' §§ 315-316o&lt;/ref&gt; ({{USPL|73|482}}) is a [[United States federal law]] that provides for the regulation of grazing on the [[public land]]s (excluding Alaska) to improve rangeland conditions and regulate their use.

The law initially permitted 80,000,000 ac (32,000,000 ha) of previously unreserved public lands of the United States to be placed into grazing districts to be administered by the [[Department of the Interior]]. As amended, the law now sets no limit on the amount of lands in grazing districts. Currently, there are approximately 162,000,000 ac (65,600,000 ha) inside grazing allotments.

These can be vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved land from public lands, all except for [[Alaska]], [[United States National Forest|national forest]]s, parks, monuments, [[Indian reservation]]s, railroad grant lands, and revested [[Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands|Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands]]. Surrounding land owners may be granted right of passage over these districts.  Permits are given for grazing privileges in the districts.  Also permits can be given to build fences, [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and other improvements.

The permittees are required to pay a fee, and the permit cannot exceed ten years but is renewable. Permits can be revoked because of severe [[drought]] or other natural disasters that deplete grazing lands.

==History==
During the administration of President [[Herbert Hoover]], it became clear that federal regulation of public land use was needed to address the root causes of the Dust Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;"The Dust Bowl" (2016,February 18) Retrieved from https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/depwwii/dustbowl/&lt;/ref&gt; Since vast portions were used for livestock grazing, the importance of range management loomed large.

The advocacy of [[John Francis Deeds]], Chief of the Agricultural Division of the Geological Survey and Deputy Director of the Department's Grazing Division, was influential in bringing about the benefits of the Taylor Grazing Act.

Congressman [[Don B. Colton]] of [[Utah]] introduced a bill to create grazing districts, but the bill failed to pass the [[US Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Peffer, E. Louise. ''The Closing of the Public Domain: Disposal and Reservation Policies, 1900-50'' Stanford University Press, 1951, pp. 203-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Edward T. Taylor]], a [[US House of Representatives|Representative]] from Colorado, reintroduced the Colton bill as the Taylor bill. This bill set up the grazing bureau, or service in the Department of Interior, to administer the range lands.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, Harold K. ''The United States Forest Service A History'' University of Washington Press, 1976, p. 205  {{ISBN|0-295-95523-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grazing Service was merged with the [[General Land Office]] in 1946 to form the [[Bureau of Land Management]].

Case studies by [[Phillip O. Foss]] on the role of local grazing advisory committees established by the Taylor Grazing Act in regulating the grazing of livestock on federal public lands found that such committees were often dominated by the same ranchers and cattlemen whose activities were supposed to be regulated,&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Phillip O. ''The Grazing Fee Dilemma''. University, AL: University of Alabama Press, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Phillip O. ''Politics and Grass''. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Phillip O. ''The Battle of Soldier Creek''. University, AL: University of Alabama Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; raising questions as to whether grazing regulation had been "captured" by the regulated interests.

Born April 27, 1902 in [[Ségou]] in the [[French Sudan]], Kouyaté studied at [[École normale supérieure William Ponty|École William Ponty]] on the [[Gorée|Île de Gorée]] in [[Senegal]]. He worked as a school teacher in the [[Ivory Coast]] from 1921 to 1923. He then travelled to [[Aix-en-Provence]] for further education, but was expelled in 1926 for spreading [[communism|communist]] [[propaganda]]. In 1927, he helped found the communist ''[[Ligue de défense de la race nègre]]'', editing their paper ''[[La Race nègre]]''.&lt;ref name=OIF /&gt; When that group split, he helped create the ''[[Union des travailleurs nègres]]'' and ran a new paper ''[[Le Cri des Nègres]]''.  When Kouyaté was thrown out by the group's hardline communists, and purged from the [[French Communist Party]], he began to work with [[Messali Hadj]]'s [[Algeria]]n independence group, [[Etoile Nord-Africaine]].&lt;ref name=OIF /&gt; Even during his Communist period, Kouyaté communicated with non-communist black activists such as [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and collaborated regularly with [[George Padmore]].

He was executed by [[Nazi]]s at Fort [[Montluçon]] in 1942. Historian Philippe Dewitte has argued that Kouyaté may have tried to collaborate with the Nazis before his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etudesafricaines.revues.org/6083 |title=Genova, James E. — Colonial Ambivalence, Cultural Authenticity, and the Limitations of Mimicry in French-Ruled West Africa, 1914-1956

{{further|U.S. national anthem protests}}
It is a tradition in the United States to play "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", the [[national anthem]], before sporting events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to the [[United States Code]], those present should stand at attention with right hand over heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|36|301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Title 36 United States Code: § 301.

[[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) have released a statement in September 2017 regarding any potential protests "The march of players, officials and children into our stadiums and singing of the anthem has been a pre-match tradition since our first game in 1996.

===Athletes and sports media===
Throughout the remainder of the 2016 season, Kaepernick received public backlash for his protest, with an anonymous [[NFL]] executive calling Kaepernick "a traitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651681-mike-freemans-10-point-stance-kaepernick-anger-intense-in-nfl-front-offices|title=Kaepernick Anger Intense in NFL Front Offices|first=Mike|last=Freeman|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he received death threats.&lt;ref name="deaththreats"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/nfl-kaepernick-received-death-threats-160921152934415.html US: Colin Kaepernick says he has received death threats]. [[Al Jazeera]]. September 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] offered support for Kaepernick stating, "Patriotism comes in many forms and what has happened is it's been conflated with a bumper-style kind of flag-waving and with the military only so that people cannot see that in his own way Colin Kaepernick, however imperfectly, is doing a patriotic thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/09/bob-costas-trump-nfl|title=Bob Costas puts the entire national anthem debate in perspective with one powerful segment|date=September 25, 2017|work=For The Win|access-date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trent Dilfer]] criticized Kaepernick. "The big thing that hit me through all this was this is a backup quarterback whose job is to be quiet, and sit in the shadows and get the starter ready to play Week 1," Dilfer said on ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]''. "Yet he chose a time where all of a sudden he became the center of attention. And it has disrupted that organization. It has caused friction.

Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] tournament in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], Team USA coach [[John Tortorella]] told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/world-cup-of-hockey/tortorella-will-sit-anthem-protests-team-usa/|title=Tortorella 'will sit' any Team USA player who protests anthem - Sportsnet.ca|newspaper=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When you hear one person say 'black lives matter' or 'blue lives matter,' all lives matter." Adding moments later, "With me being a fighter, and my hands being registered, if I hit a guy for breaking in my house, or breaking in my car, it's gonna cost me more money, so I gotta work smarter, not harder.

[[Image:Alkmaar Cheesemuseum.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The Waag in [[Alkmaar]].]]
A '''weigh house''' or '''weighing house''' is a public building at or within which goods are weighed. Most of these buildings were built before 1800, prior to the establishment of international standards for weights. As public control of the weight of goods was very important, they were run by local authorities who would also use them for the levying of taxes on goods transported through or sold within the city. Therefore, weigh houses would often be near a market square or town centre.

Between 1550 and about 1690 people accused of [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]] were at times brought to a weigh house in order to be subjected to a "witch test" to "prove" their innocence for payment (as nobody was deemed to be a witch after this test&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heksenwaag.nl/web/en/home/?language_id=16|title=Museum De Heksenwaag|website=www.heksenwaag.nl|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;). If a person was found to be lighter than a set weight, he or she was deemed guilty. This is similar to the use of a [[ducking stool]].

Weigh houses were especially common in the Netherlands, Germany, where they are called ''waag'' and ''waage'' respectively (both meaning "[[weighing scale|scale]]") and Poland (''waga miejska'', "town/city scales", as in [[Cracow]] and [[Poznań|Posen]]). Outside the Netherlands and Germany the public weighing usually didn't take place in a special building, but in a town hall, guild hall, courthouse, or the like.

==Netherlands==

===Alkmaar===
One of the very few remaining weigh houses still in use is the one in [[Alkmaar]], [[Netherlands]], where the Cheese Market still includes the weighing of the cheeses as a demonstration for tourists.

=== Amsterdam ===
[[File:Waag Amsterdam 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Waag in Amsterdam]]
The [[Waag (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam Waag]] is a remnant of the former city walls in [[Amsterdam]]. Constructed in 1488, it was originally one of the [[city gate]]s, the Sint Anthoniespoort. When the city expanded, the [[Nieuwmarkt]] (''new market'') was created around it and the [[weighing scale]]s for the [[Market (place)|market]] were placed in the former gate. Today the building houses the Waag Society, an ICT research foundation working in the social and cultural domain, and there is a café/restaurant on the ground floor.

The building carries the oldest plaque in Amsterdam, which reads ''On 28 April 1488 the first stone of this gate was laid''.

The city walls that the Sint Anthoniespoort was part of were built in the years 1481-1494. These walls have now completely disappeared and the only remnants are this gate, the lower part of another gate, the [[Regulierspoort]] (now the [[Munttoren]]) and one defence tower, the [[Schreierstoren]]. When in the late 16th century the city expanded the wall was torn down and the gate lost its function. The defensive canal and palissade around the gate was turned into a market square. In the process the ground level was raised, so the building is no longer quite as high as it used to be. For the new weighing function the original front and rear gate were connected with a roof.

The upper floors housed four [[guild]]s for some time, namely those of the smiths, [[Painter's guild|painters]], masons and surgeons. Each guild had its own entrance tower. In 1632 [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] was commissioned to paint the surgeons at work, and the resulting ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' made his reputation. In 1691 a [[theatrum anatomicum]] was added, which became famous for admitting (paying) members of the public to witness human [[dissection]]s.

After the guilds were dissolved around 1795 the building served numerous purposes, later housing a fire brigade and two museums (including the [[Joods Historisch Museum|Jewish Historical Museum]]) before it was handed over to a foundation in 1990. This had plans to partly destroy the building and build an addition designed by [[Philippe Starck]], but the foundation went bankrupt before any plans were carried out. The neighbourhood and monument lovers convinced the Amsterdam city council that the building deserved a better fate. It was decided to restore it in keeping with its medieval background. Waag Society became the principal tenant in 1996.

=== Other cities ===
A number of other Dutch towns also have a weigh house, including [[Delft]], [[Deventer]] (with museum), [[Edam, North Holland|Edam]], [[Enkhuizen]], [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Waag, Haarlem|Haarlem]], [[Hoorn]], [[Langweer]], [[Leeuwarden]], [[Leiden]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Oudewater]] (''Heksenwaag'' = witches' weighing house), [[Vlaardingen]] and [[Zaltbommel]]. [[Pieter Post]], a Golden Age architect, had his weigh house design chosen for two cities; Gouda, and Leiden:

The '''Witenaġemot''' ([[Old English]] ''witena ġemōt'', {{IPA-ang|ˈwitena jeˈmoːt}}, modern English {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|t|ə|n|ə|g|ə|ˈ|m|oʊ|t}} "meeting of wise men"), also known as the '''Witan''' (more properly the title of its members) was a political institution in [[Anglo-Saxon England]] which operated from before the 7th century until the 11th century. The Witenagemot was an assembly of the ruling class whose primary function was to advise the king and whose membership was composed of the most important [[nobility|noblemen]] in England, both [[ecclesiastic]] and [[secular]]. The institution is thought to represent an aristocratic development of the ancient Germanic general assemblies, or [[folkmoot]]s. In England, by the 7th century, these ancient folkmoots had developed into convocations of the land's most powerful and important people, including [[Ealdorman|ealdormen]], [[thegn]]s, and senior clergy, to discuss matters of both national and local significance.

==Terminology==
The terms 'Witan' and 'Witenagemot' are increasingly avoided by modern historians, although few would go as far as Geoffrey Hindley, who described 'witenagemot' as an "essentially Victorian" coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Hindley, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' prefers 'King's Council', but adds that it was known in Old English as the 'witan'.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Yorke in Lapidge et al eds, pp. 125-125&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Maddicott]] regarded the word witan with suspicion, even though it is used in sources such as the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'':
{{quote|But the word carries with it, however unjustifiably, a fustian air of decayed scholarship, and, in addition, its use may seem to prejudge the answer to an important question: do we have here an institution, a capitalized 'Witan', as it were, or merely a lower-case ad hoc gathering of the wise men who were the king's councillors?}}

For these reasons, in his study of the origins of the English parliament, he generally preferred the more neutral word 'assembly'.&lt;ref&gt;Maddicott, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He described 'witena gemot' as a rare eleventh century usage, with only nine pre-Conquest examples, mainly in the crisis of 1051-52.&lt;ref&gt;Maddicott, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Wormald]] was also sceptical, describing 'witena-gemot' as "a word always rare and unattested before 1035".&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''The Making of English Law'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution and limitations==
The exact nature of the witenagemot remains "essentially vague, fluctuating, and incoherent."&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkin, ''History of England'', p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is much direct evidence of the witan's various activities. Knowledge about who made up the witan and who was present at their meetings is provided mainly by lists of witnesses to [[charters]], or grants of land, which were concocted at the witenagemots.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, ''Anglo-Saxon Institutions'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Reference to the witan's ''acta'' or official decisions are also preserved in law codes.

The first recorded act of a witenagemot was the law code issued by King [[Æthelberht of Kent]] ca. A.D. 600, the earliest document which survives in sustained Old English prose; however, the witan was certainly in existence long before this time.&lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, ''The National Assembly'', pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, about 2000 charters and 40 law codes survive which attest to the workings of the various meetings of the witan, of which there are around 300 recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, ''The National Assembly'', pp. 2, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

These documents clearly indicate that the witan was composed of the nation's highest echelon of both ecclesiastical and secular officers. Present on the ecclesiastical side were [[archbishop]]s, [[bishop]]s, and [[abbot]]s, and occasionally also [[abbess]]es and [[priest]]s; on the secular side [[ealdormen]] (or ''[[earl|eorls]]'' in the latter centuries) and [[thegns]]. Members of the royal family were also present, and the king presided over the entire body.

In his investigation into Anglo-Saxon institutions, [[Hector Munro Chadwick|H. M. Chadwick]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I have not thought it necessary to discuss at length the nature of the powers possessed by the council [i.e. the witenagemot], for .. there can be little hope of arriving at any definite conclusions on this subject. Indeed it seems at least doubtful whether the functions of the council were ever properly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, ''Anglo-Saxon Institutions'', p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, in his study of the witenagemots, [[Felix Liebermann]] stated that "its functions and power differ .. considerably at various times."&lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, ''The National Assembly'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he was able to give a relatively detailed description of its constitution:&lt;blockquote&gt;From the time of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] the Witan was composed of the aristocratic ''élite'' created by monarchy. The king, generally indeed advised by the existing nobility, conferred [[prelate|prelatures]] and [[ealdorman]]ries, with both of which a seat in the national assembly [i.e. the witenagemot] was legally or practically connected. Members of the royal family, ladies not excepted, were present at many gemots. The king alone raised a man to the position of a [[gesith]], a [[thegns|thane]], a provincial or local [[Reeve (England)|reeve]], a court officer or a royal [[chaplain]], one of which titles seems to have been the indispensable qualification for a vote. .. as no periodicity of the assembly was fixed, the king determined when and where it was to meet, for the most part choosing places under his immediate control; he presided, spoke first, put his questions, proposed his [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] of proposed laws, and finally dismissed the witan.&lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, ''The National Assembly'', pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The witan was noted by contemporary sources as having the singular power to ''ceosan to cyninge'', 'to choose the king' from amongst the (extended) royal family. Nevertheless, at least until the [[11th century]], royal succession generally followed the "ordinary system of [[primogeniture]]." The historian Chadwick interpreted these facts as proof that the so-called election of the king by the witan merely amounted to formal recognition of the deceased king's natural successor.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, ''Anglo-Saxon Institutions'', pp. 357-58.&lt;/ref&gt; But Liebermann was generally less willing than Chadwick to see the witan's significance as buried under the weight of the royal prerogative:&lt;blockquote&gt;The influence of the king, or at least of kingship, on the constitution of the assembly seems, therefore, to have been immense. But on the other hand he (the king) was elected by the witan .. He could not depose the prelates or ealdormen, who held their office for life, nor indeed the [[hereditary]] thanes. .. At any rate, the king had to get on with the highest statesmen appointed by his predecessor, though possibly disliked by him, until death made a post vacant that he could fill with a relation or a favourite, not, however, without having a certain regard to the wishes of the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, ''The National Assembly'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Liebermann's more subtle position seems to be vindicated by testimony from abbot [[Ælfric of Eynsham]], the leading homilist of the late [[10th century]], who wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;No man can make himself king, but the people has the choice to choose as king whom they please; but after he is [[consecrated]] as king, he then has dominion over the people, and they cannot shake his yoke off their necks.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Whitelock, Review of ''The Witenagemot in the Reign of Edward the Confessor'', p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to having a role in the 'election' of English Kings, it is often held that the witenagemots had the power to [[Deposition (politics)|depose]] an unpopular king. However, there are only two occasions when this probably happened, in 757 and 774 with the depositions of kings [[Sigeberht of Wessex]] and [[Alhred of Northumbria]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, ''Anglo-Saxon Institutions'', pp. 362-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The witan's powers are illustrated by the following event. In the year 1013 [[Æthelred the Unready|King Æthelred II (aka Athelred the Unready)]] fled the country from [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who then had the witan proclaim him king. Within a few weeks, however, Sweyn died and Æthelred was called back to England by the witan. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', the witan would only receive him back under the condition that he promise to rule better than he had.&lt;ref&gt;Garmonsway, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelred did so, and was reinstated as [[King of England]]. His nickname of the 'Unræd' or 'Unready' means ill-advised, indicating that contemporaries regarded those who sat in the witan as in part responsible for the failure of his reign.

Though in general the witan were recognized as the king's closest advisors and policy-makers, various witan also operated in other capacities; there are mentions of ''þeodwitan'', 'people's witan', ''Angolcynnes witan'', 'England's witan', and an [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Archbishop of York]], [[Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York|Wulfstan II]], wrote that "it is incumbent on bishops, that venerable witan always travel with them, and dwell with them, at least of the [[priesthood]]; and that they may consult with them .. and who may be their counsellors at every time." &lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, ''The National Assembly'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Thorpe|title=Ancient Laws and Institutes of England: Comprising Laws Enacted Under the Anglo-Saxon Kings from Æthelbirht to Cnut, with an English Translation of the Saxon; the Laws Called Edward the Confessor's; the Laws of William the Conqueror, and Those Ascribed to Henry the First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-w0tAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA317|year=1840|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when summoned explicitly by kings, the witenagemots did not represent the political will of all England: before the unification of England in the 10th century, separate witenagemots were convened by the Kings of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Mercia]], [[Northumbria]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Wessex]]. Indeed, even after Wessex became the dominant power in England, supplanting the other kingdoms, local witan continued to meet until as late as 1067.&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;  In his work on [[Alfred the Great]], historian David Sturdy argues that the witan did not embody modern notions of a 'national institution' or a 'democratic' body:&lt;blockquote&gt;Victorian notions of a national 'witan' are crazy dreams without foundation, myths of a 'democratic parliament' that never was.&lt;ref&gt;David Sturdy, ''Alfred the Great'', (Constable, 1995) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Function and legacy==

Witan would advise on the administration and organization of the kingdom, dealing with issues such as [[taxation]], [[jurisprudence]] and both internal and external security. The witenagemot was in many ways different from the future institution of the [[Parliament of England]], it had substantially different powers and some major limitations, such as a lack of a fixed procedure, schedule, or meeting place.&lt;ref&gt;''Interpreters of Early Medieval Britain'' {{ISBN|0-197-26277-5}} p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The witan could seek to prevent [[autocracy]] and carry on government during [[interregnum]]s,  but ultimately the witenagemot answered to the king. It only assembled when he summoned it, and its assembling without his approval could be considered [[treason]]. The witenagemot was more an advisory council. In some cases, weak kings (such as [[Ethelred the Unready]]) were dependent on the witenagemot, while others used it as simply a group of advisers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intriguing-history.com/first-anglo-saxon-laws/ ''intriguing-history.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mystic Boundaries: Book One'' {{ISBN|978-1-31247196-2}} p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no set date was ever in use, witenagemots met at least once a year, and commonly more often. There was no single seat of a witenagemot, it being held where the king was, who typically had no single fixed court either. Witenagemots are known to have met in at least 116 locations, including [[Amesbury]], [[Calne]], [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]], [[Gloucester]], [[London]] and [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]]. The meeting places were often on royal estates, but some witenagemots were convened in the open at prominent rocks, hills, meadows and famous trees.&lt;ref&gt;''Toward the Origins of Christmas'' {{ISBN|9-039-00531-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This arrangement ended when the [[Normans]] under [[Duke of Normandy]],  [[William I of England|William the Conqurer]] invaded in 1066, to contest his claim to the throne of England after the death of King [[Edward the Confessor]] and his replacing the witenagemot with the ''[[curia regis]]'', or king's court. However, in a sign of the witenagemot's enduring legacy, the ''curia regis'' continued to be dubbed a "witan" by chroniclers until as late as the [[12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Origins of the Western Legal Tradition: From Thales to the Tudors'' {{ISBN|1-862-87181-7}} p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Revolution===
The "Saxon myth", which claimed that the old Saxon Witan originated in a representative assembly of English landholders, before being subsequently disbanded by the [[Normans|Norman]] invaders before reappearing as the [[Parliament of England]], found believers of that historical theory across the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]], by Americans including [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Jonathan Mayhew]], in the years prior to the [[American Revolution]] (1775-1783).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Middlekauff|first1=Robert|title=The Glorious Cause – The American Revolution, 1763–1789|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978 0-19-516247-9|page=124|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
It is generally accepted that the English witenagemot had its origins in ancient [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] assemblies summoned to witness royal grants of land. Yet whatever their status in the [[4th century|4th]] and [[5th century|5th centuries]], the nature of these assemblies in [[England]] was irrevocably changed when [[Christianity]] was introduced, circa A.D.600. Hereafter, church and state were "inseparably intertwined," and this was reflected in the strong ecclesiastical element in the witan's membership and concerns; records of decisions made by witan encompass ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions alike.&lt;ref&gt;Liebermann, ''The National Assembly'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The [[Wizengamot]], a fictional organisation in the [[Harry Potter]] series of books written by [[J.K. Rowling]], derives its name from the Witenagemot. In the books the Wizengamot is a wizard council and court, of which [[Albus Dumbledore]] is a senior warlock. He is temporarily thrown out when he speaks of [[Voldemort]]'s return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wizengamot|url=https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/ministry/wizengamot.html|website=The Harry Potter Lexicon|date=2004–2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The television series ''[[The Last Kingdom (TV series)|The Last Kingdom]]'' regularly features Witan gatherings in [[9th century]] England.
*The historical television series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' features the Witan.
