'''Aernout van Buchel''' (Latinised: '''Arnoldus Buchelius''') ([[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], 1565 &amp;ndash; Utrecht, 15 July 1641) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[antiquarian]] and [[humanism|humanist]], specialising in [[genealogy]] and [[heraldry]].

==Life==
[[Image:Arnoldus Buchelius (1614).jpg|thumb|200px|Arnoldus Buchellius, 1614 ([[Van de Passe family|Crispin de Passe]])]]
Buchel was the illegitimate child of a [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the [[Pieterskerk, Utrecht|St. Peter's Church]] in Utrecht. He studied in [[University of Leiden|Leiden]] for several months, but in 1585 he continued his studies in France, where he made contacts with other learned men who were interested by Roman ruins, inscriptions and writings. He travelled to [[Rome]], where he wrote an extensive account of the monuments and art that he saw in the city and elsewhere in Italy. These were included in Buchel’s ''Iter Italicum'', which forms a part of his ''Commentarius rerum quotidianarum'' (Diary of daily things), which covers the years 1560 through 1599. Especially interesting within the ''Iter Italicum'' is the selection of drawings that Buchel made, many of which are based on earlier prints.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of Buchel's borrowings, see Jan L. De Jong, 'Aernout van Buchel's Description of Italy, 1587-88', ''Print Quarterly'', Vol. XXXIII, No. 2 (June, 2016): 123-134.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is his drawing of the ''Sarcophagus of Constantia'', which resembles an illustration from Bartolomeo Marliani’s travel guide ''Antiquae Romae topographia'', first published in 1538. Marliani’s illustration is based in turn on an etching and engraving by Ambrosius Brambilla, published by Claudio Duchetti in 1582 in the Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae (Mirror of Roman Magnificence).&lt;ref&gt;De Jong, 'Aernout van Buchel's Description of Italy, 1587-88', 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1588, Buchel returned to Utrecht.

In response to the demolishing of buildings and [[Beeldenstorm|destruction of works of art]] after the [[Protestant Reformation]], van Buchel started writing and drawing threatened inscriptions, tombstones, arms boards and other noteworthy items with the aim of preserving their memory before they were lost to the destruction. The only remaining drawings and description of the lost [[St. Salvator's Church]] in Utrecht were made by van Buchel. He put together a number of manuscripts that, together, form a treasure of immeasurable worth for research into lost buildings and inventories.

Buchel hardly published anything during his life. His book about the bishops of Utrecht, published posthumously, is still seen as a standard work on the subject. During his life he was a respected scholar, and with [[Petrus Scriverius]] one of the first antiquaries of the Netherlands.

==Works==
[[Image:Monumenta Van Buchel.jpg|thumb|right|Page from the ''Monumenta'' by Aernout van Buchel (''source: The Utrecht Archive'')]]
* Perhaps his most lengthy work, his diary, or ''Diarium'' was first published in 1907&lt;ref&gt;''Diarium van Arend van Buchell'', published by Gisbert Brom and Lambregt Abraham van Langeraad as 'Diarium', Historical society of Utrecht, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; The transcription in Latin is "Commentarius rerum quotidianarum, in quo, praeter itinera diversarum regionum, urbium, oppidorumque situs, antiquitates, principes, instituta, mores, multa eorum quae tam inter publicos quam privatos contingere solent, occurrent exempla" 
* The ''Monumenta passim in templis ac monasteriis Trajectinae urbis atque agri inventa'', describes antiquities in the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and some villages in the area, such as [[Kortenhoef]], [[Maarssen]], [[Houten]], [[Maartensdijk]], [[Westbroek]], [[Tienhoven (Maarssen)|Tienhoven]] en [[Breukelen]]. The manuscript is kept in the [[Utrecht Archive]].
* The ''Inscriptiones monumentaque in templis et monasteriis Belgicis inventa'', describes inscriptions in a number of settlements in the [[Utrecht (province)|Sticht Utrecht]], particularly [[Amersfoort]], [[Holland]] (including mainly [[Leiden]], but also [[The Hague]], [[Delft]], [[Amsterdam]], and [[Rotterdam]]), and the [[Duchy of Brabant]] (including mainly [[Antwerpen]], but also [[Leuven]] and [[Brussels]]). The manuscript is kept in the University library in Utrecht.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2583">Rev. '''Albert Augustus Isaacs''' (1828 – 15 November 1903) was a British clergyman, historian and anthropologist, specialising in the history of the Jews and Arabs in the Middle East. Of major note is his biography of the Reverend [[Henry Aaron Stern]] (1820–1885), published in 1886, who for more than forty years was a missionary amongst the Jews. The book contains an account of his labors and travels in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], [[Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], and [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/biographyofrevhe00isaa Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in Berry Hill, Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;''1871 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1901 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; to Isaac and Henrietta Isaacs. He was baptised into the [[Church of England]] in [[Manchester, Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jamaica, Church of England Parish Register Transcripts, 1664-1879''&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], earning his BA in 1851 and MA in 1854, followed by admission ''ad eundem'' to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he taught.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Alumni, 1500-1886''&lt;/ref&gt; He was worked as a priest in [[Peterborough]], 1850-66, and was the vicar of Christ Church, Leicester, 1866-91.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge University Alumni, 1261-1900''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s, Isaacs made an extensive journey to [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Palestine]] and published a book about [[The Dead Sea]] and his notes and observations made during a journey in 1857. In 1863 he published a book entitled, ''A Pictorial Tour in the Holy Land'' in which he illustrates the book with an abundance of photographs taken during another recent visit. In this book he documents nomadic Arab tribes such as the [[Qedarites]] and their way of living.&lt;ref name=Isaacsp111&gt;Isaacs, 1862, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1900 he published a sketchy biography related to the missionary labors of [[Emma Herdman]]. 

He died in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany, in 1903.

The '''Australian Centre for the Moving Image''' (ACMI) is Australia's national museum of film, video games, digital culture and art – situated at  [[Federation Square]], [[Melbourne]]. During the 2015-16 financial year, 1.45 million people visited ACMI,&lt;ref name="SMH-1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rance | first = Carolyn | date = 7 February 2015 | title = Australian Centre for the Moving Image one of the world's most visited art museum | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/government-australian-centre-for-the-moving-image-one-of-the-worlds-most-visited-art-museum-20150203-1334qx.html | accessdate = 28 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the second-highest attendance of any gallery or museum in Australia,&lt;ref name="SMH-1" /&gt; and the most visited moving image museum in the world.

==History==
===Beginnings in the State Film Centre===
ACMI started life as the [[State Film Centre of Victoria]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="ACMIaboutus"&gt;[https://www.acmi.net.au/about-us/about-acmi/ ACMI] ''About Us''. Retrieved 28 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlines"&gt;[http://scanlines.net/group/australian-centre-moving-image Scanlines] ''Australian Centre for the Moving Image''. Retrieved 28 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the State Film Centre was involved in producing a number of projects for television, then a new medium in Australia. It also played a role as an archive of Australian films, such as ''[[The Sentimental Bloke]]'' (1919) and ''[[On Our Selection (1930 film)|On Our Selection]]'' (1920).&lt;ref name="ACMIaboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlines" /&gt;

During the 1960s, the State Film Centre provided advice on film treatments, production, scripts and distribution outlets to local filmmakers. In 1969, the centre assumed management of the newly constructed State Film Theatre, providing a facility for exhibiting material not screened in commercial cinemas.&lt;ref name="ACMIaboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlines" /&gt;

In the 1970s, the centre began acquiring examples of student films as well as those made by the newly vibrant Australian film industry, such as ''[[Homesdale]]'' (1971) by [[Peter Weir]], ''[[Stork (film)|Stork]]'' (1971) and ''[[Alvin Purple]]'' (1973) by [[Tim Burstall]], and ''[[The Devil's Playground (1976 film)|The Devil's Playground]]'' (1976) by [[Fred Schepisi]].&lt;ref name="ACMIaboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlines" /&gt;

In 1988, the State Film Centre Education Program was set up. The program provided screenings for [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] students, based on core texts, and in-service days for their teachers.&lt;ref name="ACMIaboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlines" /&gt;

=== Establishing ACMI at Federation Square ===
In 1993, a Victorian state government report reaffirmed the viability of a proposal for an Australian Centre for the Moving Image. In July 1997, following an open, international and two-stage design competition, [[Lab Architecture Studio]] (based in [[London]] at the time), in association with their joint venture partners, Bates Smart architects, was announced as the winner. [[Federation Square]] was to be a new civic space, built above the [[Jolimont Yard|Jolimont railyards]], to mark the celebration of Australia's Centenary of Federation.&lt;ref name="ACMIaboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlines" /&gt;

On 1 January 2002, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image was officially established by the Film Act 2001 (Victoria). The first stage was opened in October, with two exhibitions, ''Deep Space: Sensation &amp; Immersion'' and ''Ngarinyin Pathways Dulwan'', running in ACMI's Screen Gallery. A few weeks later, ACMI Cinemas officially opened.&lt;ref name="ACMIaboutus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanlines" /&gt;
[[File:Australian Centre for the Moving Image 2017.jpg|thumb|Flinders Street entrance to the Australian Centre for the Moving Image]]

Usually around November or December there is a Red Carpet Awards Gala for the finalists in which they announce winners and the next year's theme.

====Games Lab====
The Games Lab was ACMI's display area for interactive [[video game]]s. It celebrated the past, present and future of games and promoted this popular form of the moving image as a reflection of Australian culture.

In 2003, ACMI commissioned an interactive game-based, site specific installation called AcmiPark, which was exhibited in the Games Lab. AcmiPark replicates and abstracts the real world architecture of Federation Square. It also houses highly innovative mechanisms for interactive, multiplayer sound and musical composition.

The Games Lab exhibited the Best of the [[Independent Games Festival]] for 2005, 2006 and 2007. In early 2007, ''Hits of the 80s'' profiled Melbourne's [[Beam Software]] and the secret history of Australia's place in the rise and rise of the video game. In 2005 an exhibition was dedicated to [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] called Sonic the Hedgehog: Icon of our Times.

The Games Lab has now been incorporated into the ''Screen Worlds'' exhibition space.

==Biography==
Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola was baptized at [[Barbastro]] on August 26, 1562. He studied at [[Huesca]], took orders, and was presented to the rectory of [[Villahermosa]] in 1588. He was attached to the suite of the count de Lemos, viceroy of Naples, in 1610, and succeeded his brother [[Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola|Lupercio]] as historiographer of [[Aragon]] in 1613. He died at Saragossa on February 4, 1631.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Argensola, Lupercio Leonardo de|display=Argensola, Lupercio Leonardo de s.v. Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola|volume=2|page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His principal prose works are the ''Conquista de las Islas Molucas'' (1609), and a supplement to [[Jeronimo Zurita y Castro|Zurita]]'s ''Anales de Aragón'', which was published in 1630. His poems (1634), like those of his elder brother, are admirably finished examples of pungent wit. His commentaries on contemporary events, and his ''Alteraciones populares'', dealing with a Saragossa rising in 1591, are lost.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

An interesting life of this writer by Father Miguel Mir precedes a reprint of the ''Conquista de las Islas Molucas'', issued at Saragossa in 1891.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Mormon studies==
Gardner has published widely on the [[Book of Mormon]] and its [[Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|possible geographical settings]].  He has often written for the ''[[FARMS Review of Books]]''&lt;ref name=farms/&gt; and has presented in the conferences of the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (FAIR) during 2000–4, and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FAIR Conference Speakers | publisher=[[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] | url=http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Conferences/ | accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 he presented on "DNA and the Book of Mormon" to the [[Book of Mormon Archaeological Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Moore, Carrie A. | title=DNA claims rebutted on Book of Mormon | date=October 23, 2007 | work=[[Deseret Morning News]] | location=Salt Lake City, Utah | url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695221057,00.html?pg=1 | accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner is the author of ''Second Witness: Analytical &amp; Contextual Commentary on the Book of Mormon'' ({{ISBN|1589580478}}), published by [[Greg Kofford Books]] in 2007.  This six-volume commentary on the Book of Mormon focuses on its spiritual, theological, cultural, textual, and historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Introduction to "Second Witness" with Brant Gardner | date=September 3, 2008 | work=Life On Gold Plates | url=http://www.lifeongoldplates.com/2008/09/introduction-to-second-witness-with.html | accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For years much of this work was presented online as ''The Multi-dimensional Commentary on the Book of Mormon'', which Gardner further revised for publication and took offline.

The '''Calceus''' (pl. ''calcei'': cf Latin ''calx'' "ankle") was a mid-weight, outdoor walking "shoe-boot", worn in ancient Rome. It was flat-soled, usually hobnailed and entirely covered the foot and ankle, up to the lower shin. It was secured with crossed thongs or laces.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., ''in'' Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa, editors, ''The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics'', The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 105-113&lt;/ref&gt; Lighter than the openwork [[caligae]] favoured by the Roman military, ''calcei'' were considered a distinctive part of Rome's public, civilian "national dress", which centered on the [[toga]] as an exclusive mark of Roman male [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]]. The equivalent for women citizens was the [[stola]], which could be worn with white or coloured ''calcei'' in various decorative styles. The ''calcei'' of most [[Plebs|ordinary citizens]] were probably a natural brown tanned leather. The [[Equites|equestrian class]] had its own distinctive form of ''calceus'', with crescent-shaped buckles. Male citizens of [[Roman Senate|senatorial rank and office]], including certain [[Religion in ancient Rome#Public priesthoods and religious law|priesthoods]], were expected to wear a red-bordered [[toga praetexta]] and red ''calcei'' (s. ''mulleus calceus'') when engaged in their public duties. The combination of toga and ''calcei'' was impressive, but also hot and uncomfortable; the Roman poet [[Martial]] claims that in their leisure time, and more relaxed surroundings of rural life, hardly anyone used it.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith ''et al.'', editors (1890) A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, London: William Wayte. G. E. Marindin [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=calceus-cn entry for ''calceus'']&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the city, some high-ranking citizens wore light, Greek-style sandals, rather than ''calcei'', to "go with the crowd".&lt;ref&gt;Shumba, L., ''in'' Edmondson, J.

The process of coacervation&lt;ref&gt;Bungenberg de Jong, H. G., and H. R. Kruyt (1929). "Coacervation (partial miscibility in colloid systems)". ''Proc Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie Wetenschappen'' '''32''': 849—856&lt;/ref&gt; was famously proposed by [[Alexander Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] as crucial in his early theory of [[abiogenesis]] (origin of life/proiskhozhdenie zhizni). This theory proposes that [[metabolism]] predated information replication, although the discussion as to whether [[metabolism]] or molecules capable of [[template replication]] came first in the origins of life remains open&lt;ref&gt;Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere, Volume 40, Numbers 4-5, October 2010 , pp. 347–497(151)&lt;/ref&gt; and for decades the theory of Oparin and Haldane was the leading approach to the origin of life question.

==History ==
These structures were first investigated by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] chemist [[H.G. Bungenberg de Jong]], in 1932.{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}} A wide variety of solutions can give rise to them; for example, coacervates form spontaneously when a disordered [[polypeptide]], such as [[gelatin]], reacts with another biologically derived [[polyelectrolyte]], such as [[gum arabic]]. They are interesting not only in that they provide a locally segregated environment, but also in that their boundaries allow the selective absorption of simple organic molecules from the surrounding medium. For example, a mix of carbohydrate solution with a protein solution, will favor the spontaneous formation of amoeba-like coacervates which change shape, merge, divide, form "vacuoles", release "vacuole contents", and show other lifelike properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/lessons/coacerv.html Creating Coacervates]. Larry Flammer, Indiana State University.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Aleksandr Oparin|Oparin's]] view this amounts to an elementary form of [[metabolism]]. British scientist [[J. D. Bernal|Bernal]] commented that they are "the nearest we can come to cells without introducing any biological – or, at any rate, any living biological – substance." However, the lack of any mechanism by which coacervates can reproduce leaves them far short of being living systems.&lt;ref name=dick&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Steven J.

==Complex coacervation==
''Complex coacervation'' commonly refers to the liquid-liquid [[multiphasic liquid|phase separation]] that results when [[solution]]s of two oppositely charged macroions are mixed, resulting in the formation of a dense macroion-rich phase, the precursors of which are soluble complexes.&lt;ref name=complexcoacervation&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kizilay| first1=E| title=Complexation and coacervation of polyelectrolytes with oppositely charged colloids.| journal=Adv Colloid Interface Sci.| date=Sep 14, 2011|volume=167| pages=24–37| doi=10.1016/j.cis.2011.06.006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tirrell.ime.uchicago.edu/Research/Coacervates.html Research — Complex Coacervates], Tirrell Research Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781119290971.ch7|title=Advances in Chemical Physics|last=Srivastava|first=Samanvaya|last2=Tirrell|first2=Matthew V.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=499–544|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781119290971.ch7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16405">'''Comparative history''' is the comparison of different societies which existed during the same time period or shared similar cultural conditions.

The comparative history of societies emerged as an important specialty among intellectuals in the Enlightenment in the 18th century, as typified by [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], [[Adam Smith]], and others. Sociologists and economists in the 19th century often explored comparative history, as exemplified by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kalberg, ''Max Weber's Comparative-Historical Sociology'' (University of Arizona Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, a large reading public followed the comparative histories of (German) [[Oswald Spengler]],&lt;ref&gt;Spengler (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian-American) [[Pitirim Sorokin]],&lt;ref&gt;Sorokin (1950); Sorokin (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; and (British) [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee (1934-61)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, however, comparative history has faded from the public view, and is now the domain of specialized scholars working independently.&lt;ref&gt;Barraclough (1979), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the people mentioned above, recent exemplars of comparative history include American historians [[Herbert E. Bolton]] and [[Carroll Quigley]], and British historian [[Geoffrey Barraclough]]. Several sociologists are also prominent in this field, including [[Barrington Moore]],  [[S. N. Eisenstadt]],&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstadt (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], [[Charles Tilly]],&lt;ref&gt;Tilly (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally accept the comparison of particular institutions (banking, women's rights, ethnic identities) in different societies, but since the hostile reaction to Toynbee in the 1950s, generally do not pay much attention to sweeping comparative studies that  cover wide swaths of the world over many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee: A Life'' (1989) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable topics==

===Comparative studies of the Roman and Han empires===
Main article: [[Comparative studies of the Roman and Han empires]]

The ancient Chinese and Roman Empires are often compared due to their synchronous and analogous developments from warring states into universal empires.

===Atlantic history===

[[Atlantic history]] studies the [[Atlantic World]] in the [[early modern period]]. It is premised on the idea that, following the rise of sustained European contact with the New World in the 16th century, the continents that bordered the Atlantic Ocean&amp;mdash;the Americas, Europe, and Africa&amp;mdash;constituted a regional system or common sphere of economic and cultural exchange that can be studied as a totality.

Its theme is the complex interaction between Europe (especially Britain and France) and the [[European colonization of the Americas|New World colonies]]. It encompasses a wide range of demographic, social, economic, political, legal, military, intellectual and religious topics treated in comparative fashion by looking at both sides of the Atlantic. Religious revivals characterized Britain and Germany, as well as the [[First Great Awakening]] in the American colonies. Migration and race/slavery have been important topics.&lt;ref&gt;William O'Reilly, "Genealogies of Atlantic History," ''Atlantic Studies'' 1 (2004): 66–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a relatively new field, it has stimulated numerous studies of comparative history especially regarding ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Palmer, ''Age of Democratic Revolution'' (2 vol 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; colonialism,&lt;ref&gt;Stoler (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; slavery, economic history, and political revolutions in the 18th century in North and South America, Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Klooster, ''Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization models===
Beginning with German and French sociologists of the late 19th century, [[modernization]] models have been developed to show the sequence of transitions from traditional to modern societies, and indeed to postmodern societies. This research flourished especially in the 1960s, with Princeton University setting up seminars that compared the modernization process in China, Japan, Russia and other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Edwin Black, ed. ''The Modernization of Japan and Russia: a comparative study'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Edwin Black, ''The dynamics of modernization: a study in comparative history'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rozman, ''Urban networks in Ching China and Tokugawa Japan'' (1974)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rozman, ''The Modernization of China'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization theory and history have been explicitly used as guides for countries eager to develop rapidly, such as China. Indeed, modernization has been proposed as the most useful framework for [[world history]] in China, because as one of the developing countries that started late, "China's modernization has to be based on the experiences and lessons of other countries."&lt;ref&gt;Qian Chengdan, "Constructing a New Disciplinary Framework of Modern World History Around the Theme of Modernization," ''Chinese Studies in History'' Spring 2009, Vol. 42#3 pp 7-24; in [[EBSCO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative politics===
The field of comparative history often overlaps with the subdivision of [[political science]] known as [[comparative politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle (1986)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meritt and Rokkan (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; This includes "transnational" history &lt;ref&gt;McGerr (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes also international history.&lt;ref&gt;Iriye (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative history of minorities===
Mordechai Zaken compared two non-Muslim minorities in Kurdistan, the Jews and the Assyrian Christians in their relationships with their Muslim rulers and tribal chieftains during the 19th and 20th centuries. His comparative study gave a much clearer picture on the status of the minorities and their relationships with the ruling elites in and around Kurdistan. His PhD dissertation and the book upon which it was based have been widely spread and translated into the local languages in Kurdistan and the surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;Revised and Second Ebook edition and digital format, The Jews of Kurdistan and their Tribal Chieftains: A Study in Survival, Mordechai (Moti) Zaken (Jerusalem, 2015); Jewish Subjects and their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival (Leiden and Boston): Brill, 2007. {{ISBN|978-9004161900}} Yahud Kurdistan wa-ru'as'uhum al-qabaliyun: Dirasa fi fan al-baqa'.

===Military history===
[[Military history|Military historians]] have often compared the organization, tactical and strategic ideas, leadership, and national support of the militaries of different nations.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (Random House, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Davis Hanson, ''The Father of Us All: War and History, Ancient and Modern'' (Bloomsbury Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have emphasized the need to stretch beyond battles and generals to do more comparative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Citino]], "Military Histories Old and New: A Reintroduction," ''American Historical Review'' )2007) 112#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;1070–1090  [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?AHRahr.112.4.1070PDF online version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne E. Lee, ed., ''Warfare and Culture in History'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
The study of slavery in comparative perspective, ranging from the ancient world to the 19th century, has attracted numerous historians since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis, ''The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture''  (1966); Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009); Paul Finkelman, and Joseph Miller, eds. ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery'' (Macmillan, 2 vol 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Much of [[economic history]] in recent years has been done by model-building economists who show occasional interest in comparative data analysis.  Considerable work has been done by historians on the "Great Divergence"  debate launched by Kenneth Pomeranz in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pomeranz, ''The great divergence: China, Europe, and the making of the modern world economy'' (Princeton University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; At issue is why Europe moved forward rapidly after 1700 well Asia did not.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ville, "Divergence and Convergence: New and Shifting Paradigms in Comparative Economic History." ''Australian Economic History Review'' (2015) 55#1 pp: 80-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  More traditional research methodologies have been combined with econometrics, for example in the comparison of merchant guilds in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Grafe, and Oscar Gelderblom, "The Rise and Fall of the Merchant Guilds: Re-thinking the Comparative Study of Commercial Institutions in Premodern Europe," ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History,'' (2010) 40#4 pp: 477-511,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative methods==

Since the work of Sorokin,&lt;ref&gt;Pitirim A. Sorokin, ''Social and Cultural Dynamics'' (4 vol 1932; one-vol. edn., 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; scholars in comparative history, especially if sociologists and political scientists, have often used quantitative and statistical data to compare multiple societies on multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Merritt, and Stein Rokkan, eds. ''Comparing Nations: The Use of Quantitative Data in Cross-National Research'' (Yale UP, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Russett, Harvey Starr, and David Kinsella, ''World Politics: The Menu for Choice'' (2010) p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some efforts made to build mathematical dynamic models, but these have not come into the mainstream comparative history.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Turchin, ''History and Mathematics: Historical Dynamics and Development of Complex Societies'' (Moscow: KomKniga, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==

==="A Cyborg Manifesto"===
{{See also|A Cyborg Manifesto}}

In 1985, Haraway published the essay "Manifesto for [[Cyborg]]s: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the 1980s" in ''[[Socialist Review (US)|Socialist Review]]''. Although most of Haraway's earlier work was focused on emphasizing the masculine bias in scientific culture, she has also contributed greatly to feminist narratives of the twentieth century. For Haraway, the Manifesto offered a response to the rising conservatism during the 1980s in the United States at a critical juncture at which feminists, in order to have any real-world significance, had to acknowledge their situatedness within what she terms the "informatics of domination."&lt;ref name="Cyborg Manifesto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|last=Glazier|first=Jacob W.|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=|isbn=9781118663219|location=|pages=|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss318/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were no longer on the outside along a hierarchy of privileged binaries but rather deeply imbued, exploited by and complicit within networked hegemony, and had to form their politics as such.

According to Haraway's "Manifesto", "there is nothing about being female that naturally binds women together into a unified category. There is not even such a state as '[[being]]' female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices".&lt;ref name="Cyborg Manifesto"/&gt; A cyborg does not require a stable, essentialist identity, argues Haraway, and feminists should consider creating coalitions based on "affinity" instead of identity. To ground her argument, Haraway analyzes the phrase "women of color", suggesting it as one possible example of affinity politics. Using a term coined by theorist Chela Sandoval, Haraway writes that "oppositional consciousness" is comparable with a cyborg politics, because rather than identity it stresses how affinity comes as a result of "otherness, difference, and specificity".&lt;ref name="Cyborg Manifesto"/&gt;

Haraway's cyborg is a set of ideals of a genderless, race-less, more collective and peaceful civilization with the caveat of being utterly connected to the machine. Her new versions of beings reject Western humanist conceptions of personhood and promote a disembodied world of information and the withering of subjectivity. The collective consciousness of the beings and their limitless access to information provide the tools with which to create a world of immense socio-political change through altruism and affinity, not biological unity. In her essay Haraway challenges the liberal human subject and its lack of concern for collective desires which leaves the possibility for wide corruption and inequality in the world. Furthermore, the cyborg's importance lays in its coalition of consciousness not in the physical body that carries the information/consciousness. A world of beings with a type of shared knowledge could create a powerful political force towards positive change. Cyborgs can see "from both perspectives at once."&lt;ref name="Cyborg Manifesto"/&gt; In addition, Haraway writes that the cyborg has an imbued nature towards the collective good.

Haraway explains that her "Manifesto" is "an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism."&lt;ref name="Cyborg Manifesto"/&gt; She adds that "Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves."&lt;ref name="Cyborg Manifesto"/&gt; Haraway is serious about finding future ways towards equality and ending dominating behavior; however, the cyborg itself is not as serious of an endeavor for her as the idea of it is. Haraway creates an analogy using current technologies and information to imagine a world with a collective coalition that had the capabilities to create grand socio-political change. Haraway's "Manifesto" is a thought experiment, defining what people think is most important about being and what the future holds for increased artificial intelligence.

====Cyborg feminism====
In her updated essay "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century", in her book ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991), Haraway uses the cyborg metaphor to explain how fundamental contradictions in feminist theory and identity should be conjoined, rather than resolved, similar to the fusion of machine and organism in cyborgs.&lt;ref name="Cyborg Manifesto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Glossary of Feminist Theory|last=Andermahr|first=Sonya|last2=Lovell|first2=Terry|last3=Wolkowitz|first3=Carol|publisher=Arnold, London|year=1997|isbn=0-340-59662-7|location=Great Britain|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway's "Manifesto" has considerably influenced the fields of feminism, science studies, and critical theory since its original publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|last=Glazier|first=Jacob W.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=2016|isbn=9781118663219|location=|pages=|language=english|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss318/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto is also an important feminist critique of capitalism.{{Citation needed|reason=According to whom?|date=April 2018}}

==="Situated Knowledges"===

''Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective'' sheds light on Haraway's vision for a feminist science.&lt;ref name="Situated"/&gt; The essay originated as a commentary on [[Sandra Harding]]'s ''The Science Question in Feminism'' (1986) and is a reply to Harding's ''"successor science"''. Haraway offers a critique of the feminist intervention into masculinized traditions of scientific rhetoric and the concept of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. The essay identifies the metaphor that gives shape to the traditional feminist critique as a polarization. At one end lies those who would assert that science is a rhetorical practice and, as such, all ''"science is a contestable text and a power field"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Haraway|first= Donna|date=Autumn 1988 |title= Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective |journal= Feminist Studies|volume= 14|issue= 3|pages= 577}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the other are those interested in a feminist version of objectivity, a position Haraway describes as a "feminist empiricism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Haraway|first= Donna|date=Autumn 1988 |title= Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective |journal= Feminist Studies|volume= 14|issue= 3|pages= 580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Primate Visions''===

Haraway also writes about the [[history of science]] and [[biology]]. In ''Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science'' (1990), she focused on the metaphors and narratives that direct the science of [[primatology]]. She asserted that there is a tendency to masculinize the stories about "reproductive competition and sex between aggressive males and receptive females [that] facilitate some and preclude other types of conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;Carubia, Josephine M., "Haraway on the Map", in ''Semiotic Review of Books''. 9:1 (1998), 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt; She contended that female primatologists focus on different observations that require more communication and basic survival activities, offering very different perspectives of the origins of nature and culture than the currently accepted ones. Drawing on examples of Western [[narratives]] and [[ideologies]] of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[social class|class]], Haraway questioned the most fundamental constructions of scientific human nature stories based on primates. In ''Primate Visions'', she wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My hope has been that the always oblique and sometimes perverse focusing would facilitate revisionings of fundamental, persistent western narratives about difference, especially racial and sexual difference; about reproduction, especially in terms of the multiplicities of generators and offspring; and about survival, especially about survival imagined in the boundary conditions of both the origins and ends of history, as told within western traditions of that complex genre".&lt;ref&gt;''Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science'', Routledge: New York and London, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-415-90294-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haraway's aim for science is "to reveal the limits and impossibility of its '[[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]' and to consider some recent revisions offered by feminist primatologists".&lt;ref&gt;Russon, Anne. "Deconstructing Primatology?", in ''Semiotic Review of Books'', 2:2 (1991), 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway presents an alternative perspective to the accepted ideologies that continue to shape the way scientific human nature stories are created.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, Charles, "The Uses of Science Fiction", in ''Science Fiction Studies'', 17:2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
Haraway urges feminists to be more involved in the world of technoscience and to be credited for that involvement. In a 1997 publication, she remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I want feminists to be enrolled more tightly in the meaning-making processes of technoscientific world-building. I also want feminist—activists, cultural producers, scientists, engineers, and scholars (all overlapping categories) — to be recognized for the articulations and enrollment we have been making all along within technoscience, in spite of the ignorance of most "mainstream" scholars in their characterization (or lack of characterizations) of feminism in relation to both technoscientific practice and technoscience studies.&lt;ref&gt;''Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium.FemaleMan©_Meets_OncoMouse™: feminism and technoscience'', New York: Routledge, 1997. {{ISBN|0-415-91245-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==

Haraway's work has been criticized for being "methodologically vague"&lt;ref&gt;Hamner, M. Gail (2003), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=H84HhXD5ySoC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161 The Work of Love: Feminist Politics and the Injunction to Love]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Rieger | editor-first = Jeorg | title = Opting for the Margins: Postmodernity and Liberation in Christian Theology | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 9780198036500}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using noticeably opaque language that is "sometimes concealing in an apparently deliberate way".&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cachel | first = Susan | title = Partisan primatology. Review of ''Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the world of Modern Science'' | journal = [[American Journal of Primatology]] | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 139&amp;ndash;142 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/ajp.1350220207 | date = 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.1350220207 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviewers have argued that her understanding of the scientific method is questionable, and that her explorations of epistemology at times leave her texts virtually meaning-free.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cartmill | first = Matt | title = ''Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the world of Modern Science'' (book review) | journal = [[International Journal of Primatology]] | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF02547559 | date = February 1991 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02547559 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1991 review of Haraway's ''Primate Visions'', published in the ''[[International Journal of Primatology]]'', provides examples of some of the most common critiques of her view of science:&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a book that contradicts itself a hundred times; but that is not a criticism of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This is a book that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.

This is a book that clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; but that is not a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and refreshing to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another review of the same book, appearing in a 1990 issue of the ''[[American Journal of Primatology]]'', offers a similar criticism of Haraway's literary style and scholarly methods:&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many places where an editorial hand appears absent altogether. Neologisms are continually coined, and sentences are paragraph-long and convoluted. Biography, history, propaganda, science, science fiction, and cinema are intertwined in the most confusing way. Perhaps the idea is to induce a slightly dissociated state, so that readers can be lulled into belief. If one did not already possess some background, this book would give no lucid history of anthropology or primatology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, a review in the ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]'' disagrees:&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Fausto-Sterling  | title = Essay review: ''Primate Visions'', a model for historians of science? | journal = [[Journal of the History of Biology]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 329&amp;ndash;333 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00141475 | date = June 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00141475 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Primate Visions'' is one of the most important books to come along in the last twenty years. Historians of science have begun to write more externalist histories, acknowledging the possibilities of a science profoundly integrated with ongoing social agenda. Haraway's history of primatology in the twentieth century sets new standards for this approach, standards that will not be surpassed for some time to come. The book is important to students of science, feminists, historians, and anyone else interested in how the complex systems of race, gender, and science intertwine to produce supposedly objective versions of the "truth." This analysis of primatology is at once a complex, interdisciplinary, and deeply scholarly history and an imaginative, provocative analysis of the working of science in late twentieth-century Euro-America.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Faisal Devji''' is a historian who specializes in studies of [[Islam]], [[globalization]], [[violence]] and [[ethics]].

==Early life and education==
Devji was born in [[Dar es Salaam]] in 1964 to a family of [[India]]n ethnicity. His undergraduate education was at the [[University of British Columbia]], where he received double honors in history and anthropology. He received his PhD from the [[University of Chicago]] with his dissertation ''Muslim Nationalism: Founding Identity in Colonial India'' and was chosen to be a Junior Fellow at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].

Devji is [[Zanzibari]], and is now a [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizen. Devji speaks [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Urdu]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Career==
Devji's multidisciplinary work grounds empirical historical issues in philosophical questions. He has taught at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ideas interview: Faisal Devji|publisher=The Guardian|date=May 9, 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/17/alqaida.academicexperts}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught at [[Yale University]] and also served as Head of Graduate Studies at [[The Institute of Ismaili Studies]] in London.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2005, [[Cornell University Press]] published his ''Landscapes of the Jihad: Militancy, Morality, Modernity'', exploring the ethical content of jihad as opposed to its more widely studied purported political content. The book draws a distinction between the majority of [[Islamic fundamentalist]] organizations concerned with the establishing of states and [[al-Qaeda]] with its decentralized structure and emphasis on moral rather than political action. His next book was ''The Terrorist in Search of Humanity: Militant Islam and Global Politics'', published by [[Columbia University Press]] in October 2008.

Since 2009, Devji is University Reader in Modern South Asian History, Oxford University. He also is a senior fellow at the Institute for Public Knowledge (New York University)&lt;ref name="ox.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/people/devji.html|title=People - St Antony's College|website=www.sant.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yves Oltramar Chair at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva.&lt;ref name="ox.ac.uk"/&gt;

He published ''The Impossible Indian: Gandhi and the Temptations of Violence'', by Hurst &amp; Co. in March 2011.

'''George Hancock''', at the time a reporter for [[Chicago Board of Trade]], invented the game of [[softball]] in 1887. The first game was played indoors, inside the Farragut Boat Club in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;The Farragut Boat Club is mentioned in a news item that appeared later.

George Hancock shouted, "Let's play ball", and tied the boxing glove into the shape of a ball. The men chalked a diamond shape onto the floor and broke a broom handle to serve as a bat. This is credited as the first softball game which was played on [[Thanksgiving Day]] November 24, 1887 after a [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|Harvard-Yale football game]] that had been followed by [[telegraph]].&lt;ref name="performance_history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softballperformance.com/softball-history/

Hancock's original game of indoor baseball quickly caught on in popularity, becoming international with the formation of a league in [[Toronto]]. That year, 1887, was also the premiere publication of the ''Indoor Baseball Guide''. This was the first nationally distributed publication on the new game and it lasted a decade. In the spring of 1888, Hancock's game moved outdoors.&lt;ref name="plummer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/sd/slopitch/history.html|title=Slow Pitch Softball History Definition Page|last=Plummer III|first=Bill|year=1998|accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was played on a small [[Softball diamond|diamond]] and called indoor-outdoor.

'''Gertrude Stein''' (February 3, 1874 – July 27, 1946) was an American novelist, poet, playwright, and art collector. Born in the [[Allegheny West (Pittsburgh)|Allegheny West]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], and raised in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], Stein moved to [[Paris]] in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]], where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[Henri Matisse]], would meet.&lt;ref name="brbl-archive.library.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Extravagant Crowd: Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas |access-date=October 16, 2012 |url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/cvvpw/gallery/steintoklas1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'', written in the voice of [[Alice B. Toklas]], her [[life partner]] and an American-born member of the [[avant-garde|Parisian avant-garde]]. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Stein Salon Was The First Museum of Modern Art |access-date=October 13, 2012 |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-salon.html |last=Mellow |first=James R. |work=New York Times |date=May 3, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two quotes from her works have become widely known: "[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw Cf. Natias Neutert about Gertrude Stein's Rose]&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[there is no there there]]", with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of [[Oakland, California]].

Her books include ''Q.E.D.'' (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein's friends, ''Fernhurst'', a fictional story about a [[love triangle]], ''[[Three Lives]]'' (1905–06), and ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' (1902–1911). In ''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'' (1914), Stein commented on lesbian sexuality.&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

Her activities during [[World War II]] have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in [[Nazi]]-occupied France, Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of the powerful [[Vichy government]] official and Nazi collaborator [[Bernard Faÿ]]. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader [[Marshal Pétain]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some have argued that certain accounts of Stein's wartime activities have amounted to a "witch hunt".&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7643746"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/why-the-witch-hunt-against-gertrude-stein |title=Why the Witch-Hunt Against Gertrude Stein? |work=tikkun.org |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |first1=Renate |last1=Stendhal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424220426/http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/why-the-witch-hunt-against-gertrude-stein |archivedate=April 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gertrude Stein age 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gertrude Stein, age 3]]

When Stein was three years old, she and her family moved to [[Vienna]], and then Paris. Accompanied by governesses and tutors, the Steins endeavored to imbue their children with the cultured sensibilities of European history and life.&lt;ref name="Crimson" /&gt; After a year-long sojourn abroad, they returned to America in 1878, settling in [[Oakland, California]], where her father became director of [[San Francisco]]'s street car lines, the [[Market Street Railway (1893–1944)|Market Street Railway]], in an era when public transportation was a privately owned enterprise.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/an-eye-for-genius-the-collections-of-gertrude-and-leo-stein-6210565/ |work=Smithsonian Magazine |last=Lubow |first=Arthur |title=An Eye for Genius: The Collections of Gertrude and Leo Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein attended [[Temple Sinai (Oakland, California)|First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland]]'s Sabbath school.&lt;ref name=Rosenbaum21&gt;[[#Rosenbaum|Rosenbaum (1987)]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; During their residence in Oakland, they lived for four years on a ten-acre lot, and Stein built many memories of California there. She would often go on excursions with her brother, Leo, with whom she developed a close relationship. Stein found formal schooling in Oakland unstimulating, but she read often: [[Shakespeare]], [[Wordsworth]], [[Walter Scott|Scott]], [[Robert Burns|Burns]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], and more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When Stein was 14 years old, her mother died. Three years later, her father died as well. Stein's eldest brother, Michael Stein, then took over the family business holdings and in 1892 arranged for Gertrude and another sister, Bertha, to live with their mother's family in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;25–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Here she lived with her uncle [[David Bachrach]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=895}} |date=2008-11-21| title = David Bachrach House, Baltimore City|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1877 had married Gertrude's maternal aunt, Fanny Keyser.

In Baltimore, Stein met [[Claribel Cone|Claribel]] and [[Etta Cone]], who held Saturday evening [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] that she would later emulate in Paris. The Cones shared an appreciation for art and conversation about it and modeled a domestic division of labor that Stein would replicate in her relationship with [[Alice B. Toklas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Radcliffe===
Stein attended [[Radcliffe College]],&lt;ref name=Crimson&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1959/2/18/gertrude-stein-at-radcliffe-most-brilliant/ |title=Gertrude Stein at Radcliffe: Most Brilliant Women Student |work=The Harvard Crimson |language=en |access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; then an annex of [[Harvard University]], from 1893 to 1897 and was a student of psychologist [[William James]]. With James's supervision, Stein and another student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on ''normal motor automatism'', a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking.

These experiments yielded examples of writing that appeared to represent "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]", a psychological theory often attributed to James and the style of modernist authors [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[James Joyce]]. In 1934, behavioral psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] interpreted Stein's difficult poem ''Tender Buttons'' as an example of ''normal motor automatism''.&lt;ref&gt;"Has Gertrude Stein a Secret?" ''Cumulative Record'', 3rd ed. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1972, 359–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter Stein wrote during the 1930s, she explained that she never accepted the theory of [[automatic writing]]: "[T]here can be automatic movements, but not automatic writing. Writing for the normal person is too complicated an activity to be indulged in automatically."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meyer|Meyer (2001)]]&lt;/ref&gt; She did publish an article in a psychological journal on "spontaneous automatic writing" while at Radcliffe, but "the unconscious and the intuition (even when James himself wrote about them) never concerned her."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At Radcliffe, she began a lifelong friendship with Mabel Foote Weeks, whose correspondence traces much of the progression of Stein's life. In 1897, Stein spent the summer in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], studying embryology at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=hopkins&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hmn/S02/annals.html | title = Hopkins Medical News | contribution = The Unknown Gertrude}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) [[magna cum laude]] from Radcliffe in 1898.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Johns Hopkins School of Medicine===
William James, who had become a committed mentor to Stein at Radcliffe, recognizing her intellectual potential, and declaring her his "most brilliant woman student", encouraged Stein to enroll in medical school. Although Stein professed no interest in either the theory or practice of medicine, she enrolled at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in 1897.  In her fourth year, Stein failed an important course, lost interest, and left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ultimately, medical school had bored her, and she had spent many of her evenings not applying herself to her studies, but taking long walks and attending the opera.&lt;ref name="Crimson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/gertrude-stein |title=Gertrude Stein 1874–1846 |access-date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein's tenure at Johns Hopkins was marked by challenge and stress. Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in ''[[Things As They Are]]'', 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as "Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Stein-gertrude |encyclopedia=Jewish Women Encyclopedia |last=Simon |first=Linda |title=Gertrude Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |magazine=Style Magazine |last=Rudacille |first=Deborah |title=Baltimore Blues |access-date=October 17, 2012 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528023126/http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |archive-date=May 28, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's "controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Asked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled "The Value of College Education for Women", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:

{{quote|"average middle class woman [supported by] some male relative, a husband or father or brother,...[is] not worth her keep economically considered. [This economic dependence caused her to become] oversexed...adapting herself to the abnormal sex desire of the male...and becoming a creature that should have been first a human being and then a woman into one that is a woman first and always."|source=&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

While a student at Johns Hopkins and purportedly still naïve about sexual matters, Stein experienced an awakening of her latent sexuality. Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with [[Mary Bookstaver]] who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her "erotic awakening". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1902 Stein's brother [[Leo Stein]] left for [[London]], and Stein followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation"/&gt;

==Art collection==
[[File:Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpg|thumb|left|Gertrude and Leo Stein bought [[Henri Matisse]]'s, ''[[Woman with a Hat]]'', 1905, a portrait of the artist's wife, Amelia, now in the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]]]

[[File:Leo, Gertrude, Michael Stein.jpg|thumb|Leo, Gertrude, and Michael Stein]]
From 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the [[Luxembourg Garden]] on the [[Left Bank]] of Paris in a two-story apartment (with adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at [[27 rue de Fleurus]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.

The gallery space was furnished with imposing [[Renaissance]]-era furniture manufactured in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The paintings lined the walls in tiers trailing many feet to the ceiling. Initially illuminated by gaslight, the artwork was later lit by electric light shortly prior to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Leo Stein cultivated important art world connections, enabling the Stein holdings to grow over time. The art historian and collector [[Bernard Berenson]] hosted Gertrude and Leo in his English country house in 1902, facilitating their introduction to [[Paul Cézanne]] and the dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 43–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Vollard was heavily involved in the Cézanne art market, and he was the first important contact in the Paris art world for both Leo and Gertrude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The joint collection of Gertrude and Leo Stein began in late 1904 when Michael Stein announced that their trust account had accumulated a balance of 8,000 francs.

The art collection increased and the walls at Rue de Fleurus were rearranged continually to make way for new acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.132.81.65/PATREQIMGX01/size3/D1201/1063829.jpg Gertrude seated near sculpture and Cézanne's ''Bathers'' (1903–04)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080805084330/http://130.132.81.65/PATREQIMGX01/size3/D1201/1063829.jpg |date=2008-08-05 }}: The [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] catalog dates photo at 1905 ([[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 53) and places ''Bathers'' (1895) in the [http://artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html Cone Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222011339/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |date=2007-12-22 }}, [[Baltimore]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "the first half of 1905" the Steins acquired [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''Portrait of Mme Cézanne'' and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s ''Perseus and Andromeda''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 26. The Delacroix painting is now in the Cone Collection, Baltimore. (Dorothy Kosinski et al., Matisse: Painter as Sculptor, p. 38 (Yale Univ. Press 2007))&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the opening of the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 (on October 18, 1905), the Steins acquired Matisse's ''Woman with a Hat''&lt;ref&gt;This painting is now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/ref&gt; and Picasso's ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers''.&lt;ref&gt;Color plates of ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers'', or ''Jeune fille aux fleurs'', appear in Hobhouse, 1975, at 68 and Burns, 1970, at 8. The painting is in a private collection, but was displayed in a 2003 Matisse/Picasso exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry McBride (art critic)|Henry McBride]] (art critic for the ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]]'') did much for Stein's reputation in the United States, publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure. Of the art collection at 27 Rue de Fleurus, McBride commented: "[I]n proportion to its size and quality... [it is] just about the most potent of any that I have ever heard of in history."&lt;ref name="Mellow_193"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt; McBride also made the observation that Gertrude "collected geniuses rather than masterpieces. She recognized them a long way off."&lt;ref name="Mellow_193"/&gt;

By early 1906, Leo and Gertrude Stein's studio had many paintings by [[Henri Manguin]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art, 1970, pp. 88–89 provides detailed black-and-white images of the paintings on the wall.&lt;/ref&gt; Their collection was representative of two famous art exhibitions that took place during their residence together in Paris, and to which they contributed, either by lending their art, or by patronizing the featured artists.&lt;ref&gt;The first, the Paris Autumn Salon of 1905, introduced [[Fauvism]] to the Paris art public, to some shock and political cartooning. The second, the [[Armory Show]] of 1913, in New York City, introduced Modern Art to the United States art public, accompanied by similar public disparagement.&lt;/ref&gt; The Steins' elder brother, Michael, and sister-in-law Sarah (Sally) acquired a large number of [[Henri Matisse]] paintings; Gertrude's friends from Baltimore, [[Claribel Cone|Claribel]] and [[Etta Cone]], collected similarly, eventually donating their art collection, virtually intact, to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |title=Cone Collection |publisher=Baltimore Museum of Art |date=1903-06-26 |accessdate=2011-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019145733/http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html |archivedate=2014-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at 27 Rue de Fleurus. Where [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude's collection, the collection of Michael and [[Sarah Stein]] emphasized [[Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1914 Leo relocated to [[Settignano|Settignano, Italy, near Florence]], and the art collection was divided. The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:

{{quote |The Cézanne apples have a unique importance to me that nothing can replace. The Picasso landscape is not important in any such sense. We are, as it seems to me on the whole, both so well off now that we needn't repine. The Cézannes had to be divided. I am willing to leave you the Picasso oeuvre, as you left me the Renoir, and you can have everything except that. I want to keep the few drawings that I have. This leaves no string for me, it is financially equable either way for estimates are only rough &amp; ready methods, &amp; I'm afraid you'll have to look upon the loss of the apples as an act of God. I have been anxious above all things that each should have in reason all that he wanted, and just as I was glad that Renoir was sufficiently indifferent to you so that you were ready to give them up, so I am glad that Pablo is sufficiently indifferent to me that I am willing to let you have all you want of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 207–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An image of "the Cézanne apples" appears in [[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], plate 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leo departed with sixteen Renoirs, and relinquishing the Picassos and most of Matisse to his sister, took only a portrait sketch Picasso had done of him. He remained dedicated to Cézanne, nonetheless, leaving all the artist's works with his sister, taking with him only a Cézanne painting of "5 apples".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The split between brother and sister was acrimonious. Stein did not see Leo Stein again until after [[World War I]], and then through only a brief greeting on the street in Paris. After this accidental encounter, they never saw or spoke to each other again.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The Steins' holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-family.html ''The Family Knew What It Liked'']. ''The New York Times'', 3 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
After Stein's and Leo's households separated in 1914, she continued to collect examples of Picasso's art, which had turned to [[Cubism]], a style Leo did not appreciate. At her death, Gertrude's remaining collection emphasized the artwork of Picasso and [[Juan Gris]], most of her other pictures having been sold.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude Stein's personality has dominated the provenance of the Stein art legacy. It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], said that between the years of 1905 and 1907, "[Leo] was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of 20th century painting in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and Her Family |author=Linda Wagner-Martin |page=67 |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1995 |asin=B002MRKVDU |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2uyupUrgNkC&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the artworks were divided between the two Stein siblings, it was Gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the 1930s. She concentrated on the work of [[Juan Gris]], [[André Masson]], and Sir [[Francis Cyril Rose|Francis Rose]]. In 1932, Stein asserted: "painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter [[Francisco Riba Rovira]] (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what Cézanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that Cézanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.

The only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which Cézanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Stein. "A la recherche d'un jeune peintre", revue ''Fontaine'' no. 42, pp. 287–288, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Stein.

==27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon==
[[File:Plaque Gertrude Stein, 27 rue de Fleurus, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|Plaque at 27 rue de Fleurus]]
The gatherings in the Stein home "brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art". Dedicated attendees included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Gavin Williamson (harpsichordist)|Gavin Williamson]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Francis Cyril Rose]], [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], [[René Crevel]], [[Élisabeth de Gramont]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Claribel Cone]], [[Mildred Aldrich]], [[Jane Peterson]], [[Carl Van Vechten]] and [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref name="brbl-archive.library.yale.edu"/&gt; Saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so Stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors. It was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room.

Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of Cézanne: "Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]] (artist), [[André Derain]] (artist), [[Max Jacob]] (poet), [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (poet), [[Marie Laurencin]] (artist, and Apollinaire's mistress), [[Henri Rousseau]] (painter), and [[Joseph Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway "yellow" in ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child.&lt;ref name="Meyers1"&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey - ''Hemingway: A Biography'', Macmillan, New York, 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-333-42126-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stein has been credited with inventing the term "[[Lost Generation]]" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 273–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer [[Paul Bowles]] to go to [[Tangier]], where she and Alice had vacationed.

==Literary style==
[[File:Gertrude stein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Van Vechten]], ''Portrait of Gertrude Stein'', 1934]]
Stein's writing can be placed in three categories: "hermetic" works best illustrated by ''[[The Making of Americans]]: The Hersland Family''; popularized writing such as ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which ''[[Brewsie and Willie]]'' is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, [[libretti]] and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: "[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]"; "Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle"; about her childhood home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], "There is no there there"; and "The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable."

These [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] experiments, rhythmical essays or "portraits", were designed to evoke "the excitingness of pure being" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as [[Cubism]], plasticity, and [[collage]]. Many of the experimental works such as ''Tender Buttons'' have since been interpreted by critics as a [[feminist]] reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on "[[automatic writing]]" with [[William James]], she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Though Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of [[Cézanne]]. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: "the whole field of the canvas is important" (p.&amp;nbsp;8{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, "Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other." It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: "The important thing is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality."

Her use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the "bottom nature" of her characters, such as in ''The Making of Americans'' where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as "As I was saying" and "There will be now a history of her." Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with "too much association". Social judgement is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Stein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous present in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes "play" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: "rather than the [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses ''play''."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly Grahn argues that one must "''inster''stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of ''The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook'', which was written by Toklas.

Several of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including [[Virgil Thomson]]'s operas ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' and ''The Mother of Us All'', and [[James Tenney]]'s setting of ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose'' as a [[canon (music)|canon]] dedicated to [[Philip Corner]], beginning with "a" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. "a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose."

==Literary career==
[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Portrait of Gertrude Stein]]'', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. When someone commented that Stein didn't look like her portrait, Picasso replied, "She will".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/modern_art/gertrude_stein/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=210008443&amp;collID=21&amp;vw=0 | title = Portrait of Gertrude Stein | publisher = Metropolitan Museum | accessdate = November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein wrote "[[If I Told Him: A Completed Portrait of Picasso]]" in response to the painting. ]]
[[File:Félix Valloton, Portrait of Gertrude Stein, 1907.jpg|thumb|[[Félix Vallotton]], ''Portrait of Gertrude Stein'', 1907]]
While living in Paris, Stein began submitting her writing for publication. Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was ''[[Three Lives]]''. In 1911, [[Mildred Aldrich]] introduced Stein to [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.

Mabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication ''The Makings of Americans'' and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of ''Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia''.&lt;ref name="MoMA"/&gt; Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Regiment]] [[Armory Show]] in 1913, "the first avant-garde art exhibition in America".&lt;ref name="MoMA"/&gt;

In addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in "Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose", published in a special March 1913 publication of ''Arts and Decoration''.&lt;ref name="Mellow_170"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in "Speculations":

{{quote |In Gertrude Stein's writing every word lives and, apart from concept, it is so exquisitely rhythmical and cadenced that if we read it aloud and receive it as pure sound, it is like a kind of sensuous music. Just as one may stop, for once, in a way, before a canvas of Picasso, and, letting one's reason sleep for an instant, may exclaim: "It ''is'' a fine pattern!" so, listening to Gertrude Stein's words and forgetting to try to understand what they mean, one submits to their gradual charm.&lt;ref name="Mellow_170"/&gt;}}

Stein and [[Carl Van Vechten]], the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was "Papa Woojums", and Stein, "Baby Woojums". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.&lt;ref name="brbl-archive.library.yale.edu"/&gt;

===America (1934–1935)===
In October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in [[Times Square]] announced to all that "Gertrude Stein Has Arrived".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-gertrude-stein-toured-america-105320781/ |title=When Gertrude Stein Toured America |date=October 14, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

Stein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that "Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures." Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a [[speech disorder]], [[palilalia]], which caused her "to stutter over words and phrases". The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who had the ability to hold listeners with the "musicality of her language".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

In Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President's wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In [[Beverly Hills]], California, she visited actor and filmmaker [[Charlie Chaplin]] who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from [[Random House]], who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaillant|Jaillant (2015)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' wrote after Stein's return to Paris: "No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

===Books===

====''Q.E.D''.====
Stein completed ''Q.E.D.'', her first novel, on October 24, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 53–58.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest [[coming out]] stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baughman|first1=Judith|title=Gertrude Stein|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=true&amp;displayGroupName=Biographies&amp;currPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;mode=view&amp;catId=&amp;u=loym48904&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;displayGroups=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1602000898&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;activityType=&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=true|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and [[Mary Bookstaver]], and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref name="Blackmer 1995 pp. 681"&gt;[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]], pp. 681–6.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This story is discussed more completely later in this article in the section on "Lesbian relationships". --&gt;

====''Fernhurst'' (1904)====
In 1904 Stein began ''Fernhurst'', a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean ([[M. Carey Thomas]]), a faculty member from [[Bryn Mawr College]] (Mary Gwinn) and a Harvard graduate (Alfred Hodder).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 65–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Mellow asserts that ''Fernhurst'' "is a decidedly minor and awkward piece of writing".&lt;ref name="Mellow_67"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], 67.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes some commentary that Gertrude mentioned in her autobiography when she discussed the "fateful twenty-ninth year"&lt;ref name = "Mellow_67"/&gt; during which:

{{quote |All the forces that have been engaged through the years of childhood, adolescence and youth in confused and ferocious combat range themselves in ordered ranks (and during which) the straight and narrow gateway of maturity, and life which was all uproar and confusion narrows down to form and purpose, and we exchange a great dim possibility for a small hard reality.

Also in our American life where there is no coercion in custom and it is our right to change our vocation so often as we have desire and opportunity, it is a common experience that our youth extends through the whole first twenty-nine years of our life and it is not till we reach thirty that we find at last that vocation for which we feel ourselves fit and to which we willingly devote continued labor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 67–8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mellow observes that, in 1904, 30-year-old Gertrude "had evidently determined that the 'small hard reality' of her life would be writing".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Three Lives'' (1905–1906)====
Stein attributed the inception of ''[[Three Lives]]'' to the inspiration she received from a portrait [[Cézanne]] had painted of his wife and which was in the Stein collection. She credited this as a [[Revelation|revelatory moment]] in the evolution of her writing style. Stein described:

{{cquote| that the stylistic method of ''(Three Lives)'' had been influenced by the Cézanne portrait under which she sat writing. The portrait of Madame Cézanne is one of the monumental examples of the artist's method, each exacting, carefully negotiated plane—from the suave reds of the armchair and the gray blues of the sitter's jacket to the vaguely figured wallpaper of the background—having been structured into existence, seeming to fix the subject for all eternity. So it was with Gertrude's repetitive sentences, each one building up, phrase by phrase, the substance of her characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She began ''Three Lives'' during the spring of 1905 and finished it the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Making of Americans'' (1902–1911)====
Gertrude Stein stated the date for her writing of ''[[The Making of Americans]]'' was 1906–8. Her biographer has uncovered evidence that it actually began in 1902 and did not end until 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 114–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Stein compared her work to [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and to [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. Her critics were less enthusiastic about it.&lt;ref name="Mellow 1974, p. 122"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stein wrote the bulk of the novel between 1903 and 1911, and evidence from her manuscripts suggests three major periods of revision during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, George B. ''Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans: Repetition and the Emergence of Modernism''. Washington, D.C.: Peter Lang, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript remained mostly hidden from public view until 1924 when, at the urging of [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Ford Madox Ford]] agreed to publish excerpts in the ''[[transatlantic review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rainey, Lawrence. Book Review of ''The Making of Americans''. ''Modernism/Modernity'' 4.2 (1997): 222–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, the Paris-based Contact Press published a limited run of the novel consisting of 500 copies. A much-abridged edition was published by [[Harcourt Brace]] in 1934, but the full version remained out of print until [[Something Else Press]] republished it in 1966. In 1995, a new, definitive edition was published by [[Dalkey Archive Press]] with a foreword by [[William Gass]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Gertrude. ''The Making of Americans''. Normal, Illinois: Dalkey Archive Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude's ''Matisse'' and ''Picasso'' descriptive essays appeared in [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s August, 1912 edition of ''[[Camera Work]]'', a special edition devoted to Picasso and Matisse, and represented her very first publication.&lt;ref name="Kellner_266"&gt;[[#Kellner|Kellner (1988)]], p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this publication, Gertrude said, "[h]e was the first one that ever printed anything that I had done. And you can imagine what that meant to me or to any one."&lt;ref name="Kellner_266"/&gt;

====Word Portraits (1908–1913)====
Stein's descriptive essays apparently began with her essay of Alice B. Toklas, "a little prose vignette, a kind of happy inspiration that had detached itself from the torrential prose of ''[[The Making of Americans]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Stein's early efforts at word portraits are catalogued in {{harvtxt | Mellow | 1974 | pp = 129–37}} and under individual's names in Kellner, 1988. Matisse and Picasso were subjects of early essays,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 154–5, 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; later collected and published in ''Geography and Plays''{{Sfn | Stein | 1922}} and ''Portraits and Prayers''.{{Sfn | Stein | 1934}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kellner|Kellner (1988)]], pp. 34–5, 56–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Matisse and Picasso portraits were reprinted in [[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her subjects included several ultimately famous personages, and her subjects provided a description of what she observed in her Saturday salons at 27 Rue de Fleurus: "Ada" ([[Alice B. Toklas]]), "Two Women" (The [[Cone sisters]], [[Claribel Cone]] and [[Etta Cone]]), ''Miss Furr and Miss Skeene'' ([[Ethel Mars (artist)|Ethel Mars]] and [[Maud Hunt Squire]]), "Men" ([[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[Peter David Edstrom]], [[Maurice Sterne]]), "Matisse" (1909, [[Henri Matisse]]), "Picasso" (1909, [[Pablo Picasso]]), "Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia" (1911, [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]]), and "[[Guillaume Apollinaire]]" (1913).

====''Tender Buttons'' (1912)====
''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'' is the best known of Stein's "hermetic" works. It is a small book separated into three sections—"Food, Objects and Rooms", each containing prose under subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kellner|Kellner (1988)]], pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Its publication in 1914 caused a great dispute between [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and Stein, because Mabel had been working to have it published by another publisher.&lt;ref name="Mellow_178"&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Mabel wrote at length about what she viewed as the bad choice of publishing it with the press Gertrude selected.&lt;ref name="Mellow_178"/&gt; Evans wrote Gertrude:

{{quote |Claire Marie Press... is absolutely third rate, &amp; in bad odor here, being called for the most part 'decadent" and Broadwayish and that sort of thing... I think it would be a pity to publish with [Claire Marie Press] ''if'' it will emphasize the idea in the opinion of the public, that there is something degenerate &amp; effete &amp; decadent about the whole of the cubist movement which they ''all'' connect you with, because, hang it all, as long as they don't understand a thing they think all sorts of things. My feeling in this is quite strong.&lt;ref name="Mellow_178"/&gt;}}

Stein ignored Mabel's exhortations, and eventually Mabel, and published 1,000 copies of the book, in 1914. An antiquarian copy was valued at over $1,200 in 2007. It is currently in print, and was re-released as ''Tender Buttons: The Corrected Centennial Edition'' by [[City Lights Publishers]] in March 2014.

In an interview with [[:de:Robert Bartlett Haas|Robert Bartlett Haas]] in "A Transatlantic Interview - 1946", Stein insisted that this work was completely "realistic" in the tradition of [[Gustave Flaubert]], stating the following: "I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen." Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the ''reference'' of objects remained central to her work, although the ''representation'' of them had not.&lt;ref name="Perloff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19342|title=The Difference is Spreading: on Gertrude Stein|last=Perloff|first=Marjorie|year=2000|accessdate=30 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011190719/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19342|archive-date=11 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Marjorie Perloff]] had said of Stein that "[u]nlike her contemporaries ([[T.S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Ezra Pound|Pound]], [[Marianne Moore|Moore]]), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know."&lt;ref name="Perloff" /&gt;

==Alice B. Toklas==
Stein met her [[life partner]] [[Alice B. Toklas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Linzie | first = Anna | title = The True Story of Alice B. Toklas: A Study of Three Autobiographies | publisher = University of Iowa Press  | year = 2006 | pages = 1, 67, 146 | isbn = 978-0-87745-985-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; on September 8, 1907, on Toklas's first day in Paris, at Sarah and Michael Stein's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; On meeting Stein, Toklas wrote:

{{quote |She was a golden brown presence, burned by the Tuscan sun and with a golden glint in her warm brown hair. She was dressed in a warm brown corduroy suit. She wore a large round coral brooch and when she talked, very little, or laughed, a good deal, I thought her voice came from this brooch. It was unlike anyone else's voice—deep, full, velvety, like a great contralto's, like two voices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/toklas.htm |title=Alice B Toklas |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914184957/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/toklas.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soon thereafter, Stein introduced Toklas to [[Pablo Picasso]] at his studio, where he was at work on ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''.

In 1908, they summered in [[Fiesole]], Italy, Toklas staying with [[Harriet Lane Levy]], the companion of her trip from the United States, and her housemate until Alice moved in with Stein and Leo in 1910. That summer, Stein stayed with Michael and Sarah Stein, their son Allan, and Leo in a nearby villa. Gertrude and Alice's summer of 1908 is memorialized in images of the two of them in Venice, at the piazza in front of Saint Mark's.&lt;ref name="Mellow 1974, p. 122"/&gt;

Toklas arrived in 1907 with Harriet Levy, with Toklas maintaining living arrangements with Levy until she moved to 27 Rue de Fleurus in 1910. In an essay written at the time, Stein humorously discussed the complex efforts, involving much letter writing and Victorian niceties, to extricate Levy from Toklas's living arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 149–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Harriet", Stein considers Levy's nonexistent plans for the summer, following her nonexistent plans for the winter:

{{quote |She said she did not have any plans for the summer. No one was interested in this thing in whether she had any plans for the summer. That is not the complete history of this thing, some were interested in this thing in her not having any plans for the summer... Some who were not interested in her not having made plans for the summer were interested in her not having made plans for the following winter. She had not made plans for the summer and she had not made plans for the following winter... There was then coming to be the end of the summer and she was then not answering anything when any one asked her what were her plans for the winter.{{Sfn | Stein | 1934 | pp = 105–07}}}}

[[File:Gertrude Stein by Alvin Langdon Coburn.jpg|thumb|upright|Stein in 1913]]
During the early summer of 1914, Gertrude bought three paintings by [[Juan Gris]]: ''Roses'', ''Glass and Bottle'', and ''Book and Glasses''. Soon after she purchased them from [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s gallery,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of ''Three Lives'', to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 210–5.&lt;/ref&gt; When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in England. After a supposed three-week trip to England that stretched to three months due to the War, they returned to France, where they spent the first winter of the war.

With money acquired from the sale of Stein's last Matisse ''[[Woman with a Hat]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://highway55.library.yale.edu/PHOTONEGIMG/screen/S373/s3737234.jpg | format = [[JPEG]] | title = Woman with a Hat | publisher = Yale Collection | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926051404/http://highway55.library.yale.edu/PHOTONEGIMG/screen/S373/s3737234.jpg | archivedate = 2007-09-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; to her brother Michael, she and Toklas vacationed in Spain from May 1915 through the spring of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 218–6.&lt;/ref&gt; During their interlude in [[Majorca]], Spain, Gertrude continued her correspondence with [[Mildred Aldrich]] who kept her apprised of the War's progression, and eventually inspired Gertrude and Alice to return to France to join the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 225–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toklas and Stein returned to Paris in June 1916, and acquired a Ford automobile with the help of associates in the United States; Gertrude learned to drive it with the help of her friend [[William Edwards Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 226–7&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrude and Alice then volunteered to drive supplies to French hospitals, in the Ford they named ''Auntie'', "after Gertrude's aunt Pauline, 'who always behaved admirably in emergencies and behaved fairly well most times if she was flattered.'"

[[File:GertrudeStein JackHemingway Paris.jpg|thumb|Gertrude Stein with [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s son, [[Jack Hemingway]] in 1924. Stein is credited with bringing the term "Lost Generation" into use.]]
During the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass market publication of ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.'' She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the [[Ain]] district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the [[Rhône-Alpes]]. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named "Basket" whose successor, "Basket II", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.

With the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, [[Ain]], in the [[Rhône-Alpes]] region. Gertrude and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to [[Bernard Faÿ]] who was a collaborator with the [[Vichy regime]] and had connections to the [[Gestapo]], or possibly because Gertrude was an American and a famous author. Gertrude's book "Wars I Have Seen" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to [[Keystone cops]]. When Faÿ was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Gertrude and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Faÿ's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in [[Berchtesgaden]]. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: "Off We All Went To See Germany."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103918/barbara-will-gertrude-stein-christopher-benfey |work=The New Republic |last=Benfey |first=Christopher |title=The Alibi of Ambiguity |date=June 28, 2012 |access-date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, a cabinet in the [[Yale University]] [[Beinecke Library]], which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was "Baby Precious", in turn Stein was for Toklas, "Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle".&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation" /&gt;

===Lesbian relationships===
Stein is the author of one of the earliest [[coming out]] stories, "''Q.E.D.''" (published in 1950 as ''Things as They Are''), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of [[romantic friendship]] as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested "passion in its many disguised forms". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with [[Mary Bookstaver]] (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.&lt;ref name="Blackmer 1995 pp. 681"/&gt;

Stein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of [[Otto Weininger]]'s ''Sex and Character'' (1906). Weininger, though [[Jewish]] by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.&lt;ref name=Ramsay&gt;Ramsay, Tamara Ann (1998). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/5/ Discursive departures: A reading paradigm affiliated with feminist, lesbian, aesthetic and queer practices (with reference to Woolf, Stein, and H.D.)]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt;

More positive affirmations of Stein's sexuality began with her relationship with [[Alice B. Toklas]]. [[Ernest Hemingway]] describes how Alice was Gertrude's "wife" in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway's) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two "wives" to chat.&lt;ref name="Grahn"&gt;[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The more affirming essay "Miss Furr and Miss Skeene" is one of the first [[lesbian literature|homosexual revelation stories]] to be published. The work, like ''Q.E.D.'', is informed by Stein's growing involvement with a homosexual community,&lt;ref name="Grahn"/&gt; though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars.&lt;ref name="Blackmer"&gt;[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The work contains the word "[[gay]]" over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word "gay" in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them,&lt;ref name = "Blackmer" /&gt; and, thus, uninformed readers missed the lesbian content. A similar essay of homosexual men begins more obviously with the line "Sometimes men are kissing" but is less well known.&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

In ''[[Tender buttons: objects, food, rooms|Tender Buttons]]'' Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with "highly condensed layers of public and private meanings" created by wordplay including puns on the words "box", "cow", and in titles such as "tender buttons".&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

=="There is no there there"==
Along with Stein's widely known "[[A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]"&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Natias Neutert about Gertrude Stein´s Rose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw&lt;/ref&gt; quotation, "[[there is no there there]]" is also one of her most famous. It appears in ''Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). She wrote:

{{quote |She took us to see her granddaughter who was teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael, we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not changed but Goat Island might just as well not have been there, anyway what was the use of my having come from Oakland it was not natural to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if I like but not there, there is no there there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stefan Metaal |url=http://members.chello.nl/smetaal/usu1.htm |title=No There there |publisher=Members.chello.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

...but not there, there is no there there. ... Ah Thirteenth Avenue was the same it was shabby and overgrown. ... Not of course the house, the house the big house and the big garden and the eucalyptus trees and the rose hedge naturally were not there any longer existing, what was the use ...

It is a funny thing about addresses where you live. When you live there you know it so well that it is like an identity a thing that is so much a thing that it could not ever be any other thing and then you live somewhere else and years later, the address that was so much an address that it was like your name and you said it as if it was not an address but something that was living and then years after you do not know what the address was and when you say it is not a name anymore but something you cannot remember. That is what makes your identity not a thing that exists but something you do or do not remember.}}

==Political views==
According to Janet Malcolm's contested account in ''Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice'', Stein was a vocal critic of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name="entertainment.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/tls_selections/biography_and_memoirs/article3121561.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Gertrude and Alice | first = Justin | last=Beplate | date=January 2, 2008 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stein |first=Herbert |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2557/ |title=The Cubist Republican |publisher=Slate.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/books/ |accessdate=February 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some have stressed her queer, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics,&lt;ref&gt;Joan Rettalack, ''Introduction to Stein Selections'', University of California Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-4711487"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploringfictions.blogspot.com/2011/08/douglas-messerli-thirteen-ways-of.html |title=Douglas Messerli &amp;#124; 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Stone' (on Janet Malcolm's Two Lives) |work=exploringfictions.blogspot.com |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-29 |first=Douglas |last=Messerli |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424220237/http://exploringfictions.blogspot.com/2011/08/douglas-messerli-thirteen-ways-of.html |archivedate=April 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; her statements on immigration include sentiments that would be considered racist today. In a 1934 interview published in ''The New York Times'' she stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;That is the reason why I do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=WARREN|first1=LANSING|title=Gertrude Stein Views Life and Politics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-views.html|accessdate=1 August 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=May 6, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She publicly endorsed General [[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and admired Vichy leader Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]].&lt;ref name = "entertainment.timesonline.co.uk" /&gt; Some have argued for a more nuanced view of Stein's collaborationist activity, arguing that it was rooted in her wartime predicament and status as a Jew in Nazi-occupied France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/modernism-modernity/v011/11.4will.html | publisher = JHU | work = Project MUSE | title = Modernism/modernity—Lost in Translation: Stein's Vichy Collaboration | date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/07/usa.comment | location=London | work= The Guardian | title= The ignoble Nobel | first= Tariq | last= Ali | date= December 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = LA review of books | last = Stendhal | first = Renate | date = December 17, 2011 | title = Was Gertrude Stein a collaborator? | url = http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=9&amp;fulltext=1 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120711173928/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=9&amp;fulltext=1 | archivedate = July 11, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.scene4.com/readersblog/2012/01/the_obscene_critic.html | title = The obscene critic | journal = Scene4 Magazine | first = Renate | last = Stendhal | format = web log | date = 2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Stein commented in 1938 on [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]: "There is too much fathering going on just now and there is no doubt about it fathers are depressing."&lt;ref name="Blackmer"/&gt;

==World War II activities==
While identified with the modernist movements in art and literature, Stein's political affiliations were a mix of reactionary and progressive ideas. She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the [[industrial revolution]] had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline. Stein idealized the 18th century as the golden age of civilization, epitomized in America as the era of its founding fathers and what was in France, the glory of its pre-revolutionary [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Will |first=Barbara |journal=Humanities |title=The Strange Politics of Gertrude Stein |date=March–April 2012 |volume=33 |number=2 |access-date=October 14, 2012 |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/marchapril/feature/the-strange-politics-gertrude-stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/gertrude-stein-why-her-fascist-politics-matter/ |last=Herschthal |first=Eric |title=Gertrude Stein: Why Her Fascist Politics Matter |work=The Jewish Week |date=April 24, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, she was pro-immigrant, pro-democratic, and anti-patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno, ''"Courage to Be Courageous": The Last Works and Days of Gertrude Stein'', from ''The Continual Pilgrimage: American Writers in Paris, 1944–1960''Grove Presm 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Her last major work was the [[libretto]] of the feminist opera ''[[The Mother of Us All]]'' (1947) about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time, ''Brewsie and Willie'' (1946), expressed strong support for American G.I.s.

A compendium of source material confirms that Stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful [[Vichy government]] official [[Bernard Faÿ]]. Stein had met Faÿ in 1926, and he became her "dearest friend during her life", according to Alice B. Toklas. Faÿ had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933–34 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Faÿ's influence was instrumental in avoiding [[Nazi]] confiscation of Stein's historically significant and monetarily valuable collection of artwork, which throughout the war years was housed in Stein's Paris rue Christine apartment, under locked safeguard.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/why-wont-the-met-tell-the-whole-truth-about-gertrude-stein |last=Greenhouse |first=Emily |title=Why Won't The Met Tell The Whole Truth About Gertrude Stein |work=The New Yorker |date=June 8, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, at Faÿ's suggestion, Stein consented to translate into English some 180 pages of speeches made by Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]. In her introduction, Stein crafts an analogy between [[George Washington]] and Pétain. She writes of the high esteem in which Pétain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler. Conceived and targeted for an American readership, Stein's translations were ultimately never published in the United States. [[Random House]] publisher [[Bennett Cerf]] had read the introduction Stein had written for the translations and been horrified by what she had produced.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/04/26/missionaries/ |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |title=Missionaries |work=The New York Review of Books |date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jewish, Stein collaborated with [[Vichy France]], a regime that deported more than 75,000 Jews to [[Nazi concentration camps]], of whom only 3 percent survived the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/met-gertrude-stein-collaborator_b_1467174.html |last=Dershowitz |first=Alan |title=Suppressing Ugly Truths from Beautiful Art |work=The Huffington Post |date=May 21, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Stein wrote that Petain's policies were "really wonderful so simple so natural so extraordinary". This was Stein's contention in the year when the town of [[Culoz]], where she and Toklas resided, saw the removal of its Jewish children to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; It is difficult to say, however, how aware Stein was of these events. As she wrote in ''Wars I Have Seen'', "However near a war is it is always not very near. Even when it is here."&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Stein, ''Wars I Have Seen''. London: B.T. Batsford, 1945, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Stein had stopped translating Petain's speeches three years previously, in 1941.

Stein was able to condemn the Japanese attack at [[Pearl Harbor]] while simultaneously maintaining the dissonant acceptance of Hitler as conqueror of Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Journalist Lanning Warren interviewed Stein in her Paris apartment in a piece published in ''The New York Times Magazine'' on May 6, 1934. Stein, seemingly ironically, proclaimed that Hitler merited the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

:"The Saxon element is always destined to be dominated. The Germans have no gift at organizing. They can only obey. And obedience is not organization. Organization comes from community of will as well as community of action. And in America our democracy has been based on community of will and effort.... I say Hitler ought to have the peace prize...because he is removing all elements of contest and struggle from Germany. By driving out the Jews and the democratic Left elements, he is driving out everything that conduces to activity. That means peace."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lansing Warren |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-views.html |work=The New York Times |title=Gertrude Stein Views Life and Politics |date=May 6, 1934  |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that after the war Stein commented that the only way to ensure world peace was to teach the Germans disobedience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/article/gertrude-stein-taunts-hitler-1934-and-1945 |title=Gertrude Stein taunts Hitler in 1934 and 1945 |publisher=Jacket2 |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; this 1934 Stein interview has come to be interpreted as an ironic jest made by a practiced iconoclast hoping to gain attention and provoke controversy.  In an effort to correct popular mainstream misrepresentations of Stein's wartime activity, a dossier of articles by critics and historians has been gathered for the online journal Jacket2.&lt;ref name="jacket2.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/feature/gertrude-steins-war-years-setting-record-straight |title=Gertrude Stein's war years: Setting the record straight |publisher=Jacket2 |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How much of Stein's wartime activities were motivated by the real exigencies of self-preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon. However, her loyalty to Pétain may have gone beyond expedience.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacket2.org"/&gt; She had been urged to leave France by American embassy officials, friends and family when that possibility still existed, but declined to do so. Accustomed to a life of entitlement since birth, Stein may have been convinced her wealth and notoriety would exempt her from what had befallen other European Jews. In an essay written for the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in November, 1940, Stein had written about her decision not to leave France: "it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food." Stein continued to praise Pétain after the war ended, this at a time when Pétain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Author [[Djuna Barnes]] provided a caustic assessment of Stein's book, "Wars I Have Seen":

:"You do not feel that she [Stein] is ever really worried about the sorrows of the people. Her concerns at its highest pitch is a well-fed apprehension."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

Others have argued that some of the accounts of Stein's war time activities have amounted to a "witch hunt".&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-7643746"/&gt;

==Death==
Stein died on July 27, 1946 at the age of 72 after surgery for [[stomach cancer]] at the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;Hazel Rowley, "Richard Wright: The Life and Times," p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].  She was interred in Paris in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unjourdeplusaparis.com/en/paris-essentiel/plan-du-cimetiere-du-pere-lachaise Plan du cimetiere du Pere Lachaise] (Accessed: 11 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Later Alice B. Toklas was buried alongside her.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 44876-44877). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition&lt;/ref&gt; According to the famous version of her last moments, before having been taken into surgery, Stein asked her partner Toklas: "What is the answer?"  After Toklas replied to Stein that there was no answer, Stein countered by sinking back into her bed, murmuring: "Then, there is no question!"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Z. Smith: see idem, "When the Bough Breaks," ''History of Religions'' 12/4 (May 1973): 342&lt;/ref&gt;

Her companion Toklas, however, has given two other versions of the encounter—neither of which agrees with the "canonical" version above.  Writing in the June 2005 edition of ''The New Yorker'', Janet Malcolm describes:
{{quote |On July 27, 1946, Stein was operated on for what proved to be inoperable stomach cancer and died before coming out of anesthesia.  In "What Is Remembered," Toklas wrote of the "troubled, confused and very uncertain" afternoon of the surgery. "I sat next to her and she said to me early in the afternoon, What is the answer? I was silent. In that case, she said, what is the question?" However, in a letter to Van Vechten ten years earlier, Toklas had written:
{{quote |About Baby's last words. She said upon waking from a sleep--What is the question. And I didn't answer thinking she was not completely awakened. Then she said again--What is the question and before I could speak she went on--If there is no question then there is no answer.}}

Stein's biographers have naturally selected the superior "in that case what is the question?" version. Strong narratives win out over weak ones when no obstacle of factuality stands in their way. What Stein actually said remains unknown. That Toklas cited the lesser version in a letter of 1953 is suggestive but not conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Janet, "Someone Says Yes to It," ''The New Yorker'' 81/17 (June 13, 2005): 148&lt;/ref&gt;}} Stein named writer and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]] as her [[literary executor]], and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701075634/http://bryantpark.org/things-to-do/monuments.html There is a monument to Stein] on the Upper Terrace of [[Bryant Park]], [[New York City|New York]].

== Critical reception ==
[[Sherwood Anderson]] in his public introduction to Stein's 1922 publication of ''Geography and Plays'' wrote:
{{quote |For me the work of Gertrude Stein consists in a rebuilding, an entirely new recasting of life, in the city of words. Here is one artist who has been able to accept ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half forgotten city.}}

In a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, "As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.{{Sfn | Mellow | 1974 | p = 260}}"

Other critics took a more negative view of Stein's work. F. W. Dupee (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;IX) defines "Steinese" as "gnomic, repetitive, illogical, sparsely punctuated... a scandal and a delight, lending itself equally to derisory parody and fierce denunciation".

Composer Constant Lambert (1936) compares Stravinsky's choice of "the drabbest and least significant phrases" in ''L'Histoire du Soldat'' to Gertrude Stein's in "Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene" (1922), specifically: "[E]veryday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday." He writes that the "effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever", apparently missing the pun frequently employed by Stein.

[[James Thurber]] wrote:
{{quote |Anyone who reads at all diversely during these bizarre 1920s cannot escape the conclusion that a number of crazy men and women are writing stuff which remarkably passes for important composition among certain persons who should know better. Stuart P. Sherman, however, refused to be numbered among those who stand in awe and admiration of one of the most eminent of the idiots, Gertrude Stein. He reviews her ''Geography and Plays'' in the August 11 issue of the ''Literary Review'' of the ''New York Evening Post'' and arrives at the conviction that it is a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James | last = Thurber | author-link = James Thurber | title = Collecting Himself | editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''"The interesting writer is where there is an adversary, a problem. Why Stein is not, finally, a good or helpful writer. There is no problem. It’s all affirmation. A rose is a rose is a rose.”''&lt;br&gt;[[Susan Sontag]], from Journals and Notebooks, 1964-1980.&lt;ref&gt;Sontag, 2012. P.398.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Author [[Katherine Ann Porter]] provided her own estimation of Stein's literary legacy: "Wise or silly or nothing at all, down everything goes on the page with an air of everything being equal, unimportant in itself important because it happened to her and she was writing about it."&lt;ref name="Benstock, Shari 1987"&gt;Benstock, Shari, ''Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900–1940'', University of Texas Press, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0292790407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

History Professor [[Blanche Wiesen Cook]], has written of Stein: "She was not a radical feminist. She was Jewish and anti-Semitic, lesbian and contemptuous of women, ignorant about economics and hostile to socialism."&lt;ref name="Benstock, Shari 1987"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in 1923, eminent literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] presciently came to an evaluation similar to the one made by Katharine Ann Porter some twenty years later, after Stein's death. Wilson deemed that Stein's technique was one of flawed methodology, using words analogous to the way [[Cubists]] manipulated abstract forms in their artworks. As Wilson wrote, unlike the [[plastic arts]], literature deals with

:"human speech [which] is a tissue of ideas.&amp;nbsp;... Miss Stein no longer understands the conditions under which literary effects have to be produced&amp;nbsp;... There is sometimes genuine music in the most baffling of her works, but there are rarely any communicated emotions."&lt;ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879"&gt;Wilson, Edmund, "A Guide to Gertrude Stein", ''Vanity Fair'', September 1923, ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s &amp; 1930s'', Library of America, 2007, p. 878–879&lt;/ref&gt;

An elevated observer, perched high above everything below, he likened Stein to a self-conceived "[[Buddha]]...registering impressions like some august seismograph".&lt;ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879"/&gt;

Stein's literary output was a subject of amusement for her brother Leo Stein, who characterized her writing as an "abomination". Later detractors of Stein's work deemed her experimentation as the serendipitous result of her alleged inability to communicate through linguistic convention, deficient in the skills required "to deal effectively with language, so that she made her greatest weakness into her most remarkable strength".&lt;ref name="Benstock, Shari 1987"/&gt;

==Legacy and commemoration==
Stein has been the subject of many artistic works. 
Stein and Toklas merit their own line each in the song "Bosom Buddies" from the 1966 Broadway musical ''MAME'', based on the stage play ''Auntie Mame'', by composer-lyricist Jerry Herman. In ''MAME'', Vera Charles, Mame Dennis' actress-confidante pal, sings: "...I'll always be Alice Toklas, if you'll be Gertrude Stein."  (Bea Arthur, who played the original Vera Charles on Broadway, recreated the same role for the 1974 film version of the musical.)
In the 1998 Latin American literary classic ''Yo-Yo Boing!'', novelist [[Giannina Braschi]] pays homage to Stein as an imaginary mentor.

In 2005, playwright/actor [[Jade Esteban Estrada]] portrayed Stein in the solo musical ''ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1'' at [[Princeton University]]. In 2006, theatre director/actor [[Luiz Päetow]] created his solo, ''Plays'', portraying Stein's 1934 homonymous lecture, and toured [[Brazil]] for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jqz.cv.zip.net/arch2008-04-01_2008-04-30.html|title=Peças are Plays in Portuguese|publisher=uol}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Loving Repeating'' is a musical by [[Stephen Flaherty]] based on the writings of Gertrude Stein. Stein and [[Alice B. Toklas]] are both characters in the eight person show. 
Stein is a central character in [[Nick Bertozzi]]'s 2007 graphic novel ''The Salon''.

The posthumously published ''[[Journals of Ayn Rand]]'' contain several highly hostile references to Gertrude Stein. From Rand's working notes for her novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', it is clear that the character Lois Cook in that book was intended as a caricature of Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mayhew|editor1-first=Robert|title=Essays on Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead"|date=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Md. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0739115787|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSHdxgJ1UmQC&amp;lpg=PA217|chapter=Humor in The Fountainhead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein (played by [[Bernard Cribbins]]) and [[Alice B. Toklas|Toklas]] (played by [[Wilfrid Brambell]]) were depicted in the playful [[Sweden|Swedish]] 1978 [[absurdist fiction]] film ''Picassos äventyr'' ''([[The Adventures of Picasso]])'' by director [[Tage Danielsson]], with [[Gösta Ekman]] as [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078084/ |title=The Adventures of Picasso |publisher=IMDB Internet Movie Database |date= |accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein was portrayed in the 2011 [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'' by [[Kathy Bates]], and by [[Tracee Chimo]] in the 2018 season of the television series ''[[Genius (U.S. TV series)|Genius]]'' which focuses on the life and career of Pablo Picasso.

Stein is added to a list of great artists and notables in the popular Broadway musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' in the song "[[La Vie Boheme]]".
She is also mentioned in the Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers 1935 film ''Top Hat'' and in the song "[[Roseability]]" by the Scottish rock group [[Idlewild (band)|Idlewild]].

Composer [[Ricky Ian Gordon]] and librettist [[Royce Vavrek]]'s opera ''[[27 (opera)|27]]'' about Stein and Toklas premiered at [[Opera Theatre of St. Louis]] in June, 2014 with [[Stephanie Blythe]] as Stein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/departments.aspx?type=OperaWatch |title=OperaWatch |publisher=Opera News |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Einhorn]] wrote the play ''The Marriage of Alice B. Toklas by Gertrude Stein'', a farce about their fantasy marriage that also told the story of their life.  It premiered in May 2017 at HERE Arts Center in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/theater/review-love-genius-and-the-marriage-of-alice-b-toklas-by-gertrude-stein.html |title=Love, Genius and The Marriage of Alice B.

'''''Guernica''''' is a 1937 statue made by French sculptor [[René Iché]].

==History==
It is one of Iché's most personal and violent works. He created this sculpture immediately after the [[bombing of Guernica]] on 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Shocked by the horror of the civilians' massacre, Iché worked all the day and the next night on his plaster statue. His daughter, Hélène, who was six at the time, was his model. However, Iché refused to exhibit his work because of its violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Video on France 2, ''D'art d'art'' |url=http://dartdart.france2.fr/?id_article=46 |publisher=France2 |accessdate=29 June 2009 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206194453/http://dartdart.france2.fr/?id_article=46 |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was revealed to the general public in 1997, at the exhibition commemorating the centenary of the artist's birth. Thereafter, the sculpture was no longer exhibited and remains owned by the artist's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=René Iché – Official site |url=http://www.rene-iche.com/ |publisher=René Iché |accessdate=29 June 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original plaster was given in 2011 to the [[Musée Fabre]], where he is going to be restored.&lt;ref&gt;http://museefabre-en.montpellier-agglo.com/index.php/connaitre/les_nouvelles_acquisitions/peinture_et_sculpture_modernes_et_contemporaines/rene_iche_guernica&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11130">'''Hans-Jörg Rheinberger''' (born 12 January 1946) is an historian of science who comes from Liechtenstein. He has been director at the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]] in [[Berlin]] from 1997 to 2014. His focus areas within the [[history of science]] are the history and epistemology of the experiment, and further the history of [[molecular biology]] and [[protein biosynthesis]]. Additionally he writes and publicizes essays and poems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edition Isele]]: [http://www.edition-isele.de/shopersatz/index.php?aktion=detail&amp;id=441 ''Rheinberger, Hans Jörg''], visited 11. Januar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Hans-Jörg Rheinberger was born in [[Grabs]], [[Switzerland]] on 12 January 1946. He is the great-grandnephew of the composer [[Josef Rheinberger]] and grandchild of the artist and architect {{ill|Egon Rheinberger|de}}. He studied philosophy, linguistics and biology at the [[University of Tübingen]], the [[Free University of Berlin]] and the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. After completing his magister degree in philosophy (1973) he earned his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1982 with a dissertation concerned with protein biosynthesis and habilitated 1987 in molecular biology at the FU Berlin. From 1982 until 1990 Rheinberger worked as research assistant and research group superintendent at the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics]] in Berlin-Dahlem. The following two years he spend as visiting professor at the universities of Salzburg and Innsbruck. After a sabbatical at [[Stanford University]] (1989/90 within the program "History of Science"), he was senior lecturer at the Institute for the History of Medicine and Science of the [[University of Lübeck]] from 1990 until 1994. Subsequently, Rheinberger was associate professor at the [[University of Salzburg]] until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/staff/members/rheinbg MPI-Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996 Rheinberger is scientific member of the [[Max Planck Society]] and has been director at the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]] from 1997 until 2014. Since then he is Emeritus scientific member of the institute. From 1993 until 1994 he has been fellow at the [[Berlin Institute for Advanced Study]]. In 2000 Rheinberger taught in the capacity of visiting scholar at the Collegium Helveticum of the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]], 2006 at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]] and 2016 at the [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evaston]]. He is honorary professor at the [[Technical University of Berlin|TU Berlin]], member of the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities,]] the [[Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]], as well as the [[:de:P.E.N.-Club_Liechtenstein|P.E.N.-Club Liechtenstein]].&lt;/ref&gt; und im [[P.E.N.-Club Liechtenstein]].

== Research ==
Rheinbergers primary field of activity within the history of science is the epistemologcal exploration of the [[experiment]] and of the research pracatices of the natural sciences with focus on the biology of the 19th and 20th century. In his studies he describes "experimental systems" to be the driving forces within the development of the modern natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wissenswerkstatt.net/2007/05/06/experimentalsysteme-hans-joerg-rheinberger-skizziert-kontingenzspielraeume/ Wissenswerkstatt – „Experimentalsysteme“]&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his corpus of theoratical categories in dependence to the philosophy of [[Jacques Derrida]] and draws many inspirations form the works of [[Gaston Bachelard]].

His main focus is aimed at the "structures of the experiment", which he deciphers by applying reconstructive analysis to the work in laboratories concerned with biological research. In contrast to the common self-image the researching science themselves hold Rheinberger shows that planning and control is less defining the every-day-business of research than improvisation and chance. According to Rheinberger promising "experimental systems" are distinguished by the amount of space the grant an "epistemic thing" to unfold itself. This is, as he puts it, imperative to "deal prodictively the unknown".

== The "epistemic thing" ==
The "epistemic thing" is the object of investigation during the research process, which can develop to become a "technical object" over the course of the investigation, therefore becoming something that can be used to research other "epistemic things". The boundary between "epistemic thing" and "technical object" is not static and identifying something as either or not permanent. Therefore, insight is neither inevitable nor complete. Rheinberger's experiences as a molecular biologist has brought the "materiality of the natural sciences" into the focus of the history of science.

Her sister Emilia became a notable poet, and her other sister Florence served as personal secretary to [[Aurel Stein]] at the [[British Museum]]. 

She almost never used her first name; her family called her Hiddo; and at Oxford she came to be known as Highland Hilda because of her [[Scottish people|Scottish]] background.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waterhouse|first1=Helen|title=Article Lorimer, (Elizabeth) Hilda Lockhart (1873–1954), classical scholar|website=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/48498|date=23 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Lorimer attended the [[High School of Dundee]] in Scotland from 1889 – 1893. She was granted a scholarship to [[Girton College]] at [[Cambridge University]], where she earned a [[British_undergraduate_degree_classification#First-class_honours|first]]. While attending Girton, Lorimer never attended classes at Cambridge and instead was taught by tutors coming out to her.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Career==
In 1896, she became a [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|fellow]] and [[Tutorial system|tutor]] of Classics at [[Somerville College]], Oxford, which is where she spent the rest of her career. At Somerville, she had little contact with colleagues. Discrimination against women was an institutionalised part of the culture in English universities at the time and something Lorimer struggled with for much of her life.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

She was a skilled [[Latin]] linguist, but at Oxford her interests turned toward [[archaeology]]. She took a sabbatical to attend the [[British School at Athens]] in 1901 and 1902. There she began focusing on Homeric archaeology, the study of ancient civilisations known through the poems of [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waterhouse, [http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Lorimer_Hilda.pdf Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology], Brown University.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, she participated in excavations at [[Phylakopi]] on [[Melos]]. [[Dorothy Lamb]], Lillian Tenant and  Lorimer were the first women to participate in an excavation conducted by the British School at Athens.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Sue|last2=Whitehouse|first2=Ruth D.|last3=Wright|first3=Katherine I.|title=Archeology and Women: Ancient and Modern Issues|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1-59874-223-X|pages=55–56|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation, led by [[Richard MacGillivray Dawkins]], the director of the British School, was conducted from March to May 1911. The project was a supplementary excavation of a site that had been explored in 1896–1899.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawkins|first1=Richard|last2=Droop|first2=J.P.|title=Excavations at Phylakopi in Melos, 1911. The Annual of the British School at Athens, Volume 17|publisher=British School at Athens|location=Athens|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 she went to [[Salonica]] as a nursing orderly in the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service|Scottish Women's Hospital]] (the Girton and Newnham Unit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somervillians in the First World War|url=http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/archive/2011/01/25/somervillians-in-the-first-world-war/|website=blogs.some.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilda Lorimer took an  [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Oxford MA]]  at the first opportunity, in 1920,&lt;ref&gt; _____, "Degrees conferred at Oxford". Yorkshire Post, 15 October 1920. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and  her Cambridge MA in 1948 She returned to [[Athens]] in 1922 and became a university [[lecturer]] at Oxford from 1929 – 1937. She retired in 1939, but remained an [[honorary fellow]].

She died on 1 March 1954 and is buried with her siblings in [[Warriston Cemetery]] in north [[Edinburgh]]. The grave lies to the south-west of the now-sealed eastern entrance.

==Publications==

Lorimer published extensively on Homeric studies throughout her career, but her seminal work came late in life with the publication of ''Homer and the Monuments''. Its publication was delayed until 1950 by the Second World War.

'''Ibrahim Müteferrika''' ({{lang-tr|İbrahim Müteferrika}}; 1674–1745) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]-born [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[diplomat]], [[Printer (publisher)|publisher]], economist, historian, [[Kalam|Islamic theologian]], [[sociologist]],&lt;ref&gt;Vefa Erginbas (2005), Forerunner Of The Ottoman Enlightenment: Ibrahim Muteferrika and His Intellectual Landscape, p. 1 &amp; 46-47, [[Sabancı University]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the first [[Muslim]] to run a [[printing press]] with movable [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] [[Movable type|type]].&lt;ref name="katip celebi"&gt;[http://vitrine.library.uu.nl/wwwroot/en/texts/Rarqu54.htm Presentation of Katip Çelebi, ''Kitâb-i Cihân-nümâ li-Kâtib Çelebi''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505024753/http://vitrine.library.uu.nl/wwwroot/en/texts/Rarqu54.htm |date=2009-05-05 }}, at the [[Utrecht University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ibrahim Muteferrika was born in Kolozsvár (present-day [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]). He was an [[Hungarians|ethnic Hungarian]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] who converted to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="katip celebi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Hamilton, Maurits H. van den Boogert, Bart Westerweel, ''The Republic of Letters and the Levant'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden &amp; Boston, 2005, p.266. {{ISBN|90-04-14761-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original [[Hungarian language]] name is however unknown.&lt;ref name="katip celebi"/&gt;

==Diplomatic Service==
{{quote box|width=25%|quote="Why do the Christian nations, which were so weak in the past compared with Muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?"..."Because they have laws and rules invented by reason"|source='''Ibrahim Muteferrika''', ''Rational basis for the Politics of Nations'' (1731)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/niall_ferguson_the_6_killer_apps_of_prosperity.html|title=The 6 killer apps of prosperity|date=11 August 2017|website=Ted.com|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

At a young age, Ibrahim Muteferrika entered the Ottoman diplomatic services. He took an active part in the negotiations with [[Austria]] and [[Russia]]. Ibrahim Muteferrika was an active figure in promoting the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Ottoman-French alliance]] (1737–1739) against [[Austria]] and [[Russia]]. Ibrahim Muteferrika was also acclaimed for his role in the [[Great Northern War|Ottoman-Swedish]] action against [[Russia]].
During his services as a diplomat he is known to have befriended many influential personalities including [[Osman Aga of Temesvar]], a fellow diplomat of [[Transylvania]]n origins and former prisoner of war imprisoned in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/280934/Ibrahim-Muteferrika|title=Ibrahim Muteferrika - Ottoman diplomat|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during his years as a diplomat that he took a keen interest in collecting books that helped him understand the ongoing [[Renaissance]], the emergence of [[Protestant]] movements in Europe, and the rise of powerful [[Colonial powers|colonial empire]]s in [[Europe]].

==Printing Press==
[[File:Map of the Indian Ocean and the China Sea was engraved in 1728 by Ibrahim Müteferrika.jpg|thumb|left|This map of the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[China]] [[Sea]] was engraved in 1728 by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] polymath and publisher Ibrahim Muteferrika; it is one of a series that illustrated [[Katip Çelebi]]’s ''Cihannuma'' (Universal Geography), the first printed book of maps and drawings to appear in the [[Muslim World]].]]

His volumes, printed in [[Istanbul]] and using custom-made fonts, are occasionally referred to as "[[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] [[Incunabulum|incunabula]]".&lt;ref name="katip celebi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=watson&gt;William J. Watson, "Ibrahim Muteferrika and Turkish Incunabula", in ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 88, No. 3 (1968), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Muteferrika, whose last name derived from his employment as a ''Müteferrika'', head of the household, under [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Ahmed III]] and during the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], was also a geographer, astronomer, and philosopher.&lt;ref name="katip celebi"/&gt;

Following a 1726 report on the efficiency of the new system, which he drafted and presented simultaneously to [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|Grand Vizier]] [[Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha]], the [[Grand Mufti]], and the clergy, and a later request submitted to Sultan Ahmed III, he received permission to publish non-religious books (despite opposition from some [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphers]] and religious leaders).&lt;ref name="katip celebi"/&gt; Muteferrika's press published its first book in 1729, and, by 1743, issued 17 works in 23 volumes (each having between 500 and 1,000 copies).&lt;ref name="katip celebi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=watson /&gt; The first book ever published by Muteferrika is ''"Vankulu Lügati"'', a 2-volume Arabic-Turkish dictionary. Printing religious books was prohibited (and remained prohibited until 1803).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gábor Ágoston|first1=|last2=Bruce Alan Masters|first2=|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Ibrahim+muteferrika+censorship&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PfX5SeGLq7&amp;sig=ijvEDMS9_5g57sgYq_fMyTQQLos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRqsLQ9L7aAhXIU7wKHaJNDdQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ibrahim%20muteferrika%20censorship&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438110257|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the works published by Müteferrika were historical and generically scientific works, as well as [[Katip Çelebi]]'s world atlas ''Cihannüma'' (loosely translated as: ''The Mirror of the World'' or the ''World Seer'').&lt;ref name="katip celebi"/&gt; In a digression that he added to his printing, Müteferrika discussed the [[heliocentrism]] of astronomy in detail, with references to relatively up-to-date scientific arguments for and against it. In this regard, he is considered one of the first people to properly introduce [[heliocentrism]] to the Ottoman readers.&lt;ref&gt;İ. Kalaycıoğulları, Y. Unat, ''Kopernik Kuramının Türkiye'deki Yansımaları'' ("Reflections of Copernican Theory in Turkey"), presented at the XIVth National Astronomy Congress, September 2004, [[Kayseri]], Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1742, however, Ibrahim Muteferrika's printing activities were discontinued and an attempt by the [[British Empire|British]] diplomat [[James Mario Matra]], motivated by the exorbitant prices for manuscript books, to reestablish a press in [[Istanbul]] was aborted in 1779.&lt;ref name="Clogg 1979, 67"&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his account, Matra refers to the strong opposition of the scribes which Müteferrika's enterprise had to face earlier:

{{quote|A Press had been set up here about sixty years ago in the turbulent reign of [[Ahmed III]] but those who maintained themselves by copying of Books, apprehending with reason that their trade would be totally ruined, were so loud in their clamours as to alarm the [[Seraglio]], and as they were supported by a seditious Corps of [[Janissary]], the Sultan apprehending what really did after happen, that as he mounted the throne by one insurrection, he might be tumbled from it by another, gave way to their complaints, and suppressed the Press, before anything better than the [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]], and some trifling books of [[Mathematics]] had been struck off.&lt;ref name="Clogg 1979, 67"/&gt;}}

==Legacy==
Muteferrika died in [[Istanbul]].

A statue of Muteferrika can be found in the Sahaflar Çarşısı adjacent to the [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-198224-ibrahim-muteferrika-a-statue-in-the-sahaflar-carsisi.html  İbrahim Müteferrika -- a statue in the Sahaflar Çarşısı] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114031759/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-198224-ibrahim-muteferrika-a-statue-in-the-sahaflar-carsisi.html |date=2010-01-14 }} Today's Zaman, 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books published by Muteferrika ==
A total of 17 titles have been published by Muteferrika at his own press during his lifetime :

# ''Kitab-ı Lügat-ı Vankulu (Sihah El-Cevheri)'', 2 volumes, 1729
# ''Tuhfet-ül Kibar fi Esfar el-Bihar'', 1729
# ''Tarih-i Seyyah'', 1729
# ''Tarih-i Hind-i Garbi'', 1730
# ''Tarih-i Timur Gürgan'', 1730
# ''Tarih-I Mısr-i Kadim ve Mısr-i Cedid'', 1730
# ''Gülşen-i Hülefa'', 1730
# ''Grammaire Turque'', 1730
# ''Usul el-Hikem fi Nizam el-Ümem'', 1732
# ''Fiyuzat-ı Mıknatısiye'', 1732
# ''Cihan-nüma'', 1732
# ''Takvim el-Tevarih'', 1733
# ''Kitab-ı Tarih-i Naima'', 2 volumes, 1734
# ''Tarih-i Raşid'', 3 volumes, 1735
# ''Tarih-i Çelebizade'', 1741
# ''Ahval-i Gazavat der Diyar-ı Bosna'', 1741
# ''Kitab-ı Lisan el-Acem el Müsemma bi-Ferheng-i Şuuri'',  2 volumes, 1742

(Most of the copies of the book ''Tarih-i Çelebizade''  have been bound into the third and last volume of ''Tarih-i Raşid'' and sold together with it and thus have erroneously led several sources to believe a total of 16 items have been published.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">The '''Institute of Nautical Archaeology''' (INA) is the world’s oldest organization devoted to the study of humanity’s interaction with the sea through the practice of [[archaeology]].  INA’s founder [[George Bass (archeologist)|Dr. George Bass]] pioneered the science of underwater excavation in the 1960s through work at [[Cape Gelidonya]] and other ancient shipwreck sites off the coast of Turkey.  Since then, INA has expanded its scope and activities to work globally on shipwrecks and submerged sites and worked with [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]] to establish the [[Nautical Archaeology Program]] there.  Hundreds of archaeologists have received their training at Texas A&amp;M and today, after more than three decades of the Nautical Archaeology Program’s existence, many of the world’s leading scholars have received their degrees from Texas A&amp;M.

INA is a not-for-profit group founded in 1973.  Today it has members all over the world, and counts among them professional archaeologists, students, and many others from all walks of life.  INA’s members are interested in seeking out lost ships, and applying the highest standards of science and art to excavating and studying them to unlock their secrets.  They do so to add to humanity’s understanding of seafaring’s role in the development of civilization.  Three-quarters of the earth is covered by water, and in the fabric of human history, the most pervasive thread is our association with the planet’s oceans, rivers and lakes.

The Institute of Nautical Archaeology works for the public to share what nautical archaeologists do, with anyone with an interest.  INA is also committed to the preservation of the world’s shipwrecks and other archaeological sites, but specifically to finding the most significant sites and excavating them to unlock their secrets.

INA’s professional and volunteer members and affiliates have conducted fieldwork in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Americas, and Europe.  They have worked on the world’s oldest known shipwrecks, and on wrecks as recent as [[World War II]].  Their work has improved the understanding of ancient trade in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the development of the ship, shipbuilding in the Ancient World, the saga of European expansion into the New World, and wars for the control of the Americas.

In particular, many leading intelligence experts have begun to argue that the war in Iraq is actually increasing terrorism.

==Views of U.S. Congress, public, and troops==

===Calls for withdrawal from Iraq===
{{Main|Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq}}

First, was this war necessary or did it actually divert important resources from al Qaeda and the true war on terror?  The withdrawal of American military forces from [[Iraq]] has been a contentious issue within the [[United States]] since the beginning of the Iraq War.  As the war has progressed from its initial invasion phase to the more than four-year occupation, U.S. public opinion has turned in favor of troop withdrawal.

===Opinion from 2003 to 2005===

At the outset of the war, the U.S. Congress and public opinion supported the notion that the Iraq War was part of the global war on terror.  The 2002 Congressional resolution authorising military force against Iraq cited the U.S. determination to "prosecute the war on terrorism", and in April 2003, one month after the invasion, a poll found that 77% of Americans agreed that the Iraq War was part of the War on Terror.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A857-2003Nov4 Survey Shows Skepticism About Iraq], ''[[Washington Post]]'' 4 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the organized violence encountered by the U.S. military was framed by the metaphor of a [[crusade]], or total conflict, that was taken up by the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stocchetti|first=Matteo|contribution=The Politics of Fear: A Critical Inquiry into the Role of Violence in 21st Century Politics|title=Discourse, War and Terrorism|editor-last=Hodges|editor-first=Adam|editor2-last=Nilep|editor2-first=Chad|series=Discourse Approaches to Politics, Society and Culture|volume=24|publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing]]|year=2007|location=Amsterdam|pages=223–241|isbn=978-90-272-2714-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] report said the war diverts attention and resources from the threat posed by [[Al Qaeda]] and called for downsizing the war on terror and focusing instead on the threat from Al Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion from 2006 to date===

The [[Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003|military and civilian death toll]] has mounted, the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] has shifted to what many observers have labeled a [[Civil war in Iraq (2006-07)|civil war]], and the [[politics of Iraq]] have remained unstable, many politicians and citizens from the United States and across the world have begun pushing for the U.S. to withdraw from Iraq. Significant American calls for withdrawal include the [[Iraq Study Group Report]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/ Iraq Study Group Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208193855/http://www.usip.org/isg/iraq_study_group_report/report/1206/ |date=2006-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Center for American Progress]]'s proposal for [[strategic reset]].&lt;ref name=CAPreset&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/strategic_reset.html "Strategic Reset"]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As of spring 2007, surveys showed a majority of Americans in support of a timetable for withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Pew Research Center: [http://pewresearch.org/pubs/437/ Solid Majority Favors Congressional Troop Deadline], 26 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While up to 70 percent of Americans in one survey favored withdrawal, most prefer to leave gradually over 12 months, and 60 percent say the U.S. has a moral obligation to the Iraqi people.&lt;ref&gt;Public Agenda: [http://www.publicagenda.org/foreignpolicy/foreignpolicy_iraq.htm "Confidence in U.S. Foreign Policy Index"] accessed 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to voicing concerns over the human and financial costs of the war, supporters of withdrawal argue that the U.S. presence fosters ongoing violence by providing a target for al-Qaeda. It also allows Iraqi political leaders to avoid reaching a power-sharing agreement. The withdrawal will induce Iraq's neighbors to become more involved in quelling violence in the country and will relieve the strain on the U.S. military.&lt;ref name=CAPreset /&gt;  The withdrawal debate has brought comparison of Iraq and Vietnam wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7166.htm Why the U.S. must withdraw from Iraq&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0606-25.htm Withdraw From Iraq&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 midterm Congressional elections, Congress has pushed to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq, in part based on the argument that Iraq is a distraction, as opposed to a part of, the war on terror.  Likewise, a January 2007 poll found that 57% of Americans feel that the Iraq War is not part of the War on Terror.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll] Jan. 19-21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/04/military_gwot_democrats_070403w/ No more GWOT, House committee decrees - Army News, opinions, editorials, news from Iraq, photos, reports - Army Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2007, polls revealed that only 30% of Americans support the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/ | work=CNN | title=CNN Political Ticker - All politics, all the time - CNN.com Blogs | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2007/images/06/26/rel7c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 2007 the House passed a resolution by 223 to 201, for redeployment [or withdrawal] of U.S. armed forces out of Iraq.

=== Increase in terrorism ===

According to the Israel Intelligence Heritage &amp; Commemoration Center, Saddam Hussein had a long history before the invasion of [http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/html/final/eng/bu/iraq/iraq_f_a.htm#table giving money to families of suicide bombers in Palestine.] And, as part of the justification for the war, the Bush Administration argued that Saddam Hussein also had ties to [[al-Qaeda]], and that his overthrow would lead to democratisation in the Middle East, decreasing terrorism overall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html White House Oct 2002 press release]&lt;/ref&gt; However, reports from the CIA, the U.S. State Department, the FBI, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as the investigations of foreign intelligence agencies found no evidence of an operational connection [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda|between Saddam and al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisman, Jonathan.

Some intelligence experts have a contrary view - that the Iraq war has increased terrorism. Counterterrorism expert [[Rohan Gunaratna]] frequently refers to the invasion of Iraq as a "fatal mistake."&lt;ref&gt;Rohan Gunaratna, "The Post-Madrid Face of Al Qaeda", ''Washington Quarterly'' 27:3 (Summer 2004) p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  London's conservative [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become "a potent global recruitment pretext" for jihadists and that the invasion "galvanised" al-Qaeda and "perversely inspired insurgent violence" there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sengupta |first=Kim |title=Occupation Made World Less Safe, Pro-War Institute Says |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=2004-05-26 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0526-05.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920050852/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0526-05.htm |archivedate=2006-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. [[National Intelligence Council]] concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; [[David B. Low]], the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with "a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills...  There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries."  The Council's Chairman Robert L. Hutchings said, "At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Priest |first = Dana |title = Iraq New Terror Breeding Ground |publisher = Washington Post |date = 2005-01-14 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7460-2005Jan13.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And the 2006 [[National Intelligence Estimate]], which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, held that "The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause celebre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/Declassified_NIE_Key_Judgments.pdf |title=DNI: Declassified NIE Key Judgments |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930220648/http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/Declassified_NIE_Key_Judgments.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-30 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(66.3&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Mohammed Hafez]], "Since 2003, the number of suicide bombings in Iraq has surpassed all those of Hamas in Israel, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka combined."&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed M.

Al-Qaeda leaders have seen the Iraq war as a boon to their recruiting and operational efforts, providing evidence to jihadists worldwide that America is at war with Islam, and the training ground for a new generation of jihadists to practice attacks on American forces.  In October 2003, Osama bin Laden announced: "Be glad of the good news: America is mired in the swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates. Bush is, through Iraq and its oil, easy prey. Here is he now, thank God, in an embarrassing situation and here is America today being ruined before the eyes of the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;[[al Jazeera English]]: [http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=40703 Message to Iraqis October 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda commander [[Seif al-Adl]] gloated about the war in Iraq, indicating, "The Americans took the bait and fell into our trap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Gerges |first = Fawaz A. |title = The Iraq War: Planting the Seeds of Al Qaeda's Second Generation |publisher = Toward Freedom |date = 2005-10-10 |url = http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/623/60/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter thought to be from al-Qaeda leader [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] found in Iraq among the rubble where [[al-Zarqawi]] was killed and released by the U.S. military in October 2006, indicated that al-Qaeda perceived the war as beneficial to its goals: "The most important thing is that the jihad continues with steadfastness ... indeed, prolonging the war is in our interest.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Murphy |first = Dan |title = How Al Qaeda views a long Iraq war |publisher = Christian Science Monitor |date = 2006-10-06 |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1006/p01s04-woiq.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International opinion of the War on Terror===
The declaration of a global war on terror in the aftermath of the attacks of in September 2001 constituted the single most ambitious reordering of America's foreign policy objectives since the Second World War. Alongside this re-evaluation of foreign policy priorities came a stark warning to the rest of the world. At the joint session of the [[United States Congress]] following the attacks, President Bush said that 'every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.' This ultimatum deepened America's relations with states that had a strong interest in destroying [[Al-Qaeda]], and strained those with states that had mixed records in combating terrorism, such as [[Saudi Arabia]]. While September 11 did not change everything-the unipolar structure of the international system remained intact, for example-it nevertheless profoundly altered American grand strategy, reshuffling the alliance system that had served as the foundation of [[US foreign policy]] since 1945 and making the defeat of terrorism the chief object of American power. For a brief time the 'war on terror' appeared to chart a new, even revolutionary, direction for America's grand strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Boyle, "The War on Terror in American Grand Strategy," International Affairs, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Mar., 2008), pp. 191-209&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States was attacked by terrorists on September 11, 2001, its European allies were among the first nations to express sympathy and pledge their aid in the war to come. The fact that many European countries have long experienced terrorism themselves helped ensure a great deal of transatlantic empathy and cooperation- at least at first. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom have suffered political violence over the past 30 years and were thus predisposed to help the United States its new struggle against al-Qaeda. But the kind of terrorism these European countries have suffered-"old" terrorism-differs substantially from that suddenly faced by the United States. As time passed, these differences started to erode the through going unity that had flourished right after September 11.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;Jonathan Stevenson, "How Europe and America Defend Themselves," Foreign Affairs, Vol. 82, No. 2 (Mar.-April 2003), pp. 75-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, however, a rise of violent activity in Europe by international terrorist groups (such as the Palestine Liberation Organization and [[Hezbollah]]) began to prove these traditional European responses to terror inadequate. Governments reacted with more robust and effective-cooperative measures. Still, unlike the enemies the United States faces today, few terrorists in those days sought to debilitate European governments or recruit large numbers of members. And even those that did harbor global religious and ideological objectives (such as the Algerian Islamist Group, or GIA) still tended to employ "old" terrorist techniques.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Al Qaeda, on the other hand, represents a transnational threat-one very different in kind from that posed by the IRA or even newer groups such as Hamas. Al Qaeda has potentially thousands of members and no interest in bargaining with the United States or its allies. Instead, it seeks to cripple them, by inflicting mass casualties if p possible, potentially with [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDI).&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

To understand Europe's approach to counterterrorism, it helps to remember that its attitude has been informed by the region's experience with the old form of terrorism-not the new transnational kind. Because of the limited form that most of European terrorism has taken in the past, European governments remain more inclined than Washington to distinguish the political wings of terrorist groups from their military elements. This in turn helps explain why, although European governments have generally been very effective in stopping terrorists financially—they have frozen about $35 million in suspected al Qaeda assets since September 11 (compared to about $34 million in the United States and $124.5 million worldwide)—as of December 2002, they still had not frozen the assets of Hamas' political wing.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Before September 11, only six European countries-France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom-had specific counter terrorism laws (as distinct from ordinary criminal codes). Some of these six have since strengthened their laws still further or improved enforcement. Other countries such as the Netherlands, which did not have such laws or counterterrorism programs, have enacted and implemented them. Spanish magistrates, seasoned by long-standing Basque terrorism and equipped with tough statutes, have been among the most dogged pursuers of al Qaeda suspects. Germany has substantially increased funding for its border guard, prosecutor's office, and intelligence agencies, and has increased law enforcement's access to personal financial data. [[Berlin]] has also authorized the prosecution of foreigners associated with terrorist groups based outside Germany, and the deportation of those perpetrating political violence or otherwise threatening Germany's "basic order of democratic freedom." Italy, for its part, has similarly broadened its statutory authority for apprehending terrorists.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Other countries, however-such as [[Belgium]]-have done little, and even in European countries that have taken action, the measures have been largely remedial. Both Germany and Italy have long been plagued by bureaucratic in efficiencies and significant statutory gaps in their law-enforcement regimes. Prior to September 11, for instance, Germany had no provision outlawing foreign-based terrorist organizations, and Italy had not authorized surveillance of those suspected of belonging to such groups.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Still, there is no doubt that European leaders are aware that their countries were infiltrated by al Qaeda prior to September 11. This fact, along with more recent developments showing that al Qaeda has reconstituted itself and expanded its list of targets has energized EU law enforcement. This is not surprising, given that al Qaeda or its affiliates have attacked German tourists in [[Tunisia]]; French submarine engineers in Pakistan; a French oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden; U.S. marines in [[Kuwait]]; [[Australian]], European, and American tourists in [[Bali]]; and [[Israelis]] in [[Kenya]]. As this list indicates, until it is ready to stage another mass-casualty attack in America, al Qaeda will content itself with soft targets over a wider geographical range. Confirming the point, in an audiotape that surfaced in November 2002, Osama bin Laden expressly cited [[Australia]], [[Canada]], France, Germany, [[Israel]], Italy, and the United Kingdom as targets.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

In response, several European governments departed from their relatively circumspect, low-key approach to terrorism alerts and issued stark warnings about planned attacks in Europe.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Nevertheless, these incentives off or improving territorial security in Europe remain subject to countervailing attitudes and political forces. Germany, the United Kingdom, and France all have large [[Muslim]] populations. And whereas the roughly1 5million Muslims living in the EU'S 15 current member states constitute about four percent of the total EU population, the 6 million Muslims (a liberal estimate) living in the United States compose only slightly higher than two percent of the U.S. population-a significant difference. European Muslims, however, are only half-accepted socially and are politically underrepresented. This marginal status makes them susceptible to radicalization-one factor that has helped prevent governments from taking steps that might seem [[War against Islam|anti-Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson"/&gt;

Concern about terrorism varies significantly around the world, with the highest levels found in the Middle East, South Asia, and Western Europe—all regions that have suffered significant terrorist attacks. Despite [[9/11]], Americans are only average in their level of concern. Asked how big a problem terrorism is in their country, in sixteen out of forty-seven nations a majority or plurality said it was a very big problem; in fifteen nations a majority or plurality said it was at least a moderately big problem; and in thirteen nations a majority or plurality said it was a small problem or not a problem at all. An average of 41 percent of respondents across all countries polled said that terrorism is a very big problem in their country, while 23 percent said it was a moderately big problem, 19 percent said it is a small problem, and 14 percent said it is not a problem at all.&lt;ref name="POGI"&gt;"Public Opinion on Global Issues," Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the countries that show the highest levels of concern are ones where there have been significant terrorist attacks. The highest levels of concern are found in the Middle East and South Asia, led by [[Morocco]] (81 percent calling it a very big problem), Bangladesh (77 percent), [[Lebanon]] (76 percent), [[Pakistan]] (76 percent), [[India]] (72 percent), and [[Turkey]] (72 percent). But concern is also strong in European countries that have experienced terrorist attacks over the years, including Italy (73 percent), Spain (66 percent), France (54 percent), and in other countries around the world with such experiences—for instance Peru (70 percent) and Japan (59 percent).&lt;ref name="POGI"/&gt;

Despite September 11, though, Americans are only average in their level of concern, with 44 percent saying it is a very big problem and 38 percent saying it is a somewhat big problem. In fourteen countries a majority or plurality said terrorism was only a small problem or not a problem at all. These include most of the African countries polled, some Eastern European countries, as well as several Asian countries (including [[China]]).&lt;ref name="POGI"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">'''Ivan Donald Margary''' (1896–1976) was a historian who, during his lifetime, was the leading authority on [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads in Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.felbridge.org.uk/index.php?p=2_56&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote numerous works on Roman roads&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biab.ac.uk/people/25108&lt;/ref&gt; of which his most influential and complete was ''Roman Roads In Britain''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/Roman_roads_in_Britain.html?id=A0a1AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], Oxford.

Margary's primary gift to the study of Roman roads was the development of a catalogue system known as [[Margary numbers]], numbering Roman roads so that they could be referred to by catalogue number&lt;ref&gt;http://www.felbridge.org.uk/index.php?p=2_56&lt;/ref&gt; with no sign of confusion, and to allow cross-referencing of the same road between different studies and authors.

In later life he financed the excavation of [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]], near [[Chichester]] in [[West Sussex]] and building the ''Margary [[Quadrangle (architecture)|Quad]]'' at Exeter, his old college. He contributed to the [[National Trust]]'s excavation at [[Avebury|Avebury Stone Circle]] and to the archaeology department of the [[British School at Rome]]. His other interests included meteorology and agriculture.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite journal |title=Noted archaeologist. Mr I. D.

According to ''[[The Independent]]'':
"John Burrow was one of the leading intellectual historians of his generation.  His pioneering work marked the beginning of a more sophisticated approach to the history of the social sciences, one that did not treat the past as being of interest only in so far as it anticipated the present."&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

==Life==
Burrow was born in Southsea.  In 1954 after graduating from [[Exeter School]], he won a history scholarship to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], where he became a pupil of [[J.H. Plumb]] and obtained a First in both parts of the History Tripos.

Fellowships at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] and [[Downing College, Cambridge]] enabled Burrows to complete a doctorate within a new branch of history. It involved a study of the attractions of evolutionary theories, chiefly those of [[Herbert Spencer]], Sir [[Henry Maine]], and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], to 19th century social theorists.  He argued that they were a means of reconciling the disparate demands of romantic-historical and positivistic approaches to society. The result was his first book ''Evolution and Society'' (1966), which explores
the reasons why Victorian pioneers of social science were habitually approaching the study of other societies with largely positivistic and evolutionary methodologies, making anthropology into a search for affirmation of assumed laws and stages of progress rather than a quest to appreciate and understand other societies in terms of their own uniqueness and functionality.

Burrows was also an expert on [[Charles Darwin]] and the potent racial theories that [[Social Darwinism]] drew from biological versions of the theory of evolution.  His introduction to the [[Penguin Books]] edition of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' is still an authoritative contribution to the cultural history of Victorian science.

Despite his desire for a Cambridge appointment, Burrow's first appointment was as lecturer in European studies at the [[University of East Anglia]] from 1965–69, after which he moved in 1982 to the School of Social Sciences at the [[University of Sussex]], where he taught a cross-disciplinary course on the history and philosophy of the social sciences in collaboration with [[Stefan Collini]] and [[Donald Winch]], resulting in the collaborative book ''That Noble Science of Politics'' (1983), which extended the scope of the anti-teleological approach adopted in Burrow's first book.  He later made use of his unrivaled knowledge of the Whig and [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] component within English liberalism in his [[Carlyle Lectures]] at Oxford, the results appearing as ''Whigs and Liberals: Continuity and Change in English Political Thought'' (1988).

Sussex was the first university in Britain to offer an undergraduate degree in intellectual history, and Burrow became the first to occupy the chair in this branch of history created for him in 1981, the year in which his book ''A Liberal Descent: Victorian Historians and the English Past'',&lt;ref&gt;''A Liberal Descent: Victorian Historians and the English Past'' by J.W. Burrow, Cambridge  University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0 521 24079 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared and was awarded the [[Wolfson History Prize]].  To this elegant study of the monumental works of 
[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay]], [[William Stubbs]], [[Edward Augustus Freeman]] and [[James Anthony Froude]] he later added an incisive short book on [[Edward Gibbon]] (1985).

Burrow's 1981 book won the [[Wolfson History Prize]].  In that work he proposed that the 19th-century historians [[William Stubbs]], [[John Richard Green]], and [[Edward Augustus Freeman]] were historical scholars with little or no experience of public affairs, with views of the present which were romantically historicized, and who were drawn to history by an antiquarian passion for the past and by a patriotic and populist impulse to identify the nation and its institutions as the collective subject of English history, making 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the new historiography of early medieval times an extension, filling out and democratising, of older Whig notions of continuity. It was Stubbs who presented this most substantially; Green who made it popular and dramatic&amp;nbsp;... It is in Freeman&amp;nbsp;... of the three the most purely a narrative historian, that the strains are most apparent."{{Page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the same work Burrow remarked of another nineteenth-century historian, [[James Anthony Froude]], that he was a leading promoter of the imperialist excitement of the closing years of the century, but that in the mass of his work even empire took second place to religion.

In another chapter, under the title ''The German inheritance: a people and its institutions'', Burrow referred to the earlier historian [[Edward Gibbon]], who had been writing in the reign of the Hanoverian monarch [[George III of the United Kingdom]] at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Burrow mentioned that, in [[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]], Gibbon, as if affecting a superiority to patriotic prejudice and at the same time affirming its existence in his own time, had written that the [[Saxons]] were, for an Englishman, ''the barbarians from whom he derives his name, his laws and perhaps his origin.''&lt;ref&gt;Burrow cites ''Decline'' iv.386, and cf i.349.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image chosen for the front cover of ''A Liberal Descent'' was the sculpture of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in Saxon Dress executed by [[William Theed]] (1804–91) for the Royal Mausoleum at [[Frogmore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|60778|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert|William Theed}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book Burrow wrote of 'peremptory and legalistic [[constitutionalism]] changing into subtler political persuasiveness', and of 'the intersection of personal and public mythologies'.  The book's theme was the idea of a Whig interpretation of English history ('[[Whig history]]') incorporating the two fundamental notions of progress and continuity, the one making it possible to treat English history as a success story, the other endorsing a pragmatic, gradualist political style as the foundation of English freedom.  In studies of [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay]], [[William Stubbs]], [[Edward Augustus Freeman]] and [[James Anthony Froude]], Burrow attempted to place them in a cultural and historiographical context; and sought to establish the nature and limits of the self-confidence which the Victorians were able to derive from the national past, with reference to three great crises of English history: the [[Norman conquest of England]], the [[English Reformation]] and the '[[Glorious Revolution]]' of the 17th century.

The theme of the inscription on the plinth of the statue, alluding to the poet's lament for the passing of 'Sweet Auburn' [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Deserted Village]]'' may also be seen in connection with what Burrow mentions in the later book ''The Crisis of Reason: European Thought, 1848-1914'' (2000):
"'...the growth of great cities with mass population.... The great city and its teeming population was the dominant social image of the period: its excitement, its horrors, its threat to social order and decency... its dwarfing impersonality.  It was in the great city that the new democracy lurked, perhaps beyond the reach of civilizing influence.'

There could be added the influence of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] connected with the [[Great Exhibition]] and the [[South Kensington]] Museums, [[Imperial College]], and Albert Hall of '[[Albertopolis]]', although Albert's name is not among those in the index of Burrow's book.

In 1986 Burrows was elected a fellow of the British Academy.  In 1995-2000 he was a professor of European thought at the [[University of Oxford]] and a fellow [[Balliol College, Oxford]], becoming emeritus professor in 2000-2009; he officially retired in 2000.

''The Crisis of Reason: European Thought, 1848-1914'' (2000) covered 19th century European thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Richard Wagner]], and [[Oscar Wilde]].

Burrows' last major work (his magnum opus) ''A History of Histories'' (2007) covers the entire 2,500-year period from [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] to trends in late 20th century history, including [[Livy]], [[Tacitus]], [[Bede]], [[Jean Froissart]], [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]], [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay]], [[Jules Michelet]], [[William Hickling Prescott]], and [[Francis Parkman]].

In 1958 he married Diane Dunnington; they had one son, Lawrence, and one daughter, Francesca.

'''Jacob Barker''' (December 17, 1779 – December 26, 1871) was an [[Americans|American]] [[financier]] and [[lawyer]].&lt;ref name="JBObit1871"/&gt;

==Early life==
He was born on December 17, 1779 in [[Swan's Island, Maine|Swan Island]], [[Maine]], in 1779, of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] parentage.&lt;ref name="Barker1855"/&gt;  He was the son of Robert Barker (1723–1780) and Sarah ([[née]] Folger) Gardner (1739–1833), who was born on [[Nantucket]].  His mother was a widow of Hezekiah Gardner, with whom she had a son, [[Gideon Gardner]] (1759–1832), who served as a [[U.S. Representative]] from [[Massachusetts]].  His parents married at [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] in 1723.&lt;ref name="Barker1855"/&gt;

Barker was an extended relation of [[Benjamin Franklin]] through his mother, who was a cousin of Frankin's mother,&lt;ref name="JBObit1871"/&gt; [[Josiah Franklin|Abiah Folger Franklin]] (1667–1752), and grandfather [[Peter Folger (Nantucket settler)|Peter Folger]].&lt;ref name="Barker1855"/&gt;

==Career==
He went to [[New York City|New York]] at the age of 16, engaged in trade, and soon amassed a considerable fortune. In May 1811, he hired Connecticut native [[Fitz-Greene Halleck]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallock, John W. M. ''The American Byron: Homosexuality and the Fall of Fitz-Greene Halleck''. University of Wisconsin Press, 2000: 43. {{ISBN|0-299-16804-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who remained in his employ for twenty years. Early in the [[War of 1812]] he was instrumental in securing a loan of $5,000,000 for the [[Government of the United States|national government]].&lt;ref name="ABtribute1906"&gt;{{cite news|title=ABRAHAM BARKER.; Tribute to a Remarkable Man, the Son of a Remarkable Father.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02E1DC113EE733A25753C1A9629C946797D6CF&amp;legacy=true|accessdate=31 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 April 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1815, he founded the [[Exchange Bank of New York]]. He was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] in [[39th New York State Legislature|1816]], serving alongside [[Peter R. Livingston]] and [[Darius Crosby]] and representing the Southern District, which consisted of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]], [[Brooklyn|Kings]], [[Manhattan|New York]], [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]], [[Queens]], [[Staten Island|Richmond]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties.&lt;ref name="Hough1858"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hough|first1=Edward|title=The New York Civil List: Containing the names and origin of the civil divisions, and the names and dates of election or appointment of the principal state and county officers from the Revolution to the present time|date=1858|publisher=Weed, Parsons and Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3sFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, he became interested in many other large financial institutions in the city, including the [[New York Life and Fire Insurance Company|Life and Fire Insurance Company]], on the failure of which in 1826 he, with a number of others, was arrested on a charge of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to defraud. At first he acted as his own lawyer, however, eventually eminent attorneys [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)|Benjamin F. Butler]] and [[Thomas Addis Emmet]] (1764–1827) were counsels for his defense. The [[jury]] disagreed on the first trial and convicted Barker on the second trial; but an appeal was granted and the [[indictment]] was finally quashed.

===New Orleans===
He removed to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] in 1834, became prominent in financial circles, was admitted to the [[Bar association|bar]], and practiced with success in [[insurance]] cases. In the 1840s he collaborated with [[Rowland G. Hazard]] to secure the release of free [[African-Americans]] who were being illegally detained in Louisiana under the assumption they were escaped [[slavery|slave]]s.&lt;ref name=urilibraryexhibit&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/library/special_collections/exhibits/hazard/Rowland%20G%20Hazard.html Rowland Gibson Hazard, Rhode Island Manufacturer, Politician, and Philosopher], University of Rhode Island Library, Special Collections and University Archives, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was a majority stockholder in the first version of the [[St. Charles Hotel, New Orleans|St. Charles Hotel]].{{sfn|Barker|1855|p=223}} At the close of the [[American Civil War]] he was elected to the [[United States Senate]], but as [[Louisiana]] had not been readmitted to the Union, he was not allowed to take his seat. In 1867, he was declared [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], and in 1868, he was assaulted at his home in New Orleans.&lt;ref name="1868Assualt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Assault on Jacob Barker in New-Orleans.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E00E3DB1730EE34BC4953DFB3668383679FDE&amp;legacy=true|accessdate=31 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 May 1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker published ''[[American Civil War|The Rebellion:]] Its Consequences and the Congressional Committee, Denominated the Reconstruction Committee, with their Action'' (1866).&lt;ref name="Barker1855"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Jacob|title=Incidents in the Life of Jacob Barker, of New Orleans, Louisiana: With Historical Facts, His Financial Transactions with the Government and His Course on Important Political Questions, from 1800 to 1855|date=1855|location=Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B5CAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On August 27, 1801, Barker was married to Elizabeth Hazard (1783–1866). She was the daughter of Thomas Hazard Jr. (1758–1828), a descendant of [[Thomas Hazard]], one of the [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Founders of Newport|nine founding settlers]] of [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], and Anna ([[née]] Rodman) Hazard (1762–1845).&lt;ref name="Robinson1896"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Caroline Elizabeth|title=The Hazard Family of Rhode Island, 1635-1894: Being a Genealogy and History of the Descendants of Thomas Hazard ...|date=1896|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ips-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they were the parents of twelve children, including:&lt;ref name="Jones1886"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Charles Henry|title=Genealogy of the Rodman Family, 1620 to 1886|date=1886|publisher=Allen, Lane &amp; Scott|pages=71–72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJRPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His career was a very stormy one, the qualities of the man calling down upon him the envy and malice of inferior people with whom he was brought in contact. But as an example of rectitude and upright dealings, carried consistently through the most gigantic operations and disastrous losses, there is no brighter page in the merchant annals of our country than his business life.&lt;ref name="JBObit1871"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Descendants===
Through his son Abraham, he was the grandfather of [[Wharton Barker]] (1846–1921), the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] [[President of the United States|Presidential]] candidate in 1900.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5107">'''Jacob U. Egharevba''' (1893–1981) was a [[Bini people|Bini]] [[historian]] and traditional [[Tribal chief|chief]] whose writings specialized in the history of [[Benin Empire|Benin Kingdom]].{{sfn|Falola|Usuanlele|1994|p=304}} 

==Life==
===Early life===
Egharevba was born in [[Idanre]], Ondo State,{{sfn| ''Spear''|May 1968}} His father was related to Ohenmwen, Iyase of Benin and his mother, Okunzuwa was the granddaughter of Ogie Ezomo 1.{{sfn|Egharevba|1968|p=11}} His father was a trader but died in 1902.{{sfn|Egharevba|1968|p=14}} Egharevba spent part of his early childhood at the residence of his aunt in Idanre. His education was brief and irregular, he spent a year at St James' CMS School, Ibadan in 1899 and then an interval where he was out of school. He returned to studies at St David's School, [[Akure]] in 1911 before moving to St. Mathews, Benin. As a young boy, he worked part-time as a helper on canoes ferrying goods for sale between Benin Division and nearby cities.{{sfn|Egharevba|1968|p=15}} After finishing studies, Egharevba held a few low paying jobs. He worked as a water rate clerk in Benin{{sfn| ''Spear''|May 1968}} but left the job in 1917 to work for the Public Works Department. In 1922, he began trading goods in Benin and [[Sapele]]. During this period, he became close to the family of Oba [[Akenzua II]].{{sfn|Egharevba|1968|p=24}} His friendship with family allowed him access to senior informants who had knowledge of Benin's oral history.{{sfn|Falola|Usuanlele|1994|p=304}}

===Professional career===
In 1921, Egharevba wrote the draft of his first book, ''Ekhere vb Itan Edo'' later known as ''The Short History of Benin''.{{sfn|Egharevba|1968|p=29}} The book was published c.1933{{sfn|Falola|Usuanlele|1994|p=303}} by CMS Press and was very successful. His first four publications were in [[Edo language]] but he switched to English in 1934 due to its widespread use and the effect on commercial appeal.{{sfn|Falola|Usuanlele|1994|p=306}} He followed his first book with Benin Law and Custom published in 1934. Egharevba's knowledge of Benin history, laws and customs was used in Native Court cases where he served as consultant on Benin traditions. Apart from writing books, he contributed articles to newspapers and wrote petitions to the colonial government. In 1934, he started a printing press in Benin.

Egharevba was appointed the curator of the [[Benin City National Museum|Benin Museum]] in 1946. While working as a curator, he was also a prolific writer, having written 28 books by 1968.{{sfn| ''Spear''|May 1968}}  In 1973, 13 of his works were published in two volumes.

==Works==
Egharevba's most famous work is A Short History of Benin published in different editions, it has major differences in some paragraphs between the editions. His books which documented the [[oral history]] and culture of Benin{{sfn|Falola|Usuanlele|1994|p=316}} cut across different disciplines but the main content deals with issues, events, institutions, practices and personalities in Benin history.{{sfn|Falola|Usuanlele|1994|p=315}} A lot of his early writings from 1934 to 1948 dealt with documentation of oral history, folklore and customs to instill moral values in young people. Afterwards, he included commentaries about contemporary issues and personalities in Benin history in his writings.{{sfn|Falola|Usuanlele|1994|p=315}} However, some of the materials are repetitive, re-instating statements from his earlier works.

[[File:KillingNoMurder1.jpg|thumb|184px|Photo of the French edition of ''Killing No Murder'']]
'''''Killing No Murder''''' is a [[pamphlet]] published in 1657 during [[The Protectorate]] period of the English [[Interregnum]] era of English history.  The pamphlet of disputed authorship advocates the [[assassination]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  The publication was in high demand at the time of its distribution.  Cromwell was said to{{who|date=September 2014}} have been so disturbed after the publication of ''Killing No Murder'' that he never spent more than two nights in the same place and always took extreme precaution in planning his travel.

==Text from ''Killing No Murder''==
The first section of the text reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To his Highness, Oliver Cromwell.

To your Highness justly belongs the Honour of dying for the people, and it cannot choose but be unspeakable consolation to you in the last moments of your life to consider with how much benefit to the world you are like to leave it. 'Tis then only (my Lord) the titles you now usurp, will be truly yours; you will then be indeed the deliverer of your country, and free it from a bondage little inferior to that from which Moses delivered his. You will then be that true reformer which you would be thought. Religion shall be then restored, liberty asserted and Parliaments have those privileges they have fought for. We shall then hope that other laws will have place besides those of the sword, and that justice shall be otherwise defined than the will and pleasure of the strongest; and we shall then hope men will keep oaths again, and not have the necessity of being false and perfidious to preserve themselves, and be like their rulers. All this we hope from your Highness's happy expiration, who are the true father of your country; for while you live we can call nothing ours, and it is from your death that we hope for our inheritances. Let this consideration arm and fortify your Highness's mind against the fears of death and the terrors of your evil conscience, that the good you will do by your death will something balance the evils of your life."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Possible authors==
[[File:Edward Sexby - Tuer n'est pas assassiner.jpg|thumb|''Tuer n'est pas assassiner'', French edition in 1980 by [[Champ libre]]. [[Guy Debord]] wrote a short foreword for this edition.]]
''Killing No Murder'' was published under the pseudonym 'William Allen' but the authorship is largely attributed to one of three individuals or some combination of the three. The individuals generally attributed with authorship are (in order):  Colonel [[Silius Titus]], [[Edward Sexby]] or [[William Allen (English Republican)|William Allen]].

===Silius Titus===
[[Silius Titus|Colonel Titus]] was a politician and one of two individuals who claimed authorship of the work. Titus' claim could stand on its own merit due to the highly sarcastic nature of the document—a trait often attributed to Titus.  In response to claims that he often "made sport of the House" and didn't take matters seriously, Titus remarked that things were not to be taken seriously simply because they were dull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=43267 |title=Parishes: Bushey &amp;#124; British History Online |website=British-history.ac.uk |date=1904-01-05 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titus' tone can be seen throughout the document and on that alone, many attribute the work to him before he admitted to writing it.  Additionally, [[Charles II of England]] awarded Titus the title of [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]] for his service in authoring the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1660/05/07/index.php |title=Monday 7 May 1660 (Pepys' Diary) |website=Pepysdiary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofjohnmilton06massuoft |title=The life of John Milton : narrated in connexion with the political, ecclesiastical, and literary history of his time |website=Ia331314.us.archive.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edward Sexby===
[[Edward Sexby]] had returned to England to try where [[Miles Sindercombe]] had failed in exacting the call for assassination found in ''Killing No Murder''. After failing, he was caught trying to escape to [[Amsterdam]] and was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].  It was there that Sexby went insane and died a year later in 1658. Before his death, he was coerced by Sir [[John Barkstead]] to admit his participation in the writing of the pamphlet.

===William Allen===
While it was often assumed that the document was written under a pseudonym, another theory suggested that William Allen, a former [[New Model Army]] trooper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFEGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA229&amp;lpg=RA1-PA229&amp;dq=%22killing+no+murder%22+'william+allen'&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O_VBDHd54_&amp;sig=G7a_8GZI0kyXmFhgXgXfy9_QsBE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MUO_St3_PImj8Ab8tuGpAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=%22killing%20no%20murder%22%20'william%20allen'&amp;f=false |title=The last years of the Protectorate, 1656-1658 |author=Charles Harding Firth |page=229 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Republican who had ties with Edward Sexby and Thomas Sheppard, had penned the document. The trio (Allen, Sexby and Sheppard) had agitated Cromwell in the past by expressing their concerns about the Army's attitude toward Parliament.  It is possible that Allen, therefore, wrote the document brazenly himself before he died but is more likely named as the author as retribution from one of the other two authors.

{{nuclear weapons}}
This is a list of &lt;em&gt;estimated&lt;/em&gt; numbers of [[casualties]] should a [[nuclear weapon]] be detonated in a certain city or other population center.

==Method==
The effects of any [[nuclear explosion]] is dependent of a very large number of factors, including but not limited to [[List of nuclear weapons|type of nuclear device]], [[Nuclear delivery|delivery method]], explosion type (whether [[air burst]] or [[surface burst]]), the target's structural anatomy, and [[Weather|atmospheric conditions]]. To estimate the number of casualties in addition to this poses an even greater challenge.

A nuclear explosion may not hit a city directly. If distinguished, this list uses the estimate with the shortest distance.

Any nuclear attack will have consequences far beyond the [[Ground zero|area directly affected by the explosion]], and the people killed in the [[nuclear fireball]] and its [[Acute radiation syndrome|immediate radiation]]. Aside from the [[Nuclear politics|political]], [[Nuclear tactics|military and tactical]] considerations of nuclear attacks on civilians, additional effects include the subsequent [[nuclear fallout]] which spreads radioactive particles across large distances, the potential of [[nuclear winter]] and other nuclear-related [[climate change]], and the [[Chronic radiation syndrome|long-term effects of radioactive exposure on human health]], such as [[radiation-induced cancer]]. If distinguished, this list takes into account immediate deaths and short-term deaths, and not long-term health complications.

This list only includes estimates made from hypothetical nuclear scenarios and does not include death tolls from actual nuclear attacks. Nuclear weapons have only been used in combat twice throughout history, during [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]], which killed approximately 120,000 (±30,000) and 60,000 (±20,000) people, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of deaths after nuclear attacks were of especially high interest during the [[Cold War]].{{says who|date=November 2017}}

'''''Man Into Wolf; An Anthropological Interpretation of Sadism, Masochism and Lycanthropy''''' is a book by [[Robert Eisler]], published in 1948 . The text is based upon his readings in [[archeology]] and [[anthropology]]; anything not covered by these disciplines is then dealt with using [[Jungian]] methods of [[Dream analysis#Jung|dream analysis]] and the theory of [[Archetypes#Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. For instance, his remarks concerning the nature of life in [[prehistory]] are largely derived from his interpretations of the [[dream]]s of [[psychotherapy]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title= Man into Wolf: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sadism, Masochism, and Lycanthropy Paperback – April 1, 1978|url= https://www.amazon.com/Man-into-Wolf-Anthropological-Interpretation/dp/0915520060|isbn=978-0915520060|publisher= [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter==

Eisler begins with an investigation into [[sadism and masochism]] which concludes that people seek not pleasure so much as strong sensations. Whether one seeks strong pleasurable sensations, unpleasurable ones, or some combination thereof depends on which group of apes one is descended from.

He asserts that humanity [[evolution|evolved]] from two groups of [[apes]]: one peaceful, [[vegetarian]] and practicing [[free love]]; the other violent, [[Carnivores|carnivorous]] and given to fighting over [[sex partner]]s. Originally all were of the former group. However, Eisler argues that [[Ice Age]] food shortages caused some to imitate [[wolves]] and other beasts of prey, wearing animal skins and taking up [[hunting]]. He claims this is the historical basis of the [[werewolf]] [[legend]]s found in many cultures.

Eisler advocates a return to what he imagines was the harmonious life of the earliest primates and proposes the development of a new [[psychology]] and ultimately a new society, lest we are destroyed in a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] brought about by descendants of the wolf-men.

{{Missing information|the Municipal Year in Scotland and Ireland|date=January 2011}}
The '''municipal year''' is a period used by [[local government]] in the United Kingdom. The municipal year usually begins in May, following any local elections. It is not a fixed date so the number of days in any municipal year varies.

==History==
The municipal year has been in use as a concept since at least 1555,&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Carl|date=Autumn 1999|title=A Hearty Meal? The Prison Diets of Cranmer and Latimer|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=30|issue=3|page=653|issn=0361-0160|oclc=47076136|doi=10.2307/2544811}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used – very occasionally – by town councils in the United States, though much less so now.&lt;ref name="rhodeisland"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Municipal Ordinances, Rules, and Regulations Pertaining to Public Hygiene: Garbage and Refuse – Care and Disposal|date=1 July 1911|publisher=[[East Providence, Rhode Island|City of East Providence]]|location=[[East Providence, Rhode Island]], United States|chapter=SEC. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chase"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chase|first=Harvey|date=November 1906|title=Notes on Municipal Government Municipal Accounting in Boston and Louisville|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|publisher=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science]]|volume=28|pages=95–104|issn=0002-7162|oclc=50544474|doi=10.1177/000271620602800307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in some English council areas{{Where|date=July 2011}}, the beginning of a new municipal year took place in November{{why?|date=January 2011}}, and was a traditional time for celebration and [[Festivity#Seasonal festivals|festivities]]. In [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] in the 19th century, the election was known as ''Mayor-choosing day'', or ''clouting-out day'', and was – according to one contemporary source, "the very [[Saturnalia]] of play." Large-scale street games were played by children (imprisonment and subsequent rescue, or "clouting out", with knotted ropes, of young people was the source of the name), and the free distribution of [[apple]]s and [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny coins]] were also customs.&lt;ref name="burne"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burne|first=Charlotte|date=30 September 1914|title=Souling, Clementing, and Catterning.

==Function==

===England and Wales===
The start of the municipal year follows any local elections taking place that year, typically in May. Some councils have elections every four years whereas others have elections on three years out of four, with a third of seats contested at each election.

The [[Local Government Act 1972]] Section 99 requires that an annual meeting must take place between 8 and 21 days of the election of councillors, and outside of election years the annual meeting can take place on any day in March, April or May.&lt;ref name="1972 Act"&gt;Local Government Act 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 23 (1) requires that "the election of the chairman shall be the first business transacted at the annual meeting of a [[principal council]]". Vice-chairmen are also elected by the councillors. The chairman and vice-chairman of a borough in England, and a county borough in Wales, is known as mayor (spelt ''maer'' in Welsh) and deputy mayor (''dirprwy faer'' in Welsh). In councils with directly-elected mayor [[executive arrangements]], a chairman or civic mayor is elected by the councillors in the same way.&lt;ref name="1972 Act"/&gt;

During the rest of the year the council can hold as many meetings as are required.&lt;ref name="1972 Act"/&gt;

'''Nineveh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪ|n|ᵻ|v|ə}}; {{lang-akk|{{cuneiform|6|𒌷𒉌𒉡𒀀}} &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;URU&lt;/sup&gt;NI.NU.A&lt;/small&gt; Ninua}}; {{lang-syr|ܢܝܼܢܘܹܐ}}) was an ancient [[Assyria]]n city of [[Upper Mesopotamia]], located on the outskirts of [[Mosul]] in modern-day northern [[Iraq]].  It is located on the eastern bank of the [[Tigris]] River, and was the capital of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. Today it is a common name for the half of Mosul which lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris.

It was the largest city in the world for some fifty years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt T. Rosenberg|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|title=Largest Cities Through History|publisher=geography.about.com|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was [[Battle of Nineveh (612&amp;nbsp;BC)|sacked]] by a coalition of its former subject peoples, the [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. Its ruins are across the river from the modern-day major city of [[Mosul]], in the [[Ninawa Governorate]] of Iraq. The two main [[Tell (archaeology)|tells]], or mound-ruins, within the walls are ''Kouyunjik (Kuyuncuk)'', the Northern Palace, and Tell [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul#The Mosque of the Prophet Yunus (Jonah)|Nabī Yūnus]].

Large amounts of [[Assyrian sculpture]] and other artifacts have been excavated and are now located in museums around the world. The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) occupied the site during the mid-2010s, during which time they [[bulldozer|bulldozed]] several of the monuments there and caused considerable damage to the others. Iraqi forces recaptured the area in January 2017.

{{anchor|Etymology}}

== Name ==
The English placename Nineveh comes from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Ninive}}''&lt;!--not Nineve, per OED--&gt; and [[Septuagint]] [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''Nineuḗ'' ({{lang|grc|Νινευή}}) under influence of the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hebrew]] ''Nīnewēh'' ({{lang|he|נִינְוֶה}}),&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed. "Ninevite, ''n.'' and ''adj.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{lang|akk|Ninua}}'' ({{abbr|var.|variant}} ''Ninâ'')&lt;ref name=jenc&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14857.html |contribution=Nineveh |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica |publisher=Gale Group |date=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Akkadian language|Old Babylonian]] ''{{lang|akk|Ninuwā}}''.&lt;ref name=oed /&gt; The original meaning of the name is unclear but may have referred to a patron goddess. The [[cuneiform]] for ''Ninâ'' ({{cuneiform|[[wikt:𒀏|𒀏]]}}) is a fish within a house (cf. [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''nuna'', "fish"). This may have simply intended "Place of Fish" or may have indicated a goddess associated with fish or the Tigris, possibly originally of [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] origin.&lt;ref name=jenc /&gt; The city was later said to be devoted to "the goddess [[Ishtar]] of Nineveh" and ''Nina'' was one of the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] names of that goddess.&lt;ref name=jenc /&gt;

The city was also known as ''Ninii''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cooper |first=William Ricketts |contribution=Ninii |p=382 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYngNwdPZwAC&amp;pg=PA382 |title=An Archaic Dictionary: Biographical, Historical, and Mythological; from the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Etruscan Monuments and Papyri |location=London |publisher=Samuel Bagster &amp; Sons |date=1876 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Ni''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Rawlinson |first=George |title=Ancient Egypt, ''10th&amp;nbsp;ed., Ch.&amp;nbsp;XII'' |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15663/15663-h/15663-h.htm |location=London |publisher=T.

''Nabī Yūnus'' is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "Prophet [[Jonah]]". ''Kouyunjik'' was, according to [[Austen Henry Layard|Layard]], a Turkish name, and it was known as ''Armousheeah'' by the Arabs,&lt;ref&gt;Layard, 1849, p.xxi, "...called Kouyunjik by the Turks, and Armousheeah by the Arabs"&lt;/ref&gt; and is thought to have some connection with the [[Kara Koyunlu]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CP7fYghBFQC&amp;pg=PA1083 |p=1083 |contribution=Koyundjik |title=E.

== Geography ==
The remains of ancient Nineveh, the mound-ruins of Kouyunjik and [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul#The Mosque of the Prophet Yunus (Jonah)|Nabī Yūnus]], are located on a level part of the plain near the junction of the Tigris and the [[Khosr River]]s within an area of {{convert|750|ha}}&lt;ref name="mieroop"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mieroop|first=Marc van de|title=The Ancient Mesopotamian City|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191588457|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_YKlbIp9pYMC&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt; circumscribed by a {{convert|12|km|mi|1|adj=on}} brick rampart. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins overlaid in parts by new suburbs of the city of Mosul.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Turner, "Tell Nebi Yūnus: The ekal māšarti of Nineveh," ''Iraq'', vol. 32, no. 1, pp. 68–85, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineveh was an important junction for commercial routes crossing the Tigris on the great highway between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]], thus uniting the [[Ancient Near East|East]] and the West, it received wealth from many sources, so that it became one of the greatest of all the region's ancient cities,&lt;ref&gt;"Proud Nineveh" is an emblem of earthly pride in the Old Testament prophecies: "And He will stretch out His hand against the north And destroy Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness." ([[Zephaniah]] 2:13).&lt;/ref&gt; and the capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

== Early history ==
Nineveh was one of the oldest and greatest cities in antiquity. The area was settled as early as 6000&amp;nbsp;BC during the late [[Neolithic]]. The deep sounding at Nineveh uncovered layers now dated to early [[Hassuna culture]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/iraq05-044.html Kouyounjik / Nebi Yunis (ancient: Nineveh)] colostate.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

By 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, the area had become an important religious center for the Mesopotamian goddess [[Ishtar]]. The early city (and subsequent buildings) was constructed on a [[Fault (geology)|fault line]] and, consequently, suffered damage from a number of earthquakes. One such event destroyed the first temple of Ishtar, which was rebuilt in 2260&amp;nbsp;BC by the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] king [[Manishtushu]].

Texts from the [[Hellenistic]] period later offered an [[eponym]]ous [[Ninus]] as the founder of Nineveh, although there is no historical basis for this.

=== Ninevite 5 period ===
The regional influence of Nineveh became particularly pronounced during the archaeological period known as ''Ninevite 5'', or ''Ninevite V'' (2900–2600 BC). This period is defined primarily by the characteristic pottery that is found widely throughout northern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Archaeology"&gt;Ian Shaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zmvNogJO2ZgC&amp;pg=PA427 ''A Dictionary of Archaeology''.] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002 {{ISBN|0631235833}} p427&lt;/ref&gt; Also, for the northern Mesopotamian region, the ''Early Jezirah'' chronology has been developed by archaeologists. According to this regional chronology, 'Ninevite 5' is equivalent to the Early Jezirah I–II period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tellarbid.uw.edu.pl/research Polish-Syrian Expedition to Tell Arbid] 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninevite 5 was preceded by the Late [[Uruk]] period. Ninevite 5 pottery is roughly contemporary to the [[Early Transcaucasian culture]] ware, and the [[Jemdet Nasr]] ware.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Archaeology"/&gt; Iraqi ''Scarlet Ware'' culture also belongs to this period; this colourful painted pottery is somewhat similar to Jemdet Nasr ware. Scarlet Ware was first documented in the [[Diyala River]] basin in Iraq. Later, it was also found in the nearby [[Lake Hamrin|Hamrin Basin]], and in [[Luristan]].

=== Old Assyrian period ===
The historic Nineveh is mentioned in the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] during reign of [[Shamshi-Adad I]] in about 1800&amp;nbsp;BC as a centre of worship of [[Ishtar]], whose cult was responsible for the city's early importance. The goddess's statue was sent to Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] of Egypt in the 14th century BC, by orders of the king of [[Mitanni]]. The [[Assyria]]n city of Nineveh became one of Mitanni's vassals for half a century until the early 14th century BC, when the Assyrian king [[Ashur-uballit I]] reclaimed it in 1365&amp;nbsp;BC while overthrowing the Mitanni Empire and creating the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1050 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 10:11 attributes the founding of Nineveh to an [[Asshur]]: "Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh".&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a large body of evidence to show that Assyrian monarchs built extensively in Nineveh during the late 3rd and 2nd millenniums BC; it appears to have been originally an "Assyrian provincial town". Later monarchs whose inscriptions have appeared on the high city include the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] kings [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274–1245 BC) and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1114–1076 BC), both of whom were active builders in [[Assur]] (Ashur).

=== Neo-Assyrians ===
During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], particularly from the time of [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (ruled 883–859&amp;nbsp;BC) onward, there was considerable architectural expansion. Successive monarchs such as [[Tiglath-pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]], and [[Ashurbanipal]] kept in repair and founded new palaces, as well as temples to [[Sin (mythology)|Sîn]], [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[Nergal]], [[Shamash]], [[Ninurta]], [[Ishtar]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Nisroch]] and [[Nabu|Nabiu]].[[Image:Relief from Nineveh Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin.jpg|thumb|Refined low-relief section of a bull-hunt frieze from Nineveh, [[alabaster]], c. 695&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Pergamon Museum]]), Berlin.]]

==== Sennacherib's development of Nineveh ====
It was [[Sennacherib]] who made Nineveh a truly magnificent city (c. 700&amp;nbsp;BC). He laid out new streets and squares and built within it the South West Palace, or  "palace without a rival", the plan of which has been mostly recovered and has overall dimensions of about {{convert|503|x|242|m|ft|0}}. It comprised at least 80 rooms, many of which were lined with sculpture. A large number of [[Cuneiform|cuneiform tablets]] were found in the palace. The solid foundation was made out of limestone blocks and mud bricks; it was {{convert|22|m|ft|0}} tall. In total, the foundation is made of roughly {{convert|2680000|m3|yd3|0}} of brick (approximately 160&amp;nbsp;million bricks). The walls on top, made out of mud brick, were an additional {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} tall.

Some of the principal doorways were flanked by colossal stone ''[[lamassu]]'' door figures weighing up to {{convert|30000|kg|t|0}}; these were winged [[Mesopotamian lion]]s&lt;ref name="Ashrafian2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ashrafian |first=H. |year=2011 |title=An extinct Mesopotamian lion subspecies |journal=Veterinary Heritage |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bull]]s, with human heads. These were transported {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} from quarries at [[Balatai]], and they had to be lifted up {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} once they arrived at the site, presumably by a ramp. There are also {{convert|3000|m|ft|0}} of stone [[Assyrian palace reliefs]], that include pictorial records documenting every construction step including carving the statues and transporting them on a barge. One picture shows 44 men towing a colossal statue. The carving shows three men directing the operation while standing on the Colossus. Once the statues arrived at their destination, the final carving was done. Most of the statues weigh between {{convert|9000|and|27000|kg|lb|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World" edited by Chris Scarre 1999 (Thames and Hudson)&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone carvings in the walls include many battle scenes, impalings and scenes showing Sennacherib's men parading the spoils of war before him.  The inscriptions boasted of his conquests: he wrote of Babylon: "Its inhabitants, young and old, I did not spare, and with their corpses I filled the streets of the city." A full and characteristic [[Lachish relief|set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish]] in 701; it is the "finest" from the reign of [[Sennacherib]], and now in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian, ''Assyrian Sculpture'', pp. 56 (quoted), 65–71, 1998 (2nd edn.), The British Museum Press, {{ISBN|9780714121413}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote about a battle in [[Lachish]]: "And [[Hezekiah]] of Judah who had not submitted to my yoke...him I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city like a caged bird. Earthworks I threw up against him, and anyone coming out of his city gate I made pay for his crime. His cities which I had plundered I had cut off from his land."&lt;ref&gt;Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Mesopotamia: The Mighty Kings. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the total area of Nineveh comprised about {{convert|7|km2|acre|0}}, and fifteen great gates penetrated its walls. An elaborate system of eighteen canals brought water from the hills to Nineveh, and several sections of a magnificently constructed aqueduct erected by Sennacherib were discovered at [[Jerwan]], about {{convert|65|km|mi|0}} distant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip24.pdf Thorkild Jacobsen and Seton Lloyd, Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan, Oriental Institute Publication 24], [[University of Chicago Press]], 1935&lt;/ref&gt; The enclosed area had more than 100,000 inhabitants (maybe closer to 150,000), about twice as many as [[Babylon]] at the time, placing it among the largest settlements worldwide.

Some scholars believe that the garden which Sennacherib built next to his palace, with its associated irrigation works, comprised the original [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]], (2013) ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World Wonder traced,'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-966226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After Ashurbanipal ====
Nineveh's greatness was short-lived. In around 627&amp;nbsp;BC, after the death of its last great king [[Ashurbanipal]], the Neo-Assyrian empire began to unravel through a series of bitter civil wars between rival claimants for the throne, and in 616 BC Assyria was attacked by its own former vassals, the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]].  In about 616&amp;nbsp;BC [[Kalhu]] was sacked, the allied forces eventually reached Nineveh, besieging and sacking the city in 612&amp;nbsp;BC, following bitter house-to-house fighting, after which it was razed. Most of the people in the city who could not escape to the last Assyrian strongholds in the north and west were either massacred or deported out of the city and into the countryside where they founded new settlements. Many unburied skeletons were found by the archaeologists at the site. The Assyrian empire then came to an end by 605&amp;nbsp;BC, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its colonies between themselves.

Assyria, including the Nineveh region, continued to exist as a geo-political entity ([[Achaemenid Assyria]], [[Athura]], [[Assuristan]] etc.) under the rule of various empires until its dissolution in the mid-7th century AD.

Following the defeat in 612&amp;nbsp;BC, the site remained largely unoccupied for centuries and the ruins remained largely intact during Achaemenid rule, though the [[library of Ashurbanipal]] may still have been in use until around the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. The city is mentioned again in the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Battle of Nineveh]] in 627&amp;nbsp;AD, which was fought between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian Empire]] of Persia near the ancient city. From the [[Arab]] [[Islamic Conquest]] in 637 AD until the modern period, the city of Mosul on the opposite bank of the Tigris became the successor of ancient Nineveh.

== Biblical Nineveh ==
In the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], Nineveh is first mentioned in Genesis 10:11: "[[Ashur]] left that land, and built Nineveh". Some modern English translations interpret "Ashur" in the Hebrew of this verse as the country "Assyria" rather than a person, thus making [[Nimrod]], rather than Ashur, the founder of Nineveh. [[Sir Walter Raleigh]]'s notion that Nimrod built Nineveh, and the cities in Genesis 10:11-12, has also been refuted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The sacred and profane history of the world connected|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zV9AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA106|year=1858|author1=[[Samuel Shuckford]]|author2=[[James Talboys Wheeler]]|volume=Vol.1|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the fifteen [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] texts found amongst the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], has since shown that, according to the Jewish sects of Qumran, Genesis 10:11 affirms the apportionment of Nineveh to Ashur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/9.htm|title=Jubilees 9|website=www.pseudepigrapha.com|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VanderKam, "Jubilees, Book of" in L. H. Schiffman and J. C. VanderKam (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Oxford University Press (2000), Vol. I,  p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of Nineveh to Ashur is also supported by the [[Septuagint|Greek Septuagint]], [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Geneva Bible]], and by Historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] in his [[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquites of the Jews]] (Antiquities, i, vi, 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Septuagint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geneva Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1611 King James Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New King James Version}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=June 2018}}

Nineveh was the flourishing capital of the Assyrian Empire&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Kings|19:36|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the home of King [[Sennacherib]], King of Assyria, during the Biblical reign of King [[Hezekiah]] (יְחִזְקִיָּהוּ) and the lifetime of Judean prophet [[Isaiah]] (ישעיה). As recorded in Hebrew scripture, Nineveh was also the place where Sennacherib died at the hands of his two sons, who then fled to the vassal land of ''`rrt'' [[Urartu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Isa.|37:37–38|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book of the prophet [[Nahum]] is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against Nineveh. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Nahum|1:14|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse-nb||Nahum|3:19|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its end was strange, sudden, and tragic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Nahum|2:6–11|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bible, it was God's doing, His judgment on Assyria's pride ({{Bibleverse||Isaiah|10:5–19|NKJV}}). In fulfillment of prophecy, God made "an utter end of the place". It became a "desolation". The prophet [[Zephaniah]] also&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse-nb||Zephaniah|2:13–15|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. Nineveh is also the setting of the [[Book of Tobit]].

The [[Book of Jonah]], set in the days of the Assyrian empire, describes it&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:3|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse-nb||Jonah|4:11|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an "exceedingly great city of three days' journey in breadth", whose population at that time is given as "more than 120,000". The ruins of [[Kouyunjik]], [[Nimrud]], [[Karamles]] and [[Khorsabad]] form the four corners of an irregular quadrangle. The ruins of Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states He is showing mercy for the population who are ignorant of the difference between right and wrong ("who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1704.htm Mechon Mamre Hebrew Bible translation, Jonah 4]&lt;/ref&gt;) and mercy for the animals in the city.

Nineveh's repentance and salvation from evil can be found in the Jewish [[Tanakh]] (also read by Christians) and the Muslim [[Koran]].&lt;ref&gt;Also see these scriptural references: [[Gospel of Matthew]] ({{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|12:41|NKJV}}) and the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|11:32|NKJV}})&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches commemorate the three days Jonah spent inside the fish during the [[Fast of Nineveh]]. The Christians observing this holiday fast by refraining from food and drink. Churches encourage followers to refrain from meat, fish and dairy products.&lt;ref name=SycOrth&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Day Fast of Nineveh|url=http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/|publisher=Syrian Orthodox Church|accessdate=1 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025123007/http://syrianorthodoxchurch.org/news/2011/02/10/three-day-fast-of-nineveh/|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical history ==
Before the great archaeological excavations in the 19th century, there was almost no historical knowledge of the great Assyrian empire and of its magnificent capital. Other cities that had perished, such as [[Palmyra]], [[Persepolis]], and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh, no vestige seemed to remain, and the very place on which it had stood became only a matter of conjecture.

In the days of the Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Herodotus]], 400&amp;nbsp;BC, Nineveh had become a thing of the past; and when [[Xenophon]] (c. 430 – 354 BC) the historian passed the place in the ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Retreat of the Ten Thousand]]'' the very memory of its name had been lost. It was buried out of sight.&lt;ref&gt;Menko Vlaardingerbroek, The Founding of Nineveh and Babylon in Greek Historiography, Iraq, vol. 66, Nineveh. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assriologique Internationale, Part One, pp. 233–241, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''History of the World'' (written c. 1616) [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] erroneously asserted (attributing the information to [[Johannes Nauclerus]] c. 1425–1510) that Nineveh had originally had the name Campsor before Ninus supposedly rebuilt it. This was still regarded as correct information when news of Layard's discoveries (see below) reached the west.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Layard and Nineveh", ''Bentley's Miscellany'' Vol 29 (1851), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==

The location of Ninevah was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. [[Benjamin of Tudela]] visited it in 1170; [[Petachiah of Regensburg]] soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Liverani 2016, p. 23. "Toward 1170 the rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, who was traveling throughout the Near East passing from one Hebrew community to another, having arrived at Mosul (which he called 'Assur the Great') had a clear idea (thanks to information given to him by his local colleagues) that across the Tigris was the famous Ninevah, in ruins but covered with villages and farms [...] Ten years later another rabbi, Petachia of Ratisbon, also arriving at Mosul (which he called the 'New Ninevah') and crossing the river, visited 'Old Ninevah', which he described as desolate and 'overthrown like Sodom' with the land black like pitch, without a blade of grass. [...] Myths apart, the localization of Ninevah remained a matter of common knowledge and beyond argument; various western travelers (such as Jean Baptiste Tavernier in 1644, and then Bourguignon d'Anville in 1779) confirmed it, and some soundings followed."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carsten Niebuhr]] recorded its location during the 1761&amp;ndash;67 [[Danish Arabia expedition (1761–67)|Danish expedition]]. Niebuhr wrote afterwards that "I did not learn that I was at so remarkable a spot, till near the river. Then they showed me a village on a great hill, which they call Nunia, and a mosque, in which the prophet Jonah was buried. Another hill in this district is called Kalla Nunia, or the Castle of Nineveh. On that lies a village Koindsjug."&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, Edward Bouverie (1888), [https://archive.org/stream/minorprophetswit00puse#page/123/mode/1up/ ''The Minor Prophets, with a Commentary, Explanatory and Practical, and Introductions to the Several Books''], Volume II, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Excavation history ===

In 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, [[Paul-Émile Botta]], began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. The locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the mound of [[Khorsabad]], which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of [[Sargon II]], in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, though they had been damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.

In 1847 the young British diplomat [[Austen Henry Layard]] explored the ruins.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Layard, ''Nineveh and Its Remains'', John Murray, 1849&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Layard, ''Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon'', John Murray, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Layard, ''The Monuments of Nineveh; From Drawings Made on the Spot'', John Murray, 1849&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Layard, A second series of the monuments of Nineveh, John Murray, 1853&lt;/ref&gt; Layard did not use modern archaeological methods; his stated goal was "to obtain the largest possible number of well preserved objects of art at the least possible outlay of time and money."&lt;ref&gt;Liverani 2016, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Kuyunjik mound, Layard rediscovered in 1849 the lost palace of Sennacherib with its 71 rooms and colossal [[bas-relief]]s. He also unearthed the palace and famous [[library of Ashurbanipal]] with 22,000 cuneiform clay tablets. Most of Layard's material was sent to the [[British Museum]], but two large pieces were given to [[Lady Charlotte Guest]] and eventually found their way to the [[Metropolitan Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;John Malcolm Russell, ''From Nineveh to New York: The Strange Story of the Assyrian Reliefs in the Metropolitan Museum &amp; the Hidden Masterpiece at Canford School'', Yale University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-300-06459-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the archaeology of Nineveh reveals the wealth and glory of ancient Assyria under kings such as [[Esarhaddon]] (681–669&amp;nbsp;BC) and Ashurbanipal (669–626&amp;nbsp;BC).

The work of exploration was carried on by [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]], [[Hormuzd Rassam]] (a modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]), and others, and a vast treasury of specimens of Assyria was incrementally exhumed for European museums. Palace after palace was discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;George Smith, ''Assyrian Discoveries: An Account of Explorations and Discoveries on the Site of Nineveh, During 1873 and 1874'', S. Low-Marston-Searle and Rivington, 1876&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hormuzd Rassam and Robert William Rogers, ''Asshur and the Land of Nimrod'', Curts &amp; Jennings, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

The mound of Kouyunjik was excavated again by the archaeologists of the [[British Museum]], led by [[Leonard William King]], at the beginning of the 20th century. Their efforts concentrated on the site of the Temple of [[Nabu]], the god of writing, where another cuneiform library was supposed to exist. However, no such library was ever found: most likely, it had been destroyed by the activities of later residents.

The excavations started again in 1927, under the direction of Campbell Thompson, who had taken part in King's expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Campbell Thompson and R. W. Hutchinson, "The excavations on the temple of Nabu at Nineveh," ''Archaeologia'', vol. 79, pp. 103–148, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Campbell Thompson and R. W. Hutchinson, "The site of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Nineveh excavated in 1929–30," ''Liverpool Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology'', vol. 18, pp. 79–112, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Campbell Thompson and R. W. Hamilton, "The British Museum excavations on the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh 1930–31," ''Liverpool Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology'', vol. 19, pp. 55–116, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Campbell Thompson and M E L Mallowan, "The British Museum excavations at Nineveh 1931–32," ''Liverpool Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology'', vol. 20, pp. 71–186, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; Some works were carried out outside Kouyunjik, for instance on the mound of Nebi Yunus, which was the ancient arsenal of Nineveh, or along the outside walls. Here, near the northwestern corner of the walls, beyond the pavement of a later building, the archaeologists found almost 300 fragments of prisms recording the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, beside a prism of Esarhaddon which was almost perfect.

After the [[Second World War]], several excavations were carried out by Iraqi archaeologists. From 1951 to 1958 Mohammed Ali Mustafa worked the site.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Ali Mustafa, Sumer, vol. 10, pp. 110–11, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Ali Mustafa, Sumer, vol. 11, pp. 4, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; The work was continued from 1967 through 1971 by Tariq Madhloom.&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Madhloom, Excavations at Nineveh: A preliminary report, Sumer, vol. 23, pp. 76–79, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Madhloom, Excavations at Nineveh: The 1967–68 Campaign, Sumer, vol 24, pp. 45–51, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Madhloom, Excavations at Nineveh: The 1968–69 Campaign, Sumer, vol. 25, pp. 43–49, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Some additional excavation occurred by Manhal Jabur in 1980, and Manhal Jabur in 1987. For the most part, these digs focused on Nebi Yunus.

Most recently, British archaeologist and Assyriologist Professor [[David Stronach]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] conducted a series of surveys and digs at the site from 1987 to 1990, focusing his attentions on the several gates and the existent mudbrick walls, as well as the system that supplied water to the city in times of siege. The excavation reports are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/digsites/Mesopotamia/Nineveh_07/index.htm |title=Shelby White – Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications – Nineveh Publication Grant |access-date=2011-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722120816/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/digsites/Mesopotamia/Nineveh_07/index.htm |archive-date=2011-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological remains ===
[[File:Humvee down after isis attack.jpg|thumb|Humvee down after ISIS attack]]
Today, Nineveh's location is marked by two large mounds, Kouyunjik and ''Nabī Yūnus'' "Prophet [[Jonah]]", and the remains of the city walls (about {{convert|12|km|mi|0}} in circumference). The Neo-Assyrian levels of Kouyunjik have been extensively explored. The other mound, ''Nabī Yūnus'', has not been as extensively explored because there was an Arab Muslim shrine dedicated to that prophet on the site. On July 24, 2014, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] destroyed the shrine as part of a [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|campaign to destroy]] religious sanctuaries it deems "un-Islamic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/24/world/iraq-violence/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 |title=Officials: ISIS blows up Jonah's tomb in Iraq |publisher=CNN.com |date=2014-07-24 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruin mound of Kuyunjik rises about {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} above the surrounding plain of the ancient city. It is quite broad, measuring about {{convert|800|x|500|m|ft|0}}. Its upper layers have been extensively excavated, and several Neo-Assyrian palaces and temples have been found there. A deep sounding by Max Mallowan revealed evidence of habitation as early as the 6th millennium BC. Today, there is little evidence of these old excavations other than weathered pits and earth piles. In 1990, the only Assyrian remains visible were those of the entry court and the first few chambers of the Palace of Sennacherib. Since that time, the palace chambers have received significant damage by looters. Portions of relief sculptures that were in the palace chambers in 1990 were seen on the antiquities market by 1996. Photographs of the chambers made in 2003 show that many of the fine relief sculptures there have been reduced to piles of rubble.

[[File:Nineveh Nebi Yunus Excavation Bull-Man Head.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lamassu|Winged Bull]] excavated at Nebi Yunus by Iraqi archaeologists]]

Nebi Yunus is located about {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} south of Kuyunjik and is the secondary ruin mound at Nineveh. On the basis of texts of Sennacherib, the site has traditionally been identified as the "armory" of Nineveh, and a gate and pavements excavated by Iraqis in 1954 have been considered to be part of the "armory" complex. Excavations in 1990 revealed a monumental entryway consisting of a number of large inscribed [[Megalithic architectural elements#Orthostat|orthostats]] and "bull-man" sculptures, some apparently unfinished.

=== City wall and gates ===
[[File:Nineveh map city walls &amp; gates.JPG|thumb|Simplified plan of ancient Nineveh showing city wall and location of gateways.]]

The ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700&amp;nbsp;BC. About 12&amp;nbsp;km in length, the wall system consisted of an ashlar stone retaining wall about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} high surmounted by a mudbrick wall about {{convert|10|m|ft|0}} high and {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} thick. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every {{convert|18|m|ft|0}}. The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step [[merlon]]s.

Five of the gateways have been explored to some extent by archaeologists:
* Mashki Gate
Translated "Gate of the Watering Places", it was perhaps used to take livestock to water from the Tigris which currently flows about {{convert|1.5|km|mi|1}} to the west. It has been reconstructed in fortified mudbrick to the height of the top of the vaulted passageway. The Assyrian original may have been plastered and ornamented.
* Nergal Gate
Named for the god [[Nergal]], it may have been used for some ceremonial purpose, as it is the only known gate flanked by stone sculptures of winged bull-men (''[[lamassu]]''). The reconstruction is conjectural, as the gate was excavated by Layard in the mid-19th century and reconstructed in the mid-20th century.
* Adad Gate
[[File:Nineveh Adad gate exterior entrance far2.JPG|thumb|Photograph of the restored [[Adad]] Gate, taken prior to the gate's destruction by ISIL in April 2016&lt;ref name=Romey2016 /&gt;]]

Adad Gate was named for the god [[Adad]]. A reconstruction was begun in the 1960s by Iraqis but was not completed. The result was a mixture of concrete and eroding mudbrick, which nonetheless does give some idea of the original structure. The excavator left some features unexcavated, allowing a view of the original Assyrian construction. The original brickwork of the outer vaulted passageway was well exposed, as was the entrance of the vaulted stairway to the upper levels. The actions of Nineveh's last defenders could be seen in the hastily built mudbrick construction which narrowed the passageway from {{convert|4|to|2|m|ft|0}}. Around April 13, 2016, [[ISIL]] demolished both the gate and the adjacent wall by flattening them with a bulldozer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/08/29/iraqi-digital-investigation-team-confirms-isis-destruction-gate-nineveh/ |publisher=Bellingcat | title=Iraqi Digital Investigation Team Confirms ISIS Destruction of Gate in Nineveh|date=August 29, 2016|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Romey2016&gt;{{citation|last=Romey|first=Kristin|date=19 April 2016|title=Exclusive Photos Show Destruction of Nineveh Gates by ISIS|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160419-Islamic-State-ISIS-ISIL-Nineveh-gates-Iraq-Mosul-destroyed/|magazine=National Geographic|publisher=The National Geographical Society|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shamash Gate
[[File:Nineveh walls east Shamash Gate from rampart.JPG|thumb|Eastern city wall and [[Shamash]] Gate.]]

Named for the Sun god [[Shamash]], it opens to the road to [[Erbil]]. It was excavated by Layard in the 19th century. The stone retaining wall and part of the mudbrick structure were reconstructed in the 1960s. The mudbrick reconstruction has deteriorated significantly. The stone wall projects outward about {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} from the line of main wall for a width of about {{convert|70|m|ft|0}}. It is the only gate with such a significant projection. The mound of its remains towers above the surrounding terrain. Its size and design suggest it was the most important gate in Neo-Assyrian times.
* Halzi Gate
Near the south end of the eastern city wall. Exploratory excavations were undertaken here by the [[University of California]] expedition of 1989–1990. There is an outward projection of the city wall, though not as pronounced as at the Shamash Gate. The entry passage had been narrowed with mudbrick to about {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} as at the Adad Gate. Human remains from the final battle of Nineveh were found in the passageway.

== Threats to the site ==
The site of Nineveh is exposed to decay of its [[reliefs]] by a lack of proper protective roofing, vandalism and looting holes dug into chamber floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0611_030611_iraqlootingreport2.html

|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] News
|date=May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future preservation is further compromised by the site's proximity to expanding suburbs.

The ailing [[Mosul Dam]] is a persistent threat to Nineveh as well as the city of Mosul.  This is in no small part due to years of disrepair (in 2006, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] cited it as the most dangerous dam in the world), the cancellation of a second dam project in the 1980s to act as flood relief in case of failure, and occupation by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] in 2014 resulting in fleeing workers and stolen equipment.  If the dam fails, the entire site could be under as much as 45 feet (14&amp;nbsp;m) underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borger|first1=Julian|title=Mosul dam engineers warn it could fail at any time, killing 1m people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/mosul-dam-engineers-warn-it-could-fail-at-any-time-killing-1m-people|website=The Guardian|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2010 report titled ''[[Saving Our Vanishing Heritage]]'', [[Global Heritage Fund]] named Nineveh one of 12 sites most "on the verge" of irreparable destruction and loss, citing insufficient management, development pressures and looting as primary causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/ Globalheritagefund.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820022935/http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/ |date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By far, however, the greatest threat to Nineveh has been purposeful human actions by ISIL, which occupied that area in mid-2010s. In early 2015 they announced their [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|intention to destroy]] the walls of Nineveh if the Iraqis try to liberate the city. They also threatened to destroy artifacts. On February 26 they destroyed several items and statues in the [[Mosul Museum]] and are believed to have plundered others to sell overseas. The items were mostly from the Assyrian exhibit, which ISIL declared [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] and [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. There were 300 items in the museum out of a total of 1,900, with the other 1,600 being taken to the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in [[Baghdad]] for security reasons prior to the 2014 [[Fall of Mosul]].{{according to whom|date=June 2016}} Some of the artifacts sold and/or destroyed were from Nineveh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-isis-militants-pledge-to-destroy-remaining-archaeological-treasures-in-nimrud-10076133.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/2/26/isil-seen-in-new-video-destroying-7th-century-artifacts.html&lt;/ref&gt; Just a few days after the destruction of the museum pieces, they demolished remains at major UNESCO world heritage sites [[Khorsabad]], [[Nimrud]], and [[Hatra]].

[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of the [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] observe a fast called ''Ba'uta d-Ninwe'' (ܒܥܘܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘܐ) which means ''Nineveh's Prayer''. [[Copts]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] also maintain this fast.&lt;ref&gt;Warda, W, [http://christiansofiraq.com/BaootaFeb86.html Christians of Iraq: Ba-oota d' Ninevayee or the Fast of the Ninevites], re-accessed 11 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==

The English Romantic poet [[Edwin Atherstone]] wrote an epic ''[[The Fall of Nineveh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert F. Tucker, Epic. Britain's Heroic Muse 1790–1910, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2008, p. 256-261.&lt;/ref&gt; The work tells of an uprising against its king Sardanapalus of all the nations that were dominated by the [[Assyria]]n empire. He is a great criminal. He has had one hundred prisoners of war executed. After a long struggle the town is conquered by Median and Babylonian troops led by prince Arbaces and priest Belesis. The king sets his own palace on fire and dies inside together with all his concubines.
[[File:Fall of nineveh.jpg|thumb|240px|John Martin, The Fall of Nineveh]]
Atherstone's friend, the artist [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], created a painting of the same name inspired by the poem.  The English poet [[John Masefield]]'s well-known, fanciful 1903 poem ''[[Salt-Water Poems and Ballads#"Cargoes"|Cargoes]]'' mentions Nineveh in its first line. Nineveh is also mentioned in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 1897 poem ''[[Recessional (poem)|Recessional]]''.

The 1962 Italian [[peplum (film genre)|peplum]] movie, ''[[War Gods of Babylon]]'', is based on the sacking and fall of Nineveh by the combined rebel armies led by the Babylonians.

'''Saint Paisius of Hilendar''' or '''Paìsiy Hilendàrski''' ({{lang-bg|Свети Паисий Хилендарски}}) (1722–1773) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] clergyman and a key [[Bulgarian National Revival]] figure. He is most famous for being the author of ''[[Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya]]'', the second modern Bulgarian history after the work of [[Petar Bogdan Bakshev]] from 1667, "History of Bulgaria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.

Paisius was born in the [[Samokov]] eparchy of the time, probably in the town of [[Bansko]].&lt;ref&gt;"История на България", Издателство на Българската академия на науките, т. 5, София 1985, с. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JmFetR5Wqd8C&amp;pg=PA85 ''The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity''], John Anthony McGuckin, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, {{ISBN|1405185392}}, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; He established himself in the [[Hilandar]] monastery on [[Mount Athos]] in 1745, where he was later a [[hieromonk]] and [[deputy-abbot]]. Collecting materials for two years through hard work and even visiting the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], he finished his ''Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya'' in 1762 in the [[Zograf Monastery]]. The book was the first attempt to write a complete history of Bulgaria and attempted to awake and strengthen Bulgarian national consciousnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The most famous part of the whole book is the paragraph:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Oh, you unwise moron! Why are you ashamed to call yourself a Bulgarian and why don't you read and speak in your native language? Weren't Bulgarians powerful and glorious once? Didn't they take taxes from strong Romans and wise Greeks? Out of all the Slavic nations they were the bravest one. Our rulers were the first ones to call themselves kings, the first ones to have patriarchs, the first ones to baptise their people.(...) Why are you ashamed of your great history and your great language and why do you leave it to turn yourselves into Greeks? Why do you think they are any better than you? Well, here you're right because did you see a Greek leave his country and ancestry like you do?"&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This more or less signifies the purpose of the author who speaks about the danger of Bulgarians falling victim to the [[Hellenization]] policies of the mainly Greek clergy. These anti-Greek sentiments presented in Paisius  writing, characterized the [[Greeks]] as some kind of Bulgarian national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;The Formation of a Nationalist Bulgarian Intelligentsia, 1835-1878, Modern European history: a Garland series of outstanding dissertations, Thomas A.

Vol. 2, Richard C. Frucht, 	ABC-CLIO, 2004, {{ISBN|1576078000}}, pp. 821-822.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's first manual copy was done by [[Sophronius of Vratsa]] in 1765. Structurally, Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya consists of two introductions, several chapters that discuss various historic events, a chapter about the "Slavic teachers", the disciples of [[Cyril and Methodius]], a chapter about the Bulgarian saints, and an epilogue. As Paisius toured Bulgaria as a [[mendicant friar]], he brought his work, which was copied and spread among the Bulgarians. He is thought to have died on the way to Mount Athos near Ampelino (modern-day [[Asenovgrad]]).

Philately involves more than just [[stamp collecting]], which does not necessarily involve the study of stamps. It is possible to be a philatelist without owning any stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, R. Scott. ''The International Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Philately'', Iola WI: Krause Publications, 1997, p.196. {{ISBN|0-87341-448-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the stamps being studied may be very rare, or reside only in museums.

==Etymology==
The word "philately" is the English version of the French word "philatélie", coined by Georges Herpin in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Herpin, Georges. "Bapteme" in ''Le Collectionneur de Timbres-Postes'', Vol.I, 15 November 1864, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Herpin stated that stamps had been collected and studied for the previous six or seven years and a better name was required for the new hobby than ''timbromanie'', which was disliked.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;Williams, L.N. &amp; M. ''Fundamentals of Philately''. State College: The American Philatelic Society, 1971, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] root word φιλ(ο)- ''phil(o)-'', meaning "an attraction or affinity for something", and ἀτέλεια ''ateleia'', meaning "exempt from duties and taxes" to form "philatelie".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R.J. &amp; K.W. Anthony. ''The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia''. 6th edition. London: Stanley Paul, 1966, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of postage stamps meant that the receipt of letters was now free of charge, whereas before stamps it was normal for postal charges to be paid by the recipient of a letter.

The alternative terms "timbromania", "timbrophily" and "timbrology" gradually fell out of use as ''philately'' gained acceptance during the 1860s.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;

==Types==
Traditional philately is the study of the technical aspects of stamp production and stamp identification, including:
*The [[postage stamp design|stamp design]] process
*The paper used (wove, laid and including watermarks)
*The method of printing (engraving, typography)
*The [[Postage stamp gum|gum]]
*The method of [[Postage stamp separation|separation]] (perforation, rouletting)
*Any [[overprint]]s on the stamp
*Any security markings, [[underprint]]s or perforated initials ("[[perfins]]")
*The study of [[philatelic fakes and forgeries]]

==Diversification==
* [[Topical stamp collecting|Thematic philately]], also known as topical philately, is the study of what is depicted on the stamps. There are hundreds of popular subjects, such as birds on stamps, and ships, poets, presidents, monarchs, maps, aircraft, space craft, sports and insects on stamps. Interesting aspects of topical philately include design mistakes and alterations, for instance, the recent editing out of cigarettes from the pictures used for United States stamps, and the stories of how particular images came to be used.
* [[Postal history]] studies the postal systems and how they operate and, or, the study of postage stamps and covers and associated material illustrating historical episodes of postal systems both before and after the introduction of the adhesive stamps. It includes the study of [[postmark]]s, [[post office]]s, [[Postal Authorities|postal authorities]], postal rates and regulations and the process by which letters are moved from sender to recipient, including routes and choice of conveyance.  A classic example is the [[Pony Express]], which was the fastest way to send letters across the United States during the few months that it operated.  [[Cover (philately)|Covers]] that can be proven to have been sent by the Pony Express are highly prized by collectors.
* [[Aerophilately]] is the branch of [[postal history]] that specializes in the study of [[airmail]]. Philatelists have observed the development of mail transport by air from its beginning, and all aspects of airmail services have been extensively studied and documented by specialists.
* [[Postal stationery]] includes [[stamped envelope]]s, [[postal card]]s, [[letter sheet]]s, [[Aerogram|aérogramme]]s (air letter sheets) and [[Wrapper (philately)|wrappers]], most of which have an [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] or [[imprinted stamp]] or [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] indicating the prepayment of postage.
* [[Cinderella stamp|Cinderella philately]] is the study of objects that look like stamps, but are not postal stamps. Examples include [[Easter seals (philately)|Easter Seals]], [[Christmas Seal]]s, propaganda labels, and so forth.
* [[Philatelic literature]] documents the results of philatelic study and includes thousands of books and periodicals.
* [[Revenue stamp|Revenue philately]] is the study of stamps used to collect taxes or fees on such things as, legal documents, court fees, receipts, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, drugs and medicines, playing cards, hunting licenses and newspapers.
* [[Maximaphily]] is the study of Maximum Cards. Maximum Cards can be defined as a picture post card with postage stamp on the same theme and a cancellation, with a maximum concordance between all three.

==Tools==
Philately uses a number of tools, including [[stamp tongs]] (a specialized form of tweezers) to safely handle the stamps, a strong magnifying glass and a [[perforation gauge]] (odontometer) to measure the perforation gauge of the stamp.

The identification of [[watermark]]s is important and may be done with the naked eye by turning the stamp over or holding it up to the light. If this fails then ''watermark fluid'' may be used, which "wets" the stamp to reveal the mark.

Other common tools include [[stamp catalogue]]s, [[stamp stock book]]s and [[stamp hinge]]s.

==Organisations==
Philatelic organisations sprang up soon after people started collecting and studying stamps. They include local, national and international clubs and societies where collectors come together to share the various aspects of their hobby.

'''Ruin Island''' is a small island off the coast of the [[Inglefield Land]] region of northwest [[Greenland]].  In the 1930s, Danish archaeologist [[Erik Holtved]] discovered the remains of human habitation on the island.  The culture associated with this archaeological site became known as the Ruin Island phase of [[Thule Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia. Gibbon, Guy E. and Kenneth M. Ames. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
Vikings travelled to Ruin Island while hunting and trading with [[Inuit]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;Inuit-Norse contact in the Smith Sound region/Schledermann, P. McCullough, K.M.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest known inhabitants of Ruin Island are ancestors of the Inuit known as Thule culture, named after the nearby archeologic site of Thule.  These Thule culture inhabitants have been estimated to arrive at Ruin Island between 1280 and 1330.&lt;ref&gt;The Northern World: AD 900–1400.

'''''Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.''''' is a 1990 [[Superhero film|superhero]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Lloyd Kaufman]] and [[Michael Herz (producer)|Michael Herz]] and distributed by [[Troma Entertainment]].

==Synopsis==
The film follows Sergeant Detective Harry Griswold (Rick Gianasi), a clumsy [[N.Y.P.D.]] cop investigating a string of murders involving [[Kabuki]] actors. While attending an amateur Kabuki play, Harry witnesses thugs gun down the entire cast. In the ensuing gunfight, Harry is forcefully kissed by one of the dying actors, unknowingly becoming blessed with the powers of Kabuki. Before he knows it, Griswold finds out that he has the ability to transform into ''Kabukiman'', a colorfully dressed slapstick superhero who has the ability to fly and access to such unique weapons as heat seeking chopsticks and fatal sushi.

With the assistance of the beautiful Lotus (Susan Byun), he helps clean up the crime-ridden streets of New York and try to stop maniacal businessman Reginald Stuart (Bill Weeden) and his Goons, who plan to fulfill an ancient evil prophecy that will summon The Evil One whose demonic powers can enslave the world.

==Production==
While filming ''[[The Toxic Avenger Part II]]'' in Japan, where the original ''Toxic'' had been a major hit, Kaufman and Herz were approached by Tetsu Fujimura and [[Masaya Nakamura (Namco)|Masaya Nakamura]] of [[Namco]] to create a Kabuki-themed superhero film, supposedly based on an idea by Kaufman. Namco became a producer, giving Troma a one and a half million dollar budget to begin preproduction.

Creative differences troubled production from the start; both Namco and Herz wanted a mainstream-accessible film geared towards children, whereas Kaufman wanted the usual Troma-esque sex and violence style.  The film was eventually cut into both PG-13 and R-rated versions.&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/not-coming-soon-16-movies-released-after-long-stay-52080|title=Not coming soon: 16 movies released after long stays on the shelf|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=2011-02-21|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
''Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.'' premiered at the American Film Institute in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1990/08/05/troma/0e012b03-d585-4247-a7b2-361df3f87f5d/|title=Troma|last=Hubler|first=Eric|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1990-08-05|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Kaufman screened ''Kabukiman'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for several years, the film did not see theatrical distribution until 1996, when the PG-13 cut was exhibited.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "funny in a ''Mad Magazine''-manque sort of way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A05E6DB1039F931A15756C0A960958260|title=FILM REVIEW;A Superhero Lethal With Chopsticks|last=Holden|first=Stephen|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1996-05-22|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A positive review from ''[[The New York Post]]'' is prominently featured on the video package.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  The film was also reviewed by Siskel &amp; Ebert.  Despite giving it a thumbs down, Ebert compared it favorably to another independent film, ''[[Switchblade Sisters]]''.

== Legacy ==
Since the film's video debut in 1990, Sgt. Kabukiman has gone on to make several appearances in the "Tromaverse", becoming one of the company's most well-known mascots next to The Toxic Avenger. Kabukiman (played by Paul Krymse in a simpler costume) can be seen in a number of Troma commercials and video introductions throughout the 1990s. Most notably, Kabukiman was one of the prominent figures on ''[[Troma's Edge TV]]'', where he appeared in a short [[parody]] of old [[public service announcement]] films, entitled ''Sgt. Kabukiman Public Service Announcement'', which was directed by former Troma employee and current Hollywood director/screenwriter [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]].

Plans for a ''Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.'' animated series also went into the works, however the series never went to production. There had only been an animated teaser that was completed, it has since been made available as a bonus feature on the ''Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.'' DVD. The cartoon was to feature the Kabukiman character, and a number of Japanese themed super-heroes fighting crime in New York, with similar parallels to Troma's other animated spin-off, ''[[Toxic Crusaders]]''.

The character of Kabukiman made the return to the silver screen in 2001's ''[[Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV]]'', where he was once again played by Paul Kyrmse. In the film, Kabukiman has gone "from a serious superhero to a pathetic, drunken has-been who is looked upon with disdain by the citizens of Tromaville", states film critic Chris Gore. This change in character persona is attributed to fan backlash from the original film. Kabukiman is also portrayed as "Evil Kabukiman" in an alternate universe: a less wacky, more threatening villain.

Since 2000, there have been rumors that a sequel, ''Sgt. Kabukiman L.A.P.D.'', would be made, but as of 2010, there are no plans to revive the series.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  A sequel/spin-off called ''Sgt. Kabukiman and the Lesbians of Bonejack High'' started production in early 2006, but was ultimately never finished.

Kabukiman makes an appearance in the upcoming{{when|date=December 2014}} ''Return to the Class of Nuke 'Em High'' alongside the Toxic Avenger in a party scene as a tribute to his similar cameo in ''Tromeo &amp; Juliet'' from 1996.

Creator Lloyd Kaufman has revealed that Kabukiman will have a large role in the upcoming ''Toxic Twins: The Toxic Avenger V''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Kabukiman appeared in the "[[We Are All Made of Stars]]" music video by [[Moby]] in 2002 with The Toxic Avenger, signing an autograph for [[Leelee Sobieski]].

Most recently, in 2015 the character has returned to host a talk show for the TromaMovies YouTube Channel called "''Kabukiman's Cocktail Corner''" where he interviews and interacts with all kinds of performance artists including musicians (Unicorn Smack, The Cowmen, Circus Life) comedians (Dave Hill, Zac Amico, Brian Quinn), authors (Frank Casesse), tattoo artists (Paul Booth) and more. A first season has been completed and a 2nd series is in production. The character is played by Doug Sakmann, who was passed the Kabuki-mantle from Paul Kyrmse in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Troma Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

===The car flip===
''Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.'' is perhaps best known for its car chase scene that happens midway through the film where several carloads of gangsters chase Harry Griswold, wearing a clown costume, through the streets of Jersey City, which climaxes when one of the cars, a 1977–79 Ford Thunderbird strikes another vehicle, flips upside-down 30 feet in the air, lands, and then inexplicably explodes. Five years later, exactly the same footage was used in a scene in ''[[Tromeo and Juliet]]'' for not only being cost-effective, but also because ''Kabukiman'' had yet to be widely distributed on video (and thus brought some confusion as to which film the footage originated from).

Despite obvious continuity flaws, Troma has managed to fit the same footage into each of their films as a tongue-in-cheek homage, including ''[[Terror Firmer]]'', ''[[Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV]]'', ''[[Poultrygeist]]'', and ''[[Return to Nuke 'Em High Vol.1]]''. It also appeared at the end (along with a cameo by Lloyd Kaufman) of the 2011 Xbox Kinect video game ''[[The Gunstringer]]'' developed by Twisted Pixel games.

The '''sixpence''' ('''6d'''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|s|p|ən|s}}), sometimes known as a '''tanner''' or '''sixpenny bit''', is a coin that was worth one-fortieth of a [[pound sterling]], or six [[penny sterling|pence]]. It was first minted in the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and circulated until 1980. Following [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]] in 1971 it had a value of {{frac|2|1|2}} new pence. The coin was made from silver from its introduction in 1551 to 1947, and thereafter in [[cupronickel]].

Prior to [[Decimal Day]] in 1971 there were 240 pence in one pound sterling. Twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. Values less than a pound were usually written in shillings and pence, e.g. 42 old pence ({{frac|17|1|2}}p) would be three shillings and sixpence (3/6), often pronounced "three and six". Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence, e.g. eight pence would be 8d ('d' for [[denarius#Influence|denarius]]).

== History ==

The first sixpences were minted in 1551, during the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. They came about as a result of the debasement of silver coinage in the 1540s, in particular the silver [[Shilling (English coin)|testoon]], which fell in value from 12d to 6d.&lt;ref name="RMM Sixpence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/coins/british-coinage/old-denominations/sixpence/index.html|title=Sixpence|publisher=Royal Mint Museum|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debased testoon was likely useful in everyday transactions, and it was decided that new coinage should be introduced with the express denomination of six pence.&lt;ref name="Chard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24carat.co.uk/frame.php?url=sixpencesstory.html|title=The Story of the Sixpence|publisher=Chard|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The testoon decreased in value because, unlike today, the value of coins was determined by the market value of the metal they contained, and during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the purity of silver in coinage had fallen significantly.

Sixpences were minted during the reign of every British monarch after Edward VI, as well as during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], with a vast number of variations and alterations over the years. During the reign of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] a number of issues were designed by [[John Sigismund Tanner]], one time Chief Engraver of the [[Royal Mint]], and it has been suggested that this is the origin of the nickname "tanner", which was a popular name for the coin until decimalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seaby Coin &amp; Medal Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhwaAAAAIAAJ|year=1952|publisher=B.A. Seaby Ltd.|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation for the nickname is that it comes from [[Angloromani_language|Angloromani]] word ''tawno'' meaning ''small thing''.&lt;ref name="Chard"/&gt;

[[File:England Queen Elizabeth I sixpence 1593.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sixpence of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], struck in 1593 at the [[Tower of London|Tower]] [[Royal Mint|Mint]].]]
The Royal Mint undertook a [[Great Recoinage of 1816|massive recoinage programme in 1816]], with large quantities of gold and silver coin being minted. Previous issues of silver coinage had been irregular, and the previous issue, minted in 1787, did little to alleviate the chronic shortage of silver coinage in general circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Manville |first1= H. E. |last2=Gaspar |first2=P. P. |date=2004 |title=The 1787 Shilling - A Transtition in Minting Technique |url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/2004_BNJ_74_9.pdf |journal=British Numismatic Journal |volume=74 |issue= |pages=84–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New silver coinage was to be of .925 ([[Sterling silver|sterling]]) standard, with silver coins to be minted at 66 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] to the pound weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Kevin |last=Clancy |title=The recoinage and exchange of 1816-1817 |publisher=University of Leeds |year=1990 |url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/466/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, newly minted sixpences weighed 43.636 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] or 2.828 [[gram]]s.

The Royal Mint debased the silver coinage in 1920 from 92.5% silver to 50% silver. Sixpences of both alloys were minted that year.&lt;ref name="Groom2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Groom|title=The Identification of British 20th Century Silver Coin Varieties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd5nAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|date=10 July 2010|website=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-4457-5301-0|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debasement was done because of the rising price of silver around the world, and followed the global trend of elimination, or reduction in purity, of the silver in coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Numismatist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0NmAAAAMAAJ|year=1972|publisher=American Numismatic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minting of silver coinage of the pound sterling ceased completely in 1946 for similar reasons, exacerbated by the costs of the [[Second World War]]. New "silver" coinage was instead minted in [[cupronickel]], an alloy of copper and nickel containing no silver at all.&lt;ref name="Challis1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Edgar Challis|title=A New History of the Royal Mint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA583|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24026-0|pages=583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[John Wrottesley, 1st Baron Wrottesley|Lord Wrottesley's]] proposals in the 1820s, there were various attempts to decimalise the pound sterling over the next century and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bankers' Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meYzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA139|year=1855|publisher=Waterlow|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Revolution in Measurement - Western European Weights and Measures SInce the Age of Science |first1 = Ronald Edward |last1 = Zupko |series = Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society |volume  = 186 |year = 1990 |pages= 242–245 |isbn = 0-87169-186-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These attempts came to nothing significant until the 1960s when the need for a currency more suited to simple monetary calculations became pressing{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. The decision to decimalise was announced in 1966, with the pound to be divided into 100, rather than 240, pence.&lt;ref name="RM Decimalisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/discover/decimalisation/the-story-of-decimalisation|title=The Story of Decimalisation |publisher=Royal Mint |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decimal Day]] was set for 15 February 1971, and a whole range of new coins were introduced. Sixpences continued to be [[legal tender]] with a value of {{frac|2|1|2}} new pence until 30 June 1980.&lt;ref name="Challis1992b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Edgar Challis|title=A New History of the Royal Mint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA659|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24026-0|page=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:British sixpence 1787.png|thumb|right|250px|Obverse and reverse of the 1787 sixpence, depicting [[George III of Great Britain|George III]].]]
Sixpences issued during the reign of Edward VI feature a three-quarter portrait{{clarify|date=December 2014}} of the king on the obverse, with a [[Tudor rose]] to the left, and the denomination {{small|VI}} to the right. Surrounding the portrait is the inscription {{small|EDWARD VI D G AGL FRA Z HIB REX}}, or similar, meaning "''Edward VI, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland''".&lt;ref name="AMR Ed VI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amrcoins.com/coins-for-sale/HS-30082/|title=Edward VI (1547–1553) - Silver Sixpence|publisher=AMR Coins|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All sixpences minted under subsequent kings and queens bear a similar inscription on the obverse identifying the monarch (or Lord Protector during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]), with the portrait usually flipping left-facing to right-facing or vice versa between monarchs. The reverse features the escutcheon of the [[Royal Arms of England]], surrounded by the inscription {{small|POSVI DEVM ADIVTORE MEVM}}, or a variant, meaning "''I have made God my helper''".&lt;ref name="Chard"/&gt;

Starting with Elizabeth, the coins have the year of minting stamped on the reverse. Unusually, the sixpences minted in 1561 and 1562 were milled, i.e. produced by machine rather than by hand, with the press of the Frenchman [[Eloy Mestrelle]], who had been granted authority to mint coins by the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Borden |first1= D. G. |last2= Brown |first2= I. D.  |date=1983 |title=The Milled Coinage of Elizabeth I |url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1983_BNJ_53_9.pdf|journal=British Numismatic Journal |volume=53 |issue= |pages=108–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although of higher quality than hammered coins, Mestrelle's sixpences were more expensive to produce, and machine-struck coinage ceased to be minted in 1572. The coins remained in circulation for over a hundred years, but it took until the reign of [[Charles II of Great Britain|Charles II]] for milled coins of the pound sterling to be minted again.&lt;ref name="VicMus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/themes/3760/eloy-mestrelle-moneyer-1578|title=Eloy Mestrelle - Moneyer|publisher=Museum Victoria|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixpences minted after the [[Tudor period]] no longer bear the Tudor rose on the obverse.&lt;ref name="Moriesson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Moriesson|first1= Lieut.-Colonel H. W. |date=1907 |title=The Silver Coins of James I |url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1907_BNJ_4_10.pdf |journal=British Numismatic Journal |volume=4 |issue= |pages=165–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early sixpences of [[James VI and I|James I]] feature the alternative reverse inscription {{small|EXVRGAT DEVS DISSIPENTVR INIMICI}}, meaning "''Let God arise and His enemies be scattered''", becoming {{small|QVAE DEVS CONIVNXIT NEMO SEPARET}}, meaning "''What God hath put together let no man put asunder''" after 1604.&lt;ref name="Moriesson"/&gt; [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] sixpences follow the usual design, except that coins minted after 1630 do not bear a date, and the reverse inscription reads {{small|CHRISTO AVSPICE REGNO}}, meaning "''I reign under the auspices of Christ''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Borden |first1= D. G. |last2= Francis |first2= Grant R.  |date=1919 |title=Silver coins of the Tower Mint of Charles I Chapter IV |url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1919_BNJ_15_8.pdf|journal=British Numismatic Journal  |volume=15 |issue= |pages=79–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the beginning of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Protectorship there was no portrait minted on the obverse - instead there is a wreathed shield featuring [[St George's Cross]], surrounded by the inscription {{small|THE COMMONWEALTH OF ENGLAND}}. The reverse features the combined arms of England and Ireland, surrounded by the inscription {{small|GOD WITH VS}}. In 1656 the minting of milled coinage resumed, this time with the press of the Frenchman [[Peter Blondeau]]. The obverse of Cromwell's milled coinage features a portrait in the manner of a Roman emperor, surrounded by an inscription similar to those on the coins of earlier monarchs.&lt;ref name="Cromwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cromwellcoins.com/|title=Cromwell Coins - Commonwealth of England|publisher=Cromwell Coins|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a handful of early examples, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] sixpences continued to be machine-struck, and continued the usual practice of having a portrait of the monarch on the obverse. The reverse features a new design consisting of four shields arranged in a cross, with the inscription detailing the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of the monarch split across both sides of the coin. With minor changes, such as the device at the centre of the shields, and the designs between the shields, this basic design continued to be minted until the reign of [[George III of Great Britain|George III]].&lt;ref name="CotUK1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coins-of-the-uk.co.uk/pics/six1.html|title=Sixpence - 1551 - 1800|publisher=Coins of the UK|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those coins minted after the great recoinage of 1816 bear the royal coat of arms on the reverse, surrounded by the [[Order of the Garter|Garter]], which bears the words {{small|HONI SOIT QUY MAL Y PENSE}}, [[Middle French]] for "''Evil be to him who evil thinks''".&lt;ref name="Moriesson2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Moriesson|first1= Lieut.-Colonel H. W. |date=1918 |title=The centenary of our modern coinage instituted in February 1817, and the issues which preceded it in George III's reign |url=http://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1918_BNJ_14_11.pdf |journal=British Numismatic Journal|volume=14 |issue= |pages=121–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] sixpences are similar to those of his predecessor, but on some issues the Garter surrounding the shield is replaced by floral emblems representing England, Scotland and Ireland, with the inscription {{small|ANNO DATE}} (e.g. ANNO 1821) below.&lt;ref name="CotUK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coins-of-the-uk.co.uk/pics/six2.html|title=Sixpence|publisher=Coins of the UK|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British sixpence 1816.png|thumb|left|250px|1816 sixpence, showing the post-recoinage design.]]
[[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] sixpences have a simpler reverse, composed of the words {{small|SIX PENCE}} in the middle, with a crown above, the date below, and a wreath surrounding. With the exception of a withdrawn 1887 issue, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] and [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] sixpences share this reverse.&lt;ref name="CotUK"/&gt; The reverse of the 1887 issue is broadly the same as the post-1816 George III coins. This reverse is shared with the [[half-sovereign]], and since the two are of a similar size, a problem arose with people passing off sixpences as half-sovereigns. The government agreed to remove the coin from circulation in November 1887 and change the reverse.&lt;ref name="Erdinast-VulcanSimmons2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daphna Erdinast-Vulcan|author2=Allan Simmons|author3=John Henry Stape|title=Joseph Conrad: The Short Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPdhbJ3i3Z4C&amp;pg=PA18|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-0960-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] sixpences minted prior to 1926 feature an alternative reverse design composed of a crown surmounted by a lion, with those minted after 1926 featuring a design of six oak sprigs divided by six acorns.&lt;ref name="CotUK"/&gt; Only a handful of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] sixpences were ever minted, and none of these entered circulation. These feature a reverse that is different again, composed of six interlinked rings, with the inscription {{small|SIXPENCE}} below and part of the monarch's style inscribed above.&lt;ref name="RMM EdVIII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/index.asp?mwsQueryTemplate=%5B%7Bcontrol%3DcountryList%7D%7Bindex%3Dcountry%7D%7Brelation%3D*%3D*%7D%5D%5B%7Bcontrol%3DrulerList%7D%7Bindex%3Druler%7D%7Brelation%3D*%3D*%7D%5D%5B%7Bcontrol%3DdenominationList%7D%7Bindex%3Ddenomination%7D%7Brelation%3D*%3D*%7D%5D%5B%7Bcontrol%3DdateList%7D%7Bindex%3Ddate%7D%7Brelation%3D*%3D*%7D%5D&amp;countryList=United+Kingdom&amp;rulerList=Edward+VIII&amp;denominationList=sixpence&amp;dateList=&amp;page=resulta|title=Edward VIII Sixpence|publisher=Royal Mint Museum|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, the profile of Edward VIII on coins faces the same way as that of his predecessor.

[[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] sixpences feature two different reverses, both featuring a crowned [[Royal Cypher]]. Those minted prior to 1949 feature a more angular font than those minted later.&lt;ref name="CotUK"/&gt; These later coins do not bear the abbreviation {{small|IND IMP}}, since the king was no longer [[Emperor of India]]. The final change in the design of the sixpence came in 1953 when a new reverse was designed for the sixpences of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. These coins feature a floral design by Edgar Fuller and Cecil Thomas on the reverse, consisting of a rose, thistle, shamrock and leek, representing the four [[Home Nations]].&lt;ref name="RMM Sixpence"/&gt; In 2016 the Royal Mint began minting legal tender decimal sixpence coins in silver. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2446538|title=BY THE QUEEN A PROCLAMATION DETERMINING THE SPECIFICATIONS AND DESIGN FOR A NEW SIXPENCE COIN IN SILVER ELIZABETH R.|website=Thegazette.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new reverse was designed by John Bergdahl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/shop/u/ukgb16ss|title=Our Coins - The Royal Mint|website=Royalmint.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the supply of silver [[Threepence (British coin)|threepence]] coins slowly disappeared, [[Royal Mint]] sixpences replaced them as the coins traditionally put into [[Christmas pudding]]s.

In Britain, there is a well-known tradition{{cn|date=October 2018}} of the bride wearing "Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, and a silver sixpence in her shoe". A silver sixpence in the bride's shoe is a traditional good luck wedding gesture, and customarily it is the father of the bride who places the sixpence as a token of him wishing her prosperity, love and happiness in her marriage.

They are also used as a good luck charm by Royal Air Force aircrew who have them sewn behind their wings or brevets, a custom dating back to the [[Second World War]].

In ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (Act 4, Scene 2), we learn that by his absence (ensorcelled in Titania's bower) Bottom the Weaver will forgo sixpence a day for life from the Duke. In [[Elizabethan]] times, six pence was roughly a day's wage for rustic labour in the provinces. With it, one might buy two dinners, six performances of ''[[Hamlet]]'' among the groundlings at the [[Globe Theatre]], or an unbound copy of the play itself.

In ''[[David Copperfield]]'', [[Charles Dickens]] describes how its protagonist dealt with a street carman about taking his travel box to a coach office in London: "I told him mine, which was down that street there, and which I wanted him to take to the Dover coach office for sixpence", then he replying: "Done with you for a tanner!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickens|first1=Charles|title=David Copperfield|date=2000|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, Hertfordshire, UK|isbn=978-1-85326-024-7|page=155|chapter=XII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixpence also features in other works of popular culture and literature. It appears in the title of the British writer [[The Moon and Sixpence|Somerset Maughan's]] 1919 novel, ''The Moon and Sixpence,'' and appears in both the title and as a plot device in [[Michael Paraskos|Michael Paraskos's]] novel ''In Search of Sixpence.''&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, ''In Search of Sixpence'' (London: Friction Press, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half a Sixpence'' is the title of the 1963 [[West End theatre|West End]] stage musical, and the subsequent 1967 musical film version, of [[H.G. Wells|H.G. Wells']] novel ''Kipps.''
  
"I've Got Sixpence" a traditional song, runs:
:I've got sixpence. Jolly, jolly sixpence.
:I've got sixpence to last me all my life.
:I've got twopence to spend and twopence to lend
:And twopence to send home to my wife.&lt;ref&gt;This is based on story 57 of the [[Gesta Romanorum]], in which a carpenter explains that he needs eight pence every day: two to repay (to his father), two to lend (to his son), two to throw away (on his wife) and two to spend (on himself).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sixpence None the Richer]] (also known as Sixpence) is an American rock/pop band whose name was inspired by a passage from the book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]].

'''Symeon''' (or '''Simeon''') '''of Durham''' (died after 1129) was an [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English chronicler]] and a [[monk]] of [[Durham Priory]].

==Biography==
Symeon entered the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine]] monastery at [[Jarrow]] as a youth.  It moved to Durham in 1074, and he was professed in 1085 or 1086.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Simeon of Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When [[William of Saint-Calais]] returned from his Norman exile in 1091, Symeon was probably in his company.  Symeon eventually became [[precentor]] of the [[priory]], and examples of his handwriting appear to survive in several Durham books, including the ''[[Liber Vitae]]'', the so-called Cantor's Book (whose text he would have had to keep up to date as part of his duties as precentor), and in copies of his own historical works.&lt;ref&gt;Rollason, Introduction to ''Libellus de Exordio'', pp. xliv-l.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Symeon was author of two historical works which are particularly valuable for northern affairs, the ''Libellus de Exordio atque Procursu istius, hoc est Dunelmensis, Ecclesie'' (''The Little Book on the Origins and Progress of this Church, that is of Durham'') and a historical compilation ''Historia regum Anglorum et Dacorum''.  The ''[[Libellus de Exordio]]'', a history of the community of Durham (originally settled at [[Lindisfarne]]) from its inception to the year 1096, is by far his most important work.  Composed between 1104 and 1107, Symeon's task (imposed on him by his monastic superiors) was to demonstrate the continuity of Durham's history despite the notable disruptions the community weathered during the [[Viking invasions of england|Viking invasions]] and even more recently in the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].  Symeon sought furthermore to justify William of Saint-Calais's expulsion of Durham's clerical community in 1083, in order to replace it with a group of [[Benedictine]] monks drawn from Wearmouth and Jarrow.  Like earlier Durham writers, Symeon finds historical continuity between the major phases of the community's development in the constant presence of their patron, [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]].  The [[miracle]]s worked in Cuthbert's name during the late Anglo-Saxon period were particularly flamboyant, and the ''Libellus'' contains engaging accounts of some of these, including the miracle of the three waves (when Cuthbert turned a portion of the Irish Sea into blood in order to prevent his followers from taking his relics out of England, see ''Libellus'' ii.11), the foundation of Durham (when Cuthbert's body, being moved across England on a cart, refused to be moved, signalling his desire to remain at Durham, see ''Libellus'' iii.1), and several picturesque deaths visited upon the enemies of Cuthbert's devotees.

Several versions of the ''Libellus'' survive from the Middle Ages.  Symeon's own revised copy can be found in Durham, University Library, Cosin V.II.6.  It is this text which has been most often published.  The Durham manuscript also contains two anonymous continuations of Symeon's work. The first carries the history from 1096 to the death of [[Ranulf Flambard]] (1129); the second extends from 1133 to 1144. A Cambridge manuscript ([[Cambridge University Library]], Ff. i.27) contains a third continuation covering the years 1145-1154. Another [[manuscript]] (London, [[British Library]], [[Cotton Faustina]] A.V) seems to represent the text of the ''Libellus'' before the revisions found in the Durham manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Rollason, Introduction to ''Libellus de Exordio'', lxiii-lxv.&lt;/ref&gt;  A full list of manuscripts can be found on the ''[[Libellus de Exordio]]'' page.

About 1129 Symeon undertook to write a ''[[Historia regum Anglorum et Dacorum]]''. This begins at the point where the ''Ecclesiastical History'' of [[Bede]] ends. Up to 957 Simeon merely copies some old Durham annals, not otherwise preserved, which are of value for northern history; from that point to 1119 he copies [[John of Worcester]] with certain interpolations. The section dealing with the years 1119-1129 is, however, an independent and practically contemporaneous narrative. Symeon writes, for his time, with ease and perspicuity; but his chief merit is that of a diligent collector and [[copyist]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Simeon of Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symeon also wrote brief biographies of the [[archbishops of York]] and a letter on the errors of [[Origen]].  Other writings have been attributed to his pen, but on no good authority. They are printed in the ''Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores Decem'' of [[Roger Twysden]] (1652). The most complete modern edition is that of [[Thomas Arnold]] ([[Rolls series]], 2 vols., 1882–1885).  For the ''Libellus'', now see Rollason's 2000 edition.

The value of the ''Northumbrian Annals'', which Symeon used for the ''Historia regum'', has been discussed by John Hodgson-Hinde in the preface to his ''Symeonis Dunelmensis opera'', vol. i. pp. xiv. ff. (1868); by R. Pauli in ''Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte'', xii. pp.&amp;nbsp;137 sqq. (Göttingen, 1872); and by [[William Stubbs]] in the introduction to [[Roger of Hoveden]], vol. i. p. x. (“Rolls” series).&lt;ref name=eb /&gt;

[[File:Day 12 Occupy Wall Street September 28 2011 Shankbone 33.JPG|thumb|Protester on September 28, 2011]]

The following is a brief '''timeline of [[Occupy Wall Street]]''' (OWS), a protest which began on September 17, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Moynihan, Colin |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/wall-street-protest-begins-with-demonstrators-blocked/ |title=Wall Street Protest Begins, With Demonstrators Blocked |publisher= ''City Room'' (blog of ''[[The New York Times]]'') |date= September 17, 2011 |accessdate= October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Wall Street]], the [[Financial District, Manhattan|financial district]] of New York City and included the occupation of [[Zuccotti Park]], where protesters established a [[Occupy Wall Street#Zuccotti Park encampment|permanent encampment]]. The Occupy movement splintered after NYC Mayor Bloomberg had police raid the encampment in Zuccotti Park&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/17/occupy-wall-street-anniversary/2828197/&lt;/ref&gt; on November 15, 2011. The timeline here is limited to this particular protest during this approximate time-frame (ie., September 17 to November 15, 2011).

However, the chronology does encompass subsequent events if they are specific to both OWS and Zuccotti Park. After November 2011, various events and protests have continued at Zuccotti Park that claim to be associated with OWS. But permanent encampments, including extended protests and occupations of Zuccotti Park, are no longer permitted.

The original location for the protest was [[One Chase Manhattan Plaza]], with [[Bowling Green Park]] (the site of the "Charging Bull") and [[Zuccotti Park]] as alternate choices. Police discovered this before the protest began and fenced off two locations; but they left Zuccotti Park, the group's third choice, open.

Below is the timeline of events that followed the runoff [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|presidential election]] held in [[Ukraine]] on 21 November 2004 that sparked off the "[[Orange Revolution]]".

[[File:Kiev Independence Square Orange Revolution 22-11-2004.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Orange-clad supporters of [[Viktor Yushchenko]] gather in Independence Square in Kiev.]]

==21 November==

Shortly after the polling stations closed in the evening, several exit polls were released showing a substantial lead for [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. The first poll, conducted by several Ukrainian research organisations, gave Yuchshenko 54% of the vote, against [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s 43%. The results were based on the answers of 77% of 30,000 voters questioned at nearly 500 polling stations around the country. The second poll, conducted by Ukraine's Social Monitoring Centre, put Yushchenko ahead by 49.5% to 45.9%. These results were disputed by the Yanukovych campaign team, who quoted their own exit polls giving their candidate a 3% to 5% lead.

Tens of thousands of opposition supporters, including members of the [[Pora]] student movement, gathered in Independence Square in [[Kiev]] to see the results broadcast live on television.

==22 November==

At 02:00 the Central Election Commission (CEC) of Ukraine announced that after 33% of accounted votes [[Viktor Yanukovich]] was ahead with 50% to the 46% for [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. That data sharply deviated from the results of several groups of sociologists who in the instant after the end of the voting declared Yushchenko's victory. [[Yushchenko]] travelled to CEC to meet with [[Serhiy Kivalov]]. After a meeting behind closed doors Yushchenko announced: "We do not trust the accountability of the Central Election Commission. We call on our supporters to come on to [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Maidan]] of Independence and protect their freedom."

The same night in [[Kiev]] armoured vehicles arrived. [[BTR (vehicle)|BTR]]s appeared next to the building of CEC. Under the reinforced security was taken the building complex of the [[Secretariat of the President of Ukraine|presidential administration]]. The order in the capital was carried out by several ten thousands of military personnel of the Internal Affairs and [[spetsnaz]].

Ukraine's CEC announced that with 99% of the vote counted, Yanukovych had 49.4% of the vote while Yushchenko had 46.7%. This was rejected by the opposition, with Yushchenko calling on supporters to protest "the total falsification of the vote." The rally in Kiev grew in size while large demonstrations were also held elsewhere in Ukraine. Some of the demonstrators set up tents in Kiev's [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]]. Later that night, Yushchenko told supporters to stay in the square overnight to keep the tent encampment safe from security forces who wanted to dismantle it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have received information that authorities want to destroy our tent city at 3 a.m. ... At two o'clock there should be more of us than now. We must defend every chestnut tree{{#tag:ref|A [[Aesculus hippocastanum|chestnut tree]] is one of the symbols of the city of [[Kiev]]. In 1957 it was part of the [[Coat of arms of Kiev]].|group=nb}}, every tent. We must show to the authorities we are here for a long time... There must be more and more of us here every hour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

City councils of four major cities in Western Ukraine, including [[L'viv]] and [[Ivano-Frankivs'k]], refused to recognize the official results and declared that Yushchenko had won the election. The chairman of the Russian [[State Duma]], [[Boris Gryzlov]], acting as the observer, estimated the declared results as final and congratulated [[Viktor Yanukovich]] on his victory, following which   [[Vladimir Putin]] did the same.

Despite the cold weather and fear caused by the relocation of the military vehicles and the special operations personnel, the supporters of Yushchenko gathered around 100-150 thousands of followers. All of the leaders of the ''opposition'' came to the meeting, including [[Viktor Yushchenko]], [[Yulia Timoshenko]], the leader of the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] [[Oleksandr Moroz]], the head of the [[Party of industrialists and entrepreneurs]] [[Anatoliy Kinakh]].

Yushchenko called the Ukrainians to the organized resistance movement. Timoshenko called for the start of mass strikes in industries and higher level educational institutions, as well as for the closure of all the roads, airports, and railways.

The Yushchenko administration requested for an extraordinary seating of the Rada, the annulation of the election in the [[Donetsk oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk oblast]]s where no observers or journalists were allowed after the closing of the electoral districts.

Numerous tent-cities of the [[Pora!]] organization were installed on the  [[Khreschatyk]] and on the streets and squares adjacent to it.

The chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] [[Richard Lugar]] declared: "Now it became apparent that the aggressive and powerful plan of falsification and infringement at the day of election was conducted whether under the coordination or cooperation with the government." The chairman of the [[Committee on Foreign Affairs (EU)|foreign affairs committee]] of the [[European Parliament]] [[Elmar Brok]] threatens Ukraine with [[financial sanctions]] if the information about the falsification will be confirmed. The Russian ambassador in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Yuri Ushakov]], was invited for a discussion with the assistant of the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[A. Elizabeth Jones]] who expresses concerns of rushing when the [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Vladimir Putin]] congratulated [[Viktor Yanukovich]].

==23 November==

Approximately 100,000 Yushchenko supporters gathered in Kiev awaiting a session of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], Ukraine's parliament, in the hope that it would discuss the accusations of fraud and come to a solution. Thousands of people travelled to the capital from across Ukraine, though their journeys were disrupted by government closures of major roads and airports. Similar gatherings of protesters took place in other major cities, especially L'viv.

In a session of parliament boycotted by supporters of Yanukovych, Yushchenko took the presidential oath although the parliament lacked the [[quorum]] to do this legally. The oath-swearing was thus of purely symbolic value.

==24 November==

Rumours circulated that Yanukovych and Yushchenko had agreed to hold talks to negotiate over the disputed election results; this was later denied, with the government opposition refusing to meet Yanukovych. Protests continued into a third day in Kiev after an appeal by Yushchenko for their continuation. More supporters of both sides arrived at the city from outlying areas of the country. Riot police were called to protect the election commission building.

Yushchenko urged his supporters to engage in a series of nationwide [[general strike]]s &amp;ndash; an "[[Orange Revolution]]", after his campaign color &amp;ndash; with the intent of crippling the government and forcing Yanukovych to concede defeat. Hundreds of tents were erected in Kiev's Independence Square and the nearby Lenin Library was taken over to serve as the protesters' headquarters. The protesters also blockaded the [[Council of Ministers of Ukraine|Council of Ministers]] in Kiev, paralysing the government.

==25 November==

The [[Judicial system of Ukraine|Ukrainian Supreme Court]] ordered the Central Election Commission not to publish the election results until the opposition's charges of electoral fraud had been addressed. This was seen as a major victory for the opposition, as it effectively suspended official recognition of the results.

==26 November==

[[Round table]] talks organized by the out-going President [[Leonid Kuchma]] began between Yanukovych and Yushchenko. At Kuchma's request high-level foreign mediators also took part in the talks. These were: Polish President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], [[Lithuania]]n President [[Valdas Adamkus]], Russian [[Duma]] Speaker [[Boris Gryzlov]], [[European Union]]'s foreign policy chief [[Javier Solana]] and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] Secretary General [[Ján Kubiš]]. Speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]], was also present at the round table. [http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=285916 (ABC News)]

Television coverage of the opposition rallies, which had hitherto been patchy, was now greatly increased and opposition statements were widely reported for the first time. However, local television stations in Yanukovych's heartland of eastern Ukraine continued to toe the government line by not screening images of the demonstrations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==27 November==

After failing to reach an agreement with Yanukovych, Yushchenko announced that he would only agree to further negotiations if they would be on the subject of holding another vote. [http://washingtontimes.com/world/20041126-114341-1705r.htm (Washington Times)]

On the same day the Ukrainian parliament, the [[Verkhovna Rada]], declared the poll results invalid, and also passed a vote of no confidence in Ukraine's Central Election Commission. The declaration was, however, not binding and did not overturn the need for the Supreme Court to issue a ruling. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4047421.stm (BBC)]

==28 November==

The issue of [[separatism]] was raised when governors of eastern and southern regions met with Yanukovych and Moscow Mayor [[Yuriy Luzhkov]] in [[Syeverodonetsk]], [[Luhans'ka oblast'|Luhansk region]], to discuss autonomy or a separate republic for the Russian-speaking parts of Ukraine. [[Borys Kolesnikov]], president of the [[Donets'ka oblast'|Donetsk region]] council, suggested turning Ukraine into a [[federation]] and creating a new [[South-East Ukrainian Autonomous Republic]] with its capital in [[Kharkiv]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/world/detail/21936/ Yushchenko and Yanukovych aides to return to table as momentum builds for revote], [[Kyiv Post]] (28 November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/world/detail/21946/ Supreme Court considers Ukraine election appeal, eastern region sets referendum on autonomy], [[Kyiv Post]] (29 November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Yushchenko criticized these ideas as anti-constitutional, and observers suggested that Yanukovych's apparent support for separatism had damaged the standing of the government side.

Over 10,000 IM (Internal Ministry) troops mobilized to put down the protests in Independence Square in Kiev according to their commander Lt. Gen. Sergei Popkov. The [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] (Ukrainian Security Service, successor to KGB) warned opposition leaders of the crackdown. Oleksandev Galaka, head of GRU (military intelligence) made calls to "prevent bloodshed". Col. Gen. Ihor P. Smesko (SBU chief) and Maj. Gen. Vitaly Romanchenko (military counter-intelligence chief) both warned Popkov to pull back his troops, which he did.

==29 November and 30 November ==

Talks were held between the government and opposition but ended inconclusively, with Yushchenko reportedly refusing an offer from Yanukovych of the post of prime minister if the opposition accepted Yanukovych as president. Yanukovych's alternative suggestion was a fresh election with neither himself nor Yushchenko as candidates; this was also rejected. The outgoing president Leonid Kuchma announced that he would support holding an entirely new presidential election, not just a re-run of the disputed second round.

On November 29, Yanukovych's [[campaign manager]], [[Serhiy Tyhypko]], announced his resignation from both his position in the Yanukovych campaign and his position as the head of the National Bank of Ukraine. Asked by [[Channel 5 TV]] on whether he would possibly run for president if repeat elections went forward, Tyhypko replied positively. Yanukovych reacted angrily to Tyhypko's move, calling him a "mischievous cat".

At the same time, the opposition seemed to suffer a setback as the Ukrainian parliament initially failed to pass a [[motion of no confidence]] in the Yanukovych government.

==1 December==

The Ukrainian parliament passed a [[motion of no confidence]] in the Yanukovych government with 229 votes in favour and voted to create a "government of national trust." The vote urges President Leonid Kuchma to dismiss Yanukovych and appoint a caretaker prime minister, who would probably be parliamentary speaker [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]]. Kuchma has the option of rejecting the vote but the parliament can override his veto with a new vote that would need to attract a two-thirds majority (301 of the 450 deputies). Although he has not commented publicly on the vote, his aides have reportedly rejected it.

On the same day, the round table talks were resumed. As a gesture of goodwill, Yushchenko agreed to tell his supporters to cease their blockade of official buildings in Kiev so that government work could resume.

Yanukovych's camp submitted a complaint to the Ukrainian Supreme Court protesting alleged irregularities in Yushchenko-supporting regions of Ukraine and Kiev. With both camps now complaining that the election results were falsified and appealing for an annulment, the likelihood of the Supreme Court declaring the results invalid was seen to have increased significantly.

==2 December==

Presidents Kuchma and Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] met in Moscow to discuss the ongoing crisis. The two presidents issued a statement calling for an entirely new election&amp;mdash;not just a re-run of the disputed second round. This proposal was rejected by Yushchenko's camp, as it would allow Kuchma to stay in power for several more months and could break the momentum of the opposition. Yushchenko declared that he would hold out for an immediate re-run.

President George W. Bush also issued a statement, saying that any new poll should be open, fair and free of foreign influence, and that the will of the Ukrainian people must be known and heard.

Fears were expressed about the damage the crisis could cause to Ukraine's economy. The national currency, the [[hryvnia]], continued to fall against other currencies and the Ukrainian Central Bank imposed a limit on cash withdrawals on all banks to guard against a run on the currency developing.

==3 December==

After five days of deliberations, Ukraine's Supreme Court declared the results of the run-off election to be invalid. The court's chairman, [[Anatoly Yarema]], ordered that a repeat vote should take place within three weeks counting from December 5 (i.e., no later than 26 December).

This would be a re-run of the run-off vote only, rather than the wholly new election in three months' time which President Kuchma and Putin had supported. The Yushchenko camp attacked in court the validity of the second round only, and therefore the Supreme Court could only annul the results of the second round. For the first round to be also annulled and repeated (as the Kuchma/Yanukovych camp desired), further evidence would have had to be brought in that would challenge the validity of the first vote. Neither side, however, chose to do that. Both sides committed themselves to abiding by the court's decision, which they regarded as final.

Meanwhile, the Parliament voted to ask outgoing President Leonid Kuchma to withdraw [[Multinational force in Iraq#1000 - 5000 soldiers|the country's 1,600 troops]] from [[Iraq]]. The proposal was suggested by the Communist group, and passed by 257 out of the 450-member parliament. Both presidential candidates had previously supported a Ukrainian withdrawal.

==4 December==

As Yushchenko supporters have received what they wanted from Ukraine's Supreme Court, protests calmed down in Kiev although supporters of the Orange Revolution remain in Independence Square.

On this day the Ukrainian parliament failed to adopt election law changes that were requested by the Yushchenko faction. Kuchma accused him of reneging on agreements made on an earlier date. The [[Socialist Party of Ukraine|Socialist]] and the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist]] Parties had agreed to vote in favour of the electoral changes if the opposition in turn supported constitutional changes meant to lessen the power of the President in favour of the Prime Minister and the Parliament. However that agreement fell through when Yushchenko said that constitutional changes would be considered only after the elections.

==5 December==

In an interview on [[BBC]] television Yushchenko asked for the international community not to interfere in the new election, although he welcomed foreign observers.

Yushchenko's most prominent ally, the politician and businesswoman [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], stated that she would like to be appointed prime minister if Yushchenko wins.

In his first interview since the Supreme Court ruling, President Kuchma pledged to abide by its decision and ruled out any repressive measures, such as the use of force or the introduction of a state of emergency. He also said that he was prepared to reform the 15-member Central Election Commission, which had been strongly criticised for apparently colluding in the fixing of the run-off vote. However, he refused to meet demands to sack Yanukovych, potentially setting up a fresh confrontation with the Ukrainian parliament, which had earlier passed a motion of no confidence in the government.

==6 December==

Speaking in [[Turkey]], Russia's President Putin strongly warned against foreign interference in Ukraine's new election, accusing Western countries of trying to impose their definition of democracy on Ukraine.

Yushchenko continued to campaign for amendments to the election laws that would ban voting by absentee ballots and voting in people's homes, both of which were seen as being among the most abused election provisions in the first two votes. He also rejected proposals by Kuchma that the powers of the president should be diluted and partially given to the parliament, in which pro-Yanukovych forces are still powerful.

==7 December - 8 December==

After several days of heated debate, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) agreed reform measures to change the electoral laws and institute changes to the governance of Ukraine. Key elements of the reforms include:

* Changes to the Central Election Commission and dismissal of some of its members;
* Tighter rules on absentee ballots and home voting to reduce the possibility of ballot fraud;
* Reduced presidential powers, with the president confined to appointing only the prime minister, defence and foreign ministers, subject to the approval of parliament;
* Greater powers for the regions, to reduce tensions between the west and east of the country.

The reform package received the approval of 402 of the 450 parliamentary deputies (with 21 votes against and 19 abstentions) and was immediately signed into law by President Kuchma. In response, the opposition agreed to end the blockade of government buildings from 1900 (local time) on December 8.

The reforms shift the balance of power within Ukraine, moving from the strong presidential system to a parliamentary system. The outcome is seen as a compromise between the rival camps, as the new election rules will improve Yushchenko's chances of victory but the constitutional changes will enable the Kuchma/Yanukovych camp to exercise influence through parliament and the regions following the election.

Kuchma granted Yanukovych leave of absence to contest the December 26 election, and appointed First Deputy Prime Minister [[Mykola Azarov]] to serve as acting prime minister.

==11 December==
''[[The Times]]'' reported that Austrian doctors had confirmed that Yushchenko's mysterious illness was due to poisoning from a biological or chemical agent. Doctor Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic, stated that his illness had resulted from "high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=7061548&lt;/ref&gt;

==6 January==
Yanukovych will challenge his defeat of the runoff election at the Supreme Court on Thursday, even though he has acknowledged he has no hope of success. The appeal was later rejected.

==10 January==
At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Kiev time), the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]], in a live TV broadcast of the Commission meeting, officially announced that [[Viktor Yushchenko]] won the presidential elections. Results of the repeated second round are as follows:

==11 January==
The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] temporarily suspended the publication of the official results of the election, until the appeal of Yanukovych regarding the results would be considered by the Court.

==20 January==
At 2:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. (Kiev time), the Supreme Court of Ukraine announced its decision to decline the appeal of Yanukovych. Election results (Act No. 14 of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine dated 10 January 2005) are being published in the official newspapers of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] and the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]].

The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine terminated the authority of [[Viktor Yushchenko]] as the parliamentary member (on his request). The parliament also designated 23 January 2005, noon (Kiev time), as the day and time of the ceremonial assembly to hold the [[inauguration]].

==23 January==
At noon (local time) Viktor Yushchenko is inaugurated as president of Ukraine.

==24 January==
Ukraine's new president, Viktor Yushchenko, appoints [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] acting [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|prime minister]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2199">'''Unchambered long cairns''' (sometimes also '''chamberless long cairns''') are found in Scotland and northern England, and form a group of non- or semi-[[megalith]]ic monuments. There are about 28&amp;nbsp;long cairns in north Scotland and 21 in south Scotland that show no evidence of internal stone chambers. However, proving the existence of wooden chambers under a [[cairn]] is not possible without excavation work. The exact classification of this group of monuments is therefore not easy. Three particularly noteworthy examples of these cairns are: 

*Dalladies in [[Kincardineshire]], with [[cup and ring mark]]s
*Slewcairn in [[Wigtownshire]].
*Lochhill in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]].

All have narrow rectangular chambers whose positions are marked by wooden posts. The last two are especially interesting, because stone chambers were built into the mound at a later date. These make the connexions and overlaps of ideas clearly visible, something which can otherwise only be imagined from their classification by type.

Although none of the northern cairns has been excavated, their existence is significant for the architectural history of Scotland. The north is a region where [[passage tomb]]s in circular cairns are especially common (the [[Orkney]]-Cromarty type). Sites that span several periods of time, such as [[Tulach an t'Sionnaich]], demonstrate that both forms were used by the same communities. Several round cairns, like those of [[Grey Cairns of Camster|Camster]] had long cairns built over them, so that the round mound here retains its older shape. Many chamberless cairns and those with stone chambers have concave forecourts which are reminiscent of those that had been built earlier of wood (Haddenham and [[Long Cairn von Street House|Street House]]) in [[Yorkshire]].

A '''{{lang|de|Wanderwort}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvandɐˌvɔʁt|lang}}, 'wandering word', plural '''{{lang|de|Wanderwörter}}'''; capitalized like all German nouns) is a word that has spread as a [[loanword]] among numerous languages and cultures, especially those that are faraway from one another, usually in connection with trade. As such, {{lang|de|Wanderwörter}} are a curiosity in [[historical linguistics]] and [[sociolinguistics]] within a wider study of [[language contact]].&lt;ref name="Trask2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert Lawrence |last=Trask |title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;pg=PA366 |access-date=12 October 2014 |date=January 2000 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-57958-218-0 |page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a sufficient time depth, it can be very difficult to establish in which language or language family it originated and in which it was borrowed.

== Examples ==
Typical examples of {{lang|de|Wanderwörter}} are ''[[sugar]]'',&lt;ref name="HockJoseph1996"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hans Henrich |last1=Hock |first2=Brian D. |last2=Joseph |title=Language History, Language Change, and Language Relationship: An Introduction to Historical and Comparative Linguistics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGH-RCW1fzsC&amp;pg=PA514 |access-date=12 October 2014 |date=1 January 1996 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-014784-1 |page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ginger]]'', ''[[copper]]'',&lt;ref name="Trask2000"/&gt; ''[[silver]]'',&lt;ref name=Boutkan2001&gt;{{cite journal

Tea, with its maritime variant ''[[tea]]'' and Eurasian continental variant ''[[Masala chai|chai]]'' (both variants have entered English), is an example&lt;ref name="Trask2000"/&gt; whose spread occurred relatively late in [[human history]] and is therefore fairly well understood: ''tea'' is from [[Hokkien]], specifically [[Amoy dialect|Amoy]], from the Fujianese port of [[Xiamen]], hence maritime, while ''cha'' (whence ''chai''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/chai |title=chai |work=[[American Heritage Dictionary]] |quote=chai: A beverage made from spiced black tea, honey, and milk. Etymology: Ultimately from Chinese (Mandarin) ''chá''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is used in Cantonese and Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The World Atlas of Language Structures Online |title=Feature/Chapter 138: Tea |first=Östen |last=Dahl |publisher=Max Planck Digital Library |url= http://wals.info/feature/138 |access-date=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[etymology of tea]] for further details.

[[Farang]], a term derived from the [[ethnonym]] [[Franks|Frank]] through [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], refers to (typically white, European) foreigners. From the above two languages, the word has been loaned into many languages spoken on or near the Indian Ocean, including [[Hindi]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and [[Amharic]], among others.

Another example is ''[[Orange (word)|orange]]'', which originated in a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] (likely [[Telugu language|Telugu]] or [[Malayalam]]), and whose likely path to English included, in order, Sanskrit, Persian, possibly Armenian, Arabic, Late Latin,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Italian, and Old French. {{Crossref|(See {{section link|Orange (word)#Etymology}} for further details.)}}

The word ''arslan'' (lion) of Turkic origin, whose variants are now widely distributed from Hungarian, Manchu to Persian, although merely serving as personal names in some languages; used as [[Aslan]] in the English novel series ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''.

Some ancient loanwords are connected with the spread of [[writing system]]s, an example would be [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''musar'' 'written name, inscription',
[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''musarum'' 'document, seal', apparently loaned to [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*mudra-'' 'seal' ([[Middle Persian]] ''muhr'', [[Sanskrit]] ''mudr&amp;#257;''). Some even older (late [[Neolithic]]) {{lang|de|Wanderwörter}} have been suggested, e.g. Sumerian ''balag'', Akkadian ''pilakku-'', or [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''pelek'u-'' '[[axe]]'. However, Akkadian ''pilakku-'' really means '[[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]', and Sumerian ''balag'' is properly transcribed ''balaĝ'' (''ĝ'' stands for {{IPA|[ŋ]}}), meaning 'a large drum or harp'. and was borrowed into Akkadian as ''balangu-''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/epsd/nepsd-frame.html The Pennsylvanian Sumerian Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
