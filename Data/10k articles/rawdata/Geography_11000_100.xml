The '''meridian 2° west of [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich]]''' is a line of [[longitude]] that extends from the [[North Pole]] across the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Southern Ocean]], and [[Antarctica]] to the [[South Pole]].

The 2nd meridian west forms a [[great circle]] with the [[178th meridian east]].

==From Pole to Pole==
Starting at the [[North Pole]] and heading south to the [[South Pole]], the 2nd meridian west passes through:

As an adjective, the word Afghan also means "of or relating to Afghanistan or its people, [[pashto|language]], or culture".

==Afghani==
The term "Afghani" refers to the unit of [[Afghan afghani|Afghan currency]]. It is often improperly used for a person or thing related to Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More on Afghani|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2001/10/more_on_afghani.html |publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, Afghani may correctly refer to an individual whose surname is "Afghani" or more usually "al-Afghani". See, for example, [[Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī]] and [[Jamila Afghani]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Afghani was created in 1925. Between 1925 and 1993 varieties of Afghani coins and banknotes were in circulation through Afghanistan. Coins issued during this period consisted of: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25 [[Pul (coin)|pul]] in bronze, brass, copper nickel, and aluminum-bronze; silver ½, 1, and 2½ Afghani; and gold ½, 1, and 2½ amani. Banknotes issued were in: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 Afghani. In 1958 bank notes worth 2 and 5 were switched with coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famouswonders.com/afghan-afghani/|title=Afghan Afghani|work=famouswonders.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afghanistanism''' is a term, first recorded in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, Afghanistanism, n. 'colloq. (orig.

McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-7710-5326-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists Afghanistanism as a U.S. colloquialism; the first written citation it provides is from 1948: J. Lloyd Jones in Probl. Journalism ([[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] Convention) 73, "I don't wish to belabor this subject of Afghanistanism, this business of taking forthright stands on elections in Costa Rica, while the uncollected local garbage reeks beneath the editor's window."&lt;ref&gt;OED, 3rd Ed., Afghanistanism, n.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert H. Stopher and James S. Jackson, writing in their column "Behind the Front Page," said the "new term" was coined by Jenkin Lloyd Jones of Oklahoma's ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'' at that same convention, in Washington, D.C. They quoted Jones as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The tragic fact is that many an editorial writer can't hit a short-range target. He's hell on distance. He can pontificate about the situation in Afghanistan with perfect safety.  It takes more guts to dig up the dirt on the sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/147319568/?terms=afghanistanism April 18, 1948, pshr 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But columnist [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]] wrote in ''Time'' magazine in 2010 that the term originated in the 19th century when "the British press defined ''Afghanistanism'' as the obsession with obscure foreign wars at the expense of domestic priorities," adding that "Afghanistanism seems likely to become a national debate [in the United States] before long: Is building roads and police stations in Afghanistan more important than doing so at home?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2036683_2037118_2037101,00.html December 27, 2010–January 3, 2011, pages 96 and 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The concept earlier came to have several applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/column-afghanistanism-not-an-academic-joke-anymorebr-br-column/1056568 Barbara L. Fredricksen, " 'Afghanistanism' not an academic joke anymore," ''St. Petersburg Times,'' December 5, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand it was applied in North American journalism to newspaper articles about faraway places that were irrelevant to local readers. Other writers said, though, that Afghanistanism was the tendency of  some editors to avoid hard local news by writing opinion pieces about events happening in distant lands.&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/bob/greene120601.asp Bob Greene, "A few words about a word now useless," ''Jewish World Review,'' December 6, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; As ''New York Times'' writer [[James Reston]] put it about journalists, "Like officials in Washington, we suffer from Afghanistanism. If it's far away, it's news, but if it's close to home, it's sociology."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/reader/0312307446?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib%5Fbooks%5Fpg&amp;query=Afghanistanism  James Reston, quoted in ''And I Quote (Revised Edition): The Definitive Collection of Quotes, Sayings, and Jokes for the Contemporary Speechmaker,'' Thomas Dunne Books] {{ISBN|978-0-312-30744-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, educator [[Robert M. Hutchins]] used the expression in a speech at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1955:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Afghanistanism, as you know, is the practice of referring always to some remote country, place, person or problem when there is something that ought to be taken care of near at home that is very acute. So you say to a professor at [[Caltech]], "What about smog?" and he says, "Have you heard about the crisis in Afghanistan?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/161/1/hutchins.pdf "The Sources of National Strength," ''Engineering and Science,''  May 1955, page 20]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, the concept was adapted to reporting on [[environmentalism]], which was said by journalism researchers Steven E. Hungerford and James B. Lemert to deal with environmental problems of distant communities rather than local ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ094404&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ094404 Hungerford, Steven E., and Lemert, James B., "Covering the Environment: A New 'Afghanistanism'?" ''Journalism Quarterly,'' February 1973]&lt;/ref&gt; This observation was echoed in 2004 by B.A. Taleb, who called it "displacing the [environmental] problems and issues to other places and ignoring their existence in one's own community or country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/reader/0595326862?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib%5Fbooks%5Fpg&amp;query=Afghanistanism B.A. Taleb, ''The Bewildered Herd: Media Coverage of International Conflicts &amp; Public Opinion,'' iUniverse, 2004, page 386] {{ISBN|978-0-595-32686-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurfacing==

After the [[September 11 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Center]] in New York City on September 11, 2001, the concept resurfaced, with some writers asserting that it was no longer applicable to contemporary events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/1594200076.asp Robert Finn, "Ghost Wars," ''bookreporter.com,'' undated. A review of the book of that name by Steve Coll]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/reader/0393066541?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib%5Fbooks%5Fpg&amp;query=Afghanistanism Michael Kinsley, ''Please Don't Remain Calm:Provocations and Commentaries,'' W.W. Norton, 2008, page 119] {{ISBN|0-393-06654-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Stuart H. Loory]], chair in Free-Press Studies at the [[University of Missouri School of Journalism]], wrote on December 1, 2001:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A primary mission of the news business is to work as a distant early warning signal of impending problems for the public and those who can deal with those problems. It must work in a convincing way, and that means news organizations must train and educate journalists to work in various parts of the world knowledgably. They cannot fit the image now in vogue — that of parachutists jumping into an area to cover disaster on short notice. That perpetuates “Afghanistanism,” a concept that has long since outlived its usefulness, if it ever had any at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaljournalist.org/columns/final-word/2001/12/01/afghanistanism-comes-home/ Stuart H. Loory, "Afghanistanism Comes Home," ''Global Journalist,'' December 1, 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124115625/http://www.globaljournalist.org/columns/final-word/2001/12/01/afghanistanism-comes-home/ |date=November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Andreas Walsperger''' (born ca. 1415 in [[Bad Radkersburg|Radkersburg]]; time of death unknown) was a German [[cartographer]] of the 15th century. The son of a [[carpenter]], he became a [[Benedictine|Benedictine monk]] at [[St. Peter's Archabbey, Salzburg|St. Peter's]] in [[Salzburg]] in 1434. He left the monastery in 1442. Little more is known about him except that in 1448/9&lt;ref&gt;he made the world-map for which he is remembered. It has elements in common with accounts of other maps no longer extant and with the better known worldmap of the [[Fra Mauro]] (1457) the most elaborate example of medieval Latin cartography remaining. {{cite web |url=http://www.subjectgeo.com/wiki/Geography_and_the_Church |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008070103/http://www.subjectgeo.com/wiki/Geography_and_the_Church |archivedate=October 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he created his map in [[Konstanz]].

== The map ==

The '''map of Andreas Walsperger''' is a Latin [[Mappa Mundi]], atypical in its depiction of Africa and in its placing a large castle in China, where others including Fra Mauro's place their grand castle to the north. In Germany, the only other example of the type is the "Mappa mundi Ciziensis" from [[Zeitz]].

The parchment measures 57.7 x 75&amp;nbsp;cm.

==Ownership==
In the sixteenth century, the [[Fugger]] family may have owned the map. In 1622, it was given to [[Pope Gregory XV]] by [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]] and is now held in the Vatican Library Palatina (Lat. 1362 B).

'''Assisted GPS''' or '''Augmented GPS''' (abbreviated generally as '''A-GPS''' and less commonly as '''aGPS''') is a system that often significantly improves the startup performance—i.e., [[time to first fix|time-to-first-fix]] (TTFF)—of a [[Global positioning system|GPS]] satellite-based positioning system. A-GPS is extensively used with GPS-capable [[cellular phones]], as its development was accelerated by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s [[Enhanced 911|911 requirement]] to make cell phone location data available to emergency call dispatchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpsworld.com/innovation-assisted-gps-a-low-infrastructure-approach/ |title=Assisted GPS: A Low-Infrastructure Approach |publisher=GPS World |date=March 1, 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Standalone/self-ruling [[GPS navigation device|GPS devices]] depend solely on information from [[GPS satellite|satellites]]. A-GPS augments that by using cell tower data to enhance quality and precision when in poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, for example in urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit [[multipath propagation]] where signals skip off structures, or are [[Radio propagation#Absorption|weakened]] by meteorological conditions or tree canopy. Some [[GPS navigation device|standalone GPS navigators]] used in poor conditions can't fix a position because of satellite [[signal fracture]] and must wait for better satellite reception. A regular GPS unit may need as long as 12.5 minutes (the time needed to download the [[GPS signals#Navigation message|GPS almanac and ephemerides]]) to resolve the problem and be able to provide a correct location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|format=PDF|title=NavCen GPS User. 3.5.3 Almanac Collection|website=Navcen.uscvg.gov|accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assisted GPS system can address these problems by using external data. Utilizing this system can come at a cost to the user. For billing purposes, network providers often count this as a [[data access]], which can cost money, depending on the plan.&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt;

To be precise, A-GPS features depend mostly on an internet network or connection to an [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]] (or CNP, in the case of CP/mobile-phone device linked to a cellular network provider data service). A mobile (cell phone, smart phone) device with just an [[Global Positioning System#Satellite frequencies|L1 front-end radio receiver]] and no GPS acquisition, tracking, and positioning engine only works when it has an internet connection to an ISP/CNP, where the position fix is calculated offboard the device itself. It doesn't work in areas with no coverage or internet link (or nearby [[base transceiver station|base transceiver station]] (BTS) towers, in the case on CNP service coverage area). Without one of those resources, it can't connect to the A-GPS servers usually provided by CNPs. On the other hand, a mobile device with a GPS chipset requires no data connection to capture and process GPS data into a position solution, since it receives data directly from the GPS satellites and is able to calculate a position fix itself. However, the availability of a data connection can provide assistance to improve the performance of the GPS chip on the mobile device. 

Assistance falls into two categories:
# Mobile Station Based (MSB): Information used to acquire satellites more quickly.
#* It can supply [[ephemeris|orbital data]] or almanac for the GPS satellites to the GPS receiver, enabling the GPS receiver to lock to the satellites more rapidly in some cases.
#* The network can provide precise time.
# Mobile Station Assisted (MSA): Calculation of position by the server using information from the GPS receiver.
#* The device captures a snapshot of the GPS signal, with approximate time, for the server to later process into a position.
#* The assistance server has a good satellite signal and plentiful computation power, so it can compare fragmentary signals relayed to it.
#* Accurate, surveyed coordinates for the [[cell site]] towers allow better knowledge of local [[ionospheric]] conditions and other conditions affecting the GPS signal than the GPS receiver alone, enabling more precise calculation of position.

As an additional benefit, in mobile station assisted implementations, the amount of processing and software required for a GPS receiver can be reduced by offloading most of the work onto the assistance server.

A typical A-GPS-enabled receiver uses a data connection (Internet or other) to contact the assistance server for aGPS information. If it also has functioning autonomous GPS, it may use standalone GPS, which is sometimes slower on [[time to first fix]], but does not depend on the network, and therefore can work beyond network range and without incurring data-usage fees.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Low |first=Aloysius |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/mobilephones/phones/0,239025953,339281483,00.htm |title=Phones |publisher=CNET |date= |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some A-GPS devices do not have the option of falling back to standalone or autonomous GPS.

Many mobile phones combine A-GPS and other location services, including [[Wi-Fi Positioning System]] and [[Mobile phone tracking|cell-site multilateration]] and sometimes a [[hybrid positioning system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edepot.com/iphone.html#iPhone |title=iPhone Secrets and iPad Secrets and iPod Touch Secrets |website=Edepot.com |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GPS_navigation_device#Sensitivity|High-Sensitivity GPS]] is an allied technology that addresses some of these issues in a way that does not require additional infrastructure. However, unlike some forms of A-GPS, high-sensitivity GPS cannot provide a fix instantaneously when the GPS receiver has been off for some time.

==Basic concepts==
Standalone GPS provides first position in approximately 30–40 seconds. A standalone [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] needs orbital information of the satellites to calculate the current position. The data rate of the satellite signal is only 50 bit/s, so downloading orbital information like ephemerides and the almanac directly from satellites typically takes a long time, and if the satellite signals are lost during the acquisition of this information, it is discarded and the standalone system has to start from scratch. In A-GPS, the [[List of mobile network operators|network operator]] deploys an A-GPS [[Server (computing)|server]], a [[Web cache | cache server]] for GPS data. These A-GPS servers download the orbital information from the satellite and store it in the database. An A-GPS-capable device can connect to these servers and download this information using mobile-network radio bearers such as [[GSM]], [[CDMA]], [[WCDMA]], [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] or even using other radio bearers such as [[Wi-Fi]]. Usually the data rate of these bearers is high, hence downloading orbital information takes less time.

==Modes of operation==
A-GPS has two modes of operation:
;Mobile Station Assisted (MSA): In MSA mode A-GPS operation, the A-GPS capable device receives acquisition assistance, reference time and other optional assistance data from a mobile service provider. The mobile service provider continuously logs GPS information (mainly the [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac]]) from the GPS satellites using an A-GPS server in its system. With the help of the above data (the data received from the mobile device and the data already present in A-GPS server) the A-GPS server calculates the position and sends it back to the A-GPS device.
;Mobile Station Based (MSB): In MSB mode A-GPS operation, the A-GPS device receives ephemeris, reference location, reference time and other optional assistance data from the A-GPS server. With the help of the above data, the A-GPS device receives signals from the visible satellites and calculates the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.wpcentral.com/gps-vs-agps-quick-tutorial |title=GPS vs. aGPS: A Quick Tutorial &amp;#124; Windows Central |website=Wpcentral.com |date=2009-01-03 |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
A-GPS protocols are part of Positioning Protocol defined by two different standardization bodies, [[3GPP]] and [[Open Mobile Alliance|Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)]].
;[[control plane|Control Plane]] Protocol: Defined by the 3GPP for various generations of mobile phone systems. These protocols are defined for [[Circuit Switched]] Networks. The following positioning protocols have been defined.
* [[Radio resource location services protocol|RRLP]] – 3GPP defined RRLP or Radio resource location protocol to support positioning protocol on GSM networks.
* TIA 801 – [[CDMA2000]] family defined this protocol for CDMA 2000 networks.
* RRC position protocol – 3GPP defined this protocol as part of the [[Radio Resource Control|RRC]] standard for [[UMTS]] network.
* LPP – 3GPP defined LPP or LTE positioning protocol for [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] Networks.
;[[user plane|User Plane]] Protocol:
{{See also|Secure User Plane Location}}

{{-}}
A '''baymouth bar''' is a [[deposition (sediment)|depositional]] feature as a result of [[longshore drift]]. It is a [[bar (landform)|sandbank]] that partially or completely closes access to a [[bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/sandbar#ref161377 |title=Sandbar (geology) |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These bars usually consist of accumulated gravel and sand carried by the current of longshore drift and deposited at a less turbulent part of the current. Thus, they most commonly occur across artificial bay and river entrances due to the loss of kinetic energy in the current after wave refraction.

A ''cloud tree'' is a [[tree]], shaped using [[topiary]] techniques. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pruning|pruned]] into a ball or cloud shape, leaving the stems thin and exposed. The shape of the tree as a whole resembles a set of clouds.

Cloud trees differ from [[Bonsai]] trees because they are not miniature. Typically, cloud trees are planted in plain soil, rather than in pots.

Similarly to bonsai, the practice of shaping cloud trees comes from [[Japan]] because it derives from a Japanese style of [[gardening]] known as ''[[Niwaki]]'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.silktree.co.uk/cloudtree.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation status''' of the [[Global 200]] [[ecoregion]]s is used to classify ecoregions into one of three broad categories: "''critical/endangered''",
"''vulnerable''", or "''relatively stable/relatively intact''".

The conservation status of [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s is noted : CE for critical or endangered, V for vulnerable, and RS for relatively stable or intact.

Ecoregions vary in their biological particularities, as well as in their conservation status. This latter represents an estimation of the current and future ability of the ecoregion to sustain [[ecological viability]] and to react to environmental changes.

Conservation status was based on landscape (or equivalent for freshwater and marine ecoregions), such as total [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] loss, [[habitat fragmentation]], degree of degradation, degree of protection needed, degree of urgency for conservation needs, and types of conservation practiced or required. 

The Global 200 ecoregions list can mostly help [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] at regional scale (local [[deforestation]], destruction of [[swamp]]s [[wetland habitat|habitats]], [[soil degradation|degradation of soils]]...). However, certain phenomena (such as bird or [[cetacea]]ns [[Bird migration|migration]]) obviously depend on more complicated parameters not used in defining the current database (such as atmospheric currents, dynamic [[pelagic]] ecosystem...). These would require further gathering of information, and require coordination of efforts between several ecoregions. However,  Global 200 ecoregions can help these efforts by identifying habitat sites and resting sites for [[migratory animals]].  It may also help identify the origin of [[invasive species]], and offer leverage for slowing down or stopping the intrusion and settling of the latter.

In [[geography]] and [[urban planning]], '''elbow roomers''' are people who leave a city for the countryside to seek more land and greater freedom from governmental and neighborhood interference.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Some are carrying out activities such as large-scale [[gardening]], the raising of [[horse]]s or other animals, or [[farming]], or otherwise have a genuine need for the space.  Others wish to pursue a [[rural]] lifestyle for reasons unrelated to space itself.

Elbow roomers are often said to contribute to [[urban sprawl]], though some authorities claim they are a part of the natural evolution of the edges of urban areas.

'''Elephant Island''' is an ice-covered mountainous island off the coast of [[Antarctica]] in the outer reaches of the [[South Shetland Islands]], in the [[Southern Ocean]]. Its name was given by early explorers sighting [[elephant seal]]s on its shores. The island is situated {{convert|245|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} north-northeast of the tip of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], {{convert|1,253|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} west-southwest of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], {{convert|935|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Falkland Islands]], and {{convert|885|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} southeast of [[Cape Horn]].  It is within the Antarctic claims of [[Argentine Antarctica|Argentina]], [[Antártica|Chile]] and the [[British Antarctic Territory|UK]].  [[Brazil]] has a shelter on the island, [[Refuge Emílio Goeldi|Goeldi]], supporting the work of up to six researchers each during the summer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivabrazil.com/vivabrazil/proantar.htm |title=The Brazilian Antarctic Program |publisher=Vivabrazil.com |date=1984-02-06 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another ([[Refuge Engineer Wiltgen|Wiltgen]]), which was dismantled in the summer of 1997/98.

==Geography==
[[File:Piloto Pardo Islands Map.png|thumb|280px|Map of the group of islands]]

The island is oriented approximately east-west, with a maximum elevation of {{convert|2,799|ft|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at [[Pardo Ridge]]. Significant named features are [[Cape Yelcho]], [[Cape Valentine]] and [[Cape Lookout (South Shetland Islands)|Cape Lookout]] at the northeastern and southern extremes, and [[Point Wild]], a spit on the north coast. The [[Endurance Glacier]] is the main discharge glacier. Due to slow recoveries and illegal whaling by Soviet Union with support from Japan, numbers of [[southern right whale]]s visiting Elephant island are still on low level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnDVAMQ2lJQ&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elephant Island with Iceberg.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Elephant Island from the sea [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] photo]]
The island supports no significant flora or native fauna although migratory [[gentoo penguin]]s and seals may be found, and [[chinstrap penguin]]s nest in season. A lack of safe [[anchor]]age has prevented any permanent human settlement, despite the island being well placed to support scientific, [[fishing]] and [[whaling]] activities.

Elephant Island's name can be attributed to both its elephant head-like appearance and the sighting of [[elephant seal]]s by Captain [[George Powell (mariner)|George Powell]] in 1821, one of the earliest sightings. The weather is normally foggy with much snow, and winds can reach {{convert|100|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}}.

==History==
===First Russian Antarctic expedition===
The First Russian Antarctic expedition led by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]]  on the 985-ton sloop-of-war Vostok ("East") and the 530-ton support vessel Mirny ("Peaceful") discovered the Island on 29 January 1821 and named it "Остров Мордвинова" (Mordvinov Island) in honour of {{ill|Semyon Mordvinov|ru|Мордвинов, Семён Иванович|lt=Admiral Mordvinov}}.

===''Endurance'' expedition===
{{main|Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition}}

[[File:Elephant Island NOAA.jpg|thumb|280px|alt= On-board view towards the bow of a small boat with a mast. Beyond the bow is a shoreline of snowy mountains.|A ship approaching Elephant Island in 1962.]]

[[File:Elephant Island From water.jpg|thumb|280px|Summer view of the same beach where Shackleton's crew spent a winter waiting for rescue.]]

[[File:James Caird en.svg|thumb|right|280px|The route of the ''James Caird'' to South Georgia]]
[[File:LaunchingTheJamesCaird2.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Launching the ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]''.]]

The island is most famous as the desolate refuge of British explorer [[Ernest Shackleton]] and his crew in 1916. Following the loss of their ship ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' in [[Weddell Sea]] ice, the 28 exhausted men reached Cape Valentine on Elephant Island after a harrowing ordeal on drifting ice floes. The first of Shackleton's crew to set foot here, and presumably the first person ever to make landfall, was [[Perce Blackborow]], originally a stowaway on ''Endurance''. Since Blackborow was the youngest crew member, Shackleton commanded that he make the first landfall on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton, Earnest ''South. The Endurance Expedition'' Penguin Books, London, 1999, p157&lt;/ref&gt; After camping at Cape Valentine for two nights, Shackleton and his crew moved {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip}} westwards to a location which offered better protection from rockfalls and from the sea, and which they called ''Point Wild''.

Realizing that there was no chance of passive rescue, Shackleton decided to sail to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] where he knew there were several whaling stations. Shackleton sailed with five other men on a {{convert|800|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Voyage of the James Caird|voyage]] in the open lifeboat ''James Caird'' beginning on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916  and arriving at South Georgia 16 days later. His second-in-command, [[Frank Wild]], was left in charge of the men on Elephant Island, waiting for Shackleton's return with a rescue ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/shackleton/ |title=Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition |publisher=Amnh.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was much work for the stranded men. Because the island had no natural source of shelter, they constructed a shack and wind blocks from their remaining two lifeboats and pieces of canvas tents. Blubber lamps were used for lighting. Expedition physicist [[Reginald W. James|Reginald James]] composed the following verses out of gratitude for Wild's leadership:&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Sweet|Sweet, Leonard]], ''Summoned to Lead'', [[Zondervan]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitandlearn.co.uk/enduranceobituaries/Hussey.asp Obituary] of [[Leonard Hussey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
:My name is Frankie Wild-o.
:Me hut's on Elephant Isle.
:The wall's without a single brick
:And the roof's without a tile.
:Nevertheless I must confess,
:By many and many a mile,
:It's the most palatial dwelling place
:You'll find on Elephant Isle.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

They hunted for penguins and seals, neither of which were plentiful in autumn or winter. Many of the crew were already ill and frostbitten, and they were now also in danger of starvation. After four and a half months, one of the men spotted a ship on August 30, 1916. The ship, with Shackleton on board, was the tug ''[[Yelcho]]'', from [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]], commanded by [[Luis Pardo]], which rescued all the men who had set out on the original expedition. It was the fourth attempt to rescue the men. The first three attempts were turned back due to a heavy ice pack surrounding the island.

According to [[Frank Worsley]], Shackleton's captain, the men pronounced the island's name with an 'H' prefixed and a silent 't', "Hell-of-an-Island".&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Worsley|Worsley, Frank]], ''Shackleton's Boat Journey'', 1933, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;34?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint Services Elephant Island Expeditions 1970–71===
A Joint Services Expedition led by Commander [[Malcolm Burley]] was dropped off on Elephant Island by HMS Endurance. The party then spent six months carrying out a survey of the island and other scientific research for the [[British Antarctic Survey]] and climbing some of the peaks on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Services Expedition to Elephant Island by M Burley Geographical Journal 1972 https://www.jstor.org/stable/1795437?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition visited [[Point Wild]] but found no trace of the ''Endurance'' expedition; it found the wreckage of the large sailing vessel referred to below, and also landed on and climbed the highest peak on Clarence Island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1972_files/AJ%201972%20204-210%20Agnew%20Elephant.pdf#search=%22elephant island%22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic sites===
[[Point Wild]] contains the Endurance Memorial Site, an Antarctic Historic Site (HSM 53), with a bust of Captain Pardo and several plaques. Hampson Cove on the south-west coast of the island, including the foreshore and intertidal area, contains the wreckage of a large wooden sailing vessel; it has been designated a [[Historic Sites and Monuments in Antarctica|Historic Site or Monument]] (HSM 74), following a proposal by the United Kingdom to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]].&lt;ref name=atcm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ats.aq/documents/ATCM35/WW/atcm35_ww003_e.pdf|title= List of Historic Sites and Monuments approved by the ATCM (2012)|accessdate=2014-01-06 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Antarctic Treaty Secretariat |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eritrean Highlands''' are a [[mountain]]ous region in central [[Eritrea]]. Bordered to the south by the [[Mareb River]], it is a northern continuation of the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The region has seen tremendous [[deforestation]] since the colonial period, which began in the late 19th century. The Highlands are at particular risk of deforestation and associated [[soil erosion]]. Furthermore, the region, lying south of the [[Sahel]] are at particular risk of [[desertification]] and frequent drought. The Highlands experience, as most tropical regions, two seasons; the rainy season (''kremti'') is from June-September while the dry season is from September to June. The average temperature for [[Asmara]], which is {{convert|2340|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level is approximately 16°C, but other places range from about 10°C to 25°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mussie Tesfagiorgis G.|title=Eritrea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&amp;pg=PA10 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-232-6 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Eritrean Highlands.jpg|thumb|left|[[Teff]] field at the base of a small hill in the Eritrean Highlands.]]
The Eritrean Highlands are drained by four major rivers towards [[Sudan]], and by several smaller rivers into the [[Red Sea]] coast of Eritrea. Flowing towards Sudan and the [[Nile]] are the [[Gash River|Gash]] and [[Setit River|Setit]] rivers, while towards Sudan without reaching the Nile are the [[Barka River|Barka]] and [[Anseba River|Anseba]] rivers. The eastern escarpment of Eritrea is drained by numerous small streams.&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of the World |last=Philip's  |year=1994 |publisher=Reed International |isbn=0-540-05831-9 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest point in [[Eritrea]] is located in the Eritrean Highlands at [[Emba Soira]] {{convert|3018|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eritrea.be/old/eritrea-geography.htm |title=Location &amp; Geography of Eritrea |publisher=Eritrea.be |accessdate=24 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126125319/http://www.eritrea.be/old/eritrea-geography.htm |archivedate=26 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many believe that [[forest cover]] in the Eritrean Highlands was as high as 30% but has since declined to 1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|author=Boerma, Pauline |title=Assessing Forest Cover Change in Eritrea — A Historical Perspective |publisher=Mountain Research and Development |url=http://www.mrd-journal.org/pdf/Boerma_MRED26_1_pp41-47.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930162047/http://www.mrd-journal.org/pdf/Boerma_MRED26_1_pp41-47.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, others including Louise Latt have suggested that there has never been such a dramatic decline in forest cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper  | author = Louise Latt  | title = Eritrea Re-photographed: Landscape Changes in the Eritrean Highlands 1890-2004  | format = PDF  | url = http://www.cde.unibe.ch/University/pdf/TTD/Laett_Eritrea.pdf  | accessdate = 2006-09-26  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060304115009/http://www.cde.unibe.ch/University/pdf/TTD/Laett_Eritrea.pdf  | archivedate = 2006-03-04  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern edge of the Highlands falls off dramatically towards the [[Red Sea]] which causes two climatic systems to overlap. This region is oft noted for its perennial forest cover. This is also the region that Eritrea's Merara coffee is grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethiopian Geographical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmEKAQAAIAAJ|publisher=Mapping and Geography Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soil conditions in the Eritrean Highlands is also quite complex. The predominant soils are chromic, eutric, and calsic cambisols of strong red colour. Other soils found in the highlands are lithosols, xerosols and fluvisols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6782e/X6782E01.htm|title=FOSA Country Report|accessdate=2007-01-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008225652/http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6782e/X6782E01.htm|archivedate=2012-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hindustan''' ({{audio|Hindustan pronunciation1.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the [[Persian language|Persian]] name for India, broadly the [[Indian subcontinent]], which later became an [[endonym]].&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mukherjee, The Foreign Names of the Indian Subcontinent|1989|p=46}}: "They used the name ''Hindustan'' for India Intra Gangem or taking the latter expression rather loosely for the Indian subcontinent proper. The term ''Hindustan'', which in the "Naqsh-i-Rustam" inscription of Shapur I denoted India on the lower Indus, and which later gradually began to denote more or less the whole of the subcontinent, was used by some of the European authors concerned as a part of bigger India. Hindustan was of course a well-known name for the subcontinent used in India and outside in mediaeval times."&lt;/ref&gt;
After the [[Partition of India]], it continues to be used as a historic name for the [[Republic of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Sindh: An Introduction |title=Shaikh Ayaz International Conference – Language &amp; Literature |url=http://www.usindh.edu.pk/shaikh_ayaz_conf_07/sindh.html  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020050542/http://www.usindh.edu.pk/shaikh_ayaz_conf_07/sindh.html |archive-date=20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Singh2009&gt;{{cite book |page=276 |author=Sarina Singh |title=Lonely Planet India |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2009 |edition=13, illustrated |isbn=9781741791518 |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=vK88ktao7pIC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=hindustan+zindabad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyjPT6m1OsXHrQf70P2hDA&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hindustan%20zindabad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Everaer2010&gt;{{cite book |author=Christine Everaer |title=Tracing the Boundaries Between Hindi and Urdu: Lost and Added in Translation Between 20th Century Short Stories |publisher=BRILL |year=2010 |edition=annotated |isbn=9789004177314 |page=82  |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=LqZ-6QRKc7wC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=hindustan+zindabad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyjPT6m1OsXHrQf70P2hDA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hindustan%20zindabad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary meaning of Hindustan is as a geographic term for the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] in northern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hindustan |title=Hindustan: Definition |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Hindustan is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''Hindū'' cognate with the Sanskrit ''Sindhu''.{{sfnp|Sharma, On Hindu, Hindustan, Hinduism and Hindutva|2002|p=3}}
The [[Proto-Iranian language|Proto-Iranian]] sound change ''*s'' &gt; ''h'' occurred between 850–600 BCE, according to [[Asko Parpola]].{{sfnp|Parpola, The Roots of Hinduism|2015|loc=Chapter 9}} Hence, the [[Rigvedic]] ''sapta sindhava'' (the land of seven rivers) became ''hapta hindu'' in the [[Avesta]]. It was said to be the "fifteenth domain" created by [[Ahura Mazda]], apparently a land of 'abnormal heat'.{{sfnp|Sharma, On Hindu, Hindustan, Hinduism and Hindutva|2002|p=2}}
In 515 BCE, [[Darius I]] annexed the Indus valley including ''Sindhu'', the present day [[Sindh]], which was called ''Hindu'' in Persian.{{sfnp|Parpola, The Roots of Hinduism|2015|loc=Chapter 1}} During the time of [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]], the term "Hindu" was also applied to the lands to the east of Indus.{{sfnp|Sharma, On Hindu, Hindustan, Hinduism and Hindutva|2002|p=3}}

In [[middle Persian]], probably from the first century CE, the suffix ''-stān'' was added, indicative of a country or region, forming the present word ''Hindūstān''.{{sfnp|Habib, Hindi/Hindwi in Medieval Times|2011|p=105}} Thus, Sindh was referred to as ''Hindūstān'' in the Naqsh-e-Rustam inscription of [[Shapur I]] in {{circa}} 262 CE.{{sfnp|Mukherjee, The Foreign Names of the Indian Subcontinent|1989|p=46}}{{sfnp|Ray &amp; Chattopadhyaya, A Sourcebook of Indian Civilization|2000|p=553}}

Historian [[B. N. Mukherjee]] states that from the lower Indus basin, the term ''Hindūstān'' got gradually extended to "more or less the whole of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]]". The Greco-Roman name "India" and the Chinese name ''Shen-tu'' also followed a similar evolution.{{sfnp|Mukherjee, The Foreign Names of the Indian Subcontinent|1989|p=46}}{{sfnp|Ray &amp; Chattopadhyaya, A Sourcebook of Indian Civilization|2000|p=555}}

==Current usage==

===Nation State===
"Hindustan" is often used to refer to the modern day [[Republic of India]].&lt;ref name="White-Spunner2017"&gt;{{citation |last=White-Spunner |first=Barney |title=Partition: The story of Indian independence and the creation of Pakistan in 1947 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Wx9DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5 |year=2017 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK |isbn=978-1-4711-4802-6 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Singh2009/&gt;&lt;ref name= Everaer2010/&gt; Slogans involving the term are commonly heard at sports events and other public programmes involving teams or entities representing the modern nation state. In marketing, it is also commonly used as an indicator of national origin in advertising campaigns and is present in many [[Hindustan_(disambiguation)# Companies|company names]]. [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]], the founder of [[Pakistan]], and his party the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], insisted on calling the modern day [[Republic of India]] 'Hindustan' in reference to its Hindu majority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pande |first=Aparna |date=2011 |title=Explaining Pakistan’s foreign policy: escaping India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceg-kSmft94C&amp;pg=PA15 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=14-15 |isbn=0415599008 |quote="At partition, the Muslim League tried, unsuccessfully, to convince the British that the two independent countries should be called Hindustan and Pakistan but neither the British nor the Congress gave in to this demand. It is important to note that Jinnah and the majority of the Pakistani policy-makers have often referred to independent India as "Hindustan," as an affirmation of the two nation theory. "}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People===
{{main article|Hindustani people}}

In one usage among Hindustani speakers in India, the term '[[Hindustani people|Hindustani]]' refers to an Indian, irrespective of religious affiliation.  Among non-Hindustani speakers e.g. Bengali-speakers, "Hindustani" is sometimes used to describe persons who are from the upper Ganges, also regardless of religious affiliation, but rather as a geographic term.

''Hindustani'' is sometimes used as an [[ethnic group|ethnic]] term applied to [[South Asia]] (''e.g.'', a Mauritian or Surinamese man with roots in South Asia might describe his ethnicity by saying he is ''Hindustani''). For example, ''[[Hindoestanen (disambiguation)|Hindoestanen]]''&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word used to describe people of [[South Asian]] origin, in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Suriname]].

===Language===
{{main article|Hindustani language}}{{See also|Mughal Empire}}

''Hindustani'' is also used to refer to the [[Hindustani language]] (not to be confused with [[Hindi]], which is a register of Hindustani alongside [[Urdu]], another register of the same language), which derives from the [[Khariboli]] dialect under the [[Delhi Sultanate]] of present-day [[Western Uttar Pradesh]], Southern [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Delhi]] areas.

==Historical usages==
{{quotebox|align=right|width=200px|title=Babur Nama|text=
The country of Hindustan is extensive, full of men and full of produce. On the east, south and even on the west it ends at its great enclosing ocean (''muḥiṭ-daryā-sī-gha''). On the north it has mountains which connect with those of Hindu-Kush, Kafiristan and Kashmir. North-west of it lies Kabul, Ghazni and Qandahar. Dihlī is held (''aīrīmīsh'') to be the capital of the whole of Hindustan...

Early Persian scholars had limited knowledge of the extent of India. After the advent of Islam and the [[Muslim conquests]], the meaning of ''Hindustan'' interacted with its Arabic variant ''Hind'' and almost became synonymous with it. The Arabs, enagaing in oceanic trade, included all the lands from ''Tis'' in western Balochistan (near modern [[Chabahar]]) to the Indonesian archipelago, in their idea of ''Hind'', especially when used in its expansive form as "''Al-Hind''". ''Hindustan'' did not acquire this elaborate meaning. It also did not acquire the distinction between ''Sind'' (roughly modern Pakistan) and ''Hind'' (the lands to the east of it).&lt;ref name=Brill&gt;{{citation |last=Ahmad |first=S.

Sind, in point of fact, while vaguely defined territorially, overlaps rather well with what is currently Pakistan. It definitely did extend beyond the present province of Sind and Makran; the whole of Baluchistan was included, a part of the Panjab, and the North-West Frontier Province."&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th century text ''[[Hudud al-Alam]]'' defined ''Hindustan'' as roughly the [[Indian subcontinent]], with its western limit formed by the river Indus, southern limit going up to the Great Sea and the eastern limit at [[Kamarupa]], the present day Assam.{{sfnp|Ray &amp; Chattopadhyaya, A Sourcebook of Indian Civilization|2000|p=555}} For the next ten centuries, both ''Hind'' and ''Hindustan'' were used within the subcontinent with exactly this meaning, along with their adjectives ''Hindawi'' and ''Hindustani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=M.

=== North India ===
With the Turko-Persian conquests starting in the 11th century, a narrower meaning of ''Hindustan'' also took shape. The conqueres were liable to call the lands under their control as "''Hindustan''" ignoring the rest of the subcontinent.&lt;ref name=Daniyal&gt;Shoaib Daniyal, [https://scroll.in/article/855876/land-of-hindus-mohan-bhagwat-narendra-modi-and-the-sangh-parivar-are-using-hindustan-all-wrong Land of Hindus?

In the early 11th century a [[satellite state]] of the [[Ghaznavid]]s in the [[Punjab]] with its capital at [[Lahore]] was called "Hindustan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hindu J.

The latter provinces are regarded as ''pūrb'' (see '''Poorub'''), and all south of the Nerbudda as ''Dakhan'' (see '''Deccan'''). But the word is used in older Mahommedan authors just as it is used in English school-books and atlases, viz., as (a) the equivalent of India Proper.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholar Bratindra Nath Mukherjee states that this narrow menaing of ''Hindustan'' existed side by side with the wider meaning, and some of the authors used both of them simultaneously.{{sfnp|Mukherjee, The Foreign Names of the Indian Subcontinent|1989|p=132}}

The [[Mughal Empire]] (1526–1857) called its lands 'Hindustan'. The term 'Mughal' itself was never used to refer to the land. As the empire expanded, so too did 'Hindustan'. At the same time, the meaning of 'Hindustan' as the entire [[Indian subcontinent]] is also found in ''[[Baburnama]]'' and ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kingdom of Nepal usage ===
The last [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkhali]] King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] self proclaimed the newly unified [[Kingdom of Nepal]] as '''''Asal Hindustan''''' (Real Hindustan) due to North India being ruled by the [[Islamic]] [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rulers]]. The self proclamation was done to enforce Hindu social code [[Dharmashastra]] over his reign and refer to his country as being inhabitable for [[Hindus]]. He also referred Northern India as ''Mughlan'' (Country of [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]) and called the region infiltrated by Muslim foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Badamaharaj Prithivi Narayan Shah ko Divya Upadesh|last=[[Baburam Acharya|Acharya, Baburam]]|first=[[Yogi Naraharinath|Naraharinath, Yogi]]|publisher=Shree Krishna Acharya|year=2014|edition=2014 Reprint|isbn=99933-912-1-2|location=Kathmandu|pages=4,5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial usage ===
These dual meanings persisted with the arrival of Europeans. Rennel produced an atlas titled the ''Memoir of a Map of Hindoostan or the Mogul Empire'' in 1792, which was in fact a map of the Indian subcontinent. Rennel thus conflated the three notions, 'India', 'Hindustan' and the Mughal Empire.&lt;ref name="Edney p.11"&gt;* {{citation |last=Edney |first=Matthew H. |title=Mapping an Empire: The Geographical Construction of British India, 1765-1843 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF_FBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |date=2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-18486-9 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Clémentin-Ojha, India, that is Bharat|2014|loc=paragraph 3}} J. Bernoulli, to whom ''Hindustan'' meant the Mughal Empire, called his French translation ''La Carte générale de l'Inde'' (General Map of India).{{sfnp|Mukherjee, The Foreign Names of the Indian Subcontinent|1989|p=71}}
This 'Hindustan' of British reckoning was divided into British-ruled territories (sometimes referred to as 'India') and the territories ruled by native rulers.{{sfnp|Mukherjee, The Foreign Names of the Indian Subcontinent|1989|p=48}} The British officials and writers, however, thought that the Indians used 'Hindustan' to refer to only North India.{{sfnp|Mukherjee, The Foreign Names of the Indian Subcontinent|1989|p=133}}&lt;ref name=Macdonnell/&gt; An ''Anglo-Indian Dictionary'' published in 1886 states that, while ''Hindustan'' means India, in the "nativa parlance" it had come to represent the region north of [[Narmada River]] excluding [[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]].&lt;ref name="Anglo-Indian"/&gt;

During the independence movement, the Indians referred to their land by all three names: 'India', 'Hindustan' and 'Bharat'.{{sfnp|Clémentin-Ojha, India, that is Bharat|2014|loc=paragraph 1}} [[Mohammad Iqbal]]'s poem
&lt;poem&gt;
''Sare jahāṃ se acchā Hindustāṃ hamārā''
(the best of all lands is our Hindustan)
&lt;/poem&gt;
was a popular patriotic song among independence activists.{{sfnp|Clémentin-Ojha, India, that is Bharat|2014|loc=paragraph 26}}

=== Partition of India ===
The 1940 [[Lahore Resolution]] of the [[All-India Muslim League]] demanded sovereignty for the Muslim-majority areas in the northwest and northeast of India, which came to be called 'Pakistan' in popular parlance and the remaining India came to be called 'Hindustan'.{{sfnp|Dhulipala, Creating a New Medina|2015|pp=17–18,&amp;nbsp;22}} The British officials too picked up the two terms and started using them officially.&lt;ref name="White-Spunner2017"/&gt;

However, this naming did not meet the approval of Indian leaders due to the implied meaning of 'Hindustan' as the land of [[Hindus]]. They insisted that the new [[Dominion of India]] should be called 'India', not 'Hindustan'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sabharwal |first=Gopa |title=India Since 1947: The Independent Years |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9gvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12 |date=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-93-5214-089-3 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably for the same reason, the name 'Hindustan' did not receive official sanction of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]], whereas 'Bharat' was adopted as an official name.{{sfnp|Clémentin-Ojha, India, that is Bharat|2014|loc=paragraph 39}} It was recognised however that 'Hindustan' would continue to be used unofficially.{{sfnp|Clémentin-Ojha, India, that is Bharat|2014|loc=paragraphs 42–45}}

The '''Kumtor''' gold mine ({{lang-ky|Кумтөр}}, {{IPA-all|qum.tør}}; {{lang-ru|Кумтор}}) is an [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] [[gold mining]] site in [[Issyk-Kul Region]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]] located about 350&amp;nbsp;km (220&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of the capital [[Bishkek]] and 80&amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[Lake Issyk-Kul]] near the border with [[China]]. Located in [[Tian Shan]] mountains at more than 4,000 m (14,000&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, Kumtor is the second-highest gold mining operation in the world after [[Yanacocha]] gold mine in [[Peru]].

==1. Ownership==
Kumtor is 100% owned by the [[Canada|Canadian]] mining company, [[Centerra Gold]].  Centerra Gold Inc. is a Canadian-based gold mining and exploration company engaged in the operation, exploration, development and acquisition of gold properties in North America, Asia and other markets worldwide. Centerra’s shares trade on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange|Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)]] under the symbol CG. The Company is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (4). The [[Kyrgyz Republic]], via [[Kyrgyzaltyn]] JSC, is Centerra's largest shareholder owning 77,401,766 shares (5), or more than 26 % of the issued shares of Centerra (6). Kumtor Gold Company is the operator of the Kumtor project responsible for the entire production cycle. 

==2. Operation==
The deposit is mined by [[open-pit]] [[mining]] techniques utilizing typical drill, blast and truck/loader or truck/shovel operations. The [[ore]] is delivered to the crusher and further to the mill, where the gold is extracted using carbon-in-leach technology
The mill's rated throughput is approximately 16,000 tonnes of ore per day. After the ore treatment is complete, the [[gold]] is poured in the form of [[Dor%C3%A9 bar|Dore bars]] containing about 80 percent of gold. 
As of December 31, 2017, Kumtor had produced approximately 11.5 million ounces or 357 tonnes of gold since the start of commercial production in May 1997. (7). 
The Dore bars produced by the Kumtor mine are purchased by Kyrgyzaltyn JSC for processing at the Kara-Balta refinery pursuant to a Gold and [[Silver]] Sales Agreement signed by Kumtor Gold Company, Kyrgyzaltyn and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. Kyrgyzaltyn JSC enjoys the exclusive right to sell [[Gold_bar|refined gold]] and silver both in and outside the Kyrgyz Republic.
In 2017, gold production at the Kumtor mine was 562,749 ounces or 17,503.46 kg. Gold sales were 550,134 ounces or 17,111.09 kg (8).

==3. History==
Despite the fact that the Kumtor gold deposit was discovered in 1978 and the feasibility study was drafted by GINALMAZZOLOTO of the Chief Directorate of Precious Metals and Diamonds of the USSR Council of Ministers in 1989, the development of the mine was delayed as the project was seen as being too costly: 995.4 million Soviet rubles (an approximate equivalent of 1.46 billion USD as it stood in those days).
It was not until after Kyrgyzstan gained independence that it found itself in a position to attract western investment to start developing its own mineral resources. After thoroughly examining several investment offers, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic favored those made by Canadian Cameco Corporation, one of the world’s largest uranium producers. On December 4, 1992, in Toronto the sides signed the Kumtor Master Agreement (9).

The Mine's construction commenced in 1993, and commercial gold production at Kumtor started in May 1997 so that as soon as one year later, the company poured its first million gold ounces. Mining operations in the open pit are expected to be completed in 2023 while milling operations are thought to continue until 2026 (10).

'''3.2. Controversies'''
In 1992, Cameco Corporation became the owner of the Kumtor mine with no tender or competition ever announced. The Master Agreement between Cameco and the Government of Kyrgyzstan said that Kyrgyzstan's laws were applicable to the corporation insofar as they didn't contradict the Master Agreement. (13) 

One of the worst accidents relating to the mine occurred on May 20, 1998, when a truck overturned while carrying a load of sodium cyanide, used for extracting gold from ore. The spill necessitated evacuation of approximately 5,000 residents of the village of Barskoon. In late 1998, a joint Russian-Canadian expert commission concluded that toxic concentrations in the Barskoon and Tamga irrigation water was too insignificant to cause any harm to human health (14). A series of analyses, including chemical ones, conducted by a laboratory of the national sanitary-epidemiological station under the Agency for Geology and Natural Resources, showed that cyanide concentration in the river, diversion ditches and the lake was under MAC (the maximum allowable concentration) as soon as May 27, 1998. (15) Nor cyanide was ever detected in the vegetables or fruits. (16) Moreover, no follow-up medical examinations discovered any growth in cancer rates or gene mutations among the residents of Jety-Oguz district, Issyk-Kul Province. (17) 

After Cameco sold all of its shares to Centerra Gold Inc. in 2009, Kyrgyzstan became the major shareholder of the company. (18) That same year, when Kurmanbek Bakiyev was President of the Kyrgyz Republic, a new project agreement was signed between the company and Kyrgyzstan. Deposed in 2010, he was blamed for accepting terms that he knew were against the interests of the country. (19)

In this context, a temporary parliamentary commission was formed by Jogorku Kenesh in February 2012 to review the Kumtor mine's activities (20). Based on its findings, in June 2012, a State Commission was formed to carry out a comprehensive audit of Kumtor Operating Company. The Commission was chaired by Temir Sariyev, Minister of the Economy and Antimonopoly Policy (21).

In February 2013, the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan supported the State Commission's recommendation that the 2009 Kumtor Agreement should be reviewed. The Government was ordered to have the Agreement with Centerra Gold Inc. revised in favor of Kyrgyzstan. Otherwise, the Government was instructed to terminate the Agreement (22).

As a result of the Commission's efforts, On May 22, 2013, the State Inspectorate Office for Environmental and Engineering Safety filed a claim against Kumtor Operating Company to an amount of 6.8 billion soms. On May 24, the claim was dismissed by the court. On June 7, claims were filed again by the said Inspectorate Office which were rejected by the court decisions dated June 11 and 13, 2013. (23) 

Against this background, on May 28, 2013, about 500 village residents in Jety-Oguz district, Issyk-Kul Province blocked the road to the mine demanding that the 2009 Agreement should be terminated. In the evening May 30, a few dozens of protesters seized an electric power substation and shut down the grid power supply to the gold mill. Electricity supply was resumed early in the morning on May 31 after police forced out the protesters from the electric power substation. President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev declared the state of emergency in Jety-Oguz district. (24) As the result of the outage, the gold mill suffered more than $4 million in losses (25).

By October 2013, the Kyrgyz Republic's Government had completed negotiations with the Canadian company and submitted to Parliament a draft Memorandum creating a 50/50 joint venture company, which, however, was rejected by Parliament as it demanded that Kyrgyzstan's equity interests in the company should be increased to 67% (26, 27).

In 2014, the Kyrgyz Republic's Government sponsored amendments to the existing Water Code which banned any activities that might affect the status of glaciers. However, it made an exception for the Davydov and Lysyi glaciers located within Kumtor's concession area. In its explanatory notes, the Government proved that Kumtor was critically important for the economy of Kyrgyzstan (28).

In the meantime, the Government came up with a modified version of the Kumtor restructuring Memorandum which it submitted to Parliament in February 2014. The restructuring program for Kumtor was approved by Parliament(29). In December 2015, however, it was announced that the Kyrgyz Republic's Government was pulling out of the talks as it was going to provide a new restructuring program(30). In that situation, a risk of operations being shut down at Kumtor arose as the Water Code amendments permitting Kumtor's operations had still to be adopted by Parliament(35).

That same year, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic affirmed the State Inspectorate Office's appeal and brought the case back to the Inter-District Court. A second stage of litigation began. In 2016, the court made a ruling in favor of the Inspectorate Office. The principal difference between the ways the Inspectorate Office's claims were considered in 2013 and 2016 was that in 2013 court proceedings were purposefully slowed down by Kyrgyzstan's authorities in anticipation of the results of the ongoing negotiations with Centerra Gold Inc. about the restructuring of the Kumtor Project. (31)

Then legal proceedings were transferred to international courts and continued until the Strategic Environment and Investment Agreement was signed between Centerra Gold Inc. and the Kyrgyz Republic's Government (32, 33). The said Agreement settled all disputes and the existing arbitration and environmental claims. (34) On November 16, 2016, were also adopted amendments to the Water Code permitting commercial activities near the Davydov and Lysyi glaciers (28).

'''3.3 Kumtor's Contribution to Kyrgyzstan's Economy'''
According to preliminary reports of the [http://www.stat.kg/en/ Kyrgyz Republic's National Statistics Committee], Kumtor's impact on Kyrgyzstan's macroeconomic indicators in 2017 looks as follows:

- Kumtor's contribution to Kyrgyzstan's GDP accounted for 9.7%;

- Kumtor's contribution to the aggregate industrial output amounted to 21.1%;

- contributions made within the Kyrgyz Republic in 2017 (including taxes, refining, domestic suppliers, infrastructure, charities, etc.) exceeded US $269,731,000.

Kumtor's total payments made within Kyrgyzstan between 1994 and 2017 exceeded US $3.472 billion. (33) 

==4. Outlook for 2018==
Kumtor’s 2018 gold production forecast is expected to be in the range of 450,000 to 500,000 ounces or 14.15 to 15.55 tonnes. Total capital expenditures, excluding capitalized stripping, are forecast to be US $63 million. Growth capital investment is forecast at US $14 million primarily related to tailings dam construction ($9 million). Capitalized stripping costs are expected to be approximately $122 to $168 million. (34)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3137">'''Lisboa e Vale do Tejo''' ({{IPA-pt|liʒˈboɨ i vaɫ du ˈtɛʒu}}; {{lang-en|Lisbon and Tagus Valley}}) was one of the five [[Regions of Portugal]] ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] II subdivisions). Today two of the subregions are in the new [[Lisboa Region]], two in the [[Centro Region]] and one in the [[Alentejo Region]].

The region still exists as the area of intervention of the CDDR planning region.

It had 3,447,173 inhabitants (2001), and its area was 11,930&amp;nbsp;km².

==NUTS II region and area of intervention of the CCDR-LVT==

"Despite the territorial configuration for statistical purposes (National Statistical System in Portugal), in force since 2007, matching the NUTS II the Lisbon, Region Greater Lisbon (AML) - composed only NUTSIII Greater Lisbon and Setúbal Peninsula - the area of intervention of the CCDRLVT - Steering Committee and Regional Development, abbreviated to CCDR - (the Lisbon and the Tagus Valley), continues to be composed of 5 NUTSIII (Sub-regions: Greater Lisbon, Setúbal Peninsula, Middle Tagus, and Lezíria West Coast). 

For the Regional Funds, management responsibilities under the policy of the European Union in Portugal, this regions it's the region of Lisbon that consists of Grande Lisboa and Península de Setúbal, for regional planning (Run, monitor and evaluate, at regional level, policies on environment, nature conservation, land management and city) the region is called Lisbon and the Tagus Valley (LVT), composed by 5 NUTSIII (Sub-regions: Greater Lisbon, Setúbal Peninsula, Middle Tagus, and Lezíria West Coast)." ([[Talk:Lisboa Region]])

==Sub-regions==
The region includes five sub-regions ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] III subdivisions):
* [[Grande Lisboa]]
* [[Lezíria do Tejo]]
* [[Médio Tejo Subregion|Médio Tejo]]
* [[Oeste Subregion|Oeste]]
* [[Península de Setúbal]]

About NUTS II only: since 2002, the subregion [[Lezíria do Tejo]] was reinstated to the [[Alentejo Region]] and the [[Médio Tejo Subregion|Médio Tejo]] and [[Oeste Subregion|Oeste]] were reinstated to the [[Centro Region]].  The region changed the name from '''Lisboa e Vale do Tejo''' to [[Lisboa, Region|Lisboa]], its current designation.

==Other subdivisions==
The five subregions together contain 51 [[Municipalities of Portugal|municipality]], which have a combined total of 525 parishes.

 |ProdCode=IPEA358Y
 |ShortSummary=Susan and Steve's relationship has become complacent; whenever she asks for an opinion, he answers, "It's up to you," and whenever he gets up to go anywhere, she asks, "Where are you going?" Meanwhile, Susan is having issues with her new [[French people|French]] client, Giselle, referred to her by Julia. After chewing out Giselle in fluent [[French language|French]], a man starts hitting on her, mistakingly assuming her to be French, and Susan goes along with it instead of setting him straight. She then discovers her mobile phone has lost all its numbers. Attempting to phone Steve in her French accent, she accidentally calls Bruce's Bar and Grill, run by [[Australians|Australian]] Dick Darlington. He informs her that his establishment is located next to "Susan's Bar," named after an Englishwoman who slept her way across the continent due to her great love of Australians. Susan, believing herself to be said woman, is mortified. The episode then flashes back to view Steve's day, in which he gives his number to a girl at the bar by mistake. To avoid her, he fabricates "Bruce's Bar and Grill" and his identity as Dick Darlington, and is completely fooled by Susan's accent.

The episode then flashes back again to earlier that morning, with Julia complaining about Giselle to Jeff, and then calling his mobile in a flirty French accent. However, she accidentally reaches ''Susan'' - she and Jeff have identical mobile phones, and they swapped without knowing it at some prior point (thus Susan's missing contacts) - and presents herself as Giselle, leading to Susan's furious rant and the encounter with the other man. After Susan has returned to Steve's place, Steve begs Jeff to claim to be Dick Darlington, while Julia arrives and proclaims herself Giselle. The chain of mistaken identity is broken only when the girl from the bar calls. Everybody hears her conversation with Steve on speakerphone, and Susan, realizing that both she and Steve feel trapped by their life together, decides to leave. "Where are you going," Steve asks her; she replies, "It's up to you."

 |ProdCode=ICEC002S
 |ShortSummary=The episode picks up immediately after the events of the previous series, with Susan leaving Steve's apartment. Though he chases after her, she announces that their [[intimate relationship|relationship]] is over. The remainder of the episode takes place in [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], with dialogue timed to not overlap.

The guys gather at Steve's flat, and the girls at Susan's. Steve attempts to phone Susan several times, but always hangs up on the first ring.  Susan, meanwhile, attempts unsuccessfully to pretend she is not waiting for him to call. She also expresses the fatuity of glamour magazines' sexual advice - "A hundred pages of 'Men are useless bastards' and an article on why you should wake them up with a [[blow job]]!" - and how much Jane's voice makes her grind her teeth. Finally the trios head out - the boys to a strip club, and the girls to drink wine at the [[beauty parlour]] where Sally works.

At the end, both Steve and Susan stagger in the door... the same door. While Steve arrived at 12:30 am, left a drunken [[answerphone]] message for Susan asking her to return, and passed out in his bed, Susan arrives at 1:30am, hears the message, and enters his room to follow the magazine's advice to the letter, dissolving the split screen and causing the narratives to re-unite. Unbeknown to them, though, a drunk Jeff and Patrick are curled up in the corner... and, even worse, Jane phones, setting Susan's teeth on edge as she fellates Steve.

 |ProdCode=ICEC006T
 |ShortSummary=The episode begins with Jeff and Julia trying something kinky while Steve and Susan fight because Steve finds a suspicious looking freckle on his bottom and is upset that Susan has not noticed it. Jane introduces her new [[celibate]] boyfriend, James, to the group, when Jeff rushes in, still wearing a black, leather mask (from his and Julia's kinky [[role-play]]ing), to ask the group how long "[[intestine]]s take", meaning how long does it take for something to pass through the body. Jeff realises that he is wearing the mask, so he runs back to Julia, who' is still tied to the bed. Jeff swallowed the key to the [[handcuffs]] and as Jeff is talking to Julia about why he ran off, the doorbell rings. As Julia realizes that Jeff has lost the key, her ex-boyfriend, Joe (who has just returned from Iraq) turns up and demands to see her. Joe claims that he is still in a relationship with Julia, despite not having seen her for two years. As the group talks, Jane relaxes Steve by telling him that he has always had that mole. James discovers that Susan was his girlfriend in college. At the end of the episode, James tells Jane that he is going to Germany for a few months.

 |ShortSummary=Worried that she is pregnant, Sally asks all of the girls to take a [[pregnancy test]] so that she knows what a negative test looks like. One of the tests is positive, but, as the tests have been mixed up due to Sally's anxiety, there is confusion over who really is pregnant. Susan is quickly ruled out as being pregnant as she and Steve are trying to have a baby, but there is a problem: it would be a miracle if Susan could conceive. Sally and Jane could still be the ones pregnant as Jane had sex with a pizza delivery guy at Jeff's flat a few weeks earlier when she was feeling "desperate" and Jeff had left the flat to help Steve. A week after Sally confessed her love to Patrick, he finally tells her that he loves her as well, as Jane bursts through and gleefully shouts that although she has "shagged and shagged and shagged...all the lil bastards missed". At that moment, James returns from Germany and Sally thinks that she must be the one who is pregnant. As Patrick believes that Sally is pregnant, Susan walks into the bar and tells everybody that Sally is not pregnant and that it is she who is.

'''Archaeological sites in Colombia''' are numerous and diverse, including findings and [[archaeological excavation]]s that have taken place in the area now covered by the [[Republic of Colombia]]. The archaeological finds and features cover all periods since the [[paleolithic]], representing different aspects of the various cultures of ancient [[precolumbian]] civilizations, such as the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Quimbaya]] and [[Tairona]] among many others. Preservation and investigation of these sites are controlled mainly by the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Ministry of Culture]], the National Institute of [[Anthropology]] and History, and the [[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Bank of the Republic]]. The lack of funding to protect sites and enforce existing laws, results in large scale looting and illegal trading of artifacts.

This is a list of former [[stock exchange]]s in the Americas, including [[North America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean Islands]]. Year of formation and the year the exchange was acquired, liquidated, or folded are also included. Some of these exchanges remain active as subsidiaries or divisions of other current exchanges (''see [[List of stock exchanges in the Americas|current stock exchanges in the Americas]]''). See ''[[regional stock exchanges]]'' for a related list of American stock exchanges, both active and defunct. 

When the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] formed in 1934, a total of 24 securities exchanges registered with the SEC, while 19 received temporary exemptions from registration. Ten stock exchanges closed after the SEC was created, while others decided to stop trading in securities.&lt;ref name=markham/&gt; The [[National Stock Exchange (Jersey City, New Jersey)|National Stock Exchange]] ceased trading operations on May 30, 2014, bringing the number of active stock exchanges in the [[United States]] to 11.

The '''Premier of Prince Edward Island''' is the [[first minister]] for the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Prince Edward Island]]. They are the province's [[head of government]] and ''de facto'' chief executive.

[[Prince Edward Island]] was a British [[crown colony]] before it joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1873. It has had a system of [[responsible government]] since 1851, and the province kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters after joining Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=gen&amp;document=chap1&amp;dir=his&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false|title=A History of the Vote in Canada  |publisher=Elections Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Edward Island has a unicameral [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] [[parliamentary government]], in which the Premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island|Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1SEC826774|title=Government Institutions |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Premier is Prince Edward Island's [[head of government]], and the [[Queen of Canada]] is its [[head of state]] and is represented by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/lg/about.php3|title=The Office of Lieutenant Governor |publisher=Government of Prince Edward Island }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the [[Executive Council of Prince Edward Island]], and presides over that body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/ec/index.php3|title=Executive Council  |publisher=Government of Prince Edward Island }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members are first elected to the legislature during [[List of Prince Edward Island general elections|general elections]]. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the Premier may ask for early [[Dissolution of parliament#Canada|dissolution]] of the Legislative Assembly. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.electionspei.ca/provincial/guide/|title=Guide to Provincial General Elections |publisher=Elections Prince Edward Island }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Edward Island has had 45&amp;nbsp;government leaders since it became a colony in 1851. The province had 11&amp;nbsp;Premiers while a colony and 34&amp;nbsp;Premiers after Confederation, of which 18 were from the [[Prince Edward Island Progressive Conservative Party]] and 27 were from the [[Prince Edward Island Liberal Party]]. The current Premier is [[Wade MacLauchlan]], since February 23, 2015. MacLauchlan is the first member of the [[Order of Canada]] to become premier of a province, the first openly gay Premier of Prince Edward Island, and the first openly gay man to be premier of a province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wherry|first1=Aaron|title=Wade MacLauchlan: P.E.I.’s optimist-in-chief|url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/pei-premier/|accessdate=1 May 2015|work=Macleans|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mont Agel''' is a [[mountain]] located on the border between [[France]] and [[Monaco]]. The summit of this mount, at {{convert|1148|m|ft|0}} above sea level, is situated on the French side, but the highest point of Monaco, lying on a pathway named [[Chemin des Révoires]], is situated on its slopes, at an altitude of 161 metres (528&amp;nbsp;feet).

==History==
The top of Mont Agel is occupied by [[Nice Air Base]], itself built on the former [[Ouvrage Mont Agel]] of the [[Alpine Line]] fortifications.

On 18 June 2011, a light aircraft crashed onto Mont Agel, killing two British people. The plane was on a private flight, and was en route from Italy to [[Troyes]] at the time of the crash. Conditions were foggy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13823227&lt;/ref&gt;

Mont Agel is the site of the Monte Carlo Golf Club, formerly home of the [[Monte Carlo Open (golf)|Monte Carlo Open]]. The club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011.

'''Roc Agel''', purchased by [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco]] as a summer family residence, is located high on the slopes of Mont Agel.

'''Natural resource management''' refers to the management of [[natural resource]]s such as [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, with a particular focus on how management affects the [[quality of life]] for both present and future generations ([[stewardship]]).

Natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural [[landscapes]] interact. It brings together land use planning, water management, [[Conservation biology|biodiversity conservation]], and the future sustainability of industries like [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[tourism]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Resilient landscapes and communities  managing natural resources in New South Wales|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208173746/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and [[ecology]] and the life-supporting capacity of those resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Massey University|url=http://study.massey.ac.nz/massey/students/studymassey/programme.cfm?major_code=2261&amp;prog_code=93013|title=Bachelor of Applied Science (Natural Resource Management)|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmental management]] is also similar to natural resource management. In academic contexts, the [[Rural sociology|sociology of natural resources]] is closely related to, but distinct from, natural resource management.

==History==
[[File:US-DOI-BureauOfLandManagement-Logo.svg|thumb|right|135px|The [[Bureau of Land Management]] in the United States manages America's [[public land]]s, totaling approximately 264 million acres (1,070,000 km2) or one-eighth of the landmass of the country.]]

The emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of [[North America]]n [[rangeland]]s in the late 19th century, and the [[Conservation movement|resource conservation]] movement of the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley University of California: Geography: [http://geography.berkeley.edu/programcourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf Geog 175: Topics in the History of Natural Resource Management: Spring 2006: Rangelands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611112307/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Department of Geography: GEOG 657/ENVS 657:  Natural Resource Management:  Biotic Resources: [http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf Natural Resource Management and Environmental History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217101744/http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources. A more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social, cultural, economic and political aspects of resource management.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thakadu |first=O. T. |year=2005 |title=Success factors in community based natural resources management in northern Botswana: Lessons from practice |journal=Natural Resources Forum |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=199–212 |doi=10.1111/j.1477-8947.2005.00130.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more holistic, national and even global form evolved, from the [[Brundtland Commission]] and the advocacy of [[sustainable development]].

In 2005 the government of [[New South Wales]], established a ''Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;NSW Government 2005, Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management, NSW Natural Resources Commission, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the consistency of practice, based on an [[adaptive management]] approach.

In the [[United States]], the most active areas of natural resource management are [[wildlife management]] often associated with [[ecotourism]] and [[rangeland management]]. In [[Australia]], water sharing, such as the [[Murray Darling Basin|Murray Darling Basin Plan]] and [[catchment management]] are also significant.

==Ownership regimes==

Natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], natural resources:

* State property:  Ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state. Individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources, but only at the permission of the state. National forest, National parks and military reservations are some US  examples.

* Private property: Any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity. Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). Private land is the most common example.

* Common property: It is a private property of a group. The group may vary in size, nature and internal structure e.g. indigenous neighbours of village. Some examples of common property are community forests.

* Non-property (open access): There is no definite owner of these properties. Each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish. These areas are the most exploited. It is said that "Everybody's property is nobody's property". An example is a lake fishery. [[Common land]] may exist without ownership, in which case in the UK it is vested in a local authority.

* Hybrid: Many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above, so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes. An example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in NSW, Australia, where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation, but where most native vegetation exists on private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/nvact.htm|title=Native Vegetation Act 2003|publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholder analysis==

[[Stakeholder analysis]] originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into [[natural resource]] management in ever growing popularity. Stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources.&lt;ref name="Dandy"&gt;Dandy, N. et al. (2009) ‘Who's in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management,’ Journal of Environmental Management, vol. 90, pp. 1933–1949&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below. Especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder.&lt;ref name="Billgrena"&gt;Billgrena, C., Holme, H. (2008) ‘Approaching reality: Comparing stakeholder analysis and cultural theory in the context of natural resource management,’ Land Use Policy, vol. 25, pp. 550–562&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised.

Billgrena and Holme&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt; identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management:

*Identify and categorise the stakeholders that may have influence
*Develop an understanding of why changes occur
*Establish who can make changes happen
*How to best manage natural resources

This gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grimble, R|date=1998|title=Stakeholder methodologies in natural resource management, Socioeconomic Methodologies|publisher=Chatham: Natural Resources Institute|pages=1–12|url=http://www.nri.org/old/publications/bpg/bpg02.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous stakeholder theories such as Mitchell et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell, R. K.|date=1997|title=TOWARD A THEORY OF STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION AND SALIENCE: DEFINING THE PRINCIPLE OF WHO AND WHAT REALLY COUNTS|publisher=Academy of Management Review|volume=22|number=4|pages=853–886|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt; created a framework of stages for a Stakeholder Analysis in natural resource management. Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;  designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management.

'''Stages in Stakeholder analysis:'''&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;
#        Clarify objectives of the analysis
#       Place issues in a systems context
#        Identify decision-makers and stakeholders
#         Investigate stakeholder interests and agendas
#           Investigate patterns of inter-action and dependence  (e.g. conflicts and compatibilities, trade-offs and synergies)

'''Application:'''

Grimble and Wellard&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt; established that Stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as;

*	Cross-cutting systems and stakeholder interests
*	Multiple uses and users of the resource.
*	[[Market failure]]
*	[[Subtractability]] and temporal trade-offs
*	Unclear or [[open-access]] [[property rights]]
*	Untraded products and services
*	[[Poverty]] and under-representation&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

'''Case studies:'''

In the case of the [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]], a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the Batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people's livelihoods and loss of life.&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

Nepal, Indonesia and Koreas' [[community forestry#5Best Practices|community forestry]] are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources. This allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests.

'''Criticisms:'''

*	Natural resource management stakeholder analysis tends to include too many stakeholders which can create problems in of its self as suggested by Clarkson. ‘‘Stakeholder theory should not be used to weave a basket big enough to hold the world's misery.’’&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, M.B.E. (1994) A risk based model of stakeholder theory. Toronto: Working Paper, University of Toronto, pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Starik&lt;ref&gt;Starik, M. (1995) ‘Should trees have managerial standing? Toward stakeholder status for non-human nature,’ Journal of Business Ethics, vol. 14, pp. 207–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that nature needs to be represented as stakeholder. However this has been rejected by many scholars as it would be difficult to find appropriate representation and this representation could also be disputed by other stakeholders causing further issues.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;
*	Stakeholder analysis can be used exploited and abused in order to marginalise other stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Dandy" /&gt;
*	Identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Prell"&gt;Prell, C., et al. (2007) Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis in Natural Resource Management. Leeds: Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;
*	On-going conflicts and lack of trust between stakeholders can prevent compromise and resolutions.&lt;ref name="Prell" /&gt;

'''Alternatives/ Complementary forms of analysis:'''

*	[[Social network analysis]]
*	[[Common pool resource]]

==Management of the resources==

Natural resource management issues are inherently complex. They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.

After the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.

The various approaches applied to natural resource management include:

* Top-down (command and control)
* Community-based natural resource management
* [[Adaptive]] management
* Precautionary approach
* Integrated natural resource management

=== Community-based natural resource management ===

The community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005" /&gt; When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, E,  Schroeder, L and Wynne, S 1993. Institutional incentives and sustainable development: infrastructure policies in perspective. Westview Press. Oxford, UK. 266 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]].

The United Nations advocates CBNRM in the Convention on Biodiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Unless clearly defined, decentralised NRM can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e.g. forest communities in central Kalimantan (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, T Andersson, K, Jager P and Van Laerhoven 2008 The contribution of Institutional Theories for explaining [[Decentralization]] of Natural Resource Governance. Society and Natural Resources, 21:160-174 {{doi|10.1080/08941920701617973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem of CBNRM is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development, biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kellert, S|author2=Mehta, J|author3=Ebbin, S|author4=Litchtenfeld, L.|date=2000|title=Community natural resource management: promise, rhetoric, and reality|publisher=Society and Natural Resources, 13:705-715|url=http://biologicalcapital.com/art/Article-%20Community%20Natural%20Resource%20Management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and conflicting interests of CBNRM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brosius, J.|author2=Peter Tsing|author3=Anna Lowenhaupt|author4=Zerner, Charles|date=1998 |title=Representing communities: Histories and politics of community-based natural resource management |journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources|publisher=Society &amp; Natural Resources: An International Journal |volume=11 |issue=2|pages=157–168|url=http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/08941929809381069|accessdate=27 October 2014|doi=10.1080/08941929809381069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twyman, C 2000.

Understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based NRM. Locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits.

CBNRM is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities, on the one hand, and national and transnational organizations, on the other, to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shackleton, S|author2=Campbell, B|author3=Wollenberg, E|author4=Edmunds, D.|date=March 2002|title=Devolution and community-based natural resource management: creating space for local people to participate and benefit? |publisher=ODI, Natural Resource Perspectives|number=76|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3646/76-devolution-community-based-natural-resource-management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues, employment, diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity.

Caring for our Country is an Australian Government initiative jointly administered by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. These Departments share responsibility for delivery of the Australian Government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs, which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of ‘natural resource management’. These programs have been delivered regionally, through 56 State government bodies, successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|title=PROGRESS TOWARDS HEALTHY RESILIENT LANDSCAPES IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARD, TARGETS AND CATCHMENT ACTION PLANS|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217095859/http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|archivedate=17 February 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=27 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management. In the State of NSW, the 13 [[Catchment Management Authority of (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) are overseen by the [http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/ Natural Resources Commission] (NRC), responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+102+2003+cd+0+N/?autoquery=%28Content%3D%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29%20AND%20%28%28Type%3D%22act%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%20OR%20%28Type%3D%22subordleg%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%29&amp;dq=Document%20Types%3D%22Acts,%20Regs%22,%20Any%20Words%3D%22natural%20resources%20commission%22,%20Search%20In%3D%22Text%22&amp;fullquery=%28%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29|title=NSW Legislation|publisher=Legislation.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptive management===
The primary methodological approach adopted by [[Catchment Management Authority (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) for regional natural resource management in Australia is [[adaptive management]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of ‘plan-do-review-act’. It also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice:
*	Determination of scale
*	Collection and use of knowledge
*	[[Information management]]
*	Monitoring and evaluation
*	[[Risk management]]
*	[[Community engagement]]
*	Opportunities for [[collaboration]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Integrated natural resource management ===
Integrated natural resource management (INRM) is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way, which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use (biophysical, socio-political, and economic) meet production goals of producers and other direct users (e.g., food security, profitability, risk aversion) as well as goals of the wider community (e.g., poverty alleviation, welfare of future generations, environmental conservation). It focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself, reducing possible future conflicts. The conceptual basis of INRM has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use, participatory planning, integrated watershed management, and adaptive management.&lt;ref name="Conservation Ecology 52: 25"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lovell, C.|author2=Mandondo A.|author3=Moriarty P.|date=2002|title=The question of scale in integrated natural resource management|publisher=Conservation Ecology 5(2): 25|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol5/iss2/art25/|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling C.S pages 328"&gt;Holling C.S. and Meffe, G.

==Frameworks and modelling==
There are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management.

'''Geographic Information Systems (GIS)'''

[[GIS]] is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links. A bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall, cleared land and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Harding R., 1998, Environmental Decision-Making: The Role of Scientists, Engineers and the Public, Federation Press, Leichhardt. pp366.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, Metadata Directories such as NDAR provide data on Australian natural resources such as vegetation, fisheries, soils and water.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, C and Attwater, R (1996) Usage of, and demand for Environmental Statistics in Australia, in Tracking Progress: Linking Environment and Economy Through Indicators and Accounting Systems Conference Papers, 1996 Australian Academy of Science Fenner Conference on the Environment, Institute of Environmental Studies, UNSW, Sydney, 30 September to 3 October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation.

'''Natural Resources Management Audit Frameworks'''

The NSW Government in Australia has published an audit framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|format=PDF|title=Framework for Auditing the  Implementation of Catchment Action Plans|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621122515/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for natural resource management, to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management. This audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies, including [[performance audit]], [[environmental audit]] and [[internal audit]]. Audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders, identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|format=PDF|title=MURRAY CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY : Audit Report|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621120858/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riskaudit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Nature-audit-NZ-Accountants-Journal-March-2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nature Audit|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting, which closely follows Australian Standards for Assurance Engagements.

The Australian Government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management, focussing on the implementation of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.

==Other elements==
;Biodiversity Conservation

The issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management. What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer&lt;ref&gt;Gaston, KJ &amp; Spicer, JI 2004, Biodiversity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing Company, Malden.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;3) point out that biodiversity is "the variety of life" and relate to different kinds of "biodiversity organization". According to Gray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gray, JS|date=1997|title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats and conservation needs|url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172744/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.

;Precautionary Biodiversity Management

The "threats" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; [[habitat fragmentation]], putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of "alien species" and "climate change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooney, R|date=2004|title=The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management|publisher=IUCN Policy and Global Change Series|number=2|url=http://pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509063720/http://www.pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;( p.&amp;nbsp;2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.

;Concrete "policy tools"

Cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on "evidences", relating to "high standard of proof", the forbidding of special "activities" and "information and monitoring requirements". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of "activities" is regarded as a critical and "irreversible" endangerment, these "activities" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to "catch fish" by using explosives and toxicants.

;Administration and guidelines

According to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;

# "[[Ecosystem-based management]]" including "more risk-averse and precautionary management", where "given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure, function, and inter-specific interactions, precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management".
# "[[Adaptive management]]" is "a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems".
# "[[Environmental impact assessment]]" and exposure ratings decrease the "uncertainties" of precaution, even though it has deficiencies, and
# "Protectionist approaches", which "most frequently links to" biodiversity conservation in natural resources management.

;Land management

In order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young&lt;ref&gt;Young, A 1998, Land resources: now and for the future, Cambridge University Press, UK&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises some important points of land management:

* Comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem, water, soils
* Using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations
* Cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills

Dale et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dale, VH, Brown, S, Hawuber, RA, Hobbs, NT, Huntly, Nj Naiman, RJ, Riebsame, WE, Turner, MG &amp; Valone, TJ 2000, ‘Ecological guidelines for land use and management’, in Dale, VH &amp; Hawuber, RA (eds), Applying ecological principles to land management, Springer-Verlag, NY&lt;/ref&gt; study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them. The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways.It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:

* Examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, and the effects on natural resources.
* Plan for long-term change and unexpected events.
* Preserve rare landscape elements and associated species.
* Avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.
* Retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats.
* Minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species.
* Avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes.
* Implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area.

{{wiktionary|measured mile}}
A '''nautical measured mile''' is a [[nautical mile]] which is marked by two pairs of towers. A mile is measure by sailing on a given [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] and lining up the pairs of towers.  The start of the mile is recorded when the first pair of towers line up and the end of the mile recorded when the second pair line up.

To accurately measure performance ships must make at least four to six runs in both directions to allow for the wind and tide.    
                 
There are several nautical measured miles around the British Isles:

'''Padewakang''' were traditional boat used by the [[Bugis]], Mandar, and [[Makassar people|Makassar]] people of [[South Sulawesi]]. Padewakang were used for long distance voyages serving the [[south Sulawesi]] kingdoms. 

== Etymology ==
No-one quite seems to know the origin of the name ''padewakang,'' though some have suggested that it stems from Dewakang Island, an important navigational landmark between Sulawesi and Java. Dutch records from the 1735 mention letters from Sulawesi arriving in Batavia ‘per Paduakkang’.&lt;ref&gt;Nationaal Archief Nederland, 1.04.02.8207: 13&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Horridge, the word “''padewakang'', ''paduwakang''” (Sulawesi) and “''paduwang''” ([[Madura Island|Madura]]) have its roots from word ''wa'', ''wangka'', ''waga'', ''wangga'', and ''bangka'' of Austronesian languages. The term is associated with outrigger [[perahu]] or small perahu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Prahu: Traditional Sailing Boat of Indonesia|last=Horridge|first=Adrian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1981|isbn=0195804996|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
It typically weights between 20 to 50 tons, had one or two masts with [[Tanja sail|tanja sails]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Indian Archipelago: Its History and Present State|last=John|first=St.|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=1853|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other traditional vessels of the archipelago, it is steered using 2 quarter rudders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antropologi Dan Sejarah Dalam Kearifan Tempatan|last=Zainun|first=Nazarudin|publisher=Penerbit USM|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the end of the 16th century to early 20th century they routinely sailed for the coasts of northern [[Australia]] in search of [[Sea cucumber|teripang]], armed with cannon of ancient origin, probably [[cetbang]] or [[lantaka]]. Padewakang were the biggest craft of South Sulawesi as trading vessel and as war fleets, used for hundreds of years sailing the seas between western [[New Guinea]], the southern parts of the Philippines, and the [[Malay Peninsula|Malayan peninsula]]. There is even a Dutch publication of padewakang under full sail in [[Persian Gulf|Persian gulf]]. They are used until the production stopped in favor of the famous [[Pinisi]] by the 20th century. The pinisi evolved from basic padewakang hull with fore-and-aft sails to its own hull model with indigenous "pinisi rig".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;2004 Horst H. Liebner'', Malayologist, Expert Staff of the Agency for Marine and Fisheries Research, Department of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of the Republic of Indonesia''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution to Pinisi ==
According to Horst Liebner, a Mandar maritime expert, pinisi sail originally mounted onto the hull of a padded boat and the like; however, when the sailors and craftsmen are increasingly aware of the way they are used, they selected only the ''palari'' (derived from ''lari'' - "to run") hull - a very pointed hull type and it is indeed the one that best suits the secondary sail.

This evolution takes place in several stages: The hull type is designed with more pointed and enhanced with some additional boards that causing the deck of the bow becomes lower than the main deck and the stern, and that the construction of the rolling beams seems to 'fly' behind stern boat (Konjo language : ''palari salompong ambeng rua kali''); the next part of the stern deck (''ambeng'') is continued until the steering beams merge with it (''palari salompong''); and the last step is to increase the bow height so that the entire deck becomes straight.

This last type of hull is used until the pinisi boat is replaced with PLM (motorized sailboat) type. In the early 1970s thousands of pinisi-palari ships measuring up to 200 tonnes of cargo, the world's largest commercial sailing fleet at the time, had contacted all corners of the [[Indian Ocean]] and became the trading backbone of the people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Replica ==

* One replica named "''Hati Marege''" (Heart of [[Arnhem Land]]) is exhibited in [[Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory|Northern Territory Museum of Arts &amp; Gallery]]. It is a replica of padewakang used in search of Australian sea cucumber before 1906-1907 Australian ban on Makassan trepangers.
* A replica is exhibited at ''Les Royaumes de la mer'' (Kingdoms of the Sea) in [[La Boverie]], [[Liège]], [[Belgium]].

'''The physical geography of [[Euskal Herria]]''' is very diverse despite the small size of the region. The territory hosts a blend of green and brown to yellowish tones, featuring hilly terrain altogether. The [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] spreads from the rough coastal landscape to the semi-desert of the Bardenas on the south-eastern fringes of Navarre.

[[File:Euskalherria landsat.jpg|thumb|The view of the Basque Country from the landsat satellite]]

The main natural limits of the Basque Country are the [[Cantabrian Sea]] (south [[Bay of Biscay]]) in the north and in the west side, and in the south side, the [[Ebro]] river. The highest point in the Basque Country is the [[Hiru Erregeen Mahaia]] peak (2438 m high).

==Coast==
[[File:20060623-Plentzia Bahia.jpg|thumb|The Butroe river joins the sea in Plentzia]]
The coast of the Basque Country has three sides. The coast of Biscay is rough but in general there are big beaches. There are also at least two big estuaries, that of [[Ibaizabal]] (known also as the Ría de Bilbao) and [[Urdaibai]].

The coast of Gipuzkoa shows a more rugged terrain and in general the slopes are steeper. From the limit of Biscay to [[Zumaia]] there are smaller beaches and they are more rocky. East of Zumaia, they are larger and longer. When different rivers join the sea, small estuaries can be found ([[Oria (river)|Oria]]), and in the others, maritime branches ([[Urumea]], [[Bidasoa]]).

The coast of [[Lapurdi]] is flatter. The beaches are longer and the slopes gentler. The rivers [[Bidasoa]] and [[Adour]] join the ocean in Lapurdi.

==Mountains==
[[File:Ailuitz1.jpg|thumb|The Aliutz mountain (Biscay)]]
The Basque country is mountainous. Most of the mountains are along an east-west axis, at the west of the [[Pyrenees]].

The most important rock there is [[limestone]], but there are also mountains composed of other materials. For example, [[Aiako Harria]] is composed of [[granite]].

The highest mountain is Hiru Errege Maila.

The south of [[Álava]] and [[Navarre]] is the middle east limit of [[Cantabrian Mountains]]. There are mountains like Kodes and Toloño. Between those importants mountains there are Euskal mendiak: [[Urbasa]], [[Andia]], [[Aralar Range|Aralar]], [[Anboto]], Ordunte or [[Aizkorri]].

==Rivers==
The [[Ebro]] is the largest river which crosses the Basque Country. It is 910&amp;nbsp;km long, and flows along the southern boundary of the Basque Country before it joins [[Mediterranean Sea|the Mediterranean sea]]. On its way east, the Ebro harvests the water of a string of tributaries, such as [[Zadorra]], Baias, [[Ega (river)|Ega]] and [[Aragón (river)|Aragon]]. Aragon's course is the longest, at 192&amp;nbsp;km. The river rises in Astun, located in Aragon; it flows down past the Esa reservoir, and crosses thereafter eastern Navarre until it joins the river of Ebro.

Aturri, which joins the sea in the coast of Basque Country, is the largest river and has the biggest water flow. Its source is in Tourmalet and it joins the sea in Baiona, crosses 335&amp;nbsp;km of land, the last 30&amp;nbsp;km of which are in Basque Country. It has several tributaries from the Pyrenees, including the Biduze, Errobi, and [[Aran (river)|Aran]]. Like Aturri, other Basque rivers join the sea in the Bay of Biscay, such as Nerbioi, Bidasoa, Oria, Deba, Urola, and Urumea.  The Nerbioi is the longest such river in the Basque Country, with a length of 75&amp;nbsp;km.

==Forests==
The forest of Irati is the largest in the Basque Country, and one of the main beech forests in Europe. It covers parts of [[Lower Navarre]], [[Zuberoa]] and Spanish Navarre.

Otherwise, from [[Sakana]] to [[Aezkoa]] extending all over the north of Navarre, [[deciduous forests]] abound. These breed of trees can be also found on the east of Álava, in the region called Mendialdea and Araialdea, and in [[Zuberoa]] and Lower Navarre. They exist in Gipuzkoa too, in the middle of [[Urola]] and in Aralar.

In Biscay, there are [[evergreen forests]] throughout 66% of the province.  The main exceptions of this are some places of [[Enkarterri]] and in [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] ([[Urkiola Natural Park]]). In Gipuzkoa, 56% of the trees there are conifers, but in Álava they consist of only 28% of the trees.

Currently, 55% of Basque Country is covered by trees, and in Navarre the figure is 45%.

==Desert==
[[Bardenas Reales|The natural park of Barde]] is the biggest [[desert]], and is located in the south east of Navarre. It is 41.845 hectares in area. It is 45&amp;nbsp;km from north to south, and 24&amp;nbsp;km from west to east.

In Germany, military test rockets were launched in [[Peenemünde]] (including [[Greifswalder Oie]]) and [[Cuxhaven]], and larger non-military rockets were launched in [[Hespenbusch]], [[Rocket experiments in the area of Cuxhaven|Cuxhaven]] and [[Zingst]].
In World War II, [[V-2 rocket|A4]]-rockets were also launched as weapons from several western areas of Germany.  Several launchpads were also constructed for the [[Bachem Ba 349]] (also known as Natter), developed in 1944/45.

==Peenemünde==
From [[Test stand VII]], the most important launchpad for test rockets in Peenemünde, the mud wall, the channel for static tests, the concrete slab used for launches and some remains of the assembly hall still exist. The area is not open to tourists.

==Greifswalder Oie==
From the former launchpad, a piece of rail and the former observation shelter still exist.  The area is open to tourists.

==Cuxhaven==
In the area of Cuxhaven, a launchpad was constructed only for [[Operation Backfire (WWII)|Operation Backfire]].  Launches for other operations in this area were made from mobile pads.  A trench and some shelter remnants of the Backfire launchpad still exist.  Also, the old Navy shelter used [[Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft]] as control shelter still exists.  The area is open to tourists.

==Hespenbusch==
In Hespenbusch only small rockets were launched from mobile launch pads.

==Zingst==
In Zingst, a lighted roadway indicates that there was once an important facility.  It is possible that the concrete slab on which the launchpad stood still exists.

==Liebenau==
In Liebenau, the concrete slab probably still exists, which was used for launching the last A4-rockets in World War II in Germany in April 1945.

==Launch sites for war use of A4==
The war launches of A4 were made from mobile launch sites, for which no permanent construction was necessary.  Nevertheless, there are at some sites concrete pads still in existence (in Hillscheid, for example).

==Launch sites for Bachem Ba 349==
On the Ochsenkopf high ground in [[Lager Heuberg]] near [[Stetten am kalten Markt]], there is still the concrete pad from which the first manned launch of a [[Bachem Ba 349]] that took place on 1 March 1945, which ended with the pilot [[Lothar Sieber]] being killed.  The site is on an active ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' military exercise area and therefore is not open to tourists.

Three other launch sites for the unmanned [[Bachem Ba 349]] test flights are situated in the [[Bachem Ba 349|Hasenholz forest]] near [[Kirchheim/Teck]]. This area is accessible for the public.

'''Shear Velocity''', also called '''friction velocity''', is a form by which a [[shear stress]] may be re-written in units of [[velocity]]. It is useful as a method in [[fluid mechanics]] to compare true velocities, such as the velocity of a flow in a stream, to a velocity that relates shear between layers of flow.

Shear velocity is used to describe shear-related motion in moving fluids. It is used to describe:
* [[Diffusion]] and [[Dispersion (water waves)|dispersion]] of particles, tracers, and contaminants in fluid flows
* The velocity profile near the boundary of a flow (see [[Law of the wall]])
* Transport of sediment in a channel

Shear velocity also helps in thinking about the rate of shear and dispersion in a flow. Shear velocity scales well to rates of dispersion and bedload sediment transport. A general rule is that the shear velocity is between 5% to 10% of the mean flow velocity.

For river base case, the shear velocity can be calculated by Manning's equation.

:&lt;math&gt;u^*=\langle u\rangle\frac{n}{a}(gR_h^{-1/3})^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;
* ''n'' is the Gauckler–Manning coefficient. Units for values of n are often left off, however it is not dimensionless, having units of: (T/[L&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;]; s/[ft&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;]; s/[m&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;]).
* ''R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the hydraulic radius (L; ft, m);
* the role of a is a dimension correct factor. Thus a= 1 m&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;/s = 1.49&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;/s.
Instead of finding &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_h&lt;/math&gt; for your specific river of interest, you can examine the range of possible values and note that for most rivers, &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt; is between 5% and 10% of &lt;math&gt;\langle u\rangle&lt;/math&gt;:

For general case
:&lt;math&gt;u_{\star}=\sqrt{\frac{\tau}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''τ'' is the shear stress in an arbitrary layer of fluid and ''ρ'' is the [[density]] of the fluid.

Typically, for sediment transport applications, the shear velocity is evaluated at the lower boundary of an open channel:

:&lt;math&gt;u_{\star}=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_b}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''τ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the shear stress given at the boundary.

Shear velocity can also be defined in terms of the local velocity and shear stress fields (as opposed to whole-channel values, as given above).

==Friction Velocity in Turbulence==
The friction velocity is often used as a scaling parameter for the fluctuating component of velocity in turbulent flows.&lt;ref name="Schlicting"&gt;{{cite book|first1=H. |last1=Schlichting |first2=K. |last2=Gersten |title=Boundary-Layer Theory |edition=8th |publisher=Springer 1999 |ISBN=978-81-8128-121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of obtaining the shear velocity is through [[Non-dimensionalization and scaling of the Navier–Stokes equations|non-dimensionalization]] of the turbulent equations of motion. For example, in a fully developed turbulent channel flow or turbulent boundary layer, the streamwise momentum equation in the very near wall region reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; 0={\nu}{\partial^2 \overline{u}\over \partial y^2}-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(\overline{u'v'}) &lt;/math&gt;.

By integrating in the ''y''-direction once, then non-dimensionalizing with an unknown velocity scale ''u''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; and viscous length scale {{sfrac|''ν''|''u''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the equation reduces down to:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\tau_w}{\rho} = \nu\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} - \overline{u'v'}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\tau_w}{\rho u_{\star}^2} = \frac{\partial u^+}{\partial y^+} + \overline{\tau_T^+}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the right hand side is in non-dimensional variables, they must be of order 1. This results in the left hand side also being of order one, which in turn give us a velocity scale for the turbulent fluctuations (as seen above):

:&lt;math&gt;u_{\star} = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_w}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, ''τ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' refers to the local shear stress at the wall.


==Planetary boundary layer==
Within the lowest portion of the [[planetary boundary layer]] a semi-empirical [[log wind profile]] is commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds.
The simplified equation that describe it is
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u(z) = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \left[\ln \left(\frac{z-d}{z_0} \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Von Kármán constant]] (~0.41), &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the zero plane displacement (in metres).

The zero-plane displacement (&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.  It can be approximated as &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the average height of the obstacles.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"&gt;Holmes JD. Wind Loading of Structures. 3rd ed. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m.

Thus, you can extract the friction velocity by knowing the wind velocity at two levels (z).
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u_* = \frac{\kappa(u(z2)-u(z1))}{\ln \left(\frac{z2-d}{z1-d} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/CENTER&gt;

The '''Solid image''' is a geomatic ([[Geomatics]]) product giving the possibility to mesures 3D coordinates from a simple 2D image. The solid image is an easy and complete way to describe 3D objects.

A photo image can be considered, from a photogrammetric ([[photogrammetry]]) point of view, a central perspective of the acquired object with good approximation.  If the internal and external orientation of the camera are known, it is possible to establish the direction in the space of each object point represented by a pixel in the digital image.  If only one image is available, it is impossible to determine the spatial X,Y,Z position of such object points, because the simple direction is insufficient: all the points along that direction would give the same image point.

By means of a DDEM (Dense [[Digital elevation model]]) of the acquired object, every pixel (and therefore every direction in the space)can be associated to the value of distance between the [[center of perspectivity]] and the object point represented by the pixel itself. In this way each pixel can be referred to the 3D position of the corresponding object point in an absolute reference system.
The DDEM can be derived from an existing map, or by the use of surveying instruments and procedures.  A series of instruments, based on the laser technology ([[3D scanner]]), have been introduced on the market, giving the possibility to obtain a DDEM in a quick and cheap way.

== The idea, 2003 ==

Definition, first results and applications of the solid image was presented in the ISPRS (International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing - [http://www.isprs.org/]) Comm.V, WG V/4 meeting in Ancona, July 2003 and in the CIPA 2003 XIXth Symposium – Antalya, Turkey 30 September - 04 October2003.
The Solid Image have been ideated by Prof. Sergio Dequal, DITAG - Dipartimento di Ingegneria del Territorio, dell'Ambiente e delle Geotecnlogie del Politecnico di Torino ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080312184234/http://www.polito.it/ricerca/dipartimenti/ditag/]), and developed by a DITAG Politecnico di Torino research group (Prof. Fulvio Rinaudo, Prof. Andrea Lingua, Dott. Leandro Bornaz).

'''''Speedwell''''' was a 60-ton [[Full-rigged pinnace|pinnace]] that, along with ''[[Mayflower]]'', transported the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth)|Pilgrims]] and was the smaller of the two ships. A vessel of the same name and size traveled to the New World seventeen years prior as the flagship of the first expedition of [[Martin Pring]].

==''Swiftsure''==
''Speedwell'' was built in 1577, under the name ''Swiftsure'', as part of English preparations for war against [[Spain]]. She participated in the fight against the [[Spanish Armada]]. During the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]'s 1596 [[Azores]] expedition she served as the ship of his second in command, Sir [[Gelli Meyrick]]. After hostilities with Spain ended, she was decommissioned in 1605, and renamed ''Speedwell''.

[[File:Embarkation of the Pilgrims.jpg|thumb|''The Embarkation of the Pilgrims'', 1843, US [[Capitol Rotunda]]. The name of the ship, ''Speedwell'', and ''1620'' are written in the foreground of the painting.]] The [[Leiden]] Separatist, a Captain Blossom, bought ''Speedwell'' in [[Holland]], and embarked from Delfshaven on 22 July 1620.&lt;ref name=phm&gt;[http://www.pilgrimhallmuseum.org/ap_voyage_mayflower_speedwell.htm "The Voyage of the  Mayflower &amp; Speedwell", Pilgrim Hall Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; They then sailed under the command of Captain Reynolds to [[Southampton]], [[England]] to meet the sister ship, ''Mayflower'', which had been chartered by merchant investors (again Captain Blossom). In Southampton they joined with other Separatists and the additional colonists hired by the investors. ''Speedwell'' was already leaking. The ships lay at anchor in Southampton almost two weeks while ''Speedwell'' was being repaired and the group had to sell some of their belongings, food and stores, to cover costs and port fees.&lt;ref name=scc&gt;[https://www.southampton.gov.uk/sleisure/artsheritage/history/localhistory/mayflower.aspx "Mayflower - the Southampton story", Southampton City Council]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ships began the voyage on 5 August 1620, but ''Speedwell'' was found to be taking on water, and the two ships put into [[Dartmouth, England|Dartmouth]] for repairs. On the second attempt, ''Mayflower'' and ''Speedwell'' sailed about 100 [[league (unit)|leagues]] (about {{convert|300|nmi}}) beyond [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]], but ''Speedwell'' was again found to be taking on water.  Both vessels returned to [[Plymouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].   The Separatists decided to go on to America on ''Mayflower''.&lt;ref name=phm/&gt; According to Bradford, ''Speedwell'' was sold at auction in London, and after being repaired made a number of successful voyages for her new owners. At least two of her passengers, Captain Thomas Blossom and a son, returned to Leiden.{{sfn|Ames|1907|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4107/4107-h/4107-h.htm#link2HCH0002 Chapter II]}}

Prior to the voyage, ''Speedwell'' had been refitted in Delfshaven and had two masts. Nathaniel Philbrick theorizes that the crew used a [[mast (sailing)|mast]] that was too big for the ship, and that the added stress caused holes to form in the hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mayflower |date=2007 |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick |publisher=Penguin Publishing |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] wrote that the "overmasting" strained the ship's [[ship hull|hull]], but attributes the main cause of her leaking to actions on the part of the crew.{{sfn|Ames|1907|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4107/4107-h/4107-h.htm#link2HCH0002 Chapter II]}} Passenger [[Robert Cushman]] wrote from Dartmouth in August 1620 that the leaking was caused by a loose board approximately two feet long.{{sfn|Ames|1907|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4107/4107-h/4107-h.htm#linkappendix Appendix] VIII}}

Eleven people from ''Speedwell'' boarded ''Mayflower'', leaving 20 people to return to [[London]] (including Cushman) while a combined company of 102 continued the voyage. For a third time, ''Mayflower'' headed for the [[New World]]. She left Plymouth on 6 September 1620 and entered [[Cape Cod]] Harbor on 11 November.  ''Speedwell's'' replacement, [[Fortune (Plymouth Colony ship)|''Fortune'']], eventually followed, arriving at [[Plymouth Colony]] one year later on 9 November 1621.  [[Delano family#Philippe Delano (De Lannoy)|Philippe de Lannoy]] on ''Speedwell'' made the trip.

==''Speedwell'' in art==

This painting was placed in the [[U.S. Capitol Rotunda]] at [[Washington, D.C.]] in December 1843. Known as ''The Embarkation of the Pilgrims'', the remarkable {{Convert|12|by|18|ft}} painting is a scene on board ''Speedwell'' while harbored in Delfs [or [[Delft]]] Haven, [[Holland]]. The historical event dramatized took place on July 22, 1620.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/historic-rotunda-paintings/embarkation-pilgrims&lt;/ref&gt; Weir would later paint another, much smaller oil on canvas that is now displayed in the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]]. The paintings are similar except for lighting and a few minor changes. The 1857 work measures about {{Convert|4|by|6|ft}}. ''The Embarkation of the Pilgrims'' is depicted on the reverse of the [[10,000 dollar bill]] ([[Federal Reserve Note]]) issued in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pilgrimhallmuseum.org/ce_history_paintings.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Only five examples of this bill are known, and "none exist outside of institutional collections."

'''Tel Kabri''' ({{lang-he-n|תֵל כַבְרִי}}; {{lang-ar|تَلْ ألْقَهوَة}}, Tell al-Qahweh, "the mound of coffee"{{sfnp|Khalidi|1992|p=28}}) is an [[archaeological]] site of a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' (hill city), containing one of the largest [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze]] (MB) Age (2,100–1,550 BC) [[Canaan]]ite palaces in ancient Palestine,{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}} and the largest such palace excavated as of 2014.{{sfnp|Koh|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2014}} Kabri is named for the abundance of its perennial [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] – as described in the [[#Etymology|Etymology]] section below – the presence of which has led to the site's occupation and use as a water source from the [[Neolithic#Neolithic 3 – Pottery Neolithic (PN)|Pottery Neolithic]] (PN) period (6,400–4,500 BC) to the present day.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}} Located in the Western [[Upper Galilee]], the site was at the height of its power in the MB, controlling much of the surrounding region. Kabri declined as a local power at the end of the MB, but the site continued to be occupied at times, on a much reduced level, up until the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

Since 1957, Tel Kabri has been excavated by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA), formerly the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (IDAM), as well as Israeli and American universities.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|pp=839–841}} Among the discoveries at the site by the two full-scale archaeological expeditions,{{efn|1= [[#The Tel Kabri Expedition: 1986–1993|The Tel Kabri Expedition]] (1986–1993) and [[#The Tel Kabri Archaeological Project: 2005–ongoing|The Tel Kabri Archaeological Project]] (2005–ongoing) are discussed in detail later in the text.}}  two have attracted particular attention from the archaeological community. The first finding to come to international attention was the discovery of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-style [[fresco]]es in the palace at Kabri.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|Goshen|2011|p=245}} {{as of|2015}}, these are the only Minoan-style frescoes ever discovered in Israel.{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}} Second, in 2013, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project uncovered the oldest and largest known palatial [[wine cellar]] in the [[Ancient Near East]] in Kabri's palace.{{sfnp|Burrows|2013}}

==Etymology==
{{as of|2015}}, the original Canaanite name of Tel Kabri is unknown.{{efn|1= Tel Kabri, as the name suggests is a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tel]]'', a type of mound found from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] that is created as a result of the destruction of mudbrick from repeated different periods of occupation of a site.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=21-22}}}} Aharon Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might have been the same city as Rehov, referred to in the [[Execration Texts]], an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian list of enemy polities.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=452}} [[Amihai Mazar]] once believed that Tel Kabri – or the site of [[Rehov|Tel Rehov]] – might be the Rehov from the Execration Texts, or Tel Kabri might be a different Rehov mentioned in topographic lists by [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmose III]].{{sfnp|Mazar|1999|p=4}} No definitive evidence has been found to support any of these hypotheses. By the [[Iron Age Levant|Iron Age]], 1200-500BC (IA), the site is known to have been called Rehov, and this continued into the [[Phoenicia#High point: 1200–800 BC|Phoenician]] period – a period of Phoenician dominance over the area, which was concurrent with the Iron Age.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}}

Early in the [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Roman Period]] (64 BC–500s AD), the town of Kabrita had been established to the east of the tel.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} The site is mentioned in the 3rd century [[Mosaic of Rehob]], as marking one of the northernmost bounds of Jewish resettlement after their return from [[Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel in the Baraita ‘Boundaries of Eretz-Israel’'' Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and its Yishuv (vol. 27), 1983, pp. 39–46. (See: {{cite journal |last=Finkelstein |first=Israel |title='The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel' in the Baraita 'Boundaries of Eretz-Israel' |journal=Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and its Yishuv |volume=27 |issue= |pages=39–46 |jstor=23398920|date=1983|registration=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Kabrita became the Arab village of el-Kabira, which by the late 1200s AD was called al-Kabrah by the Arabs and Le Quiebre by the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem#The Kingdom of Acre|Crusader]]s who controlled the area at the time. By 1880, both the village and the ruins on the tel had come to be associated and bear the same names.{{sfnp|Guérin|1880|p=32}} Al-Kabrah eventually became [[al-Kabri]],{{sfnp|Barag|1979|p=203}} and this name lasted until the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] when the village was depopulated.{{sfnp|Anon|1988|p=49}} Both the post-war kibbutz, [[Kabri, Israel|Kabri]], on whose grounds the archaeological site is located, and the tel itself, are named for al-Kabri.{{sfnp|Anon|1988|p=49}} The name of Kabrita, and the later names, were derived from the triconsonantal [[Semitic root#Triconsonantal roots|Semitic root]], כבר, meaning 'great or powerful', in reference to the plentiful water from Kabri's springs.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=452}}

==Geography==
Tel Kabri is at the eastern end of the Western Galilee coastal plain, located on the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri. It is less than {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the [[Mediterranean Sea|sea]], and the [[Ga'aton River]] is nearby to the south, with the closest major city being [[Nahariyya]] to the west. The [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] is home to four springs, Ein Shefa, Ein Giah, Ein Tzuf, and Ein ha-Shayara.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}} It is these springs that have brought people to Kabri since the Neolithic.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}}

Natural resources such as trees on the hills to the east and stone quarries near the coast were important for the inhabitants of the site. Kabri's height is partly a result of human activity: Over the centuries, material remains created layers that built up thetel.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=21-22}} During Kempinski's excavations, it was found that the original surface in the Neolithic would have been up to {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} lower than the present surface.{{sfnp|Horowitz|2002|p=8}}

==History==

The tel and its surrounding area have been inhabited since the [[Neolithic#Neolithic 3 .E2.80.93 Pottery Neolithic .28PN.29|Pottery Neolithic]] (PN).{{efn|1= 6,400–4,500 BC}}  Kabri was at the height of its power in the MB, when the polity there controlled a significant portion of the Upper Galilee. After the MB, Tel Kabri was occupied by later peoples – though on a much reduced scale – up to the founding of the State of Israel, when the kibbutz of Kabri was created.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}}

===Pre-Palatial===

The area of Kabri was first settled during the PN by members of the [[Yarmoukian]] culture.{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|p=305}} In the early [[Chalcolithic]] period (4500–3500 BC), Kabri was a major centre of the [[Wadi Raba]] culture. In the Early Bronze (EB) Age (3500-2100 BC), there was a town on the side of the tel that was destroyed as part of the region-wide [[societal collapse|systems collapse]] that characterised the EB collapse.{{efn|1= The Early Bronze Age collapse is the event that is traditionally used to mark the end of the EB and the beginning of MB. The "collapse" was an abrupt end to the material culture – such as pottery and architecture – that is identified with the EB civilisations of the [[Aegean Civilization|Aegean]], [[Bronze Age Anatolia#Early Bronze Age|Anatolia]] and the [[Bronze Age Levant#Bronze Age|Levant]] and the beginning of a period marked by the prevalence of so-called palatial society. {{As of|2015}} there is no accepted explanation for this sudden change.}}  In the early and middle MB I, Tel Kabri – along with [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Tel Afek|Aphek]], and [[Acre, Israel#Antiquity|Akko]] – was one of the earliest cities in the Levant to rebuild its fortifications following the EB collapse.{{sfnp|Kempinski|1992|p=127}} The new city was confined to the northern part of the earlier EB tel.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=70}}

===Palatial===

Prior to the ongoing excavations at Kabri that began in 2005,{{efn|1= {{as of|2015}}, excavations are ongoing.}}  archaeologists thought that there was only one palace at the site,{{efn|1= A palace that had been found by Aharon Kempinski during the [[#The Tel Kabri Expedition: 1986–1993|Tel Kabri Expedition of 1986–1993]].}}  and that it was built in the period between the late MB I (2200–1950 BC) and MB IIA (1950–1700 BC). It was also thought that the MB I period had been a transition phase. However, the palace found by Kempinski has been dated to the MB IIB (1700–1550 BC), and in 2010, a second, earlier, palace – an MB IIA palace{{efn|1= MB I and MB IIA are interchangeable terms. This palace is hereinafter referred to as the earlier palace.}}  – was identified beneath the MB IIB palace.{{efn|1= Hereinafter referred to as the later palace.}}  The remains of the earlier MB IIA palace appear to show that it was expanded to create the later MB IIB palace. The discovery of the earlier palace pushes the dates for palatial occupation of the site to the MB IIA, 150 years earlier than originally believed. The earlier MB IIA palace may have been "the most impressive structure in the Upper Galilee" at the time, and was possibly the oldest palace in Canaan.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

Earlier still, at the transition between the MB I and MB II, a large-scale restructuring programme was undertaken in a possible effort to transform Kabri into an idealised Syrian-style city – a powerful city-state centred around a magnificent and well-fortified palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=70}} The area was fortified, and an additional {{convert|25|ha|m2}} were enclosed within a large glacis, a type of earthwork fortification that was {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide with a stone core and that encircled the tel as it appears today. The glacis was topped by mudbrick and stone.{{sfnp|Issar|Zohar|2004|p=147}} There was an MB I palace and this was expanded into the MB II palaces.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}} This restructuring programme resulted in some parts of the tel being flattened out and a large portion of the population having to find new homes in the city, as a result of part of the MB IIA palace – along with certain parts of the rampart – being built in an area previously occupied by private houses.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=72}} Kabri's ancillary sites (such as [[Achziv]] and [[Avdon]]) were also built up, and migration from the hinterland to Kabri – and its secondary sites – increased dramatically as a result of these projects.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|pp=72–73}} Kabri became the capital of a major polity, with the newly expanded MB II palace at its centre.{{sfnp|Marom|al.|2014|p=63}}

At the peak of its power, Kabri may have controlled a domain that stretched from [[Mount Carmel]] in the south to the [[Sulam range]] in the north, with as many as 31 vassal sites and 30,000 subjects.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2007|p=162}} Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might be the Bronze Age settlement of Rehov, a polity mentioned in the Execration Texts and the biblical [[Book of Joshua]].{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}}During this period, Kabri maintained significant contacts with neighbouring regions in the form of trade and exchange of ideas.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|Pierce|2008|p=62}}

Counting the MB I, MB IIA, and MB IIB stages, the palace was continuously occupied for three centuries. This is longer than any other palace in ancient Israel.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

[[File:AcreNE1799.jpg|thumb|[[Sidon Eyalet|Ottoman period]] French survey map from 1799 showing the Upper Galilee. Kabri's springs are shown as being exploited by Akko.]]
By 1500 BC, the site was abandoned for reasons unknown as of the 2015.{{sfnp|Burrows|2013}} Some time after the abandonment, during the Late Bronze (LB) Age (1550–1200 BC), a small village occupied the tel.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}}
In the Iron Age, the site was reoccupied by Greek mercenaries under hire from the Phoenician city-state of [[Tyre, Lebanon#Early history|Tyre]]. The mercenaries were based in a citadel there.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=2}} Close to the citadel, in the Iron Age and Phoenician periods, the later Phoenician city of Rehov was sited at Kabri. The Phoenician town was fortified by a [[casemate]] wall. This town was destroyed by the armies of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] around 585 BC, and his rule was extended over [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Phoenicia]].{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1994|p=35*}} After this destruction, the town was rebuilt and this new town grew during the [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Persian period]] (538–332 BC). Remains from this time have been found near the tel's spring of Ein Shefa.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} Habitation at the tel itself ends at this point. Early in the [[Phoenicia under Hellenistic rule|Hellenistic period]] (332–64 BC), the ruins of the Iron Age citadel were used for burials, but the tel was not resettled until the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period (1517-1917 AD).{{sfnp|Lehmann|2002|p=87}}

Some time during the [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Early Roman period]], a Jewish settlement is mentioned, named Kabrita,{{sfnp|Aviram|1997|p=23}} located east of the tel in the area that was occupied by the later Arab village, eventually named al-Kabri.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} Kabri, appearing under the name of al-Kabrah, is mentioned in the last [[hudna]], or peace treaty, between the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]{{efn|1= Which by that point had been reduced to a remnant based out of Akko (called Acre).}}  and the [[Mamluks]].{{efn|1= A [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] sultanate based in Egypt which ruled most of the Levant at the time}}  In the treaty, the village and its surrounding fields, are shown as belonging to the ruler of Akko.{{sfnp|Barag|1979|p=203}}

In addition to al-Kabri which is located east of the site, during the Ottoman Period, two additional Arab villages were founded on the actual site – [[Al-Nahr|en-Nahr]] and [[al-Tall, Acre|et-Tell]] – in the southern and western portions of the tel, respectively.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} All three villages were close to the major springs, but during most of their existence, they were sparsely populated – in the low hundreds. Al-Kabri appears as ''Kabli'' and En-Nahr appears as ''el-Qahweh'' in the first topographic map of the region made in 1799 by [[Napoleon]]'s cartographer, [[Pierre Jacotin]]. This same map does not show Et-Tell, and only shows a mill in that location.{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=160}} Et-Tell does appear in the later [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] map of 1880,{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=160}} and is talked about by [[Victor Guérin]] in his travelogue of the area, published that same year, which described all three villages.{{sfnp|Guérin|1880|pp=31-33, 46, 50}} Karmon hypothesised that the new village of et-Tell might have been founded by villagers from el-Qahweh as a home for mill workers.{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=246}} The three villages existed up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War when they were depopulated.{{sfnp|Morris|2004|pp=253-254}}

Much of Kabri's recorded history also deals with its springs and, starting in the Hellenistic period, the springs' relationship to the city of [[Akko]].{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|pp=15-17}} The springs of Kabri have fed Akko for centuries, and aqueducts have been built from Kabri to Akko by local rulers.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=17}} In the Hellenistic period, an aqueduct was constructed at Kabri,{{sfnp|Frankel|2002|pp=82-87}} and another was built during the governorship of [[Jezzar Pasha]], the Ottoman ruler of [[Acre, Israel#Ottoman era|Akko]] who also ruled the [[Eyalet of Sidon]] (1775-1804).{{efn|1= An ''[[eyalet]]'' was an Ottoman administrative division corresponding to a province. Most of the Galilee, including Kabri, fell under the Eyalet of Sidon.}}  Later, a new aqueduct was built by Jezzar's successor, [[Suleiman Pasha(Acre)|Sulaymán Páshá]]{{efn|1= Jezzar's aqueduct had been destroyed by the military forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].}}  in the Ottoman Period, and this aqueduct functioned up until the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=18}} Portions of the structure still stand today.{{sfnp|Kahanov|2011|p=104}}

Following the War, the tel was incorporated into the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri and was made into agricultural land. Soon after, the ancient remains of the site were rediscovered and on-and-off archaeological work began which continues to the present day alongside the agricultural work of the kibbutz.

==Archaeology==
[[File:TelKabriRegion.png|thumb|250px|Tel Kabri in relation to old and new settlements]]
Tel Kabri has been a subject of archaeological study since 1957, following the discovery of Late Neolithic vessels at the site in 1956 by members of the kibbutz.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|pp=268–269}} After 1961, most of the focus on the site shifted to Bronze Age material remains. [[Archaeological survey|Surveys]] and excavations have taken place at the site to explore its past.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|pp=2–3}}

Tel Kabri is a multi-period site, meaning that it has layers, or "strata", of occupation dating from different time periods. The tel itself operates as an agricultural area of Kibbutz Kabri, and certain layers have been subject to damage as a result of agriculture activity.{{Sfnm|Kempinski|2002a|1p=4|Kempinski|2002c|2p=35}}

The tel is located on the grounds of the kibbutz, and contains the remains of the Canaanite city from the MB period and the partially excavated later Iron Age citadel. Tel Kabri is the only Canaanite city that can be excavated in its entirety because no other city with monumental architecture was built on the site after the MB city.{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}} In 2013, it was estimated that the palace would have occupied {{convert|6100|m2|acres|abbr=on}},{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}} and in 2006, it was estimated that the ancient city as a whole would have occupied {{convert|4|ha|acres|abbr=on|0}}.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=37}}

As a result of farming and erosion, Stratum 1 of the tel, the uppermost layer, has been heavily damaged.{{efn|1= Strata (sing. stratum) are layers of stratigraphy. Typically strata arranged in descending order, so Stratum 1 is physically on top of Stratum 2, which is in turn over Stratum 3, and so on. See the following section for a brief explanation of stratigraphy.}}  Prior to agricultural activities by the ''[[kibbutz]]niks'' in 1976, there still existed large towers on the tel, which may have been gates.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002c|p=35}} The entire site is cut across by a [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] period (1920–1948 AD) road that originally led from the coastal city of [[Nahariyya]] to the ''[[moshav]]'' of [[Me'ona]].{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=1}}  Most of the tel was also covered over with a metre of sterile top-soil (containing no archaeological remains) laid down for the purpose of farming by the kibbutz between Kempinski's excavations ending in 1993 and the beginning of the ongoing expedition in 2005. According to Tel Kabri Archaeological Project co-Director Assaf Yasur-Landau: "The city's preservation enables us to get a complete picture of political and social life in the Canaanite period. We can reveal whether or not it had a central government, whether taxes were levied, what sort of agriculture there was and how politics were conducted at the time."{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}}

===Stratigraphy===
{{details|topic=stratigraphy and its uses in archaeology|Stratigraphy (archaeology)}}
Kempinski identified twelve stratigraphic layers at Tel Kabri. Stratigraphy is the layering of soil with the more recent soil layers higher up and the older soil layers further down. Archaeologists and geologists use stratigraphy to date artefacts found in the soil relative to each other.{{efn|1= See [[Relationship (archaeology)]] for further information on how the relationships between archaeological finds are determined.}}  The artefacts – in particular, [[sherd]]s of pottery – can, in turn, be used to date the layer of soil and its contents to a specific date range.{{efn|1= See ''[[Seriation (archaeology)]]'' for an explanation on how archaeologists can use pottery to create a timeline for the past.}}  The 1986-1993 Tel Kabri Expedition did not find a continuous stratigraphic sequence in any one excavation trench, and so Kempinski based the identification of the layers at Tel Kabri on finds in different areas.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} He arranged the layers as follows:{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|pp=4–5}}

===Areas===

Tel Kabri is divided up into areas (some of which are shown in the table above) for practical purposes of organisation.{{efn|1= As defined in Kempinski (2002a); p. 4-5}}  The first areas – A, B, and C – were designated during the 1975–1976 excavations by Kempinski and Prausnitz.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}} Later Areas D, E, F, and T were opened by the 1986–1993 Tel Kabri Expedition, and Area D was subdivided by the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project starting in 2005.The following areas have been investigated as of the 2013 season.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;

*'''Area A''' – This area was designated Area A by Kempinski and Prausnitz during their 1975–1976 excavations.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}} The area that would come to be called Area A was the first area of archaeological fieldwork at Tel Kabri. This was the survey of Area A in 1957 after Neolithic [[Stone tool|stone]] vessels had been found in 1956.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|pp=268–269}} This area was first excavated by Prausnitz from 1957 to 1958, when he found early Chalcolithic [[cist|cist tombs]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#cite note-FOOTNOTEPrausnitz1959268-68|Prausnitz (1959)]], pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;  and houses.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1970|p=160}} Exploration in Area A has focused on the Neolithic and Chalcolithic aspects of the site.{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|p=299}} This area was not excavated during Kempinski's 1986–1993 Tel Kabri Expedition,{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|pp=299–305}} and has not been excavated by the current Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, as of the 2013 season.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
*'''Area B''' – First excavated by Ben-Yosef in 1969,{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}} the area was later excavated by Kempinski and Prausnitz in 1975 and 1976 who gave it the name, Area B. Kempinski's 1986-1993 expedition found some pottery from the MB II, but modern human activity had destroyed the layers of previous habitation.
*'''Area C''' – Like Areas A and B, Area C was named during Kempinski and Prausnitz's 1975–1976 excavations. Area C was a 40-metre-long trench cut into the rampart on the northern end of the tel in the first year of their expedition. During Kempinski's 1986–1993 excavations, the trench was expanded south so as to study the fortifications inside the city itself.
*'''Area D''' – First uncovered as a result of [[Mekorot]]'s 1961 trench, which exposed the MB [[lime plaster|plaster]] floors. Area D is where the excavation on the MB palaces has taken place. Kempinski focused most of his efforts on Area D,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} and excavations during the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project have been confined to Area D.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; During the course of the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, Area D has been sub-divided as follows:&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
**''Area D-West'' (2005, 2008–present) – First opened in 2005 to investigate a possible throne room for the final palace,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=4}} D-West has been open every year during the portion of the expedition devoted to excavation, which started in 2008, for the purpose of further uncovering palatial structures.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; In 2013, a storage room was found in D-West which was later identified as a wine cellar. 
**''Area D-South'' (2005, 2009-2013) – In 2005, D-South was opened to investigate the southern portion of Area D which Kempinski and Niemeier hypothesised might be a religious area. Excavators found evidence of metal-working as well as what excavators referred to as a massive stone structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=3}} When D-South was reopened in 2009, it was further subdivided into D-South 1 and 2 and remained as two areas in 2009 and 2011, and then just D-South 1 in the 2013 season. During the course of these excavations, a structure called the "Upper Terrace or Courtyard Building" or Building 3079 was exposed in both areas, which the excavators hypothesised might be part of an as of yet unexcavated monumental structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|pp=4-6}}
***''D-South 1'' (2009-2013) – D-South 1 was opened in 2009 to investigate the massive stone structure found in 2005, which was found to be a wall corner and was further exposed towards the east in later seasons as building 3079. In 2013, the excavators looked for further structures as well as the possible early stages of the city rampart. They found a wall which they believe may be part of the retaining wall for another building.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|pp=6-7}}
***''D-South 2'' (2009 and 2011) – D-South 2 was opened in 2009 so as to link areas excavated in 2005 in D-South with Area F as well as to investigate, further towards the west, the massive stone structure found in 2005 (later Building 3079).{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=5}} By 2011, the large structure had been identified, including a so-called "zig-zag wall" (based on its shape), and the excavators hypothesised that there might be a lower courtyard, as well as a thus far unexcavated monumental structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|pp=4-6}}
**''Area D-North'' (2005, 2013 as part of Area D-West East) – Opened in 2005 to locate a possible northern wall of the final palace which had been located by geophysical surveys. The results of the 2005 season in D-North supported an earlier hypothesis by Kempinski and Niemeier that there had been a large structure on the site of the later palace preceding its construction.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|pp=3–4}} In 2013, D-North was linked via D-West East to Kempinski's old Area D excavations.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}}
**''Area D-West East'' (2013) – D-West East was opened in 2013 in an attempt to link up D-North with the portions of Area D excavated by Kempinski, as well as explore further rooms surrounding one of the final palace's courtyards, as well as to find a complete [[Assemblage (archaeology)|pottery assemblage]] free of possible contamination from other periods or locations in the palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=7}}
*'''Area E''' – Area E was excavated in 1986 via a trench in the southwest of the tel after a survey found traces of Iron Age settlement.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} It was reopened from 1989 to 1990 and from 1992 to 1993.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xvi}} This area was investigated once more by Smithline in 2004 when he recovered significant amounts of Iron Age pottery, which add to the body of knowledge for the site's post-palatial ceramics.{{sfnp|Smithline|2007}} 
*'''Area F''' – Area F was a portion of Area D created in 1990 as a result of Area D being physically cut in two by the Mandate period road. In both Kempinski's preliminary reports and on-site, Area F was treated as separate from Area D.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} However, both Kempinski's final report (2002) treated Area F as part of Area D. In 2009, Area F was reopened and excavated by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
*'''Area T''' – Located in the northeast of the tel, this area was excavated in 1990{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xvi}} to investigate what Kempinski's team thought might be a tower.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} They found a section of well-preserved city wall instead.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002c|p=35}}

==Archaeological expeditions==
[[File:Tel Kabri Wine Cellar with labelled wine jars.png|thumb|A view to the southeast of the 40 or so wine storage vessels ''in-situ'' in the D-West wine cellar in 2013. The expedition has numbered the vessels in the photo.{{sfnp|Koh|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2014}}]]
Archaeological work has taken place at Tel Kabri since 1956. The work at Tel Kabri has consisted of a survey, five minor excavations, and two major excavations,{{efn|1= Kempinski's 1986–1993 excavations, under the Tel Kabri Expedition, and the excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project ongoing since 2005}}  although prior to 1986, much of the activity was [[Rescue archaeology|salvage excavations]] and surveys. {{as of|2015}}, Tel Kabri is being excavated by an international consortium, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; Among the finds that have been discovered at Tel Kabri, are Minoan-style wall frescoes – of which there are four known at Kabri – and the oldest and largest known palatial wine cellar in the Ancient Near East.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}}

In the years before the first large-scale excavations by Aharon Kempinski (1986-1993), surveys and smaller excavations were conducted to rescue artefacts and get an idea of the nature of Tel Kabri. This began when the archaeological remains of the tel were first discovered in the 1950s after kibbutzniks started coming across Neolithic artefacts near the local spring of Ein Giah. In 1956, on behalf of IDAM, the forerunner of today's Israel Antiquities Authority, David Alon and [[Daniel Rosolio]] conducted a survey in the area where the Neolithic artefacts had first been found earlier in the same year. They came across fortifications from the MB, and this survey led to salvage excavations in the following two years of what would later become Area A. In 1961, public works by the national water company revealed Bronze Age architectural remains in the form of a palace floor. In 1969, another rescue excavation was launched to investigate MB IIA tombs revealed as a result of agricultural activity by the kibbutz. {{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} From 1975 to 1976, a salvage excavation was conducted to examine areas exposed in 1957, 1958, 1961, and 1969 {{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}}

From 1957 to 1958, The first rescue excavations  were carried out by [[Moshe Prausnitz]] working with the IDAM,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=2}} who was joined by Robert Stigler of [[Brandeis University]].{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|p=268}} Prausnitz focused on Area A of the site where the surveyors, Alon and Rosoliyo, had first investigated the Neolithic implements found by the kibbutzniks in 1956. His expedition found Neolithic 'cist' tombs as well as round and rectangular dwellings from the lower part of the city.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1970|p=160}}

In 1961, after Prausnitz's excavation, a large trench was cut into the tel by the national water company, Mekorot, so as to incorporate the local springs into the national water system. This inadvertently led to the start of exploration into the EB and MB archaeological remains at Kabri.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} The stratigraphy from the Mekorot trench was photographed and revealed the existence of the Bronze Age settlements.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=449,451}} It also revealed the plaster floors – the first evidence of what would later be identified as the MB II palaces.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} The trench also cut into – and revealed the existence of – the MB II rampart.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}}

In 1969, as a result of the kibbutz removing an orchard from the tel, MB II tombs containing grave goods were found in what had been the lower city. Their findspot{{efn|1= Later designated as Area B in the 1975–1976 excavations.}}  was excavated by Y. Ben-Yosef for the IDAM that same year.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}}

From 1975 to 1976, salvage excavations were carried out by Prausnitz representing the IDAM, Kempinski of [[Tel Aviv University]] (TAU), and [[Ruth Amiran]] of the [[Israel Museum]], to explore the area where the MB II tombs had been found, the lower city, the earthen rampart, and the Neolithic layers of the site.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} Among their finds was a {{convert|2.10|m|ft}} tall [[stela]] that had a polished face, but no inscription.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}} Following this excavation, Kempinski, focused his work on Tel Kabri{{sfnp|Oren|2002b|p=xii}} and applied for permits from the IDAM and permission from Kibbutz Kabri to conduct large-scale excavation of the site.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=3}}

In 1986, large-scale excavations began at Tel Kabri, initially under the direction of Kempinski for TAU, and then, from 1989 onwards, Kempinski and [[Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier]] for [[Heidelberg University]],{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} until Kempinski died in July 1994, and the expedition was discontinued.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} Between 1986 and 1988, the first remains of the MB palaces were discovered near the spring of Ein Shefa, along with a contemporaneous residential area. The portion of the palace initially excavated included a {{convert|10|by|10|m|ft}} hall, with a Minoan-style decorated plaster floor.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} The style of the floor is closest to what is referred to as the 'Cretan-Theran Late Minoan IA' tradition of wall painting.{{sfnp|Kempinski|1992|pp=112–113}} They also found more than 2,000 Aegean-style painted plaster fragments.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013a}} It was during the course of Kempinski's excavations that an Iron Age [[Phoenicia]]n citadel was also discovered. The site's excavators believed this fortification was occupied by Greek mercenaries, based on the pottery found there.{{sfnp|Niemeier|2002|pp=328–331}}

[[File:MBII duckbill axe from Kabri.png|thumb|An MB II duck-billed axe recovered during the 1988 excavations.]]

In the first year of excavation by the Kempinski expedition, work was carried out in Area C, {{efn|1= which had been designated during the 1975–1976 excavations.}}  and continued each year through the 1991 season. In 1986, Areas D and E were opened, and excavated,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xv}} for the first time.{{sfnm|Oren|2002a|1p=55|Lehmann|2002|2p=73}} Area D was, and is, home to the MB palace, which became the focus of Kempinski's excavations for the duration of his expedition, which was the first to excavate the palace intentionally (after the accidental excavation by the Mekorot water company [[#Early work|in 1961]]).{{sfnp|Oren|2002a|p=55}} Area D was excavated each year by Kempinski's team. In 1987, the Kempinski expedition discovered the entranceway to what would be designated as Hall 611 in the palace, the ceremonial hall with the painted plaster floor.{{sfnp|Niemeier|Niemeier|2002|p=254}} Area E was excavated every year except 1987, 1988, and 1991, and in the first year, 1986, yielded Iron Age Greek pottery.{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1991|p=31*}} In 1987, new work was carried out in Prausnitz's Area B and continued each year through 1992.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xv}} During the 1988 excavation, a large family tomb was discovered in Area C,{{sfnp|Kempinski|1989|p=Introduction}} and MB II bronze artefacts, such as a "duck-billed axe" from Area B{{sfnp|Kempinski|1989|p=vi}} (see picture to the right), were also recovered from tombs in both Areas B and C.{{sfnp|Shalev|2002|pp=310–311}}

At the start of the 1989 season, German Archaeologist, Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier, joined Kempinski's Tel Kabri Expedition as his co-director. Along with the excavations in Areas B, C, D, and E, additional work was carried out in the new Area F,{{efn|1= An extension of Area D, again for the sake of organisation}}  which continued each year excluding the 1991 season, and in Area T,{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1990|p=1*}} which was excavated in 1990. Area T was an area at the northern part of the tel opened to explore what looked like a surviving tower but the exploration of which resulted in finding well-preserved fortifications. In 1990, finds included a Phoenician seal impression which had both the name of the official who owned it and the year according to the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] calendar.{{sfnp|Naveh|Kempinski|1991|p=10*}} Also in 1990, the western portion of Hall 611 was completely revealed in Area D, and preliminary preservation efforts were completed on the hall's painted plaster floor.{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1991|p=1*}} Work by the Kempinski expedition continued up though 1993. In Area E, work was done to investigate occupation of the site after the Iron Age – prior focus having been on the Bronze Age aspects of the site.

At the end of the 1993 season, the painted plaster floor in Hall 611 was covered over with [[geotextile]], as the team expected to return the following summer in 1994. However, Kempinski's excavations never resumed past 1993, as Kempinski died in June the following year.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} In accordance with his wishes, Kempinski was buried at Tel Kabri.{{sfnp|Oren|2002b|p=xv}}

Between the major excavations by Kempinski and the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, two separate minor excavations were conducted by Dina Shalem and Howard Smithline. In 1999, Shalem headed up a salvage excavation ahead of a construction project on the Mandate period road running through the tel. Her team worked in Area D and came across EB architecture, as well as some Chalcolithic sherds and a possible surface from that period.{{sfnp|Shalem|2009|pp=19–39}} In 2004, the Israeli telecommunications company, Cellcom, was laying down new telephone cable near Area E, and Smithline was asked to conduct a salvage excavation before the work started. He used this as an opportunity to investigate further the Iron Age aspects of the site. His team did not make any new discoveries, but did add to the collection of Iron Age I (1,200–1,000 BC) and Iron Age II (1,000–586 BC) pottery from the site.{{sfnp|Smithline|2007}}

In 2003, former Tel Kabri Expedition excavator, Assaf Yasur-Landau,{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} and geophysicist, Yitzhach Makovsky, both then of Tel Aviv University, conducted an investigation to see if Kempinski and Niemeier had underestimated the size of the palace at Tel Kabri. They conducted [[Electrical resistivity tomography|electric resistivity]] and [[Magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetometric]] soundings in an attempt to map out the architectural features under the soil without having to dig trenches. Their findings showed that the palace was indeed larger than previously thought.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=67-68}} With these results, Yasur-Landau approached his former [[Tel Megiddo#Archaeology|Megiddo Expedition]] colleague, Prof. [[Eric H. Cline]] of [[The George Washington University]], the following year and asked whether he would like to co-direct new excavations at Tel Kabri. After devoting a year to getting the necessary funding and permits for excavation, the two were able to begin work on the site in the summer of 2005.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|pp=34-36}}

Since 2005, the renewed excavations have been conducted by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, an international team co-directed by Yasur-Landau, now of the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at the [[University of Haifa]], Cline on behalf of The George Washington University, and Prof. Andrew Koh of [[Brandeis University]], which officially joined the consortium in 2013.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=1}} The majority of these excavation seasons have taken place at the MB palaces in Area D of the tel,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|pp=70–75}} and, since 2009, have been semi-annual.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=1}}

The first four seasons at Tel Kabri were dedicated to investigating the site's potential for future large-scale excavation. As a result, the 2005 season was exploratory in nature, featuring assessment of the site and minor excavations to determine the viability of conducting future work at the site.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=1}}During the course of the season, additional palatial architecture was uncovered, and the palace was found to be twice as large as previously thought by Kempinski, thus confirming the results of the 2003 soundings by Yasur-Landau and Makovsky.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|p=68}}  Along with this, another structure – possibly communal or another palace – was discovered below the MB II palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=1}} It was during the 2005 season that the first find of a gold artefact at Kabri was made.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=3}}

The team also found that in the time between the end of Kempinski's excavations and the start of the new expedition, there had been significant damage done to the site by the elements. The most apparent example of this was the [[geotextile]] that had been placed by Kempinski to cover the painted plaster floor in the palace hall.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=5}} Since 1993, the geotextile had bonded to the plaster, and this made it impossible to remove the geotextile without destroying the floor. As a result of this, much of the work done in the 2005 season was also conservation work.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|pp=5–6}}

The following 2006 season was a series of surveys of the region around Kabri. The goals of this season were only partially fulfilled during the original timeframe though, as the 2006 season coincided with the [[2006 Lebanon War]].{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}} The team was able to survey MB II sites in the area around the site and see how they would have interacted with Kabri in that time period. However, as a result of the war, they had to postpone any aerial photography of the tel – by order of the [[Israeli Air Force]] – and access to the pottery from previous excavations – held in the IAA storerooms at Kibbutz [[Beit HaEmek]] – was restricted for the duration of the war.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}} In that time period, the IAA did allow the team to remove the relevant pottery from Beit HaEmek{{efn|1= This was a result of Beit HaEmek being under continuous bombardment.}}  to Tel Aviv for study, where the pottery could also be kept safe.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=4}} The team had to wait until mid-September to achieve its goals fully. As a result of the dangers posed by the rockets from the north,{{efn|1= Six rockets struck the tel and one rocket hit the kibbutz itself.}}  some members of the team had to return to their home countries, without completing their work.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}}

The 2007 season was partly devoted to finishing the work that had to be halted in the 2006 season, as well as preparing the site for excavation the following season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=1}} Through comparative studies of pottery, the team was able to map out Kabri's rise to regional power in the MB II.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=3}} The architecture of the palace was mapped out using a [[total station]], and a digital topographic map was made of the tel using aerial photography and measurements on the ground.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=5}}

The 2008 season saw a return to excavation at the site, with a focus on the palace in Area D that had been discovered by Kempinski. The team wanted to go deeper and explore the possibility of there being a palace beneath the one Kempinski found.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=2}} They managed to get a clearer picture of the entire MB palatial area up to the 1600s BC destruction, and recovered further wall plaster fragments. The structure underneath the MB II palace was determined most likely to be a palace itself, and further fragments of Aegean wall frescos and imported pottery were found, allowing the excavators to push back the time for contact with the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] and [[Alashiya|Cyprus]] to the MB I period.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=8}} At the close of the dig season, the site was covered up to preserve it in the off-season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=9}}

2009 was the first year of large-scale excavation by the expedition, and the first year that the system of semi-annual excavation – with the off-years devoted to data-processing – was implemented and was in use as of the 2013 season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=1}} The 2009 season was also the only year that two separate seasons of excavations were conducted: a summer large-scale excavation, and a winter minor excavation. During the summer season of 2009, additional Aegean style frescoes were found at the site. In Area D-West, the northern bounds of the palace were successfully determined,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=2}} and a corridor was discovered that held restorable pottery.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|pp=4–5}} During the winter season, the corridor in D-West was revisited, so that its use could be determined.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|pp=1–2}} As a result of these excavations, the date for the construction of the earliest palace was revised and estimated to be in the MB I period in the 1800s BC, making the palace at Kabri one of the oldest palaces in Canaan.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

[[File:Tell Kabri (4).JPG|thumb|2011 excavations in Area D South-1]]
The main finds of the 2011 season included an [[orthostat]] building close to the palace, further pieces of painted plaster,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|p=1}} and a scarab of the [[Second Intermediate Period]].{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|p=4}}

Andrew Koh, and students from Brandeis University, were responsible for doing the residue analysis on the wine jars in the storage room, which led to the room's identification as a wine cellar.}}]]
During the 2013 season, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project discovered the first known complete MB storage room in Canaan.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}} On 22 November 2013, the team announced that this storage room had been found to be the oldest palatial [[wine cellar]] in the Ancient Near East, with 40 large ceramic jars, totalling 2,000 litres in capacity,{{efn|1= The equivalent of 3,000 750ml [[Wine bottle size|standard wine bottles]].}}  containing traces of wine dating to 1700 BC.{{sfnp|Wilford|2013}} During the latter half of the season, the dig shifted its focus to Area D-West, where the wine cellar was located. To speed up the process of uncovering the vessels in the wine cellar, for part of the time, the team adopted the atypical practice of working in morning and afternoon shifts of 05:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 19:00, respectively,{{sfnp|Ingeno|2015|p=51}} almost exclusively in Area D-West.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}}{{efn|1= Near Eastern summer archaeological digs typically dig in the morning only so as to avoid the afternoon heat. Exceptions are made when time is a constraint or the collecting of artefacts is urgent.{{sfnp|Ingeno|2015|p=51}}}} Prior to the actual removal of the vessels, [[LiDAR]] work was done on the site, for the first time, in this area.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=2,6}} Near the end of the season, red plaster fragments were discovered while the area was being cleaned.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}} However, the finds were not restricted to Area D-West. In Area D-South, a deposit was discovered that held additional pieces of wall plaster.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}} In Area D-West-East, the area of D-North was linked up with the areas excavated by Kempinski, thus unifying the whole area from D-North to D-West, exposing further architecture,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=7,10}} and bringing the estimate of the size of the palace to approximately {{convert|6000|m2|abbr=on}}.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}} As a result of the discovery of two doorways in D-West at the end of the 2013 season, part of the 2015 season will be devoted to exploring where – and to what – these doorways lead.{{sfnp|Lopatto|2013}}

==Site reports==
Below are the site reports that could be located for the archaeological work at Tel Kabri. They have been arranged chronologically, with internet links where available, for reference.

The reports for the 1957–1958, 1975–1976, 1999, and 2004 excavations were all published in journals, some in English and some in Hebrew. It was not until the Tel Kabri Expedition of Tel Aviv University under Kempinski that stand-alone excavation reports for Tel Kabri were published, and then Kempinski made sure to publish a report for each year – a practice that has continued with the ongoing excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project of The George Washington University and the University of Haifa. Reports for the 1969 survey could not be located.

'''Thule''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θj|uː|l|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/thule "Thule"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Θούλη}}, ''Thoúlē''; {{lang-la|Thule, Tile}}) was the place located furthest north, which was mentioned  in [[ancient Greek literature|ancient Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Roman]] literature and [[cartography]].

In classical and medieval literature,  '''''ultima Thule''''' (Latin "furthermost Thule") acquired a metaphorical meaning of any distant place located beyond the "borders of the known world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nieves|last1=Herrero|first2=Sharon R.|last2=Roseman|title=The Tourism Imaginary and Pilgrimages to the Edges of the World|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=qu3jCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22In+medieval+geography,+however,+Ultima+Thule+referred+to+any+far+away+place%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPqqb-seDXAhWFyKQKHd3QD7wQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20medieval%20geography%2C%20however%2C%20Ultima%20Thule%20referred%20to%20any%20far%20away%20place%22&amp;f=false|page=122|publisher=Channel View Publications|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[late middle ages]] and [[early modern era]], the Greco-Roman Thule was often identified with the  real [[Iceland]] or [[Greenland]]. Sometimes ''Ultima Thule'' was a [[Latin]] name for Greenland, when ''Thule'' was used for Iceland.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DThule|author1=Charlton T. Lewis|author2=Charles Short|title=A Latin Dictionary|accessdate=5 April 2017|year=1879|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, however, ''Thule'' was frequently identified with [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0862120#m_en_gb0862120]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bostock &amp; Riley (1893) page 352 (on "Chapter 30 (16) – Britannia") assert: "Opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous in the extreme." The notes on Book IV of Pliny in an 1829 translation into French by Ajasson de Grandsagne mention six, which are taken word-for-word in translation by Bostock &amp; Riley (their words in quotes): ―
* "That Thule is the island of [[Iceland]]." Burton (1875) pages 1, 25.
* "That it is either the [[Faroe Islands|Ferroe Group]], or one of those islands." Burton pages 22–23.
* "The notion of [[Ortelius]], Farnaby, and Schœnning, that it is identical with [[Telemark|Thylemark]] in [[Norway]]." Burton page 25.
* "The opinion of [[Conrad Malte-Brun|Malte Brun]], that the continental portion of [[Denmark]] is meant thereby, a part of which is to the present day called [[Thy (district)|Thy]] or Thyland." Fotheringham (1862) page 497.
* "The opinion of [[Olaus Rudbeck|Rudbeck]] and of Calstron, borrowed originally from [[Procopius]], that this is a general name for the whole of [[Scandinavia]]." Grandsagne (1829) page 338: "L'idée de Rudbeck ... et de Calstron ... due originairement à Procope, qui ... a prononcé nettement que sous ce nom était comprise toute la Scandinavie." The reference is to Procopius Book III No. 4.
* "That of Gosselin, who thinks that under this name [[Mainland, Shetland|Mainland]], the principal of the [[Shetland Islands]], is meant. The reference to "Gosselin" or elsewhere "M. Gosselin" and his monumental work dating from the time of the French Revolution is much copied even though miscited. No such geographer existed; the "M." must stand for ''Monsieur''. The [[Library of Congress]] catalog cites the work as: {{cite book|first=Pascal François Joseph|last=Gossellin|title=Recherches sur la géographie systématique et positive anciens; pour servir de base à l'histoire de la géographie ancienne|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/02007793|location=Paris|publisher=L'imprimerie de la république [etc.] an VI|orig-year=1798|year=1813}} This four-volume work is rare and inaccessible today. The opinion is said to come from Volume I page 162 under the title ''Thulé''.

Bostock and Riley continue: "It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authors writing at distant periods and under different states of geographical knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark in Norway."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the explorer [[Knud Rasmussen]] established a missionary and trading post in north-western Greenland, which he named "Thule" (later [[Qaanaaq]]).

Modern interpretations of the ancient Greek and Roman place name have included [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]], the island of [[Saaremaa]] (Ösel) in Estonia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.saartehaal.ee/2015/10/17/raamat-saaremaa-ongi-ultima-thule/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.err.ee/550811/saaremaal-arutati-kuidas-ultima-thule-muuti-turundamisel-ara-kasutada]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Norwegian island of [[Smøla (island)|Smøla]].&lt;ref name=Germania&gt;Andreas Kleineberg, Christian Marx, Eberhard Knobloch und Dieter Lelgemann: ''Germania und die Insel Thule.

==Historical usage==
=== Classical and medieval eras ===
The [[Greeks|Greek]] explorer [[Pytheas]] of Massalia (now Marseille, France) is the first to have written of Thule, after his travels between 330–320 BCE. Pytheas mentioned going to Thule in his now [[lost work]], ''Things about the Ocean'' Τὰ περὶ τοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ (''ta peri tou Okeanou''). He supposedly was sent out by the Greek city of [[Marseille|Massalia]] to see where their trade goods were coming from.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]] (1954). ''[[Lost Continents]]'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptions of some of his discoveries have survived in the works of later, often skeptical, authors. [[Polybius]] in his ''Histories'' (c. 140 BC), Book XXXIV, cites Pytheas as one "who has led many people into error by saying that he traversed the whole of Britain on foot, giving the island a circumference of forty thousand [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]], and telling us also about Thule, those regions in which there was no longer any proper land nor sea nor air, but a sort of mixture of all three of the consistency of a [[jellyfish]] in which one can neither walk nor sail, holding everything together, so to speak."&lt;ref&gt;Polybius. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/34*.html ''Book XXXIV, 5, 3'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st century BCE Greek astronomer [[Geminus]] of Rhodes claimed that the name Thule went back to an archaic word for the [[polar night]] phenomenon – "the place where the sun goes to rest".&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to the Phenomena'', VI. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysius Periegetes]] in his ''De situ habitabilis orbis'' also touched upon this subject&lt;ref&gt;''Geographici Graeci Minores'', 2. 106&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Martianus Capella]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Problem of Pytheas' Thule'', Ian Whitaker, The Classical Journal, Vol. 77, No. 2 (Dec., 1981 – Jan., 1982), pp. 55–67&lt;/ref&gt; Avienus in his ''Ora Maritima'' added that during the summer on Thule night lasted only two hours, a clear reference to the midnight sun.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]] in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (c. 30 CE),&lt;ref&gt; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1D*.html Book I, Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt; mentions Thule in describing [[Eratosthenes]]' calculation of "the breadth of the inhabited world" and notes that Pytheas says it "is a six days' sail north of Britain, and is near the frozen sea". But he then doubts this claim, writing that Pytheas has "been found, upon scrutiny, to be an arch falsifier, but the men who have seen Britain and Ireland do not mention Thule, though they speak of other islands, small ones, about Britain". Strabo adds the following in Book 5: "Now Pytheas of Massilia tells us that Thule, the most northerly of the Britannic Islands, is farthest north, and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the Arctic Circle. But from the other writers I learn nothing on the subject – neither that there exists a certain island by the name of Thule, nor whether the northern regions are inhabitable up to the point where the summer tropic becomes the [[Arctic Circle]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Book II, Chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo ultimately concludes,&lt;ref name="strabo iv"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html Book IV, Chapter 5].&lt;/ref&gt; "Concerning Thule, our historical information is still more uncertain, on account of its outside position; for Thule, of all the countries that are named, is set farthest north." The inhabitants or people of Thule are described in most detail by Strabo  (citing Pytheas): "the people (of Thule) live on millet and other herbs, and on fruits and roots; and where there are grain and honey, the people get their beverage, also, from them. As for the grain, he says, since they have no pure sunshine, they pound it out in large storehouses, after first gathering in the ears thither; for the threshing floors become useless because of this lack of sunshine and because of the rains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographica, 4. 5. 5|author=Strabo|translator=Jones, H.L.|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|date=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-1st century Roman geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] placed Thule north of [[Scythia]].&lt;ref&gt;''De Situ Orbis'', III, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 77 CE, [[Pliny the Elder]] published his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he also cites Pytheas' claim (in Book II, Chapter 75) that Thule is a six-day sail north of Britain. Then, when discussing the islands around Britain,&lt;ref name="strabo iv"/&gt; he writes: "The farthest of all, which are known and spoke of, is Thule; in which there be no nights at all, as we have declared, about mid-summer, namely when the Sun passes through the sign Cancer; and contrariwise no days in mid-winter: and each of these times they suppose, do last six months, all day, or all night." Finally, in refining the island's location, he places it along the most northerly parallel of those he describes: "Last of all is the Scythian parallel, from the Rhiphean hills into Thule: wherein (as we said) it is day and night continually by turns (for six months)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny6.html Book VI, Chapter 34].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]], in his book chronicling the life of his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], describes how the Romans knew that Britain (in which Agricola was Roman commander) was an island rather than a continent, by circumnavigating it. Tacitus writes of a Roman ship visiting the Orkneys and claims the ship's crew even sighted Thule. However their orders were not to explore there, as winter was at hand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], Agricola, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.agri.shtml 10].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that Tacitus was referring to [[Shetland]].  

The 3rd Century, Latin grammarian [[Gaius Julius Solinus]] wrote in his ''Polyhistor'' that "Thyle, which was distant from Orkney by a voyage of five days and nights, was fruitful and abundant in the lasting yield of its crops".&lt;ref name="orkneyjar.com"&gt;Ab Orcadibus Thylen usque quinque dierum ac noctium navigatio est; sed Thyle larga et diutina Pomona copiosa est.[http://www.orkneyjar.com/placenames/pomona.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th century Virgilian commentator [[Servius]] also believed that Thule sat close to Orkney: "Thule; an island in the Ocean between the northern and western zone, beyond Britain, near Orkney and Ireland; in this Thule, when the sun is in Cancer, it is said that there are perpetual days without nights..."&lt;ref name="fjor.net"&gt;"''Thule; insula est Oceani inter septemtrionalem et occidentalem plagam, ultra Britanniam, iuxta Orcades et Hiberniam; in hac Thule cum sol in Cancro est, perpetui dies sine noctibus dicuntur&amp;nbsp;...''"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130045/http://fjor.net/etome/grecoroman/servius-bi.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other late classical writers and post-classical writers, such as [[Orosius]] (384–420) and the Irish monk [[Dicuil]] (late 8th and early 9th century), describe Thule as being north and west of both Ireland and Britain, strongly suggesting that it was Iceland. In particular, Dicuil described Thule as being beyond islands that seem to be the [[Faroe Islands]] (which are between Shetland and Iceland).

[[Solinus]] (d. 400 CE) in his ''Polyhistor'', repeated these descriptions, noting that the people of Thule had a fertile land where they grew a good production of crop and fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Solinus|title=Polyhistor}} Ch. XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

In the writings of the historian [[Procopius]], from the first half of the 6th century, Thule is a large island in the north inhabited by 25 tribes. It is believed that Procopius is really talking about a part of Scandinavia, since several tribes are easily identified, including the [[Geats]] (''Gautoi'') in present-day Sweden and the [[Sami people]] (''Scrithiphini''). He also writes that when the [[Herules]] returned, they passed the [[Warini]] and the [[Danes]] and then crossed the sea to Thule, where they settled beside the Geats.

=== Modern research ===
The British surveyor [[Charles Vallancey]] (1731–1812) was one of many antiquarians to argue that [[Ireland]] was Thule, as he does in his book ''An essay on the antiquity of the Irish language''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/anessayonantiqu00vallgoog An essay on the antiquity of the Irish language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hypothesis, first proposed by [[Lennart Meri]] in 1976, holds that the island of [[Saaremaa]] (which is often known by the exonym Osel) in [[Estonia]], could be Thule. That is, there is a phonological similarity between Thule and the [[root word|root]] ''tule-'' "of fire" in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (and other [[Finnic languages]]). A [[crater lake]] named [[Kaali crater|Kaali]] on the island appears to be have been formed by a [[meteor strike]] in prehistory.&lt;ref name="Silverwhite"&gt;{{cite book

In 2010, scientists from the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation Science at the [[Technical University of Berlin]], claimed to have identified persistent errors in calculation that had occurred in attempts by modern geographers to superimpose [[geographic coordinate system]]s upon Ptolemaic maps. After correcting for these errors, the scientists claimed, Ptolemy's Thule could be mapped to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] island of [[Smøla (island)|Smøla]].&lt;ref name=Germania&gt;Andreas Kleineberg, Christian Marx, Eberhard Knobloch und Dieter Lelgemann: ''Germania und die Insel Thule.

==Modern geographical &amp; scientific usage==
In 1775, during his second voyage, [[Captain Cook]] named an island in the high southern latitudes of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], [[Southern Thule]]. The name is now used for a group of three southernmost islands in the [[South Sandwich Islands]], one of which is called [[Thule Island]].  The island group became a [[British overseas territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]] , albeit also claimed by [[Argentina]] (in Spanish ''Islas Tule del Sur'').

In 1910, the explorer [[Knud Rasmussen]] established a missionary and trading post, which he named [[Avannaa|Thule]] (Inuit: ''Avanaa'')  on Greenland. The [[Thule people]], the predecessor of modern [[Inuit]] [[Greenlanders]], were named after the Thule region. In 1953, Avanaa became [[Thule Air Base]], operated by [[United States Air Force]]. The population was forced to resettle to [[Qaanaaq|New Thule]] (Qanaaq), {{convert|67|mi|km|-1|order=flip}} to the north ({{coord|76|31|50.21|N|68|42|36.13|W|display=inline}} only 840 [[Nautical mile|NM]] from the [[North Pole]]).

Thule lends its name to the 69th element in the [[periodic table]], [[thulium]].

Ultima Thule is the name of a location in the [[Mammoth Cave]] system in Kentucky, United States. It was formerly the terminus of the known-explorable southeastern (upstream) end of the passage called "Main Cave", before discoveries made in 1908 by [[Ed Bishop]] and [[Max Kaemper]] showed an area accessible beyond it, now the location of the [[Violet City Entrance]]. The Violet City Lantern tour offered at the cave passes through Ultima Thule near the conclusion of the route.

The Southern Thule islands were occupied by Argentina in 1976. The occupation was not militarily contested by the British until the 1982 [[Falklands War]], during which time British sovereignty was restored by a contingent of [[Royal Marines]]. Currently the three islands are uninhabited.

In March 2018, following a naming competition, the [[Kuiper Belt object]] [[(486958) 2014 MU69|2014 MU69]], a fly-by target of the  [[NASA]] probe ''[[New Horizons]]'' was nicknamed "Ultima Thule". The pass is scheduled for 1 January 2019, and will be the most distant encounter between a spacecraft and a planetary body. An official name for the body will be assigned by the [[International Astronomical Union]] after the fly-by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-chooses-nickname-for-ultimate-flyby-target|title= New Horizons Chooses Nickname for ‘Ultimate’ Flyby Target|website=NASA|date=13 March 2018|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger]] writes of a day when new lands will be discovered past Thule.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca: Medea, v. 379. Translated by Frank Justus Miller [http://www.theoi.com/Text/SenecaMedea.html]: "There will come an age in the far-off years when Ocean shall unloose the bonds of things, when the whole broad earth shall be revealed, when Tethys shall disclose new worlds and Thule not be the limit of the lands."

This implies that Thule was [[Scotland]]. But in ''Against Rufinias'', the [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Rufinum/2*.html Second Poem], Claudian writes of "Thule lying icebound beneath the pole-star".

In the early 7th century, [[Isidore of Seville]] wrote in his ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'' that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ultima Thule (''Thyle ultima'') is an island of the Ocean in the northwestern region, beyond Britannia, taking its name from the sun, because there the sun makes its summer solstice, and there is no daylight beyond (''ultra'') this.

By the late [[Middle Ages]], scholars were linking Iceland and/or Greenland to the name Thule and/or places reported by the Irish mariner [[Saint Brendan]] (in the 6th century) and other distant or mythical locations, such as [[Hy Brasil]] and  [[Cockaigne]].  These scholars included works by [[Dicuil]] (see above), the [[Anglo-Saxon]] monk [[Venerable Bede]] in ''[[De ratione temporum]]'', the [[Landnámabók]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} by the anonymous ''[[Historia Norwegie]]'',{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and by the German cleric [[Adam of Bremen]] in his ''[[Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church]]'', where they cite both ancient writers' use of Thule as well as new knowledge since the end of antiquity. All these authors also understood that other islands were situated to the north of Britain.

[[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], in his 12th century commentary on the ''[[Iliad]],'' wrote that the inhabitants of Thule were at war with a tribe whose members dwarf-like, only 20 fingers in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eustathius of Thessalonica|title=Eustath. ad Hom. |page= 372|url=http://www.theoi.com/Phylos/Pygmaioi.html|website=Theoi.com/phylos/Pygmaioi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American classical scholar [[Charles Anthon]] believed this legend may have been rooted in history (although exaggerated), if the dwarf or pygmy tribe were interpreted as being a smaller [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] tribe of Britain the people on Thule had encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Classical Dictionary, ''Vol. II''|date= 1888|author=Anthon, Charles |page= 1146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thule is referred to in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s poem "[[Der König in Thule]]" (1774), famously set to music by [[Franz Schubert]] (D 367, 1816) and [[Robert Schumann]] (Op.67, No.1), and in the collection ''[[s:Ultima Thule|Ultima Thule]]'' (1880) by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].

===Modern literature===

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem "[[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#Dream-Land (1844)|Dream-Land]]" (1844) begins with the following stanza: {{poemquote|By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named Night,
On a black throne reigns upright.
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule –
From a wild weird clime, that lieth, sublime,
Out of Space – out of Time.}}

John Henry Wilbrandt Stuckenberg wrote on the subject in 1885: {{Quotation|
What is the mind’s ''ultima Thule''? What substance must be regarded as first, and therefore as the seed of the universe? What is the eternal Something, of which the temporal is but a manifestation? Matter? Spirit? Matter and Spirit? Something behind both and from which they have sprung, neither Matter nor Spirit, but their Creator? Or is there in reality neither Matter nor Spirit, but only an agnostic Cause of the phenomena erroneously assigned by us to body and mind?

After spending many years in profoundly investigating this problem, I have at last struck bottom. Unhesitatingly and unconditionally I adopt materialism, and declare it to be the sole and all-sufficient explanation of the universe. This affords the only thoroughly scientific system; and nowhere but in its legitimate conclusions can thought find suitable resting-place, the heart complete satisfaction, and life a perfect basis. Unless it accepts this system, philosophy will be but drift-wood, instead of the stream of thought whose current bears all truth. Materialism, thorough, consistent, and fearless, not the timid, reserved, and half-hearted kind, is the hope of the world.|''The Final Science: or Spiritual Materialism'' (1885) by John Henry Wilbrandt Stuckenberg (1835-1903), p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuckenberg, John Henry Wilbrandt|date=1885|url=https://archive.org/stream/thefinalscience00stucuoft#page/8/mode/1up |title=The Final Science: or Spiritual Materialism|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Usage in Nazi ideology ==

In Germany, [[Nazism and occultism|extreme right occultists]] believed in a historical Thule, or [[Hyperborea]], as the ancient origin of the "[[Aryan race]]" (a term which they believed had been used by the [[Proto-Indo-European people]]). The [[Thule Society]], which had close links to the ''Deutsche Arbeiter Partei'' (DAP), known later as the ''[[Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]]'' (NSDAP or Nazi party) was, according to its own account, founded on August{{nbsp}}18, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] (1874&amp;ndash;1954), ''Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab'', Munich 1985 – ''The Man who Gave Hitler the Ideas'', the Viennese psychologist and author [[Wilfried Daim]] claimed that the Thule Gesellschaft name originated from mythical Thule. In his history of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] (''Mit ruhig festem Schritt'', 1998 – ''With Firm and Steady Step''), [[Wilfred von Oven]], [[Joseph Goebbels]]' press adjutant from 1943 to 1945, confirmed that Pytheas' Thule was the historical Thule for the ''Thule Gesellschaft''.

Much of this fascination was due to rumours surrounding the ''[[Oera Linda Book]]'', falsely claimed to have been found by Cornelis Over de Linden during the 19th century.  The ''Oera Linda Book'' was translated into German in 1933 and was favored by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. The book has since been thoroughly discredited. Professor of Frisian Language and Literature Goffe Jensma wrote that the three authors of the translation intended it "to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

[[File:Karte Aut Stmk OBERSTMK.png|thumb|270px|''Obersteiermark'' districts within the state of Styria]]
'''Upper Styria''' ({{lang-de|Obersteiermark}}), in the [[Austria]]n usage of the term, refers exclusively to the northwestern, generally mountainous and well wooded half of the [[States of Austria|federal state]] of [[Styria]]. The southwestern half of the state around the capital of [[Graz]] is known as [[Central Styria]] (''Mittelsteiermark''), which is further divided into Eastern and Western Styria (east and west of Graz).

==Geography==
Upper Styria is separated from Central Styria by the Stubalpe and Gleinalpe ranges of the [[Lavanttal Alps]], and the [[Prealps East of the Mur]]. It is a generally rural region characterized by agriculture and tourism, except for the area between the towns of [[Judenburg]] and [[Mürzzuschlag]], in the valley formed by the rivers [[Mur River|Mur]] and [[Mürz]], with extensive industrial sites. The area around [[Altaussee]] in the far northwest ist part of the Austrian [[Salzkammergut]] cultural landscape.

The ''Obersteiermark'' region consists of five [[Districts of Austria|districts]]:
*[[Murau District|Murau]]
*[[Liezen District|Liezen]]
*[[Murtal District|Murtal]] (former [[Judenburg District|Judenburg]] and [[Knittelfeld District|Knittelfeld]])
*[[Leoben District|Leoben]]
*[[Bruck an der Mur District|Bruck]]–[[Mürzzuschlag District|Mürzzuschlag]]. 

==Usage in Slovenia==
[[File:Styrie en AT &amp; en SI.PNG|thumb|Former Styrian duchy in modern Austria and Slovenia]]
In [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] usage, the term '''Upper Styria''' (''Zgornja Štajerska'') refers to the whole Austrian state of Styria—as opposed to the traditional region called [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]] (''Spódnja Štájerska''), Slovenian Styria (''Slovenska Štájerska'') or just Styria (''Štájerska''), the southern third of the former [[Duchy of Styria]] which after World War I was allotted to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] according to the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and is today part of [[Slovenia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5482">[[Palau]] requires its residents to register their [[motor vehicle]]s and display '''[[vehicle registration plate]]s'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/world/PA_PALA.html|title=License Plates of Palau|website=Worldlicenseplates.com|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current plates are [[Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_States#Designs_and_serial_formats|North American standard]] 6 × 12 inches (152 × 300 mm). Most [[States of Palau|states]] issue metal plates, some stamped, however some are hand painted, stenciled or of printed laminated paper on a wooden base. Most states issue new plates every few years, others use revalidation through [[sticker]]s.

The designs of the plates vary by state, with each state issuing their own plates, although some states have less than 100 residents and the largest just 14,000. Palau witnessed [[Politics_of_Palau#Political_history|several instances of political violence in the 1980s]], due to state-by-state conflict over the [[Compact of Free Association|nuclear issue]], so in the 1990s a national plate was issued. This has since reverted to state-by-state production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/Palau/palauy2k.html|title=palauy2k.html|website=Plateshack.com|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zheng He''' ({{zh|t=鄭和}}; 1371–1433 or 1435) was a Chinese [[History of the Chinese navy|mariner]], [[Chinese exploration|explorer]], [[Foreign relations of imperial China|diplomat]], [[fleet admiral]], and court eunuch during China's [[History of the Ming dynasty|early Ming dynasty]]. He was originally born as '''Ma He''' in a Muslim family, later adopted the conferred surname Zheng from Emperor Yongle.&lt;ref name=dr7-22-3&gt;Dreyer 2007, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng commanded [[Treasure voyages|expeditionary voyages]] to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length. These carried hundreds of sailors on four tiers of decks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0393918472|location =New York|pages = 409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a favorite of the [[Yongle Emperor]], whose [[Jingnan Campaign|usurpation]] he assisted, Zheng rose to the top of the [[Government of the Ming Empire|imperial hierarchy]] and served as commander of the southern capital [[Nanjing]] (the capital was later moved to Beijing by the Yongle Emperor). His voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of [[Liang Qichao]]'s ''Biography of Our Homeland's Great Navigator, Zheng He'' in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Liang Qichao. "''Zuguo Da Hanghaijia Zheng He Zhuan''". 1904. {{zh-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HMZX"&gt;Hui Chun Hing.&lt;!--sic--&gt; "[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v51p067.pdf ''Huangming Zuxun'' and Zheng He’s Voyages to the Western Oceans]".

Retrieved 17 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Galle Trilingual Inscription|trilingual stele]] left by the navigator was discovered on the island of [[Ceylon]] shortly thereafter.

==Early life and family==
Zheng He was born Ma He (馬和)&lt;ref name=dr7-11/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills 1970, p. 5"/&gt; to a [[Islam in China|Muslim]] family&lt;ref name="Mills 1970, p. 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ra87-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=dr7-148/&gt; of [[Kunyang Subdistrict|Kunyang]], [[Kunming]], Yunnan, China.&lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had an older brother and four sisters.&lt;ref name=dr7-11/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills 1970, p. 5"&gt;Mills 1970, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levathes 1996, 62"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "China p. 621"/&gt;

Ma He's religious beliefs became [[Syncretism|all-embracing and eclectic]] in his adulthood.&lt;ref name=ra87-66&gt;Ray 1987, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dr7-148&gt;Dreyer 2007, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dreyer (2007), the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions suggest that Zheng He's devotion to [[Mazu (goddess)|Tianfei]]&lt;!-- contemporaneously-used name--&gt; (the patron goddess of sailors and seafarers) was the dominant faith to which he adhered, reflecting the goddess' central role to the [[Chinese treasure fleet|treasure fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer 2007, 148 &amp; 150. "The inscriptions [...] devotion to Tianfei, the goddess of seafarers, had become the dominant strand in his eclectic religious heritage."&lt;/ref&gt; John Guy mentions, "When Zheng He, the Muslim eunuch leader of the great expeditions to the 'Western Ocean' (Indian Ocean) in the early fifteenth century, embarked on his voyages, it was from the Divine Woman that he sought protection, as well as at the tombs of the Muslim saints on Lingshan Hill, above the city of Quanzhou."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCIPD1V39QkC&amp;pg=PA163 |chapter=Quanzhou: Cosmopolitan City of Faiths |title=The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty |first= John| last= Guy |page=176 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300166569|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zheng He was a great-great-great-grandson of [[Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar]], who served in the administration of the [[Mongol Empire]] and was the [[governor of Yunnan]] during the early [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Shih-Shan Henry| last= Tsai| title= Perpetual Happiness: The Ming Emperor Yongle| publisher= University of Washington Press| year= 2002| isbn= 978-0295981246| page= 38}} ({{Google books|aU5hBMxNgWQC|restricted online copy|page=38}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=Chunjiang| last1= Fu| first2= Choo Yen| last2= Foo| first3= Yaw Hoong| last3= Siew| title= The great explorer Cheng Ho.

In the autumn of 1381, a [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army invaded and [[Ming conquest of Yunnan|conquered Yunnan]], which was then ruled by the Mongol prince [[Basalawarmi]], Prince of Liang.&lt;ref name=dr7-12/&gt; In 1381, Ma Haji (Zheng He's father) died in the fighting between the Ming armies and Mongol forces.&lt;ref name="Levathes 1996, 62"/&gt; Dreyer (2007) states that Zheng He's father died at age 39 while resisting the Ming conquest.&lt;ref name=dr7-12/&gt; Levathes (1996) states Zheng He's father died at age 37, but it is unclear if he was helping the Mongol army or just caught in the onslaught of battle.&lt;ref name="Levathes 1996, 62"&gt;Levathes 1996, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Wenming, the oldest son, buried their father outside of Kunming.&lt;ref name="Levathes 1996, 62"&gt;Levathes 1996, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as Admiral, Zheng He had an epitaph engraved in honor of his father, composed by the Minister of Rites Li Zhigang on the [[Duanwu Festival]] of the 3rd year in the Yongle era (1 June 1405).&lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture, castration and service==
Ma He was captured by the Ming armies at Yunnan in 1381.&lt;ref name="Levathes 1996, 62"/&gt; General [[Fu Youde]] saw Ma He on a road and approached him in order to inquire about the location of the Mongol pretender.&lt;ref name=lev6-58/&gt; Ma He responded defiantly by saying that the Mongol pretender had jumped into a lake.&lt;ref name=lev6-58&gt;Levathes 1996, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the general took him prisoner.&lt;ref name=lev6-58/&gt;  One source states that he was [[Castration|castrated]] at the age of 10 and then was placed in the service of the Prince of Yan,&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer 2007,12 &amp; 16.&lt;/ref&gt; while another source indicates that the castration occurred in 1385.&lt;ref name=lev6-58/&gt;

Ma He was sent to serve in the household of Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, who later became the [[Yongle Emperor]].&lt;ref name=dr7-12&gt;Dreyer 2007, 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lev6-58/&gt; Zhu Di was eleven years older than Ma.&lt;ref name=dr7-18&gt;Dreyer 2007, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; While enslaved as a eunuch servant, Ma He eventually gained the confidence of Zhu Di, while Zhu Di as his benefactor would gain the allegiance and loyalty of the young eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zheng He's art of collaboration: Understanding the legendary Chinese admiral from a management perspective.|last=Hoon|first=H.S|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=32, 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1380, the prince had been governing Beiping (later [[Beijing]]),&lt;ref name=dr7-12/&gt; which was located near the northern frontier where the hostile Mongol tribes were situated.&lt;ref name= lev6-58/&gt;&lt;ref name=dr7-18/&gt; Ma would spend his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier.&lt;ref name=lev6-58/&gt;&lt;ref name= dr7-16&gt;Dreyer 2007, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; He often participated in Zhu Di's military campaigns against the Mongols.&lt;ref name=dr7-18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 1390, Ma accompanied the Prince when he commanded [[Ming campaign against the Uriankhai|his first expedition]], which was a great victory as the Mongol commander [[Naghachu]] surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen for a deception.&lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kunyang - Zheng He Park - P1350545.JPG|thumb|Ma Hajji, a Yuan Dynasty official in Yunnan (a descendant of [[Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar]]), and his young son Ma He, future admiral Zheng He, as imagined by a modern [[Kunyang Subdistrict|Kunyang]] sculptor.]]
Eventually, he would gain the confidence and trust of the prince.&lt;ref name=dr7-18/&gt; Ma was also known as "sān bǎo" during the time of service in the household of the Prince of Yan.&lt;ref name=lev6-63&gt;Levathes 1996, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This name was a reference to the [[Three Jewels]] ({{lang|zh|三寶}}, ''triratna'') in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer 2007, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a document saying his name could be {{lang|zh|三保}} (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Three Protections", also pronounced ''sān bǎo'').&lt;ref&gt;Historical documents have both spelling. See e.g. Xiang Da ({{lang|zh|向达}}),  《关于三宝太监下西洋的几种资料》("Regarding several kinds of historical materials on the expeditions of Eunuch Grand Director Sanbao to the Western Ocean"), in 《郑和研究百年论文选》(''100 Years of Zheng He Studies: Selected Writings'', {{ISBN|730107154X}}, p. 10).&lt;/ref&gt; Ma received a proper education while at Beiping, which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital Nanjing, as the [[Hongwu]] Emperor did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate.&lt;ref name=lev6-63/&gt; Meanwhile, the Hongwu Emperor purged and exterminated many of the original Ming leadership and gave his [[enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] sons more military authority, especially those in the north like the Prince of Yan.&lt;ref name="dr7-19"/&gt;

==Adulthood and military career==
Ma He's appearance as an adult was recorded: he was seven ''chi''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A ''chi'' is thought to vary between 10.5 to 12 inches (Dreyer 2007, 19).}} tall, had a waist that was five ''chi'' in circumference, cheeks and a forehead that was high, a small nose, glaring eyes, teeth that were white and well-shaped as shells, and a voice that was as loud as a bell. It is also recorded that he had great knowledge about warfare and was well-accustomed to battle.&lt;ref name="Levathes 1996, 62"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer 2007, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young eunuch eventually became a trusted adviser to the prince and assisted him when the [[Jianwen Emperor]]'s hostility to his uncle's feudal bases prompted the 1399{{ndash}}1402 [[Jingnan Campaign]] which ended with the emperor's apparent death and the ascension of the Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, as the [[Yongle Emperor]]. In 1393, the Crown Prince had died, thus the deceased prince's son became the new heir apparent.&lt;ref name=dr7-19/&gt; By the time the emperor died (24 June 1398), the Prince of Qin and the Prince of Jin had perished, which left Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, as the eldest surviving son of the emperor.&lt;ref name=dr7-19&gt;Dreyer 2007, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zhu Di's nephew succeeded the imperial throne as the [[Jianwen Emperor]].&lt;ref name=dr7-20&gt;Dreyer 2007, 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1398, he issued a policy known as ''xuēfān'', or "reducing the feudatories", which entails eliminating all the princes by stripping their power and military forces.&lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1399, Zhu Di openly rebelled against his nephew.&lt;ref name=dr7-21&gt;Dreyer 2007, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1399, Ma He successfully defended Beiping's city reservoir Zhenglunba against the imperial armies.&lt;ref name=dr7-22-3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1402, Zhu Di began with his military campaign to capture the imperial capital Nanjing.&lt;ref name=lev6-70&gt;Levathes 1996, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng He would be one of his commanders during this campaign.&lt;ref name=lev6-70/&gt;

In 1402, Zhu Di's armies defeated the imperial forces and marched into Nanjing on 13 July 1402.&lt;ref name=lev6-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=dr7-21-2/&gt; Zhu Di accepted the elevation to emperor four days later.&lt;ref name=dr7-21-2/&gt; After ascending the throne as the Yongle Emperor, Zhu Di promoted Ma He as the Grand Director ({{lang|zh|太監}}, ''tài jiàn'') of the Directorate of Palace Servants.&lt;ref name=dr7-21-2&gt;Dreyer 2007, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Chinese New Year|New Year]]'s day on 11 February 1404,&lt;ref name=dr7-22-3/&gt; the Yongle Emperor conferred the surname "Zheng" to Ma He, because he had distinguished himself defending the city reservoir Zhenglunba against imperial forces in the Siege of Beiping of 1399,&lt;ref name=dr7-22-3&gt;Dreyer 2007, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lev6-72-3&gt;Levathes 1997, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was that the eunuch commander also distinguished himself during the 1402 campaign to capture the capital Nanjing.&lt;ref name=lev6-72-3/&gt; It is believed that his choice to confer the surname "Zheng" was because the eunuch's horse had been killed during the battle at Zhenglunba near Beiping at the onset of his rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Levathes 1996, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|what is the significance of this?|date=April 2015}}

In the new administration, Zheng He served in the highest posts, as Grand Director&lt;ref name="Mills 1970, p. 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="China p. 621"&gt;''Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture'', p. 621.

Over the next three decades he conducted seven of these voyages on behalf of the emperor, trading and collecting tribute in the eastern Pacific and Indian Oceans.

In 1424, Admiral Zheng He traveled to Palembang to confer an official seal{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The ''Taizong Shilu'' 27 February 1424 entry reports that Zheng He was sent to deliver the seal, because the old seal was destroyed in a fire.

The later ''Mingshi'' compilers seem to have combined these accounts, remarking that Shi Jisun's succession was approved in 1424 and that a new seal was delivered in 1425, suggesting that only one seal was destroyed by fire. (Dreyer 2007, 96)}} and letter of appointment upon Shi Jisun, who was placed in the office of Pacification Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=95 &amp; 136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Taizong Shilu'' 27 February 1424 entry reports that Shi Jisun had sent Qiu Yancheng as envoy to petition the approval of the succession from his father Shi Jinqing, who was the Pacification Commissioner of Palembang, and was given permission from the Yongle Emperor.&lt;ref name=dr7-95&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 1424, Zhu Gaozhi had inherited the throne as the Hongxi Emperor after the death of the Yongle Emperor on 12 August 1424.&lt;ref name=dr7-1367&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=136–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Duyvendak|1938|loc=388}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Zheng He returned from Palembang, he found that the Yongle Emperor had died during his absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=95, 136–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Duyvendak|1938|loc=387}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ascension of Zhu Di's son as the [[Hongxi Emperor]], the ocean voyages were discontinued and Zheng He was instead appointed as [[Defender of Nanjing]], the empire's southern capital. In that post, he was largely responsible for the completion of the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], an enormous [[pagoda]] still described as a wonder of the world as late as the 19th century.

On 15 May 1426, the Xuande Emperor ordered the Directorate of Ceremonial to send a letter to Zheng He to reprimand him for a transgression.&lt;ref name=dr7-1412&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=141–142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, an official{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Unnamed official who served as a Department Director under the Ministry of Works, who earlier had departed for Nanjing to supervise the renovation of government buildings and to reward the skilled workers (Dreyer 2007, 141).}} petitioned the emperor to reward workmen who had built temples in Nanjing.&lt;ref name=dr7-1412/&gt; The Xuande Emperor responded negatively to the official for placing the costs to the court instead of the monks themselves, but he realized that Zheng He and his associates had instigated the official.&lt;ref name=dr7-1412/&gt; Dreyer (2007) noted that the nature of the emperor's words indicated that Zheng He's behaviour in this situation was the last straw, but that there's too little information about what had transpired beforehand.&lt;ref name=dr7-1412/&gt; Nevertheless, the Xuande Emperor would eventually come to trust Zheng He.&lt;ref name=dr7-1412/&gt;

In 1430, the new [[Xuande Emperor]] appointed Zheng He to command over a seventh and final expedition into the "Western Ocean" (Indian Ocean).&lt;ref&gt;Mills 1970, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1431, Zheng He was bestowed with the title "''Sānbǎo Tài Jiàn''" ({{lang|zh|三寶太監}}), using his informal name Sanbao ("Three Treasures") together with the title of Grand Director.&lt;ref name=mi70-7&gt;Mills 1970, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
One theory is that Admiral Zheng He died in 1433.&lt;ref name="d7-165"/&gt; It may have happened during or shortly after the seventh voyage.&lt;ref name=d7-165&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|loc=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another belief is that Zheng He continued to serve as the defender of Nanjing, dying in 1435.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mills|1970|loc=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A tomb was built for Zheng He at the southern slope of Cattle Head Hill, [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref name=lin05/&gt; The original tomb was a horseshoe-shaped grave.&lt;ref name=lin05/&gt; It is a [[cenotaph]] believed to contain his clothes and headgear.&lt;ref name=lin05/&gt; In 1985, the tomb was rebuilt following a Muslim style.&lt;ref name=lin05&gt;{{cite book|date=2005|title=Zheng He's Voyages Down the Western Seas|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|page=45|editor=Lin (Chief Editor).

He adopted the eldest son of his elder brother, who was awarded a hereditary officer rank in the imperial guard.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Expeditions==
{{main article|Ming treasure voyages}}
The [[Yuan dynasty]] and expanding Sino-Arab trade during the 14th century had gradually expanded Chinese knowledge of the world: "universal" maps previously only displaying China and its surrounding seas began to expand further and further into the southwest with much more accurate depictions of the extent of Arabia and Africa.&lt;ref name=marichang/&gt; Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored seven naval expeditions.

While Zheng He's fleet was unprecedented, the routes were not. Zheng He's fleet was following long-established, well-mapped routes of trade between China and the [[Arabian peninsula]] employed since at least the [[Han dynasty]]. This fact, along with the use of a more than abundant number of crew members that were regular military personnel, leads some to speculate that these expeditions may have been geared at least partially at spreading China's power through expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book Review of Zheng He: China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405–1433|first=David A. |last=Graffe |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6e77ebc7-6b4e-4827-bf59-1136f1b39b63%40sessionmgr14&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=10 |work=Journal of Military History |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Three Kingdoms]] Period, the king of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] sent a twenty year long diplomatic mission led by Zhu Ying and Kang Tai along the coast of Asia, which reached as far as the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ILD_UPzMG7kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=king+of+Wu+mission+to+Roman+Empire#v=onepage&amp;q=king%20of%20Wu%20mission%20to%20Roman%20Empire&amp;f=false|title=Chinese Maritime Activities and Socioeconomic Development, C. 2100 BC–1900 AD|last=Deng|first=Gang|date=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313292125|location=|page=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After centuries of disruption, the [[Song dynasty]] restored large-scale maritime trade from China in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, reaching as far as the Arabian peninsula and East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Deng 2005&lt;/ref&gt; When his fleet first arrived in [[Malacca]], there was already a sizable Chinese community.

Zheng He generally sought to attain his goals through diplomacy, and his large army awed most would-be enemies into submission.

In 1424, the Yongle Emperor died. His successor, the [[Hongxi Emperor]] (r. 1424{{ndash}}1425), stopped the voyages during his short reign. Zheng He made one more voyage during the reign of Hongxi's son, the [[Xuande Emperor of China|Xuande Emperor]] (r. 1426–1435) but, after that, the voyages of the Chinese treasure ship fleets were ended. Xuande believed his father's decision to halt the voyages had been meritorious and thus "there would be no need to make a detailed description of his grandfather's sending Zheng He to the Western Ocean."&lt;ref name=HuiChunHing/&gt; The voyages "were contrary to the rules stipulated in the [[Huang Ming Zuxun]]" ({{lang|zh|皇明祖訓}}), the dynastic foundation documents laid down by the [[Hongwu Emperor]]:&lt;ref name=HuiChunHing/&gt;

Although unmentioned in the official dynastic histories, Zheng He probably died during the treasure fleet's last voyage.&lt;ref name=marichang/&gt; Although he has a tomb in China, it is empty: he was [[buried at sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?type=explorersection&amp;id=57 |title=The Seventh and Final Grand Voyage of the Treasure Fleet |publisher=Mariner.org |accessdate=23 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220112256/http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?type=explorersection&amp;id=57 |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zheng He led seven expeditions to the "Western" or Indian Ocean. Zheng He brought back to China many trophies and envoys from more than thirty kingdoms – including King Vira Alakeshwara of [[Ceylon]], who came to China as a captive to apologize to the Emperor for offenses against his mission.

Zheng himself wrote of his travels:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have traversed more than 100,000 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' of immense water spaces and have beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising in the sky, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds day and night, continued their course [as rapidly] as a star, traversing those savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare...&lt;ref&gt;Tablet erected by Zheng He in [[Changle]], Fujian, in 1432. Louise Levathes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sailing charts==
{{see also|Chinese geography|Mao Kun map}}
[[File:WuBeiZhi.jpg|thumb|One of a set of maps of Zheng He's missions (郑和航海图), also known as the [[Mao Kun map]], 1628]]
[[File:Zhenghe-sailing-chart.gif|thumb|A section of the ''Wubei Zhi'' oriented east: India in the upper left, Sri Lanka upper right, and Africa along the bottom.]]

Zheng He's sailing charts, the [[Mao Kun map]], were published in a book entitled the ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'' (''A Treatise on Armament Technology'') written in 1621 and published in 1628 but traced back to Zheng He's and earlier voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Marine Cartography: Sea Charts of Pre-Modern China|author=Mei-Ling Hsu|edition=Imago Mundi |volume=40|pages=96–112|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally a strip map 20.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 560&amp;nbsp;cm that could be rolled up, but was divided into 40 pages which vary in scale from 7 miles/inch in the Nanjing area to 215 miles/inch in parts of the African coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Ma Huan Ying Yai Sheng Lan: The overall survey of the ocean shores|author=Mills, J.V.|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation into folios 19V to 20R of the Mao Kun Map which covers the Indian Ocean including South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and East Africa suggests that it is a composite of four maps, one for Sri Lanka, one for South India one for the Maldives and one for around 400&amp;nbsp;km of the East African coast, no further south than 6 degrees south of the Equator. Each of these maps is positioned at a different orientation to fit with the ocean currents and winds required of a sailing chart, rather than a formal map. The analysis also suggests that Arabic-speaking pilots with a detailed knowledge of the African coast were involved in the cartography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zheng He and the Afro-Asian World.|first1=Chia Lin |last1=Sien |first2=Sally K. |last2=Church |publisher=Perbadanan Muzium Melaka |year=2012 |isbn=978-9671138601 |pages=273–77 |chapter=Chapter 12 by Clifford J Pereira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little attempt to provide an accurate 2-D representation; instead the sailing instructions are given using a [[Chinese directions|24-point compass system]] with a Chinese symbol for each point, together with a sailing time or distance, which takes account of the local currents and winds. Sometimes depth soundings are also provided. It also shows bays, estuaries, capes and islands, ports and mountains along the coast, important landmarks such as pagodas and temples, and shoal rocks. Of 300 named places outside China, more than 80% can be confidently located. There are also fifty observations of stellar altitude.

==Size of the ships==
Traditional and popular accounts of Zheng He's voyages have described a great fleet of gigantic ships, far larger than any other wooden ships in history.

Chinese records&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer (2007): 82–95&lt;/ref&gt; state that Zheng He's fleet sailed as far as East Africa. According to medieval Chinese sources, Zheng He commanded seven expeditions. The 1405 expedition consisted of 27,800 men and a fleet of 62 treasure ships supported by approximately 190 smaller ships.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer (2007): 122–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_focus/2005-07/05/content_70352.htm |title=Briton charts Zheng He's course across globe |publisher=Chinaculture.org |accessdate=23 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220064849/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_focus/2005-07/05/content_70352.htm |archivedate=20 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet included:
* "[[Chinese treasure ship]]s" ({{lang|zh|宝船}}, ''Bǎo Chuán''), used by the commander of the fleet and his deputies (nine-masted, about {{convert|127|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|52|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide), according to later writers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
* Equine ships ({{lang|zh|馬船}}, ''Mǎ Chuán''), carrying horses and tribute goods and repair material for the fleet (eight-masted, about {{convert|103|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|42|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide).
* Supply ships ({{lang|zh|粮船}}, ''Liáng Chuán''), containing staple for the crew (seven-masted, about {{convert|78|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide).
* Troop transports ({{lang|zh|兵船}}, ''Bīng Chuán''), six-masted, about {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.
* Fuchuan warships ({{lang|zh|福船}}, ''Fú Chuán''), five-masted, about {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.
* Patrol boats ({{lang|zh|坐船}}, ''Zuò Chuán''), eight-oared, about {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.
* Water tankers ({{lang|zh|水船}}, ''Shuǐ Chuán''), with 1 month's supply of fresh water.

Six more expeditions took place, from 1407 to 1433, with fleets of comparable size.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

If the accounts can be taken as factual Zheng He's treasure ships were mammoth ships with nine masts, four decks, and were capable of accommodating more than 500 passengers, as well as a massive amount of cargo. [[Marco Polo]] and [[Ibn Battuta]] both described multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1,000 passengers in their translated accounts.&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Civilization in China'', [[Joseph Needham]], Volume 4, Section 3, pp. 460–70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Da Conti]], a contemporary of Zheng He, was also an eyewitness of ships in Southeast Asia, claiming to have seen 5 masted junks weighing about 2,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Civilization in China'', Joseph Needham, Volume 4, Section 3, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; There are even some sources that claim some of the treasure ships might have been as long as 600 feet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CqzDSC9VzFEC&amp;pg=PA49 ''Taiwan: A New History''], Murray A. Rubinstein, p. 49, M.E. Sharp, 1999, {{ISBN|1563248158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=588&amp;art_id=vn20021111065452169C237696&amp;set_id=1 ''Chinese discoverers dwarfed European travels''], Tony Weaver, IOL, 11 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; On the ships were navigators, explorers, sailors, doctors, workers, and soldiers along with the translator and diarist [[Gong Zhen]].

The largest ships in the fleet, the [[Chinese treasure ships]] described in Chinese chronicles, would have been several times [[List of world's largest wooden ships|larger than any other wooden ship]] ever recorded in history, surpassing [[French ship L'Orient (1791)|''l'Orient'']], {{convert|65|m|ft|1}} long, which was built in the late 18th century. The first ships to attain {{convert|126|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long were 19th century steamers with iron hulls. Some scholars argue that it is highly unlikely that Zheng He's ship was {{convert|450|ft|m|1}} in length, some estimating that they were {{convert|390|–|408|ft|m|1}} long and {{convert|160|–|166|ft|m|1}} wide instead&lt;ref&gt;''When China Ruled the Seas'', Louise Levathes, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; while others put them as small as {{convert|200|–|250|ft|m|1}} in length, which would make them smaller than the equine, supply, and troop ships in the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

One explanation for the seemingly inefficient size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely used by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats to travel along the Yangtze for court business, including reviewing Zheng He's expedition fleet. The Yangtze river, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable by these treasure ships. Zheng He, a court eunuch, would not have had the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships, seaworthy or not. The main ships of Zheng He's fleet were instead 6 masted 2000-liao ships.&lt;ref name="Technical1"&gt;Xin Yuanou: ''Guanyu Zheng He baochuan chidu de jishu fenxi (A Technical Analysis of the Size of Zheng He's Ships).''

In the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled. The information in the [[Ming Taizong Shilu|Yongle]] and [[Ming Xuanzong Shilu|Xuande Emperors' official annals]] was incomplete and even erroneous; other official publications omitted them completely.&lt;ref name="HMZX"/&gt; Although some have seen this as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages,&lt;ref name="heyhei"/&gt; it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions {{ndash}} unauthorized by (and in fact, counter to) the [[Huang Ming Zu Xun|injunctions of the dynastic founder]] {{ndash}} presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty.&lt;ref name="HMZX"/&gt;

State-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng's voyages. Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the [[Northern Yuan dynasty|surviving Yuan Mongols]] from the north. The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu Fortress]], less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. This battle had two salient effects. First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new [[Jingtai Emperor|Jingtai era]]. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the [[Great Wall of China]]. In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen.

However, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades. Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them: the ''[[History of Ming]]'' records imperial edicts forbidding Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years.&lt;ref name="Tata"/&gt;

====Veneration of Zheng He====
[[File:Cakra Donya.JPG|thumb|The Cakra Donya Bell, a gift from Zheng He to [[Pasai]], now located at the Museum Aceh in [[Banda Aceh]].]]

Among the [[Chinese diaspora]] in Southeast Asia, Zheng He became a figure of folk veneration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121211193248/http://ias.umn.edu/2012/11/20/wade-geoffrey/  Geoffery Wade lecture Nov, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Even some of his crew members who happened to stay in this or that port sometimes did as well, such as "Poontaokong" on Sulu.&lt;ref name="Tata"&gt;Tan Ta Sen &amp; al.

====Malacca====
[[File:马六甲三宝庙.JPG|thumb|The [[Poh San Teng Temple|Sam Po Kong Temple]] in Malacca.]]

The oldest and most important Chinese temple in Malacca is the 17th-century Cheng Hoon Teng, dedicated to [[Guanyin]]. During [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial rule]], the head of the Cheng Hoon Temple was appointed chief over the community's Chinese inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Tata"/&gt;

Following Zheng He's arrival, the sultan and sultana of Malacca visited China at the head of over 540 of their subjects, bearing ample tribute. Sultan [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|Mansur Shah]] (r. 1459{{ndash}}1477) later dispatched Tun Perpatih Putih as his envoy to China, carrying a letter from the sultan to the Ming emperor. The letter requested the hand of an imperial daughter in marriage. Malay (but not Chinese) annals record that, in the year 1459, a princess named [[Hang Li Po]] or Hang Liu was sent from China to marry the sultan. The princess came with 500 high-ranking young men and a few hundred handmaidens as her entourage. They eventually settled in [[Bukit Cina]]. It is believed that a significant number of them married into the local populace, creating the descendants now known as the [[Peranakan]].&lt;ref name="malacca"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Shaoqing|title=Zheng He's Voyages down the Western Seas|editor=Office of the People's Goverernment of Fujian Province|publisher=China Intercontinental Press|location=Fujian, China|year=2005|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QmpkR6l5MaMC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=2 August 2009 | isbn=978-7508507088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to this supposed lineage, the Peranakan still use special honorifics: ''Baba'' for the men and ''[[Nyonya]]'' for the women.

Indonesian Chinese have established temples to Zheng He in [[Jakarta]], [[Cirebon]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Semarang]].&lt;ref name="Tata"/&gt;

In 1961, the [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian]] Islamic leader and scholar [[Hamka]] credited Zheng He with an important role in the development of Islam in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Rosey Ma. "[http://210.0.141.99/eng/malaysia/ChineseMuslim_in_Malaysia.asp Chinese Muslims in Malaysia, History and Development]".{{unreliablesource-inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brunei Times'' credits Zheng He with building Chinese Muslim communities in [[Palembang]] and along the shores of [[Java]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], and the [[Philippines]]. These Muslims allegedly followed the [[Hanafi]] school in the Chinese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AQSHA|first=DARUL|title=Zheng He and Islam in Southeast Asia|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2010/07/13/zheng-he-and-islam-southeast-asia|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=The Brunei Times|date=13 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509022407/http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2010/07/13/zheng-he-and-islam-southeast-asia|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Chinese Muslim community was led by Hajji [[Yan Ying Yu]], who urged his followers to assimilate and take local names. The Chinese trader [[Sun Long (merchant)|Sun Long]] even supposedly adopted the son of the king of [[Majapahit]] and his Chinese wife, a son who went on to become [[Sultanate of Demak#Raden Patah|Raden Patah]].&lt;ref&gt;Li Tong Cai.

"[http://www.gimonca.com/sejarah/walisongo.shtml Wali Songo: The Nine Walis]".{{unreliablesource-inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid this assimilation (and loss of contact with China itself), the Hanafi Islam became absorbed by the local [[Shafi'i]] school and the presence of distinctly ethnic Chinese Muslims dwindled to almost nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Suryadinata Leo | title=Admiral Zheng He &amp; Southeast Asia | publisher=Singapore Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | year=2005 | isbn=978-9812303295 | url=http://www.infobold.com/ChinaBooks/search.cfm?UR=26121&amp;search_stage=details&amp;records_to_display=50&amp;this_book_number=10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313131250/http://www.infobold.com/ChinaBooks/search.cfm?UR=26121&amp;search_stage=details&amp;records_to_display=50&amp;this_book_number=10 | archivedate=13 March 2007 | df=dmy-all }}{{verifysource|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Malay Annals'' also record a number of Hanafi mosques {{ndash}} in [[Semarang]] and [[Ancol]], for instance {{ndash}} were converted directly into temples of the Zheng He cult during the 1460s and '70s.&lt;ref name="Tata"/&gt; The [[Sam Poo Kong]] temple in Semarang was built to commemorate Zheng He's voyage to Java.

===Modern scholarship===
In the 1950s, historians such as [[John Fairbank]] and [[Joseph Needham]] popularized the idea that after Zheng He's voyages China turned away from the seas due to the ''[[Haijin]]'' edict and was isolated from European technological advancements. Modern historians point out that Chinese maritime commerce did not totally stop after Zheng He, that Chinese ships continued to participate in Southeast Asian commerce until the 19th century, and that active Chinese trading with India and East Africa continued long after the time of Zheng. Moreover, [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] such as [[Jack Goldstone]] argue that the Zheng He voyages ended for practical reasons that did not reflect the technological level of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = Goldstone
| first = Jack
| title = The Rise of the West – or Not? A Revision to Socio-economic History
| url = http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/10/114.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ming dynasty did ban shipping with the ''Haijin'' edict, this was a policy of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] that long preceded Zheng He and the ban {{ndash}} so obviously disregarded by the [[Yongle Emperor]] {{ndash}} was eventually lifted entirely. However, the ban on maritime shipping did force countless numbers of people into smuggling and [[wokou|piracy]]. Neglect of the imperial navy and Nanjing dockyards after Zheng He's voyages left the coast highly vulnerable to Japanese [[Wokou]] during the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Wang2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuan-Kang Wang|title=Harmony and War: Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxVfTuKsaJQC&amp;pg=PT286|date=20 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231522403|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grygiel2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jakub J.

[[Richard von Glahn]], a [[UCLA]] professor of Chinese history, commented that most treatments of Zheng He present him wrongly: they "offer counterfactual arguments" and "emphasize China's missed opportunity." This "narrative emphasizes the failure" instead of the accomplishments, despite his assertion that "Zheng He reshaped Asia." Glahn argues that maritime history in the 15th century was essentially the Zheng He story and the effects of his voyages.&lt;ref name="glaan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/china/article.asp?parentid=10387 |title=Zheng He's Voyages of Discovery&amp;nbsp;– UCLA center for Chinese Study|publisher=International.ucla.edu |date=20 April 2004 |accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influence===
Despite the official neglect, the adventures of the fleet captured the imagination of some Chinese and novelizations of the voyages occurred, such as the ''Romance of the Three-Jeweled Eunuch'' in 1597.&lt;ref name="heyhei"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UMIKjFQB98MC&amp;pg=PA121 Blacks in Pre-Modern China]'', pp. 121–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his travels, Zheng He built mosques{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} while also spreading the worship of [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]]. He apparently never found time for a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] but did send sailors there on his last voyage. He played an important part in developing relations between China and Islamic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan Ta Sen|title=Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia|year=2009|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-9812308375|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIUmU2ytmIIC&amp;pg=PA171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunn|first=Geoffrey C.|title=History Without Borders: The Making of an Asian World Region, 1000–1800|year=2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-9888083343|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E10tnvapZt0C&amp;pg=PA117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng He also visited Muslim shrines of Islamic holy men in the [[Fujian]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In modern times, interest in Zheng He revived substantially. In [[Vernor Vinge]]'s 1999 science-fiction novel ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]'', an interstellar society of commercial traders in human space are named the Qeng Ho after the admiral. The expeditions featured prominently in [[Heather Terrell]]'s 2005 novel ''The Map Thief''. For the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyages in 2005, the China's [[China Central Television|CCTV]] produced a special television series ''[[Zheng He Xia Xiyang (TV series)|Zheng He Xia Xiyang]]'', starring [[Gallen Lo]] as Zheng He. He is also mentioned in part of the main storyline of the first-person shooter game [[Far Cry 3]].

===Relics===
;Nanjing Temple of Mazu
Zheng He built the Tianfei Palace (天妃宫, ''Tiānfēigōng'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Palace of the Celestial Wife"), a temple in honor of the [[Chinese mythology|goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], in Nanjing after the fleet returned from its first western voyage in 1407.

;Taicang Stele
The "Deed of Foreign Connection and Exchange" (通番事跡) or "Tongfan Deed Stele" is located in the Tianfei Palace in [[Liuhe, Taicang]], whence the expeditions first departed. The [[stele]] was submerged and lost, but has been rebuilt.

;Nanshan Stele
In order to thank the [[Mazu (goddess)|Celestial Wife]] for her blessings, Zheng He and his colleagues rebuilt the Tianfei Palace in Nanshan, [[Changle]] county, in Fujian province as well prior to departing on their last voyage. At the renovated temple, they raised a stele entitled "A Record of Tianfei Showing Her Presence and Power" (天妃靈應之記, '' Tiānfēi Líng Yīng zhī Jì''), discussing their earlier voyages.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, Robert J. "[http://www.hist.umn.edu/hist1012/primarysource/source.htm Primary Source: Zheng He Inscription]". Univ. of Minnesota. Retrieved 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sri Lankan Stele
The [[Galle Trilingual Inscription]] in Sri Lanka was discovered in the city of [[Galle]] in 1911 and is preserved at the [[National Museum of Colombo]]. The three languages used in the inscription were Chinese, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and Persian. The inscription praises [[Buddha]] and describes the fleet's donations to the famous [[Tondeswaram temple|Tenavarai Nayanar temple]] of [[Tondeswaram]] frequented by both [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua News Agency.

;Tomb and Museum
Zheng He's tomb in Nanjing has been repaired and a small museum built next to it, although his body was buried at sea off the [[Malabar Coast]] near Calicut in western India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levathes |first=Louise |title=When China Ruled The Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405–1433 |page=172 |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=978-0195112078 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hvay9yk04AC&amp;pg=PA172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his sword and other personal possessions were interred in a Muslim tomb inscribed in Arabic.

The tomb of Zheng He's assistant [[Hong Bao]] was recently unearthed in Nanjing, as well.

===Commemoration===
In the People's Republic of China, 11 July is [[China National Maritime Day|Maritime Day]] ({{lang|zh|中国航海日}}, ''Zhōngguó Hánghǎi Rì'') and is devoted to the memory of Zheng He's first voyage. Initially [[Kunming Changshui International Airport]] was to be named Zheng He International Airport.

In 2015 [[Emotion Media Factory]] dedicated a special multimedia show "Zheng He is coming" for amusement park [[Romon U-Park]] ([[Ningbo]], China). The show became a finalist of the amusement industry prestigious Brass Rings Awards by [[IAAPA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blooloop.com/news/emotion-media-factory-multimedia-romon-u-park/29189#.VjdwG3rhDIU {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923192214/http://www.blooloop.com/news/emotion-media-factory-multimedia-romon-u-park/29189 |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.eap-magazin.de/48-News/4150,China%3A-Two-New-Multimedia-Shows-at-Romon-U-Park.html | title=China: Two New Multimedia Shows at Romon U-Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;
