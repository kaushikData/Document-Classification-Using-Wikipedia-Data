      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11641">In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[group theory]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], '''Arithmetic Kleinian groups''' are a special class of [[Kleinian group]]s constructed using [[Order (ring theory)|order]]s in [[quaternion algebra]]s. They are particular instances of [[arithmetic group]]s. An '''arithmetic hyperbolic three-manifold''' is the quotient of [[hyperbolic space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb H^3&lt;/math&gt; by an arithmetic Kleinian group. These manifolds include some particularly beautiful or remarkable examples.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Quaternion algebras ===
{{Main| Quaternion algebra}}

A quaternion algebra over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a four-dimensional [[Central simple algebra|central simple]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. A quaternion algebra has a basis &lt;math&gt;1, i, j, ij&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i^2, j^2 \in F^\times&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ij = -ji&lt;/math&gt;.

A quaternion algebra is said to be split over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if it is isomorphic as an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra to the algebra of matrices &lt;math&gt;M_2(F)&lt;/math&gt;; a quaternion algebra over an algebraically closed field is always split.

If &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; into a field &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; we shall denote by &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_\sigma E&lt;/math&gt; the algebra obtained by [[Extension of scalars|extending scalars]] from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; where we view &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; as a subfield of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arithmetic Kleinian groups ===

A subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''derived from a quaternion algebra'' if it can be obtained through the following construction. Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a [[number field]] which has exactly two embeddings into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; whose image is not contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; (one conjugate to the other). Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a quaternion algebra over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that for any embedding &lt;math&gt;\tau: F \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; the algebra &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_\tau \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the [[Hamilton quaternions]]. Next we need an order &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O^1&lt;/math&gt; be the group of elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; of reduced norm 1 and let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be its image in &lt;math&gt;M_2(\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. We then consider the Kleinian group obtained as the image in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathcal O^1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The main fact about these groups is that they are discrete subgroups and they have finite covolume for the [[Haar measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the construction above yields a cocompact subgroup if and only if the algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is not split over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The discreteness is a rather immediate consequence of the fact that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is only split at its complex embeddings. The finiteness of covolume is harder to prove.{{sfn|Maclachlan|Reid|2003|loc=Theorem 8.1.2}}

An ''arithmetic Kleinian group'' is any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; which is [[commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] to a group derived from a quaternion algebra. It follows immediately from this definition that arithmetic Kleinian groups are discrete and of finite covolume (this means that they are [[Lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattices]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Examples ===

Examples are provided by taking &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to be an [[imaginary quadratic field]], &lt;math&gt;A = M_2(F)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O = M_2(O_F)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;O_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ring of integers]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; (for example &lt;math&gt;F = \mathbb Q(i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_F = \mathbb Z[i]&lt;/math&gt;). The groups thus obtained are the [[Bianchi group]]s. They are not cocompact, and any arithmetic Kleinian group which is not commensurable to a conjugate of a Bianchi group is cocompact.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is any quaternion algebra over an imaginary quadratic number field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; which is not isomorphic to a matrix algebra then the unit groups of orders in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are cocompact.

== Trace field of arithmetic manifolds ==

The invariant [[trace field]] of a Kleinian group (or, through the monodromy image of the fundamental group, of an hyperbolic manifold) is the field generated by the traces of the squares of its elements. In the case of an arithmetic manifold whose fundamental groups is commensurable with that of a manifold derived from a quaternion algebra over a number field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; the invariant trace field equals &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

One can in fact characterise arithmetic manifolds through the traces of the elements of their fundamental group. A Kleinian group is an arithmetic group if and only if the following three conditions are realised:
*Its invariant trace field &lt;matH&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a number field with exactly one complex place; 
*The traces of its elements are [[algebraic integer]]s; 
*For any &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the group, &lt;math&gt;t=\mathrm{Trace}(\gamma^2)&lt;/math&gt; and any embedding &lt;math&gt;\sigma: F \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|\sigma(t)| \le 2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Geometry and spectrum of arithmetic hyperbolic three-manifolds ==

=== Volume formula ===

For the volume an arithmetic three manifold &lt;math&gt;M = \Gamma_{\mathcal O} \backslash \mathbb H^3&lt;/math&gt; derived from a maximal order in a quaternion algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; over a number field &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; we have the expression:{{sfn|Maclachlan|Reid|2003|loc=Theorem 11.1.3}}

&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{vol}(M) =  \frac {2 |D_F|^{\frac 3 2} \cdot \zeta_F(2)} {2^{2r + 1} \cdot \pi^{2r}} \cdot \prod_{\mathfrak p | D_A} (N(\mathfrak p) - 1). &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_A,D_F&lt;/math&gt; are the [[discriminant]]s of &lt;math&gt;A,F&lt;/math&gt; respectively, &lt;math&gt;\zeta_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dedekind zeta function]] of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r = [F:\mathbb Q]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Finiteness results ===

A consequence of the volume formula in the previous paragraph is that

:''Given &lt;math&gt;v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there are at most finitely many arithmetic hyperbolic 3&amp;ndash;manifolds with volume less than &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. ''

This is in contrast with the fact that [[hyperbolic Dehn surgery]] can be used to produce infinitely many non-isometric hyperbolic 3&amp;ndash;manifolds with bounded volume. In particular, a corollary is that given a cusped hyperbolic manifold, at most finitely many Dehn surgeries on it can yield an arithmetic hyperbolic manifold.

=== Remarkable arithmetic hyperbolic three-manifolds ===

The [[Weeks manifold]] is the hyperbolic three-manifold of smallest volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Milley | first=Peter | title=Minimum volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. | journal=J. Topol. | volume=2 | year=2009 | pages=181–192 | mr=2499442 | doi=10.1112/jtopol/jtp006| arxiv=0809.0346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Meyerhoff manifold]] is the one of next smallest volume.

The complement in the three—sphere of the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] is an arithmetic hyperbolic three—manifold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Riley | first=Robert | title=A quadratic parabolic group | journal=Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. | volume=77 | year=1975 | pages=281–288 | mr=0412416 | doi=10.1017/s0305004100051094| bibcode=1975MPCPS..77..281R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and attains the smallest volume among all cusped hyperbolic three-manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cao | first1=Chun | last2=Meyerhoff |first2=G. Robert | title=The orientable cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds of minimum volume | journal=Invent. Math. | volume=146 | year=2001 | pages=451–478 | mr=1869847 | doi=10.1007/s002220100167| bibcode=2001InMat.146..451C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spectrum and Ramanujan conjectures ===

The [[Ramanujan conjecture]] for automorphic forms on &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}(2)&lt;/math&gt; over a number field would imply that for any congruence cover of an arithmetic three&amp;ndash;manifold (derived from a quaternion algebra) the spectrum of the Laplace operator is contained in &lt;math&gt;[1, +\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Arithmetic manifolds in three-dimensional topology ==

Many of Thurston's conjectures (for example the [[virtually Haken conjecture]]), now all known to be true following the work of Ian Agol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Ian |last1=Agol | title=The virtual Haken Conjecture | others=With an appendix by Ian Agol, Daniel Groves, and Jason Manning | journal=Doc. Math. | year=2013 | pages=1045–1087 | volume=18 | mr=3104553 | url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/documenta/vol-18/33.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; were checked first for arithmetic manifolds by using specific methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lackenby | first1=Marc | last2=Long | first2=Darren D. | last3=Reid | first3=Alan W. | title=Covering spaces of arithmetic 3-orbifolds | journal=Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some arithmetic cases the Virtual Haken conjecture is known by general means but it is not known if its solution can be arrived at by purely arithmetic means (i.e. by finding a congruence subgroup with positive first Betti number).

Arithmetic manifolds can be used to give examples of manifolds with large injectivity radius whose first Betti number vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Calegari| first1=Frank | last2=Dunfield | first2=Nathan | title=Automorphic forms and rational homology 3-spheres | journal=Geom. Topol. | volume=10 | year=2006 | pages=295–329 | doi=10.2140/gt.2006.10.295| arxiv=math/0508271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boston | first1=Nigel | last2=Ellenberg | first2=Jordan | title=Pro-p groups and towers of rational homology spheres | journal=Geom. Topol. | volume=10 | year=2006 | pages=331–334 | doi=10.2140/gt.2006.10.331| arxiv=0902.4567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remark by William Thurston is that arithmetic manifolds "...often seem to have special beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Thurston | first=William | date=1982 | title=Three-dimensional manifolds, Kleinian groups and hyperbolic geometry | url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=648524 | journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) | volume=6 | pages=357–381 | doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-1982-15003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be substantiated by results showing that the relation between topology and geometry for these manifolds is much more predictable than in general. For example:
*For a given genus ''g'' there are at most finitely many arithmetic (congruence) hyperbolic 3&amp;ndash;manifolds which fiber over the circle with a fiber of genus ''g''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=harv | last1=Biringer | first1=Ian | last2=Souto | first2=Juan | title=A finiteness theorem for hyperbolic 3-manifolds | journal=J.

*There are at most finitely many arithmetic (congruence) hyperbolic 3&amp;ndash;manifolds with a given Heegaard genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gromov | first1=Misha | author1-link = Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov | last2=Guth | first2=Larry | author2-link = Larry Guth | title=Generalizations of the Kolmogorov-Barzdin embedding estimates | journal=Duke Math.

{{Wiktionary|ascendency}}

'''Ascendency''' is a quantitative attribute of an [[ecosystem]], defined as a function of the ecosystem's [[trophic network]].  Ascendency is derived using mathematical tools from [[information theory]].  It is intended to capture in a single index the ability of an ecosystem to prevail against [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] by virtue of its combined organization and size.

One way of depicting ascendency is to regard it as "organized power", because the index represents the magnitude of the power that is flowing within the system towards particular ends, as distinct from power that is dissipated willy-nilly. Almost half a century earlier, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922) had suggested that a system's capacity to prevail in evolution was related to its ability to capture useful power. Ascendency can thus be regarded as a refinement of Lotka's supposition that also takes into account how power is actually being channeled within a system.

In mathematical terms, ascendency is the product of the aggregate amount of material or energy being transferred in an ecosystem times the coherency with which the outputs from the members of the system relate to the set of inputs to the same components ([[Robert Ulanowicz|Ulanowicz]] 1986).  Coherence is gauged by the [[average mutual information]] shared between inputs and outputs (Rutledge et al. 1976).

Originally, it was thought that ecosystems increase uniformly in ascendency as they developed, but subsequent empirical observation has suggested that all sustainable ecosystems are confined to a narrow "window of vitality" (Ulanowicz 2002). Systems with relative values of ascendency plotting below the window tend to fall apart due to lack of significant internal constraints, whereas systems above the window tend to be so "brittle" that they become vulnerable to external perturbations.

Sensitivity analysis on the components of the ascendency reveals the controlling transfers within the system in the sense of [[Justus von Liebig|Liebig]] (Ulanowicz and Baird 1999). That is, ascendency can be used to identify which resource is limiting the functioning of each component of the ecosystem.

It is thought that autocatalytic feedback is the primary route by which systems increase and maintain their ascendencies (Ulanowicz 1997.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7729">In mathematical physics, a '''Berezin integral''', named after [[Felix Berezin]], (or '''Grassmann integral''', after [[Hermann Grassmann]]) is a way to define [[integral|integration]] of elements of the [[exterior algebra]] (Hermann Grassmann 1844). It is called integral because it is used in physics as a sum over histories for [[fermion]]s, an extension of the [[Functional integration|path integral]].

==Integration on an exterior algebra==

Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n&lt;/math&gt; be the exterior algebra of polynomials in anticommuting elements &lt;math&gt;\theta_{1},\dots,\theta_{n}&lt;/math&gt; over the field of complex numbers. (The ordering of the generators &lt;math&gt;\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and defines the orientation of the exterior algebra.) The '''Berezin integral''' on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the linear functional &lt;math&gt;\int_{\Lambda^{n} }\cdot\textrm{d}\theta&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Lambda^n}\theta_{n}\cdots\theta_{1}\,\mathrm{d}\theta=1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Lambda^n}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta_{i}}\,\mathrm{d}\theta=0,\ i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt;f\in\Lambda^n,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial\theta_{i}&lt;/math&gt; means the left or the right partial derivative. These properties define the integral uniquely. The formula

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Lambda^n}f\left( \theta\right) \, \mathrm{d}\theta=\int_{\Lambda^1}\left(  \cdots \int_{\Lambda^1}\left(  \int_{\Lambda^1}f\left(\theta\right) \, \mathrm{d}\theta_{1}\right) \, \mathrm{d}\theta_2 \cdots \right)\mathrm{d}\theta_n&lt;/math&gt;

expresses the Fubini law. On the right-hand side, the interior integral of a monomial &lt;math&gt;f=g\left(  \theta^{\prime}\right)  \theta_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is set to be &lt;math&gt;g\left(  \theta^{\prime}\right)  ,\ &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta^{\prime}=\left(\theta_{2},...,\theta_{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;; the integral of &lt;math&gt;f=g\left( \theta^{\prime}\right)  &lt;/math&gt; vanishes. The integral with respect to &lt;math&gt;\theta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated in the similar way and so on.

==Change of Grassmann variables==

Let &lt;math&gt;\theta_{i}=\theta_{i}\left(  \xi_{1},...,\xi_{n}\right)  ,\ i=1,...,n,&lt;/math&gt; be odd polynomials in some antisymmetric variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_{1},...,\xi_{n}&lt;/math&gt;. The Jacobian is the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;D=\left\{  \frac{\partial\theta_{i}}{\partial\xi_{j}},\ i,j=1,...,n\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where the left and the right derivatives coincide and are even polynomials. The formula for the coordinate change reads

:&lt;math&gt;\int f\left(  \theta\right)  \mathrm{d}\theta=\int f\left(  \theta\left( \xi\right)  \right)  \left(  \det D\right)  ^{-1}\mathrm{d}\xi.&lt;/math&gt;

==Berezin integral==

Consider now the algebra &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{m\mid n}&lt;/math&gt; of functions of real commuting variables &lt;math&gt;x=x_{1},...,x_{m}&lt;/math&gt; and of anticommuting variables &lt;math&gt;\theta_{1},...,\theta_{n}&lt;/math&gt; (which is called the free superalgebra of dimension &lt;math&gt;\left(  m\mid n\right)  &lt;/math&gt;). This means that an element &lt;math&gt;f=f\left(x,\theta\right)  \in\Lambda^{m\mid n}&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the argument &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that varies in an open set &lt;math&gt;X\subset\mathbb{R}^{m}&lt;/math&gt; with values in the algebra &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n}.&lt;/math&gt; Suppose that this function is continuous&lt;math&gt;\ &lt;/math&gt;and vanishes in the complement of a compact set &lt;math&gt;K\subset\mathbb{R}^{m}.&lt;/math&gt; The Berezin integral is the number

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Lambda^{m\mid n}}f\left(  x,\theta\right)  \mathrm{d}\theta \mathrm{d}x=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{m}}\mathrm{d}x\int_{\Lambda^{n}}f\left( x,\theta\right)  \mathrm{d}\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

==Change of even and odd variables==

Let a coordinate transformation be given by &lt;math&gt;x_{i}=x_{i}\left(  y,\xi\right) ,\ i=1,...,m;\ \theta_{j}=\theta_{j}\left(  y,\xi\right)  ,j=1,...,n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are even and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{j}&lt;/math&gt; are odd polynomials of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; depending on even variables &lt;math&gt;y.&lt;/math&gt; The Jacobian matrix of this transformation has the block form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{J}=\frac{\partial\left(  x,\theta\right)  }{\partial\left(y,\xi\right)  }=\left(\begin{array}[c]{cc}
A &amp; B\\ C &amp; D\end{array}\right)  ,&lt;/math&gt;

where each even derivative &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial y_{j}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with all elements of the algebra &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{m\mid n}&lt;/math&gt;; the odd derivatives commute with even elements and anticommute with odd elements. The entries of the diagonal blocks &lt;math&gt;A=\partial x/\partial y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D=\partial\theta/\partial\xi&lt;/math&gt; are even and the entries of the offdiagonal blocks &lt;math&gt;B=\partial x/\partial \xi,\ C=\partial\theta/\partial y&lt;/math&gt; are odd functions, where &lt;math&gt;\partial /\partial\xi_{j}&lt;/math&gt; mean right derivatives. The '''Berezinian''' (or the '''superdeterminant''') of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{J}&lt;/math&gt; is the even function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ber~J}=\det\left(  A-BD^{-1}C\right)  \det D^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

defined when the function &lt;math&gt;\det D&lt;/math&gt; is invertible in &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{m\mid n}.&lt;/math&gt; Suppose that the real functions &lt;math&gt;x_{i}=x_{i}\left(  y,0\right)  &lt;/math&gt; define a smooth invertible map &lt;math&gt;F:Y\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; of open sets &lt;math&gt;X,\ Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{m}&lt;/math&gt; and the linear part of the map &lt;math&gt;\xi\mapsto\theta=\theta\left(y,\xi\right)  &lt;/math&gt; is invertible for each &lt;math&gt;y\in Y.&lt;/math&gt; The general transformation law for the Berezin integral reads

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Lambda^{m\mid n}}f\left(  x,\theta\right)  \mathrm{d}\theta\mathrm{d}x=\int_{\Lambda^{m\mid n}}f\left(  x\left(  y,\xi\right)
,\theta\left(  y,\xi\right)  \right)  \varepsilon\mathrm{Ber~J~d}\xi\mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\int_{\Lambda^{m\mid n}}f\left(  x\left(  y,\xi\right)  ,\theta\left(y,\xi\right)  \right)  \varepsilon\frac{\det\left(  A-BD^{-1}C\right)  }{\det D}\mathrm{d}\xi\mathrm{d}y,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\mathrm{sgn~\det}\partial x\left(  y,0\right)  /\partial y&lt;/math&gt; is the sign of the orientation of the map &lt;math&gt;F.&lt;/math&gt; The superposition &lt;math&gt;f\left( x\left(  y,\xi\right)  ,\theta\left(  y,\xi\right)  \right)  &lt;/math&gt; is defined in the obvious way, if the functions &lt;math&gt;x_{i}\left(  y,\xi\right)  &lt;/math&gt; do not depend on &lt;math&gt;\xi.&lt;/math&gt; In the general case, we write &lt;math&gt;x_{i}\left(  y,\xi\right) =x_{i}\left(  y,0\right)  +\delta_{i},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{i},\ i=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt; are even nilpotent elements of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{m\mid n}&lt;/math&gt; and set

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(  x\left(  y,\xi\right)  ,\theta\right)  =f\left(  x\left(y,0\right)  ,\theta\right)  +\sum_i\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}\left(x\left(  y,0\right)  ,\theta\right)  \delta_{i}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}\left(  x\left(  y,0\right),\theta\right)  \delta_{i}\delta_{j}+...,&lt;/math&gt;

where the Taylor series is finite.

==History==

The mathematical theory of the integral with commuting and anticommuting variables was invented and developed by [[Felix Berezin]]. Some important earlier insights were made by [[David John Candlin]]. Other authors contributed to these developments, including the physicists Khalatnikov&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Khalatnikov (1954), "Predstavlenie funkzij Grina v kvantovoj elektrodinamike v forme kontinualjnyh integralov" (Russian). JETP, 28, 635.&lt;/ref&gt; (although his paper contains mistakes), Matthews and Salam&lt;ref&gt;P.T. Matthews, A. Salam (1955), "Propagators of quantized field". Nuovo Cimento 2, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Martin.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Martin (1959), "The Feynman principle for a Fermi System". Proc. Roy. Soc. A 251, 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernstein's theorem''' is an inequality relating the maximum modulus of a complex [[polynomial]] function on the unit disk with the maximum modulus of its [[derivative]] on the unit disk. It was proven by [[Sergei Bernstein]] while he was working on [[approximation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Boas, Jr., Inequalities for the derivatives of polynomials, Math. Mag. 42 (1969), 165–174. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\max_{|z| = 1} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; denote the maximum modulus of an arbitrary
function &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;|z|=1&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;f'(z)&lt;/math&gt; denote its derivative.
Then for every polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(z)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we have

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{|z| = 1} |P'(z)| \le n \max_{|z| = 1} |P(z)|&lt;/math&gt;.

The inequality is best possible with equality holding if and only if

: &lt;math&gt; P(z) =  \alpha z^n,\ |\alpha| = \max_{|z| = 1} |P(z)|&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Malik, M. C. Vong, Inequalities concerning the derivative of polynomials, Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo (2) 34 (1985), 422–426.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proof ===
Let &lt;math&gt;P(z)&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;Q(z)&lt;/math&gt; be another polynomial of the same degree with no zeros in &lt;math&gt;|z| \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. We show first that if &lt;math&gt;|P(z)| &lt; |Q(z)|&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;|z| = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;|P'(z)| &lt; |Q'(z)|&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;|z| \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. 

By [[Rouché's theorem]], &lt;math&gt;P(z) + \varepsilon\ Q(z)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\varepsilon| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; has all
its zeros in &lt;math&gt;|z| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. By virtue of the [[Gauss–Lucas theorem]],
&lt;math&gt;P'(z) + \varepsilon\ Q'(z)&lt;/math&gt; has all its zeros in &lt;math&gt;|z| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; as well.
It follows that &lt;math&gt;|P'(z)| &lt; |Q'(z)|&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;|z| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;,
otherwise we could choose an &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\varepsilon| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;P'(z) + \varepsilon Q'(z)&lt;/math&gt; has a zero in &lt;math&gt;|z|\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

For an arbitrary polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(z)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain Bernstein's Theorem by applying the above result to the polynomials &lt;math&gt;Q(z) =  C z^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary constant exceeding &lt;math&gt;\max_{|z|=1}|P(z)|&lt;/math&gt;.

== Similar results ==
[[Paul Erdős]] conjectured that if &lt;math&gt;P(z)&lt;/math&gt; has no zeros in &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\max_{|z| = 1} |P'(z)| \le \frac{n}{2} \max_{|z| = 1} |P(z)|&lt;/math&gt;. This was proved by [[Peter Lax]].&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Lax, Proof of a conjecture of P. Erdös on the derivative of a polynomial, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 50 (1944), 509–513.&lt;/ref&gt;

M. A. Malik showed that if &lt;math&gt;P(z)&lt;/math&gt; has no zeros in &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;k&lt;/math&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;k \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\max_{|z| = 1} |P'(z)| \le \frac{n}{1+k} \max_{|z| = 1}|P(z)|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Malik, On the derivative of a polynomial J. London Math. Soc (2) 1 (1969), 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2615">In [[mathematics]], the '''Besov space''' (named after [[Oleg Vladimirovich Besov]]&lt;!--Оле́г Влади́мирович Бесов--&gt;) &lt;math&gt;B^s_{p,q}(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Complete metric space|complete]] [[quasinorm]]ed space which is a [[Banach space]] when {{math|1 ≤ ''p'', ''q'' ≤ ∞}}.  These spaces, as well as the similarly defined [[Triebel–Lizorkin space]]s, serve to generalize more elementary [[function space]]s such as [[Sobolev space]]s and are effective at measuring regularity properties of functions.

==Definition==

Several equivalent definitions exist. One of them is given below.

Let

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_h f(x) = f(x-h) - f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and define the [[modulus of continuity]] by

:&lt;math&gt; \omega^2_p(f,t) = \sup_{|h| \le t} \left \| \Delta^2_h f \right \|_p&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{mvar|n}} be a non-negative integer and define: {{math|''s'' {{=}} ''n'' + ''α''}} with {{math|0 &lt; ''α'' ≤ 1}}. The Besov space &lt;math&gt;B^s_{p,q}(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; contains all functions {{mvar|f}} such that
 
:&lt;math&gt; f \in W^{n, p}(\mathbf{R}), \qquad \int_0^\infty \left|\frac{ \omega^2_p \left ( f^{(n)},t \right ) } {t^{\alpha} }\right|^q \frac{dt}{t} &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

==Norm==
The Besov space &lt;math&gt;B^s_{p,q}(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; is equipped with the norm

:&lt;math&gt; \left \|f \right \|_{B^s_{p,q}(\mathbf{R})} = \left( \|f\|_{W^{n, p} (\mathbf{R})}^q + \int_0^\infty \left|\frac{ \omega^2_p \left ( f^{(n)}, t \right ) } {t^{\alpha} }\right|^q \frac{dt}{t} \right)^{\frac{1}{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

The Besov spaces &lt;math&gt;B^s_{2,2}(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; coincide with the more classical [[Sobolev spaces]] &lt;math&gt;H^s(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt; p=q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; is not an integer, then  &lt;math&gt;B^s_{p,p}(\mathbf{R}) =\bar W^{s,p}( \mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \bar W^{s,p}( \mathbf{R}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Sobolev space|Sobolev–Slobodeckij space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1379">In algebra, a '''central polynomial''' for ''n''-by-''n'' matrices is a [[polynomial]] in non-commuting variables that is non-constant but yields a scalar matrix whenever it is evaluated at ''n''-by-''n'' matrices. That such polynomials exist for any square matrices was discovered in 1970 independently by [[Edward W. Formanek|Formanek]] and Razmyslov. The term "central" is because the evaluation of a central polynomial has the image lying in the center of the matrix ring over any commutative ring. The notion has an application to the theory of [[polynomial identity ring]]s.

Example: &lt;math&gt;(xy - yx)^2&lt;/math&gt; is a central polynomial for 2-by-2-matrices. Indeed, by the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], one has that &lt;math&gt;(xy - yx)^2 = -\det(xy - yx)I&lt;/math&gt; for any 2-by-2-matrices ''x'', ''y''.

''Not to be confused with [[computer engineering]].''

'''Computational science and engineering''' (CSE) is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations, often coupled with [[high-performance computing]], to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design (computational engineering) as well as natural phenomena ([[computational science]]). CSE has been described as the "third mode of discovery" (next to theory and experimentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cseprograms.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/CSEHandbook-Students-v11.pdf |title=Computational Science and Engineering Program: Graduate Student Handbook | website=cseprograms.gatech.edu |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, computer simulation is integral and therefore essential to business and research. Computer simulation provides the capability to enter fields that are either inaccessible to traditional experimentation or where carrying out traditional empirical inquiries is prohibitively expensive. CSE should neither be confused with pure [[computer science]], nor with [[computer engineering]], although a wide domain in the former is used in CSE (e.g., certain algorithms, data structures, parallel programming, high performance computing) and some problems in the latter can be modeled and solved with CSE methods (as an application area).

It is typically offered as a [[Master of Science|masters]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] program at several institutions.

==Methods==
Computational Science and Engineering methods and frameworks include:
* [[High performance computing]] and techniques to gain efficiency (through change in computer architecture, parallel algorithms etc.)
* [[Computer model|Modeling]] and [[simulation]]
* [[Algorithms]] for solving discrete and continuous problems
* Analysis and visualization of data
* Mathematical foundations: Numerical and applied linear algebra, initial &amp; boundary value problems, Fourier analysis, optimization
* [[Data_science|Data Science]] for developing methods and algorithms to handle and  extract  knowledge from large scientific data
With regard to computing, computer programming, algorithms, and parallel computing play a major role in CSE. The most widely used programming language in the scientific community is [[FORTRAN]]. Recently, [[C++]] and C have increased in popularity over FORTRAN. Due to the wealth of legacy code in FORTRAN and its simpler syntax, the scientific computing community has been slow in completely adopting C++ as the lingua franca. Because of its very natural way of expressing mathematical computations, and its built-in visualization capacities, the proprietary language/environment [[MATLAB]] is also widely used, especially for rapid application development and model verification. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] along with external libraries (such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]], [[Matplotlib]]) has gain some popularity as a free and [[Copycenter]] alternative to MATLAB.
==Applications==

[[File:CritPair svg.svg|thumb|400px|Triangle diagram of a critical pair obtained from two rewrite rules ''s''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''t'' (upper row, left) and ''l''→''r'' (right). The [[substitution (logic)#First-order logic|substitution]] σ [[unification (computer science)#Syntactic unification of first-order terms|unifies]] the [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|subterm]] ''s''[[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|&lt;!---using ascii code for vertical bar, to prevent Yobot from deleting it---&gt;&amp;#124;]]&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''l''. The resulting overlay term ''s''σ[[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|[]]''lσ'']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (lower row, middle) can be rewritten to the term ''tσ'' and ''s''σ[[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|[]]''rσ''']&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; (lower row, left and right), respectively. The latter two terms form the critical pair. They can be eventually rewritten to a common term, if the rewrite rule set is [[confluence (term rewriting)|confluent]].]]

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''critical pair''' arises in [[term rewriting system]]s where rewrite rules overlap to yield two different terms. In more detail, (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a critical pair if there is a term ''t'' for which two different applications of a rewrite rule (either the same rule applied differently, or two different rules) yield the terms ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, in the term rewriting system with rules
:{|
|-
| ''f''(''g''(''x'',''y''),''z'') || → ''g''(''x'',''z'')
|-
| ''g''(''x'',''y'') || → ''x'',
|}
the only critical pair is ⟨''g''(''x'',''z''), ''f''(''x'',''z'')⟩. Both of these terms can be derived from the term ''f''(''g''(''x'',''y''),''z'') by applying a single rewrite rule.

As another example, consider the term rewriting system with the single rule
:{|
|-
| ''f''(''x'',''y'') || → ''x''.
|-
|}
By applying this rule in two different ways to the term ''f''(''f''(''x'',''x''),''x''), we see that (''f''(''x'',''x''), ''f''(''x'',''x'')) is a (trivial) critical pair.

When both sides of the critical pair can [[reduction (mathematics)|reduce]] to the same term, the critical pair is called ''convergent''. Where one side of the critical pair is identical to the other, the critical pair is called ''trivial''.

If the term rewriting system is not [[confluence (term rewriting)|confluent]], the critical pair may not converge, so critical pairs are potential sources where confluence will fail. In fact, the [[critical pair lemma]] states that a term rewriting system is [[Confluence (term rewriting)#Local confluence|weakly (a.k.a. locally) confluent]] if all critical pairs are convergent. Thus, to find out if a term rewriting system is weakly confluent, it suffices to test all critical pairs and see if they are convergent. This makes it possible to find out algorithmically if a term rewriting system is weakly confluent or not, given that one can algorithmically check if two terms converge.

Weak confluence clearly implies convergent critical pairs: if any critical pair ⟨''a'', ''b''⟩ arises, then ''a'' and ''b'' have common [[reduct]] and thus the critical pair is convergent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3013">In mathematics, a '''cyclotomic unit''' (or '''circular unit''') is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] of an [[algebraic number field]] which is the product of numbers of the form (ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''a''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) for ζ{{su|b=''n''}} an ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[root of unity]] and 0 &lt; ''a'' &lt; ''n''. Note that if ''n'' is the power of a prime ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''a''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 itself is not a unit; however the numbers (ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''a''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/(ζ{{su|b=''n''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) for (''a'', ''n'') = 1, and ±ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''a''}} generate the group of cyclotomic units in this case (''n'' power of a prime). 

The cyclotomic units form a subgroup of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]] in the [[Dirichlet's unit theorem|group of units]] of a [[cyclotomic field]].  The index of this subgroup of ''real'' cyclotomic units (those cyclotomic units in the maximal real subfield) within the full real unit group  is equal to the [[Class number (number theory)|class number]] of the maximal real subfield of the [[cyclotomic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington, Theorem 8.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Note also that if ''n'' is a [[composite number]], the subgroup of cyclotomic units generated by (ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''a''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/(ζ{{su|b=''n''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)with (''a'', ''n'') = 1 is not of finite index in general.&lt;ref&gt;Washington, 8.8, page 150, for ''n'' equal to 55.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cyclotomic units satisfy ''distribution relations''.  Let ''a'' be a rational number prime to ''p'' and let ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; denote exp(2πi''a'')−1.  Then for ''a''≠ 0 we have &lt;math&gt; \prod_{p b=a} g_b = g_a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1990) p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

Using these distribution relations and the symmetry relation ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''a''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 = -ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''a''}} (ζ{{su|b=''n''|p=''-a''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) a basis ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of the cyclotomic units can be constructed with the property that 
''B''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''d'' | ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;http://perisic.com/cyclotomic&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2373">In [[mathematics]], specifically the area of [[Diophantine approximation]], the '''Davenport–Schmidt theorem''' tells us how well a certain kind of [[real number]] can be approximated by another kind.  Specifically it tells us that we can get a good approximation to irrational numbers that are not quadratic by using either [[quadratic irrational]]s or simply [[rational number]]s.  It is named after [[Harold Davenport]] and [[Wolfgang M. Schmidt]].

==Statement==
Given a number α which is either rational or a quadratic irrational, we can find unique integers ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' such that ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are not all zero, the first non-zero one among them is positive, they are relatively prime, and we have

:&lt;math&gt;x\alpha^2 +y\alpha +z=0.&lt;/math&gt;

If α is a quadratic irrational we can take ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' to be the coefficients of its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]].  If α is rational we will have ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  With these integers uniquely determined for each such α we can define the ''height'' of α to be

:&lt;math&gt;H(\alpha)=\max\{|x|,|y|,|z|\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem then says that for any real number ξ which is neither rational nor a quadratic irrational, we can find infinitely many real numbers α which ''are'' rational or quadratic irrationals and which satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;|\xi-\alpha|&lt;CH(\alpha)^{-3}\max(1,\xi^2),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is any real number satisfying ''C''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;160/9.&lt;ref&gt;H. Davenport, Wolfgang M. Schmidt, "''Approximation to real numbers by quadratic irrationals''," Acta Arithmetica '''13''', (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the theorem is related to [[Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem|Roth's theorem]], its real use lies in the fact that it is [[Effective results in number theory|effective]], in the sense that the constant ''C'' can be worked out for any given ξ.

'''Dex-net''' is a robotic manipulator. It uses a Grasp Quality [[Convolutional neural network|Convolutional Neural Network]] to learn how to grasp unusually shaped objects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610587/robots-get-closer-to-human-like-dexterity|title=Exclusive: This is the most dexterous robot ever created|last=Knight|first=Will|date=|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Mahler|first=Jeffrey|last2=Liang|first2=Jacky|last3=Niyaz|first3=Sherdil|last4=Laskey|first4=Michael|last5=Doan|first5=Richard|last6=Liu|first6=Xinyu|last7=Ojea|first7=Juan Aparicio|last8=Goldberg|first8=Ken|date=2017-03-27|title=Dex-Net 2.0: Deep Learning to Plan Robust Grasps with Synthetic Point Clouds and Analytic Grasp Metrics|eprint=1703.09312|class=cs.RO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Dex-net was developed by [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor Ken Goldberg and graduate student Jeff Mahler.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Design ==
Dex-net includes a high-resolution 3-D sensor and two arms, each controlled by a different [[Artificial neural network|neural network]]. One arm is equipped with a conventional robot gripper and another with a suction system. The robot’s software scans an object and then asks both neural networks to decide, on the fly, whether to grab or suck a particular object.  It runs on an off-the-shelf industrial machine made by Swiss robotics company [[ABB Group|ABB]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The software learns by attempting to pick up objects in a virtual environment. Dex-Net can generalize from an object it has seen before to a new one. The robot can "nudge" such virtual objects to examine it if it is unsure how to grasp it. The trial data set was  6.7 million point clouds, grasps and analytic grasp metrics generated from thousands of 3D models. Grasps are defined as a gripper's planar position, angle and depth relative to an RGB-D sensor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Mean picks per hour ==
A metric called ''mean picks per hour'' (MPPH) is calculated by multiplying the average time per pick and the average probability of success for a specific set of objects. The new metric allows labs working on picking robots to compare their results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Humans are capable of between 400 and 600 MPPH. In a contest organized by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] recently, the best robots were capable of between 70 and 95. Dex-net has achieved 200 to 300.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61241">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[differential geometry]] and [[tensor calculus]], '''differential forms''' are an approach to [[multivariable calculus]] that is independent of [[coordinate]]s.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define [[integrand]]s over curves, surfaces, volumes, and higher-dimensional [[manifold]]s.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by [[Élie Cartan]].  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.

For instance, the expression {{math|''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} from one-variable calculus is an example of a {{math|1}}-form, and can be [[integral|integrated]] over an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the expression {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' + ''g''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dz'' + ''h''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} is a {{math|2}}-form that has a [[surface integral]] over an [[oriented]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] {{math|''S''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S f(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dy + g(x,y,z)\,dx\wedge dz + h(x,y,z)\,dy\wedge dz.&lt;/math&gt;
The symbol {{math|∧}} denotes the [[exterior product]], sometimes called the ''wedge product'', of two differential forms. Likewise, a {{math|3}}-form {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' ∧ ''dz''}} represents a [[volume element]] that can be integrated over a region of space. In general, a {{mvar|k}}-form is an object that may be integrated over {{mvar|k}}-dimensional sets, and is homogeneous of degree {{mvar|k}} in the coordinate differentials.

The [[exterior algebra|algebra]] of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the domain of integration.  There is an operation {{math|''d''}} on differential forms known as the [[exterior derivative]] that, when acting on a {{math|''k''}}-form, produces a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form.  This operation extends the [[differential of a function]], and is directly related to the [[divergence]] and the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field in a manner that makes the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], the [[divergence theorem]], [[Green's theorem]], and [[Stokes' Theorem#Kelvin–Stokes theorem|Stokes' theorem]] special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized [[Stokes' theorem]].  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the [[topology]] of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as [[de Rham's theorem]].

The general setting for the study of differential forms is on a [[differentiable manifold]].  Differential {{math|1}}-forms are naturally dual to [[vector field]]s on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and {{math|1}}-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the [[interior product]].  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the [[change of variables formula]] for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.

==History==
Differential forms are part of the field of differential geometry, influenced by linear algebra.  Although the notion of a differential is quite old, the initial attempt at an algebraic organization of differential forms is usually credited to [[Élie Cartan]] with reference to his 1899 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Sur certaines expressions différentielles et le problème de Pfaff | first=Élie  |last=Cartan |journal=Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure |url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1899_3_16__239_0|year=1899 |pages=239–332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspects of the exterior algebra of differential forms appears in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s 1844 work, ''Die Lineale&lt;!--sic--&gt; Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik''&lt;ref&gt;''Tr''. The rulers extension theory, a new branch of mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; [The Theory of Linear Extension, a New Branch of Mathematics]

==Concept==

Differential forms provide an approach to [[multivariable calculus]] that is independent of [[coordinate]]s.

===Integration===
A differential {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] of dimension {{math|''k''}}.  A differential one-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal (oriented) length, or one-dimensional density.  A differential two-form can be thought of as measuring an infinitesimal (oriented) area, or two-dimensional density.  And so on.

Integration of differential forms is well-defined only on [[Orientability|oriented]] [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]].  An example of a one dimensional manifold is an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and intervals can be given an orientation: they are positively oriented if {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}, and negatively oriented otherwise.  If {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}} then the integral of the differential one-form {{math|''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} (with its natural positive orientation) is
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
which is the negative of the integral of the same differential form over the same interval, when equipped with the opposite orientation.  That is:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_b^a f(x)\,dx = -\int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
This gives a geometrical context to the [[Integral#Conventions|conventions]] for one-dimensional integrals, that the sign changes when the orientation of the interval is reversed.  A standard explanation of this in one-variable integration theory is that, when the limits of integration are in the opposite order ({{math|''b'' &lt; ''a''}}), the increment {{math|''dx''}} is negative.  The integrals are negatives of one another because the oriented lengths "''dx''" have opposite directions.

More generally, an {{math|''m''}}-form is an oriented density that can be integrated over an {{math|''m''}}-dimensional oriented manifold.  (For example, a {{math|1}}-form can be integrated over an oriented curve, a {{math|2}}-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, etc.)  If {{math|''M''}} is an oriented {{math|''m''}}-dimensional manifold, and {{math|''M''′}} is the same manifold with opposed orientation and {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|''m''}}-form, then one has:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \omega = - \int_{M'} \omega \,.&lt;/math&gt;
These conventions correspond to interpreting the integrand as a differential form, integrated over a [[Chain (algebraic topology)|chain]]. In [[measure theory]], by contrast, one interprets the integrand as a function {{mvar|f}} with respect to a measure {{mvar|μ}} and integrates over a subset {{mvar|A}}, without any notion of orientation; one writes &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_A f\,d\mu = \int_{[a,b]} f\,d\mu}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate integration over a subset {{mvar|A}}. This is a minor distinction in one dimension, but becomes subtler on higher-dimensional manifolds; see [[#Relation with measures|below]] for details.

Making the notion of an oriented density precise, and thus of a differential form, involves the [[exterior algebra]].  The basic {{math|1}}-forms are the differentials of the coordinates: {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}.  Each of these represents a [[covector]] that measures a small displacement in the corresponding coordinate direction.  A general {{math|1}}-form is a linear combination of these differentials
:&lt;math&gt;f_1dx^1+\cdots+f_ndx^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the coordinates.  A differential {{math|1}}-form is integrated along an oriented curve as a line integral.

The basic two-forms are expressions {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''i''}} ∧ ''dx''{{i sup|''j''}}}}, where {{math|''i'' &lt; ''j''}}.  This represents an infinitesimal oriented square parallel to the {{math|''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}}–{{math|''x''{{i sup|''j''}}}}-plane.  A general two-form is a linear combination of these, and it is integrated just like a surface integral.

A fundamental operation defined on differential forms is the [[exterior product]] (the symbol is the [[Wedge (symbol)|wedge]] {{math|∧}}).  This is similar to the [[cross product]] from vector calculus, in that it is an alternating product.  For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;dx^1\wedge dx^2=-dx^2\wedge dx^1&lt;/math&gt;
because the square whose first side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and second side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is to be regarded as having the opposite orientation as the square whose first side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and whose second side is {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The exterior product allows higher dimensional differential forms to be built out of lower-dimensional ones, in much the same way that the cross product in vector calculus allows one to compute the area vector of a parallelogram from vectors pointing up the two sides.

In addition to the exterior product, there is also the [[exterior derivative]] operator {{math|''d''}}.  Like the [[differential of a function]], the exterior derivative gives a way of quantifying a differential form's sensitivity to change.  In {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''f'' ''dx''{{i sup|''a''}}}} is a {{math|''k''}}-form, then {{math|''dω''}} is a {{math|''k'' + 1}}-form defined by

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^a.&lt;/math&gt;

with extension to general {{math|''k''}}-forms occurring linearly.

This more general approach allows for a more natural coordinate-free approach to integration on [[manifold]]s. It also allows for a natural generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (see {{section link||Stokes' theorem}}).

===Differential calculus===
Let {{math|''U''}} be an [[open set]] in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A differential {{math|0}}-form ("zero-form") is defined to be a [[smooth function]] {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}}. If {{math|''v''}} is any vector in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a [[directional derivative]] {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''}}, which is another function on {{math|''U''}} whose value at a point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}} is the rate of change (at {{math|''p''}}) of {{math|''f''}} in the {{math|''v''}} direction:

:&lt;math&gt; (\partial_v f)(p) = \left. \frac{d}{dt} f(p+tv)\right|_{t=0} .&lt;/math&gt;

(This notion can be extended to the case that {{math|''v''}} is a [[vector field]] on {{math|''U''}} by evaluating {{math|''v''}} at the point {{math|''p''}} in the definition.)

In particular, if {{math|1=''v'' = ''e''{{sub|''j''}}}} is the {{math|''j''}}th [[coordinate vector]] then {{math|∂{{sub|''v''}} ''f''}} is the [[partial derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} with respect to the {{math|''j''}}th coordinate function, i.e., {{math|∂''f'' / ∂''x''{{i sup|''j''}}}}, where {{math|''x''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''x''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''x''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are the coordinate functions on {{math|''U''}}. By their very definition, partial derivatives depend upon the choice of coordinates: if new coordinates {{math|''y''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''y''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''y''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are introduced, then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y^i} .&lt;/math&gt;

The first idea leading to differential forms is the observation that {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' (''p'')}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''v''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (\partial_{v + w} f)(p) &amp;= (\partial_v f)(p) + (\partial_w f)(p) \\
    (\partial_{c v} f)(p) &amp;= c (\partial_v f)(p)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for any vectors {{math|''v''}}, {{math|''w''}} and any real number {{math|''c''}}. This [[linear map]] from {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|'''R'''}} is denoted {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and called the [[derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''p''}}. Thus {{math|1=''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'') = ∂&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' (''p'')}}. The object {{math|''df''}} can be viewed as a function on {{math|''U''}}, whose value at {{math|''p''}} is not a real number, but the linear map {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This is just the usual [[Fréchet derivative]] – an example of a differential [[1-form|{{math|1}}-form]].

Since any vector {{math|''v''}} is a [[linear combination]] {{math|∑ ''v''{{i sup|''j''}}''e''{{sub|''j''}}}} of its [[Euclidean vector#Vector components|components]], {{math|''df''}} is uniquely determined by {{math|''df''{{sub|''p''}}(''e''{{sub|''j''}})}} for each {{math|''j''}} and each {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}, which are just the partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}}. Thus {{math|''df''}} provides a way of encoding the partial derivatives of {{math|''f''}}. It can be decoded by noticing that the coordinates {{math|''x''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''x''{{sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''x''{{i sup|''n''}}}} are themselves functions on {{math|''U''}}, and so define differential {{math|1}}-forms {{math|''dx''{{i sup|1}}}}, {{math|''dx''{{i sup|2}}}}, ..., {{math|''dx''{{i sup|''n''}}}}. Let {{math|1=''f'' = ''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}}. Since {{math|1=∂''x''{{i sup|''i''}} / ∂''x''{{i sup|''j''}} = ''δ''{{i sup|''j''}}{{sub|''i''}}}}, the [[Kronecker delta function]], it follows that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;df = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|*|&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}}}

The meaning of this expression is given by evaluating both sides at an arbitrary point {{math|''p''}}: on the right hand side, the sum is defined "[[pointwise]]", so that
:&lt;math&gt;df_p = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(p) (dx^i)_p .&lt;/math&gt;
Applying both sides to {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the result on each side is the {{math|''j''}}th partial derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''p''}}. Since {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''j''}} were arbitrary, this proves the formula {{EquationNote|*|(*)}}.

More generally, for any smooth functions {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''U''}}, we define the differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|1=''α'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dh''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} pointwise by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_p = \sum_i g_i(p) (dh_i)_p&lt;/math&gt;

for each {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}. Any differential {{math|1}}-form arises this way, and by using {{EquationNote|*|(*)}} it follows that any differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} on {{math|''U''}} may be expressed in coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i\, dx^i&lt;/math&gt;

for some smooth functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''U''}}.

The second idea leading to differential forms arises from the following question: given a differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} on {{math|''U''}}, when does there exist a function {{math|''f''}} on {{math|''U''}} such that {{math|1=''α'' = ''df''}}? The above expansion reduces this question to the search for a function {{math|''f''}} whose partial derivatives {{math|∂''f'' / ∂''x''{{i sup|''i''}}}} are equal to {{math|''n''}} given functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, such a function does not always exist: any smooth function {{math|''f''}} satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \, \partial x^j} =  \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^j \, \partial x^i} ,&lt;/math&gt;

so it will be impossible to find such an {{math|''f''}} unless

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x^j} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}.

The [[skew symmetry|skew-symmetry]] of the left hand side in {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} suggests introducing an antisymmetric product {{math|∧}} on differential {{math|1}}-forms, the [[exterior product]], so that these equations can be combined into a single condition

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^j = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∧}} is defined so that:

: &lt;math&gt; dx^i \wedge dx^j = - dx^j \wedge dx^i. &lt;/math&gt;

This is an example of a differential {{math|2}}-form.  This {{math|2}}-form is called the [[exterior derivative]] {{math|''dα''}} of {{math|1=''α'' = ∑{{su|b=''j''=1|p=''n''}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dx''{{i sup|''j''}}}}.  It is given by

:&lt;math&gt; d\alpha = \sum_{j=1}^n df_j \wedge dx^j = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_j}{\partial x^i} \, dx^i \wedge dx^j .&lt;/math&gt;

To summarize: {{math|1=''dα'' = 0}} is a necessary condition for the existence of a function {{math|''f''}} with {{math|1=''α'' = ''df''}}.

Differential {{math|0}}-forms, {{math|1}}-forms, and {{math|2}}-forms are special cases of differential forms. For each {{math|''k''}}, there is a space of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms, which can be expressed in terms of the coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i_1,i_2\ldots i_k=1}^n f_{i_1i_2\ldots i_k} dx^{i_1} \wedge dx^{i_2} \wedge\cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

for a collection of functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Antisymmetry, which was already present for {{math|2}}-forms, makes it possible to restrict the sum to those sets of indices for which {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Differential forms can be multiplied together using the exterior product, and for any differential {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''α''}}, there is a differential {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-form {{math|''dα''}} called the exterior derivative of {{math|''α''}}.

Differential forms, the exterior product and the exterior derivative are independent of a choice of coordinates. Consequently, they may be defined on any [[smooth manifold]] {{math|''M''}}. One way to do this is cover {{math|''M''}} with [[coordinate chart]]s and define a differential {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} to be a family of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms on each chart which agree on the overlaps. However, there are more intrinsic definitions which make the independence of coordinates manifest.

==Intrinsic definitions==
{{see also|Exterior algebra}}

Let {{math|''M''}} be a [[smooth manifold]]. A smooth differential form of degree {{math|''k''}} is a [[section (fiber bundle)|smooth section]] of the {{math|''k''}}th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] of the [[cotangent bundle]] of {{math|''M''}}.  The set of all differential {{math|''k''}}-forms on a manifold {{math|''M''}} is a [[vector space]], often denoted {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}.

The definition of a differential form may be restated as follows.  At any point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}}, a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''β''}} defines an element
:&lt;math&gt; \beta_p \in \bigwedge^k T_p^* M,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} is the [[tangent space]] to {{math|''M''}} at {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M''}} is its [[dual space]].  This space is naturally isomorphic to the fiber at {{math|''p''}} of the dual bundle of the {{math|''k''}}th exterior power of the [[tangent bundle]] of {{math|''M''}}.  That is, {{math|''β''}} is also a linear functional

: &lt;math&gt;\beta_p \colon \bigwedge^k T_pM \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the universal property of exterior powers, this is equivalently an [[alternating form|alternating]] [[multilinear map]]
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_p\colon \bigoplus_{n=1}^k T_p M \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, a differential {{math|''k''}}-form may be evaluated against any {{math|''k''}}-tuple of tangent vectors to the same point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''M''}}.  For example, a differential {{math|1}}-form {{math|''α''}} assigns to each point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} a [[linear functional]] {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}. In the presence of an [[inner product]] on {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} (induced by a [[Riemannian metric]] on {{math|''M''}}), {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be [[Riesz representation theorem|represented]] as the inner product with a [[tangent vector]] {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Differential {{math|1}}-forms are sometimes called [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant vector fields]], covector fields, or "dual vector fields", particularly within physics.

The exterior algebra may be embedded in the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map.  The alternation map is defined as a mapping  
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt} \colon \bigotimes^k T^*M \to \bigotimes^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
For a tensor at a point {{math|''p''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt}(\omega_p)(x_1, \dots, x_k) = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma \in S_k} \sgn(\sigma) \omega_p(x_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(k)}),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[symmetric group]] on {{math|''k''}} elements.  The alternation map is constant on the cosets of the ideal in the tensor algebra generated by the symmetric 2-forms, and therefore descends to an embedding
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt} \colon \bigwedge^k T^*M \to \bigotimes^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;

This map exhibits {{math|''β''}} as a [[antisymmetric tensor|totally antisymmetric]] [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] [[tensor field]] of rank {{math|''k''}}. The differential forms on {{math|''M''}} are in one-to-one correspondence with such tensor fields.

==Operations==

As well as the addition and multiplication by scalar operations which arise from the vector space structure, there are several other standard operations defined on differential forms. The most important operations are the [[exterior product]] of two differential forms, the [[exterior derivative]] of a single differential form, the [[interior product]] of a differential form and a vector field, the [[Lie derivative]] of a differential form with respect to a vector field and the [[covariant derivative]] of a differential form with respect to a vector field on a manifold with a defined connection.

=== Exterior product ===
The exterior product of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''α''}} and an {{math|''l''}}-form {{math|''β''}} is a ({{math|''k'' + ''l''}})-form denoted {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}}. At each point {{math|''p''}} of the manifold {{math|''M''}}, the forms {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} are elements of an exterior power of the tangent space at {{math|''p''}}. When the exterior algebra is viewed as a quotient of the tensor algebra, the exterior product corresponds to the tensor product (modulo the equivalence relation defining the exterior algebra).

The antisymmetry inherent in the exterior algebra means that when {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}} is viewed as a multilinear functional, it is alternating. However, when the exterior algebra embedded a subspace of the tensor algebra by means of the alternation map, the tensor product {{math|''α'' ⊗ ''β''}} is not alternating. There is an explicit formula which describes the exterior product in this situation.  The exterior product is
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge \beta = \frac{(k + \ell)!}{k!\ell!}\operatorname{Alt}(\alpha \otimes \beta).&lt;/math&gt;
This description is useful for explicit computations. For example, if {{math|1=''k'' = ''l'' = 1}}, then {{math|''α'' ∧ ''β''}} is the {{math|2}}-form whose value at a point {{math|''p''}} is the [[alternating bilinear form]] defined by
:&lt;math&gt; (\alpha\wedge\beta)_p(v,w)=\alpha_p(v)\beta_p(w) - \alpha_p(w)\beta_p(v)&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|''v'', ''w'' ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}.

The exterior product is bilinear: If {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''β''}}, and {{math|''γ''}} are any differential forms, and if {{math|''f''}} is any smooth function, then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (\beta + \gamma) = \alpha \wedge \beta + \alpha \wedge \gamma,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge (f \cdot \beta) = f \cdot (\alpha \wedge \beta).&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''skew commutative'' (also known as ''graded commutative''), meaning that it satisfies a variant of [[anticommutativity]] that depends on the degrees of the forms: if {{math|''α''}} is a {{math|''k''}}-form and {{math|''β''}} is an {{math|''l''}}-form, then

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \wedge \beta = (-1)^{kl} \beta \wedge \alpha .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Riemannian manifold ===
On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], the metric defines a fibre-wise isomorphism of the tangent and cotangent spaces.  This makes it possible to convert vector fields to covector fields and vice versa.  It also enables the definition of additional operations such as the [[Hodge star operator]] &lt;math&gt;\star \colon \Omega^k(M)\ \stackrel{\sim}{\to}\ \Omega^{n-k}(M)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Hodge star#Codifferential|codifferential]] &lt;math&gt;\delta\colon \Omega^k(M)\rightarrow \Omega^{k-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;, which has degree {{math|−1}} and is adjoint to the exterior differential {{math|''d''}}.

==== Vector field structures ====
On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, {{math|1}}-forms can be identified with vector fields; vector fields have additional distinct algebraic structures, which are listed here for context and to avoid confusion.

Firstly, each (co)tangent space generates a [[Clifford algebra]], where the product of a (co)vector with itself is given by the value of a quadratic form – in this case, the natural one induced by the [[metric tensor|metric]]. This algebra is ''distinct'' from the [[exterior algebra]] of differential forms, which can be viewed as a Clifford algebra where the quadratic form vanishes (since the exterior product of any vector with itself is zero). Clifford algebras are thus non-anti-commutative ("quantum") deformations of the exterior algebra. They are studied in [[geometric algebra]].

Another alternative is to consider vector fields as derivations. The (noncommutative) algebra of [[differential operator]]s they generate is the [[Weyl algebra]] and is a noncommutative ("quantum") deformation of the ''symmetric'' algebra in the vector fields.

===Exterior differential complex===
One important property of the exterior derivative is that {{math|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}. This means that the exterior derivative defines a [[cochain complex]]:

:&lt;math&gt;0\ \to\ \Omega^0(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^1(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^2(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^3(M)\ \to\ \cdots \ \to\ \Omega^n(M)\ \to \ 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This complex is called the de Rham complex, and its [[cohomology]] is by definition the [[de Rham cohomology]] of {{math|''M''}}.  By the [[Poincaré lemma]], the de Rham complex is locally [[exact sequence|exact]] except at {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}.  The kernel at {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} is the space of [[locally constant function]]s on {{math|''M''}}.  Therefore, the complex is a resolution of the constant [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbf{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, which in turn implies a form of de Rham's theorem: de Rham cohomology computes the [[sheaf cohomology]] of &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathbf{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Pullback==
{{see also|Pullback (differential geometry)}}

Suppose that {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is smooth.  The differential of {{math|''f''}} is a smooth map {{math|''df'' : ''TM'' → ''TN''}} between the tangent bundles of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}.  This map is also denoted {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} and called the '''pushforward'''.  For any point {{math|''p'' &amp;isin; ''M''}} and any {{math|''v'' &amp;isin; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}, there is a well-defined pushforward vector {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'')}} in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''f''(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt;''N''}}.  However, the same is not true of a vector field.  If {{math|''f''}} is not injective, say because {{math|''q'' &amp;isin; ''N''}} has two or more preimages, then the vector field may determine two or more distinct vectors in {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;''N''}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is not surjective, then will be a point {{math|''q'' &amp;isin; ''N''}} at which {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not determine any tangent vector at all.  Since a vector field on {{math|''N''}} determines, by definition, a unique tangent vector at every point of {{math|''N''}}, the pushforward of a vector field does not always exist.

By contrast, it is always possible to pull back a differential form.  A differential form on {{math|''N''}} may be viewed as a linear functional on each tangent space.  Precomposing this functional with the differential {{math|''df'' : ''TM'' → ''TN''}} defines a linear functional on each tangent space of {{math|''M''}} and therefore a differential form on {{math|''M''}}.  The existence of pullbacks is one of the key features of the theory of differential forms.  It leads to the existence of pullback maps in other situations, such as pullback homomorphisms in de Rham cohomology.

Formally, let {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} be smooth, and let {{math|''ω''}} be a smooth {{math|''k''}}-form on {{math|''N''}}.  Then there is a differential form {{math|''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''}} on {{math|''M''}}, called the '''pullback''' of {{math|''ω''}}, which captures the behavior of {{math|''ω''}} as seen relative to {{math|''f''}}.  To define the pullback, fix a point {{math|''p''}} of {{math|''M''}} and tangent vectors {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''M''}} at {{math|''p''}}.  The pullback of {{math|''ω''}} is defined by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(f^*\omega)_p(v_1, \ldots, v_k) = \omega_{f(p)}(f_*v_1, \ldots, f_*v_k).&lt;/math&gt;

There are several more abstract ways to view this definition.  If {{math|''ω''}} is a {{math|1}}-form on {{math|''N''}}, then it may be viewed as a section of the cotangent bundle {{math|''T''{{i sup|∗}}''N''}} of {{math|''N''}}.  Using {{i sup|∗}} to denote a dual map, the dual to the differential of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|(''df''){{i sup|∗}} : ''T''{{i sup|∗}}''N'' → ''T''{{i sup|∗}}''M''}}.  The pullback of {{math|''ω''}} may be defined to be the composite
:&lt;math&gt;M\ \stackrel{f}{\to}\ N\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ T^*N\ \stackrel{(df)^*}{\longrightarrow}\ T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a section of the cotangent bundle of {{math|''M''}} and hence a differential {{math|1}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  In full generality, let &lt;math&gt;\wedge^k (df)^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the {{math|''k''}}th exterior power of the dual map to the differential.  Then the pullback of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} is the composite
:&lt;math&gt;M\ \stackrel{f}{\to}\ N\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ \wedge^k T^*N\ \stackrel{\wedge^k (df)^*}{\longrightarrow}\ \wedge^k T^*M.&lt;/math&gt;

Another abstract way to view the pullback comes from viewing a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} as a linear functional on tangent spaces.  From this point of view, {{math|''ω''}} is a morphism of [[vector bundle]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TN\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ N \times \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''N'' × '''R'''}} is the trivial rank one bundle on {{math|''N''}}.  The composite map
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TM\ \stackrel{\wedge^k df}{\longrightarrow}\ \wedge^k TN\ \stackrel{\omega}{\to}\ N \times \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
defines a linear functional on each tangent space of {{math|''M''}}, and therefore it factors through the trivial bundle {{math|''M'' × '''R'''}}.  The vector bundle morphism &lt;math&gt;\wedge^k TM \to M \times \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined in this way is {{math|''f''{{i sup|∗}}''ω''}}.

Pullback respects all of the basic operations on forms.  If {{math|''ω''}} and {{math|''η''}} are forms and {{math|''c''}} is a real number, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
             f^*(c\omega) &amp;= c(f^*\omega), \\
       f^*(\omega + \eta) &amp;= f^*\omega + f^*\eta, \\
  f^*(\omega \wedge \eta) &amp;= f^*\omega \wedge f^*\eta, \\
             f^*(d\omega) &amp;= d(f^*\omega).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The pullback of a form can also be written in coordinates. Assume that {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are coordinates on {{math|''M''}}, that {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are coordinates on {{math|''N''}}, and that these coordinate systems are related by the formulas {{math|1=''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for all {{math|''i''}}. Locally on {{math|''N''}}, {{math|''ω''}} can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} \omega_{i_1\cdots i_k} \, dy^{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dy^{i_k},&lt;/math&gt;

where, for each choice of {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a real-valued function of {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Using the linearity of pullback and its compatibility with exterior product, the pullback of {{math|''ω''}} has the formula

:&lt;math&gt;f^*\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} (\omega_{i_1\cdots i_k}\circ f) \, df_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge df_{i_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each exterior derivative {{math|''df''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be expanded in terms of {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ..., {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The resulting {{math|''k''}}-form can be written using [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] matrices:

:&lt;math&gt; f^*\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k} \sum_{j_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_k} (\omega_{i_1\cdots i_k}\circ f)\frac{\partial(f_{i_1}, \ldots, f_{i_k})}{\partial(x^{j_1}, \ldots, x^{j_k})} \, dx^{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{j_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(f_{i_1}, \ldots, f_{i_k})}{\partial(x^{j_1}, \ldots, x^{j_k})}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the determinant of the matrix whose entries are &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_{i_m}}{\partial x^{j_n}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1\leq m,n\leq k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Integration==
A differential {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over an oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional manifold.  When the {{math|''k''}}-form is defined on an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold with {{math|''n'' &amp;gt; ''k''}}, then the {{math|''k''}}-form can be integrated over oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifolds.  If {{math|1=''k'' = 0}}, this is just evaluation of a function at points. Other values of {{math|1=''k'' = 1, 2, 3, ...}} correspond to line integrals, surface integrals, volume integrals, and so on.  There are several equivalent ways to formally define the integral of a differential form, all of which depend on reducing to the case of Euclidean space.

===Integration on Euclidean space===
Let {{math|''U''}} be an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Give {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} its standard orientation and {{math|''U''}} the restriction of that orientation.  Every smooth {{math|''n''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} on {{math|''U''}} has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = f(x)\,dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;
for some smooth function {{math|''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''}}.  Such a function has an integral in the usual Riemann or Lebesgue sense.  This allows us to define the integral of {{math|''ω''}} to be the integral of {{math|''f''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_U \omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \int_U f(x)\,dx^1 \cdots dx^n.&lt;/math&gt;
Fixing an orientation is necessary for this to be well-defined.  The skew-symmetry of differential forms means that the integral of, say, {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be the negative of the integral of {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∧ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Riemann and Lebesgue integrals cannot see this dependence on the ordering of the coordinates, so they leave the sign of the integral undetermined.  The orientation resolves this ambiguity.

===Integration over chains===
Let {{math|''M''}} be an {{math|''n''}}-manifold and {{math|''ω''}} an {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  First, assume that there is a parametrization of {{math|''M''}} by an open subset of Euclidean space.  That is, assume that there exists a diffeomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \colon D \to M&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''D'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Give {{math|''M''}} the orientation induced by {{math|''φ''}}.  Then {{Harv|Rudin|1976}} defines the integral of {{math|''ω''}} over {{math|''M''}} to be the integral of {{math|''φ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''ω''}} over {{math|''D''}}.  In coordinates, this has the following expression.  Fix a chart on {{math|''M''}} with coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_n} a_{i_1,\dots,i_n}({\mathbf x})\,dx^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx^{i_n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Suppose that {{math|''φ''}} is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi({\mathbf u}) = (x^1({\mathbf u}),\dots,x^n({\mathbf u})).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the integral may be written in coordinates as
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \omega = \int_D \sum_{i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_n} a_{i_1,\dots,i_n}(\varphi({\mathbf u})) \frac{\partial(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_n})}{\partial(u^{1},\dots,u^{n})}\,du^1 \cdots du^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_n})}{\partial(u^{1},\dots,u^{n})}&lt;/math&gt;
is the determinant of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]].  The Jacobian exists because {{math|''φ''}} is differentiable.

In general, an {{math|''n''}}-manifold cannot be parametrized by an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  But such a parametrization is always possible locally, so it is possible to define integrals over arbitrary manifolds by defining them as sums of integrals over collections of local parametrizations.  Moreover, it is also possible to define parametrizations of {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets for {{math|''k'' &amp;lt; ''n''}}, and this makes it possible to define integrals of {{math|''k''}}-forms.  To make this precise, it is convenient to fix a standard domain {{math|''D''}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, usually a cube or a simplex.  A {{math|''k''}}-'''chain''' is a formal sum of smooth embeddings {{math|''D'' → ''M''}}.  That is, it is a collection of smooth embeddings, each of which is assigned an integer multiplicity.  Each smooth embedding determines a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifold of {{math|''M''}}.  If the chain is
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sum_{i=1}^r m_i \varphi_i,&lt;/math&gt;
then the integral of a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} over {{math|''c''}} is defined to be the sum of the integrals over the terms of {{math|''c''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_c \omega = \sum_{i=1}^r m_i \int_D \varphi_i^*\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

This approach to defining integration does not assign a direct meaning to integration over the whole manifold {{math|''M''}}.  However, it is still possible to assign such a meaning indirectly because every smooth manifold may be smoothly [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulated]] in an essentially unique way, and the integral over {{math|''M''}} may be defined to be the integral over the chain determined by a triangulation.

===Integration using partitions of unity===
There is another approach, expounded in {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}, which does directly assign a meaning to integration over {{math|''M''}}, but this approach requires fixing an orientation of {{math|''M''}}.  The integral of an {{math|''n''}}-form {{math|''ω''}} on an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold is defined by working in charts.  Suppose first that {{math|''ω''}} is supported on a single positively oriented chart.  On this chart, it may be pulled back to an {{math|''n''}}-form on an open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Here, the form has a well-defined Riemann or Lebesgue integral as before.  The change of variables formula and the assumption that the chart is positively oriented together ensure that the integral of {{math|''ω''}} is independent of the chosen chart.  In the general case, use a partition of unity to write {{math|''ω''}} as a sum of {{math|''n''}}-forms, each of which is supported in a single positively oriented chart, and define the integral of {{math|''ω''}} to be the sum of the integrals of each term in the partition of unity.

It is also possible to integrate {{math|''k''}}-forms on oriented {{math|''k''}}-dimensional submanifolds using this more intrinsic approach.  The form is pulled back to the submanifold, where the integral is defined using charts as before.  For example, given a path {{math|''γ''(''t'') : [0, 1] → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, integrating a {{math|1}}-form on the path is simply pulling back the form to a form {{math|''f''(''t'')&amp;thinsp;''dt''}} on {{math|[0, 1]}}, and this integral is the integral of the function {{math|''f''(''t'')}} on the interval.

===Integration along fibers===
{{main|Integration along fibers}}

[[Fubini's theorem]] states that the integral over a set that is a product may be computed as an iterated integral over the two factors in the product.  This suggests that the integral of a differential form over a product ought to be computable as an iterated integral as well.  The geometric flexibility of differential forms ensures that this is possible not just for products, but in more general situations as well.  Under some hypotheses, it is possible to integrate along the fibers of a smooth map, and the analog of Fubini's theorem is the case where this map is the projection from a product to one of its factors.

Because integrating a differential form over a submanifold requires fixing an orientation, a prerequisite to integration along fibers is the existence of a well-defined orientation on those fibers.  Let {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} be two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}, respectively.  Suppose that {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a surjective submersion.  This implies that each fiber {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} is {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-dimensional and that, around each point of {{math|''M''}}, there is a chart on which {{math|''f''}} looks like the projection from a product onto one of its factors.  Fix {{math|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} and set {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}.  Suppose that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\omega_x &amp;\in \wedge^m T_x^*M, \\
\eta_y &amp;\in \wedge^n T_y^*N,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and that {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not vanish.  Following {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}, there is a unique
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*(f^{-1}(y))&lt;/math&gt;
which may be thought of as the fibral part of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to {{math|''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  More precisely, define {{math|''j'' : ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'') → ''M''}} to be the inclusion.  Then {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined by the property that,
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_x = (f^*\eta_y)_x \wedge \sigma'_x \in \wedge^m T_x^*M,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'_x \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*M&lt;/math&gt;
is any {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-covector for which
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = j^*\sigma'_x.&lt;/math&gt;
The form {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} may also be notated {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Moreover, for fixed {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} varies smoothly with respect to {{math|''x''}}.  That is, suppose that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega \colon f^{-1}(y) \to T^*M&lt;/math&gt;
is a smooth section of the projection map; we say that {{math|''ω''}} is a smooth differential {{math|''m''}}-form on {{math|''M''}} along {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}.  Then there is a smooth differential {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-form {{math|''σ''}} on {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} such that, at each {{math|''x'' ∈ ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}},
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \omega_x / \eta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
This form is denoted {{math|''ω'' / ''η''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The same construction works if {{math|''ω''}} is an {{math|''m''}}-form in a neighborhood of the fiber, and the same notation is used.  A consequence is that each fiber {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} is orientable.  In particular, a choice of orientation forms on {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} defines an orientation of every fiber of {{math|''f''}}.

The analog of Fubini's theorem is as follows.  As before, {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are two orientable manifolds of pure dimensions {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}, and {{math|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} is a surjective submersion.  Fix orientations of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}, and give each fiber of {{math|''f''}} the induced orientation.  Let {{math|''θ''}} be an {{math|''m''}}-form on {{math|''M''}}, and let {{math|''ζ''}} be an {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''N''}} that is almost everywhere positive with respect to the orientation of {{math|''N''}}.  Then, for almost every {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, the form {{math|''θ'' / ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a well-defined integrable {{math|''m'' &amp;minus; ''n''}} form on {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}.  Moreover, there is an integrable {{math|''n''}}-form on {{math|''N''}} defined by
:&lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta_y\bigg)\,\zeta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
Denote this form by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta\bigg)\,\zeta.&lt;/math&gt;
Then {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}} proves the generalized Fubini formula
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M \theta = \int_N \bigg(\int_{f^{-1}(y)} \theta / \zeta\bigg)\,\zeta.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to integrate forms of other degrees along the fibers of a submersion.  Assume the same hypotheses as before, and let {{math|''α''}} be a compactly supported {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'' + ''k'')}}-form on {{math|''M''}}.  Then there is a {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''γ''}} on {{math|''N''}} which is the result of integrating {{math|''α''}} along the fibers of {{math|''f''}}.  The form {{math|''α''}} is defined by specifying, at each {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, how {{math|''α''}} pairs against each {{math|''k''}}-vector {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''y''}}, and the value of that pairing is an integral over {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} that depends only on {{math|''α''}}, {{math|'''v'''}}, and the orientations of {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}.  More precisely, at each {{math|''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, there is an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\wedge^k T_yN \to \wedge^{m-k} T_y^*N&lt;/math&gt;
defined by the interior product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \mapsto \mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y.&lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''x'' ∈ ''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}}, then a {{math|''k''}}-vector {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''y''}} determines an {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''k'')}}-covector at {{math|''x''}} by pullback:
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(\mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y) \in \wedge^{m-k} T_x^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
Each of these covectors has an exterior product against {{math|''α''}}, so there is an {{math|(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'')}}-form {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on {{math|''M''}} along {{math|''f''{{i sup|&amp;minus;1}}(''y'')}} defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(\beta_{\mathbf{v}})_x = \left(\alpha_x \wedge f^*(\mathbf{v}\,\lrcorner\,\zeta_y)\right) \big/ \zeta_y \in \wedge^{m-n} T_x^*M.&lt;/math&gt;
This form depends on the orientation of {{math|''N''}} but not the choice of {{math|''ζ''}}.  Then the {{math|''k''}}-form {{math|''γ''}} is uniquely defined by the property
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\gamma_y, \mathbf{v}\rangle = \int_{f^{-1}(y)} \beta_{\mathbf{v}}(x),&lt;/math&gt;
and {{math|''γ''}} is smooth {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}.  This form also denoted {{math|''α''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt;}} and called the '''integral of {{math|''α''}} along the fibers of ''f'''''.  Integration along fibers is important for the construction of Gysin maps in de Rham cohomology.

Integration along fibers satisfies the '''projection formula''' {{Harv|Dieudonne|1972}}.  If {{math|''λ''}} is any {{math|''ℓ''}}-form on {{math|''N''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^\flat \wedge \lambda = (\alpha \wedge f^*\lambda)^\flat.&lt;/math&gt;

===Stokes' theorem===
{{main|Stokes' theorem}}
The fundamental relationship between the exterior derivative and integration is given by the [[Stokes' theorem]]: If {{math|''ω''}} is an ({{math|''n'' − 1}})-form with compact support on {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''∂M''}} denotes the [[manifold|boundary]] of {{math|''M''}} with its induced [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

A key consequence of this is that "the integral of a closed form over homologous chains is equal": If {{math|''ω''}} is a closed {{math|''k''}}-form and {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are {{math|''k''}}-chains that are homologous (such that {{math|''M'' − ''N''}} is the boundary of a ({{math|''k'' + 1}})-chain {{math|''W''}}), then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_M \omega = \int_N \omega}&lt;/math&gt;, since the difference is the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_W d\omega = \int_W 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if {{math|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} is the derivative of a potential function on the plane or {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then the integral of {{math|''ω''}} over a path from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''b''}} does not depend on the choice of path (the integral is {{math|''f''(''b'') − ''f''(''a'')}}), since different paths with given endpoints are [[homotopic]], hence homologous (a weaker condition). This case is called the [[gradient theorem]], and generalizes the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. This path independence is very useful in [[contour integration]].

This theorem also underlies the duality between [[de Rham cohomology]] and the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of chains.

=== Relation with measures ===
{{details|Density on a manifold}}

On a ''general'' differentiable manifold (without additional structure), differential forms ''cannot'' be integrated over subsets of the manifold; this distinction is key to the distinction between differential forms, which are integrated over chains or oriented submanifolds, and measures, which are integrated over subsets. The simplest example is attempting to integrate the {{math|1}}-form {{math|''dx''}} over the interval {{math|[0, 1]}}. Assuming the usual distance (and thus measure) on the real line, this integral is either {{math|1}} or {{math|&amp;minus;1}}, depending on ''orientation:'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_0^1 dx = 1}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_1^0 dx = - \int_0^1 dx = -1}&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the integral of the ''measure'' {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}} on the interval is unambiguously {{math|1}} (formally, the integral of the constant function {{math|1}} with respect to this measure is {{math|1}}). Similarly, under a change of coordinates a differential {{math|''n''}}-form changes by the [[Jacobian determinant]] {{math|''J''}}, while a measure changes by the ''absolute value'' of the Jacobian determinant, {{math|{{abs|''J''}}}}, which further reflects the issue of orientation. For example, under the map {{math|''x'' ↦ −''x''}} on the line, the differential form {{math|''dx''}} pulls back to {{math|−''dx''}}; orientation has reversed; while the [[Lebesgue measure]], which here we denote {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}}, pulls back to {{math|{{abs|''dx''}}}}; it does not change.

In the presence of the additional data of an ''orientation'', it is possible to integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms (top-dimensional forms) over the entire manifold or over compact subsets; integration over the entire manifold corresponds to integrating the form over the [[fundamental class]] of the manifold, {{math|[''M'']}}. Formally, in the presence of an orientation, one may identify {{math|''n''}}-forms with [[densities on a manifold]]; densities in turn define a measure, and thus can be integrated {{Harv |Folland |1999 |loc = Section 11.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;361&amp;ndash;362}}.

On an orientable but not oriented manifold, there are two choices of orientation; either choice allows one to integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms over compact subsets, with the two choices differing by a sign. On non-orientable manifold, {{math|''n''}}-forms and densities cannot be identified —notably, any top-dimensional form must vanish somewhere (there are no [[volume form]]s on non-orientable manifolds), but there are nowhere-vanishing densities— thus while one can integrate densities over compact subsets, one cannot integrate {{math|''n''}}-forms. One can instead identify densities with top-dimensional [[Volume form#Relation to measures|pseudoform]]s.

Even in the presence of an orientation, there is in general no meaningful way to integrate {{math|''k''}}-forms over subsets for {{math|''k'' &lt; ''n''}} because there is no consistent way to use the ambient orientation to orient {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets.  Geometrically, a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subset can be turned around in place, yielding the same subset with the reserve orientation; for example, the horizontal axis in a plane can be rotated by a half-circle.  Compare the [[Gram determinant]] of a set of {{math|''k''}} vectors in an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space, which, unlike the determinant of {{math|''n''}} vectors, is always positive, corresponding to a squared number.  An orientation of a {{math|''k''}}-submanifold is therefore extra data not derivable from the ambient manifold.

On a Riemannian manifold, one may define a {{math|''k''}}-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] for any {{math|''k''}} (integer or real), which may be integrated over {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets of the manifold. A function times this Hausdorff measure can then be integrated over {{math|''k''}}-dimensional subsets, providing a measure-theoretic analog to integration of {{math|''k''}}-forms. The {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Hausdorff measure yields a density, as above.

===Currents===
The differential form analog of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] or generalized function is called a '''current'''.  The space of {{math|''k''}}-currents on {{math|''M''}} is the dual space to an appropriate space of differential {{math|''k''}}-forms.  Currents play the role of generalized domains of integration, similar to but even more flexible than chains.

==Applications in physics==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Maxwell's equations]] --&gt;

Differential forms arise in some important physical contexts. For example, in Maxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]], the '''Faraday 2-form''', or [[electromagnetic field strength]], is

:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F} = \frac 1 2 f_{ab}\, dx^a \wedge dx^b\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are formed from the electromagnetic fields &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt;; e.g., {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;/''c''}}, {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; = −''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or equivalent definitions.

This form is a special case of the [[curvature form]] on the {{math|[[U(1)]]}} [[principal bundle]] on which both electromagnetism and general [[gauge theories]] may be described.  The [[connection form]] for the principal bundle is the vector potential, typically denoted by {{math|'''A'''}}, when represented in some gauge.  One then has
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{F} = d\textbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''current {{math|3}}-form''' is

: &lt;math&gt; \textbf{J} = \frac 1 6 j^a\, \varepsilon_{abcd}\, dx^b \wedge dx^c \wedge dx^d\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the four components of the current density. (Here it is a matter of convention to write {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} instead of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. to use capital letters, and to write {{math|''J''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}} instead of {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. However, the vector rsp. tensor components and the above-mentioned forms have different physical dimensions. Moreover, by decision of an international commission of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]], the magnetic polarization vector is called &lt;math&gt;\vec J&lt;/math&gt; since several decades, and by some publishers {{math|'''J'''}}, i.e. the same name is used for different quantities.)

Using the above-mentioned definitions, [[Maxwell's equations]] can be written very compactly in [[geometrized units]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        d {\textbf{F}} &amp;= \textbf{0} \\
  d {\star \textbf{F}} &amp;= \textbf{J},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hodge star]] operator.  Similar considerations describe the geometry of gauge theories in general.

The {{math|2}}-form &lt;math&gt;{\star} \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;, which is [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the Faraday form, is also called '''Maxwell 2-form'''.

Electromagnetism is an example of a {{math|[[U(1)]]}} [[gauge theory]].  Here the [[Lie group]] is {{math|U(1)}}, the one-dimensional [[unitary group]], which is in particular [[abelian group|abelian]].  There are gauge theories, such as [[Yang–Mills theory]], in which the Lie group is not abelian.  In that case, one gets relations which are similar to those described here. The analog of the field {{math|'''F'''}} in such theories is the curvature form of the connection, which is represented in a gauge by a [[Lie algebra]]-valued one-form {{math|'''A'''}}.  The Yang–Mills field {{math|'''F'''}} is then defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = d\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A}\wedge\mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the abelian case, such as electromagnetism, {{math|1='''A''' ∧ '''A''' = 0}}, but this does not hold in general.  Likewise the field equations are modified by additional terms involving exterior products of {{math|'''A'''}} and {{math|'''F'''}}, owing to the [[Maurer–Cartan form|structure equations]] of the gauge group.

==Applications in geometric measure theory==

Numerous minimality results for complex analytic manifolds are based on the [[Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)|Wirtinger inequality for 2-forms]].  A succinct proof may be found in [[Herbert Federer]]'s classic text ''Geometric Measure Theory''.  The Wirtinger inequality is also a key ingredient in [[Gromov's inequality for complex projective space]] in [[systolic geometry]].

A [[Congruence relation|congruence]] θ of a [[Semilattice|join-semilattice]] ''S'' is ''monomial'', if the θ-[[equivalence class]] of any element of ''S'' has a largest element. We say that θ is ''distributive'', if it is a [[Join (mathematics)|join]], in the [[Compact element|congruence lattice]] Con ''S'' of ''S'', of monomial join-congruences of ''S''.

The following definition originates in Schmidt's 1968 work and was subsequently adjusted by Wehrung.

'''Definition (weakly distributive homomorphisms).''' A homomorphism 
''&amp;mu; : S → T'' between join-semilattices ''S'' and ''T'' is ''weakly distributive'', if for all ''a, b'' in ''S'' and all ''c'' in ''T'' such that ''&amp;mu;(c)&amp;le; a &amp;or; b'', there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''S'' such that ''c&amp;le; x &amp;or; y'', ''&amp;mu;(x)&amp;le; a'', and ''&amp;mu;(y)&amp;le; b''.

'''Examples:'''

(1) For an [[Universal algebra|algebra]] ''B'' and a ''reduct'' ''A'' of ''B'' (that is, an algebra with same underlying set as ''B'' but whose set of operations is a subset of the one of ''B''), the canonical (∨, 0)-homomorphism from Con&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; A to Con&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; B is weakly distributive. Here, Con&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; A denotes the (∨, 0)-semilattice of all [[Compact element|compact congruences]] of ''A''.

(2) For a [[Lattice (order)|convex sublattice]] ''K'' of a lattice ''L'', the canonical (∨, 0)-homomorphism from Con&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ''K'' to Con&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ''L'' is weakly distributive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6366">In [[metalogic]] and [[metamathematics]], '''Frege's theorem''' is a [[metatheorem]] that states that the [[Peano axiom]]s of [[arithmetic]] can be derived in [[second-order logic]] from [[Hume's principle]]. It was first proven, informally, by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his ''Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik'' (''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]''),{{page needed|date=April 2016}} published in 1884, and proven more formally in his ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'' (''Basic Laws of Arithmetic''),{{page needed|date=April 2016}} published in two volumes, in 1893 and 1903. The theorem was re-discovered by [[Crispin Wright]] in the early 1980s and has since been the focus of significant work. It is at the core of the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as [[neo-logicism]] (at least of the [[Scottish School (philosophy of mathematics)|Scottish School]] variety).

In ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884), and later, in ''Basic Laws of Arithmetic'' (vol. 1, 1893; vol. 2, 1903), Frege attempted to derive all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical (see [[logicism]]). Most of these axioms were carried over from his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the one truly new principle was one he called the '''Basic Law V'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (now known as the [[axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension]]):&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pettigrew, [https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/students/math/basic-set-theory.pdf "Basic set theory"], January 26, 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; the "value-range" of the function ''f''(''x'') is the same as the "value-range" of the function ''g''(''x'') if and only if ∀''x''[''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'')]. However, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a logical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be inconsistent, because it was subject to [[Russell's paradox]].&lt;ref name=Zalta&gt;{{citation|title=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|contribution-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege-theorem/|contribution=Frege's Theorem and Foundations for Arithmetic|first=Edward|last=Zalta|authorlink=Edward Zalta|year=2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inconsistency in Frege's ''Grundgesetze'' overshadowed Frege's achievement: according to [[Edward Zalta]], the ''Grundgesetze'' "contains all the essential steps of a valid proof (in second-order logic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic from a single consistent principle."&lt;ref name=Zalta/&gt; This achievement has become known as Frege's theorem.&lt;ref name=Zalta/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37509971|title=Logic, Logic, and Logic|last=Boolos|first=George|authorlink=George Boolos|date=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Edited by Richard C.

In [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]], Frege's theorems refers to this [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]:

: (''P'' → (''Q''→''R'')) → ((''P''→''Q'') →  (''P''→''R''))

The [[truth table]] to the right gives a proof. For all possible assignments of ''false'' ({{n&amp;}}) or ''true'' ({{y&amp;}}) to ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' (columns 1, 3, 5), each subformula is evaluated according to the rules for [[material conditional]], the result being shown below its main operator. Column 6 shows that the whole formula evaluates to ''true'' in every case, i.e. that it is a tautology. In fact, its [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] (column 2) and its [[consequent]] (column 10) are even equivalent.

'''Fresnel integrals''', ''S''(''x'') and ''C''(''x''), are two [[transcendental function]]s named after [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] that are used in [[optics]], which are closely related to the [[error function]] (erf). They arise in the description of [[near and far field|near-field]] [[Fresnel diffraction]] phenomena and are defined through the following [[integral]] representations:

: &lt;math&gt;S(x) = \int_0^x \sin(t^2)\,\mathrm{d}t,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;C(x) = \int_0^x \cos(t^2)\,\mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

The simultaneous [[parametric equation|parametric plot]] of ''S''(''x'') and ''C''(''x'') is the [[Euler spiral]] (also known as the Cornu spiral or clothoid). Recently, they have been used in the design of highways and other engineering projects.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stewart|title=Calculus Early Transcendentals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4-1Rk7uaEcC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;lpg=PA383&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22design+of+highways%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22design%20of%20highways%22&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|isbn=0-495-38273-6|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[image:Fresnel Integrals (Normalised).svg|250px|thumb|
Fresnel integrals with arguments {{pi}}''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 instead of ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; converge to 0.5.]]
The Fresnel integrals admit the following [[power series expansion]]s that converge for all ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S(x) &amp; =\int_0^x \sin(t^2)\,\mathrm{d}t=\sum_{n=0}^{\infin}(-1)^n\frac{x^{4n+3}}{(2n+1)!(4n+3)} \\[6pt]
C(x) &amp; =\int_0^x \cos(t^2)\,\mathrm{d}t=\sum_{n=0}^{\infin}(-1)^n\frac{x^{4n+1}}{(2n)!(4n+1)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors, including [[Abramowitz and Stegun]], (eqs 7.3.1 &amp;ndash; 7.3.2) use &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}t^2&lt;/math&gt; for the argument of the integrals defining ''S''(''x'') and ''C''(''x''), which changes their [[Limit of a function#Limits at infinity|limits]] to 0.5 and the arc length for the first spiral turn &lt;math&gt;(2\pi)&lt;/math&gt; to 2 (at &lt;math&gt;t=2&lt;/math&gt;), all smaller by a factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;. The alternative functions are also called ''Normalized Fresnel integrals''.

== Euler spiral ==
{{Main|Euler spiral}}
[[Image:Cornu Spiral.svg|250px|thumb|
Euler spiral &lt;math&gt;(x,y) = (C(t), S(t))&lt;/math&gt;. The spiral converges to the centre of the holes in the image as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; tends to positive or negative infinity.]]
The '''Euler [[spiral]]''', also known as '''Cornu spiral''' or '''clothoid''', is the curve generated by a [[parametric plot]] of &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; against &lt;math&gt;C(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The Cornu spiral was created by [[Marie Alfred Cornu]] as a [[nomogram]] for diffraction computations in science and engineering.

From the definitions of Fresnel integrals, the [[infinitesimal]]s &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dy&lt;/math&gt; are thus:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}x = C'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t = \cos(t^2)\,\mathrm{d}t,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}y = S'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t = \sin(t^2)\,\mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the length of the spiral measured from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] can be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt;L = \int_0^{t_0} \sqrt {\mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2} = \int_0^{t_0} \mathrm{d}t = t_0. &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the curve length measured from the origin &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, and the Euler spiral has [[Infinity|infinite]] length. The vector &lt;math&gt;(\cos(t^2), \sin(t^2))&lt;/math&gt; also expresses the [[unit vector|unit]] [[tangent vector]] along the spiral, giving &lt;math&gt;\theta = t^2&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''t'' is the curve length, the curvature &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; \kappa = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} = 2t. &lt;/math&gt;

And the rate of change of curvature with respect to the curve length is
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\kappa}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac {\mathrm{d}^2\theta}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = 2. &lt;/math&gt;

An Euler spiral has the property that its [[curvature]] at any point is proportional to the distance along the spiral, measured from the origin.  This property makes it useful as a [[track transition curve|transition curve]] in highway and railway engineering: If a vehicle follows the spiral at unit speed, the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in the above derivatives also represents the time. That is, a vehicle following the spiral at constant speed will have a constant rate of [[angular acceleration]].

Sections from Euler spirals are commonly incorporated into the shape of roller-coaster loops to make what are known as [[clothoid loop]]s.

== Properties ==
* ''C''(''x'') and  ''S''(''x'') are [[odd function]]s of ''x''.
* Asymptotics of the Fresnel integrals as &lt;math&gt;x \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; are given by the formulas:

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S(x) &amp; =\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left( \frac{\mbox{sign}{(x)}}{2} - \left[1+O(x^{-4}) \right] \left( \frac{\cos{(x^{2})}}{x \sqrt{2 \pi}} + \frac{\sin{(x^2)}}{ x^3 \sqrt{8 \pi}} \right) \right), \\[6pt]
C(x) &amp; =\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left( \frac{\mbox{sign}{(x)}}{2} + \left[1+O(x^{-4}) \right] \left( \frac{\sin{(x^2)}}{x \sqrt{2 \pi}} - \frac{\cos{(x^{2})}}{ x^3 \sqrt{8 \pi}} \right) \right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Fresnel-sin.png|right|thumb|300px|Complex Fresnel integral S(z)]]
* Using the power series expansions above, the Fresnel integrals can be extended to the domain of [[complex number]]s, and they become [[analytic function]]s of a complex variable.
* The Fresnel integrals can be expressed using the [[error function]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;functions.wolfram.com, [http://functions.wolfram.com/GammaBetaErf/FresnelS/27/01/ Fresnel integral S: Representations through equivalent functions] and [http://functions.wolfram.com/GammaBetaErf/FresnelC/27/01/ Fresnel integral C: Representations through equivalent functions].  Note: Wolfram uses the Abramowitz &amp; Stegun convention, which differs from the one in this article by factors of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fresnel-cos.png|right|thumb|300px|Complex Fresnel integral ''C''(''z'')]]

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S(z) &amp; =\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1+i}{4} \left[ \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}z\right) -i \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{1-i}{\sqrt{2}}z\right) \right], \\[6pt]
C(z) &amp; =\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1-i}{4} \left[ \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}z\right) + i \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{1-i}{\sqrt{2}}z\right) \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:or

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
C(z) + i S(z) &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1+i}{2} \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{1-i}{\sqrt{2}}z\right), \\[6pt]
S(z) + i C(z) &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1+i}{2} \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}z\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* ''C'' and  ''S'' are [[entire function]]s.

===Limits as ''x'' approaches infinity===
The integrals defining ''C''(''x'') and ''S''(''x'') cannot be evaluated in the [[closed-form expression|closed form]] in terms of [[elementary function]]s, except in special cases. The [[limit of a function|limits]] of these functions as ''x'' goes to infinity are known:

::&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \cos t^2\,\mathrm{d}t = \int_0^\infty \sin t^2 \, \mathrm{d}t = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{8}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Fresnel Integral Contour.svg|right|250px|thumb|The sector contour used to calculate the limits of the Fresnel integrals]]
The limits of {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''S''}} as the argument tends to infinity can be found by the methods of [[complex analysis]]. This uses the [[contour integral]] of the function

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

around the boundary of the [[Circular sector|sector]]-shaped region in the [[complex plane]] formed by the positive {{math|''x''}}-axis, the bisector of the first quadrant {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''}} with {{math|''x'' ≥ 0}}, and a circular arc of radius {{math|''R''}} centered at the origin.

As {{math|''R''}} goes to infinity, the integral along the circular arc tends to {{math|0}}, the integral along the real axis tends to the half [[Gaussian integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, \mathrm{d}t = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note too that because the integrand is an [[entire function]] on the complex plane, its integral along the whole contour is zero. Overall, we must have

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty e^{-t^2} \, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{\gamma_3} e^{-t^2} \, \mathrm{d}t&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_3&lt;/math&gt; denotes the bisector of the first quadrant, as in the diagram. To evaluate the right hand side, parametrize the bisector as &lt;math&gt;t = re^{\pi i /4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i)r&lt;/math&gt; where r ranges from 0 to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the square of this expression is just &lt;math&gt;+ir^2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, substitution gives the right hand side as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty e^{-ir^2}\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i) \, \mathrm{d}r.&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Euler's formula]] to take real and imaginary parts of &lt;math&gt;e^{-ir^2}&lt;/math&gt; gives this as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_0^\infty (\cos(r^2) - i\sin(r^2))\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i) \, \mathrm{d}r \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \int_0^\infty [\cos(r^2) + \sin(r^2)] + [\cos(r^2) - \sin(r^2)] i \, \mathrm{d}r = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} + 0i
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have written &lt;math&gt;0i&lt;/math&gt; to emphasize that the original Gaussian integral's value is completely real with zero imaginary part. Letting &lt;math&gt;I_C = \int_0^\infty \cos(r^2) \, \mathrm{d}r, I_S = \int_0^\infty \sin(r^2) \, \mathrm{d}r&lt;/math&gt; and then equating real and imaginary parts produces the following system of two equations in the two unknowns &lt;math&gt;I_C, I_S&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_C + I_S &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}, \\[6pt]
I_C - I_S &amp; = 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this for &lt;math&gt;I_C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_S&lt;/math&gt; gives the desired result.

== Generalization ==
The integral
: &lt;math&gt;\int x^m \exp(ix^n)\,\mathrm{d}x = \int\sum_{l=0}^\infty\frac{i^lx^{m+nl}}{l!}\,\mathrm{d}x
 = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{i^l}{(m+nl+1)}\frac{x^{m+nl+1}}{l!}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[confluent hypergeometric function]] and also an [[incomplete gamma function]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|first1 =R. J. | last1=Mathar
|title=Series Expansion of Generalized Fresnel Integrals |year=2012 |eprint=1211.3963
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int x^m \exp(ix^n)\,\mathrm{d}x &amp; =\frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1}\,_1F_1\left(\begin{array}{c} \frac{m+1}{n}\\1+\frac{m+1}{n}\end{array}\mid ix^n\right) \\[6pt]
&amp; =\frac{1}{n} i^{(m+1)/n}\gamma\left(\frac{m+1}{n},-ix^n\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which reduces to Fresnel integrals if real or imaginary parts are taken:

: &lt;math&gt;\int x^m\sin(x^n)\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{x^{m+n+1}}{m+n+1}
\,_1F_2\left(\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{m+1}{2n}\\
\frac{3}{2}+\frac{m+1}{2n},\frac{3}{2}\end{array}\mid -\frac{x^{2n}}{4}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The leading term in the asymptotic expansion is

: &lt;math&gt; _1F_1 \left(\begin{array}{c}\frac{m+1}{n}\\1+\frac{m+1}{n} \end{array}\mid ix^n\right)\sim \frac{m+1}{n}\,\Gamma\left(\frac{m+1}{n}\right) e^{i\pi(m+1)/(2n)} x^{-m-1},&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore
: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^m \exp(ix^n)\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{n} \,\Gamma\left(\frac{m+1}{n}\right)e^{i\pi(m+1)/(2n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the imaginary part of this equation in particular is

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\sin(x^a)\,\mathrm{d}x = \Gamma\left(1+\frac{1}{a} \right) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with the left-hand side converging for ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 and the right-hand side being its analytical extension to the whole plane less where lie the poles of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(a^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

The Kummer transformation of the confluent hypergeometric function is

: &lt;math&gt; \int x^m \exp(ix^n)\,\mathrm{d}x = V_{n,m}(x)e^{ix^n}&lt;/math&gt;

with
: &lt;math&gt;V_{n,m} := \frac{x^{m+1}}{m+1}\,_1F_1\left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 + \frac{m+1}{n} \end{array}\mid -ix^n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
The Fresnel integrals were originally used in the calculation of the electromagnetic field intensity in an environment where light bends around opaque objects.&lt;ref name=Beatty&gt;{{cite web|last=Beatty|first=Thomas|title=How to evaluate Fresnel Integrals|url=http://www.thomasbeatty.com/MATH%20PAGES/ARCHIVES%20-%20NOTES/Complex%20Variables/How%20to%20evaluate%20Fresnel%20Integrals.pdf|work=FGCU MATH - SUMMER 2013|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, they have been used in the design of highways and railways, specifically their curvature transition zones, see [[track transition curve]].&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt; Other applications are roller coasters&lt;ref name=Beatty /&gt; or calculating the transitions on a velodrome track to allow rapid entry to the bends and gradual exit.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14380">The '''future of mathematics''' is a topic that has been written about by many notable mathematicians. Typically, they are motivated by a desire to set a research agenda to direct efforts to specific problems, or a wish to clarify, update and extrapolate the way that subdisciplines relate to the general discipline of mathematics and its possibilities. Examples historical and recent include  [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]], [[Hilbert's problems]], [[Langlands program]], and the [[Millennium Prize Problems]]. In the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] section 01Axx History of mathematics and mathematicians, the subsection 01A67 is titled Future prospectives.

==Motivations and methodology for speculation==

According to [[Henri Poincaré]] writing in 1908 (English translation), "The true method of forecasting the future of mathematics lies in the study of its history and its present state".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Poincaré]] (1908). [http://ricardoheras.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Poincare-the-future-of-mathematics.pdf "The Future of Mathematics"]. Translation of the French original: [http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1908.1/Main/icm1908.1.0167.0182.ocr.pdf "L'avenir des mathématiques"]. in ''Revue générale des sciences pures et appliquées'' 19 (1908), pages 930–939. Also appeared in: ''Circolo Matematico di Palermo''; ''Bulletin des Sciences mathématiques''; ''Scientia''; and ''Atti del IV° Congresse internazionale dei Matematici''. Lecture held at the Eighth [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], Rome, Italy, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;
The historical approach can consist of the study of earlier predictions, and comparing them to the present state of the art to see how the predictions have fared, e.g. monitoring the progress of Hilbert's problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XQXoG4pL1-kC The honors class: Hilbert's problems and their solvers], Ben Yandell, A K Peters Ltd., 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-56881-216-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subject survey of mathematics itself however is now problematic: the sheer expansion of the subject gives rise to issues of [[mathematical knowledge management]].

Given the support of research by governments and other funding bodies, concerns about the future form part of the  rationale of the distribution of funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ercim-news.ercim.eu/content/view/385/640/ Keynote – Mathematics Everywhere], Marja Makarow, ERCIM NEWS 73 April 2008&lt;!-- "The European Science Foundation is preparing a Forward Look on Mathematical
Modelling, and has received a proposal from the CNRS, France, to develop one on
Mathematics and Industry. Forward Looks serve as strategic instruments, where the
best researchers describe the status quo of their scientific domain, envision its evolution
and impact in the next 5-10 years, and predict the needs for training, infrastructure
and funding." --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mathematical education]] must also consider changes that are happening in the mathematical requirements of the workplace; course design will be influenced both by current and by possible future areas of application of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D4wTfTqSH9wC Foundations for the future in mathematics education], Editors Richard A. Lesh, Eric Hamilton, James J. Kaput
Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8058-6056-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[László Lovász]], in ''Trends in Mathematics: How they could Change Education?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bolyai.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/lisbon.pdf Trends in Mathematics: How they could Change Education?]&lt;/ref&gt; describes how the mathematics community and mathematical research activity is growing and states that this will mean changes in the way things are done: larger organisations mean more resources are spent on overheads (coordination and communication); in mathematics this would equate to more time engaged in survey and expository writing.

==Mathematics in general==

===Subject divisions===
[[Steven G. Krantz]] writes in "The Proof is in the Pudding. A Look at the Changing Nature of Mathematical Proof":&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.cs.dal.ca/~jborwein/Preprints/Books/MbyE/Second-Ed/Material/krantz-proof.pdf The Proof is in the Pudding. A Look at the Changing Nature of Mathematical Proof], Steven G. Krantz, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; "It is becoming increasingly evident that the delineations among “engineer” and “mathematician” and “physicist” are becoming ever more vague. It seems plausible that in 100 years we will no longer speak of mathematicians as such but rather of mathematical scientists. It would not be at all surprising if the notion of “Department of Mathematics” at the college and university level gives way to “Division of Mathematical Sciences”."

===Experimental mathematics===
[[Experimental mathematics]] is the use of computers to generate large data sets within which to automate the discovery of patterns which can then form the basis of conjectures and eventually new theory. The paper "Experimental Mathematics: Recent Developments and Future Outlook"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | citeseerx = 10.1.1.138.1705 | chapter = Experimental Mathematics: Recent Developments and Future Outlook | first1 = David H. | last1 = Bailey | first2 = Jonathan M. | last2 = Borwein | title = Mathematics unlimited: 2001 and beyond | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes expected increases in computer capabilities: better hardware in terms of speed and memory capacity; better software in terms of increasing sophistication of [[algorithm]]s; more advanced [[Mathematical visualization|visualization]] facilities; the mixing of [[Symbolic-numeric computation|numerical and symbolic]] methods.

===Semi-rigorous mathematics===
[[Doron Zeilberger]] considers a time when computers become so powerful that the predominant questions in mathematics change from proving things to determining how much it would cost: "As wider classes of identities, and perhaps even other kinds of classes of theorems, become routinely provable, we might witness many results for which we would know how to find a proof (or refutation), but we would be unable, or unwilling, to pay for finding such proofs, since “almost certainty” can be bought so much cheaper. I can envision an abstract of a paper, c. 2100, that reads : “We show, in a certain precise sense, that the Goldbach conjecture is true with probability larger than 0.99999, and that its complete truth could be determined with a budget of $10B.”"&lt;ref&gt;[[Doron Zeilberger]] (1994). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math.CO/9301202 "Theorems for a Price: Tomorrow’s Semi-Rigorous Mathematical Culture"]. ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' 16:4, pages 11–18, December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people strongly disagree with Zeilberger's prediction, for example it has been described as provocative and quite wrongheaded,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wPhwJdjI-dIC Proof and other dilemmas: mathematics and philosophy], [[Bonnie Gold]], Roger A. Simons, MAA, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-88385-567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas it has also been stated that choosing which theorems are interesting enough to pay for, already happens as a result of funding bodies making decisions as to which areas of research to invest in.

===Automated mathematics===
In "Rough structure and classification",&lt;ref&gt;Rough structure and classification, Timothy Gowers, 1999, https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/gafavisions.ps&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Gowers]] writes about three stages: 1) at the moment computers are just slaves doing boring calculations, 2) soon databases of mathematical concepts and proof methods will lead to an intermediate stage where computers are very helpful with theorem proving but unthreatening, and 3) within a century computers will be better than humans at theorem proving.

==Mathematics by topic area==

===Combinatorics===

On [[combinatorics]]: In 2001, [[Peter Cameron (mathematician)|Peter Cameron]] in "Combinatorics entering the third millennium"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/preprints/pfhist.pdf Combinatorics entering the third millennium], Peter J. Cameron, Third draft, July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to ''"throw some light on present trends and future directions. I have divided the causes into four groups: the influence of the computer; the growing sophistication of combinatorics; its strengthening links with the rest of mathematics; and wider changes in society."'' He makes the prediction that ''"What is clear, though, is that combinatorics will continue to elude attempts at formal specification."'' [[Béla Bollobás]] writes: "Hilbert, I think, said that a subject is alive only if it has an abundance of problems. It is exactly this that makes combinatorics very much alive. I have no doubt that combinatorics will be around in a hundred years from now. It will be a completely different subject but it will still flourish simply because it still has many, many problems".&lt;ref&gt;"Creative Minds, Charmed Lives", Yu Kiang Leong, World Scientific, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerical analysis and scientific computing===
On [[numerical analysis]] and [[scientific computing]]: In 2000, [[Lloyd N. Trefethen]] wrote "Predictions for scientific computing 50 years from now",&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/future.pdf Predictions for scientific computing 50 years from now], Lloyd N. Trefethen (Mathematics Today, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded with the theme that "Human beings will be removed from the loop" and writing in 2008 in ''[[The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]]'' predicted that by 2050 most numerical programs will be 99% intelligent wrapper and only 1% algorithm, and that the distinction between linear and non-linear problems, and between forward problems (one step) and inverse problems (iteration), and between algebraic and analytic problems, will fade as everything becomes solved by iterative methods inside adaptive intelligent systems that mix and match and combine algorithms as required.&lt;ref&gt;The Princeton Companion to Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2008, Page 614&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data analysis===

On [[data analysis]]: In 1998, [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]] in "Possible Trends in Mathematics in the Coming Decades",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/199807/forum.pdf Possible Trends in Mathematics in the Coming Decades], Mikhael Gromov, Notices of the AMS, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; says that traditional probability theory applies where global structure such as the Gauss Law emerges when there is a lack of structure between individual data points, but that one of today's problems is to develop methods for analyzing [[Structured data analysis (statistics)|structured data]] where classical probability does not apply. Such methods might include advances in [[wavelet analysis]], [[multiscale geometric analysis|higher-dimensional methods]] and [[inverse scattering]].

===Control theory===

A list of grand challenges for [[control theory]] is outlined in "Future Directions in Control, Dynamics, and Systems: Overview, Grand Challenges, and New Courses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/preprints/mur03-ejc.pdf Future Directions in Control, Dynamics, and Systems: Overview, Grand Challenges, and New Courses], Richard M. Murray, European journal of control, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical logic===

[[Mathematical logic]] is discussed in "The Prospects For Mathematical Logic In The Twenty-First Century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0205003 The Prospects For Mathematical Logic In The Twenty-First Century], Samuel R. Buss, [[Alexander S. Kechris]], Anand Pillay, and Richard A. Shore, Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical biology===

[[Mathematical biology]] is one of the fastest expanding areas of mathematics at the beginning of the 21st century.  "Mathematics Is Biology's Next Microscope, Only Better; Biology Is Mathematics' Next Physics, Only Better"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020439 "Mathematics Is Biology's Next Microscope, Only Better; Biology Is Mathematics' Next Physics, Only Better"], Joel E. Cohen, PLoS Biol, 2004 – biology.plosjournals.org&lt;/ref&gt; is an essay by [[Joel E. Cohen]].

===Mathematical physics===

[[Mathematical physics]] is an enormous and diverse subject. Some indications of future research directions are given in "New Trends in Mathematical Physics: Selected Contributions of the XVth International Congress on Mathematical Physics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=whDbZL7MsxkC New Trends in Mathematical Physics: Selected Contributions of the XVth International Congress on Mathematical Physics], Editor Vladas Sidoravicius, Springer, 2009, {{ISBN|978-90-481-2809-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George William Hart''' (born 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/94039139 |title=LCCN Permalink for 94039139 |work=[[Library of Congress]] Online Catalog |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] [[list of geometers|geometer]] who expresses himself both artistically and academically. He is also an interdepartmental research professor at the [[State University of New York]] in [[Stony Brook, New York]].

His artistic work includes sculpture, computer images, toys (e.g. [[Zome]]) and puzzles.  His sculptures have been featured in articles in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="cite"&gt; [http://www.georgehart.com/cite/cite.html George W. Hart in the News]. Consulted on April 5, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.georgehart.com/cite/Games1-readable.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Science News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.georgehart.com/cite/Ivars-Peterson.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science (magazine)|''Science'']],&lt;ref name="cite"/&gt; ''[[Tiede]]''&lt;ref name="cite"/&gt; (Finnish), [http://www.arsetmathesis.nl/ ''Ars et Mathesis''] (Dutch), ''[[Nauka i Zhizn|Наука и жизнь]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/17807/|title=IPP-29.

His academic work includes the online publication [http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/vp.html Encyclopedia of Polyhedra], the textbook ''Multidimensional Analysis'', and the instruction book ''Zome Geometry''.  He has also published over sixty academic articles.

Hart is a co-founder of North America's only Museum of Mathematics, [[Museum of Mathematics|MoMath]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;G. Hart et al., ''Forming a Museum of Mathematics'', in Science Exhibitions: Communication and Evaluation, {{ISBN|978-0-9561943-8-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As chief of content, he set the "Math is Cool!" tone of the museum and spent five years designing original exhibits and workshop activities for it.  

Hart is a coinventor on two US [[patent]]s, {{US patent|4672555}} ''Digital ac monitor'' and {{US patent|4858141}} ''Non-intrusive appliance monitor apparatus''. These patents cover, in part, an improved electrical meter for homes called [[Nonintrusive load monitoring|nonintrusive load monitors]].  These meters track changes in voltage and current usage by a given household and then deduce which appliances are using how much electricity and when.

Hart received a B.S. in Mathematics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (1977), an M.A. in [[Linguistics]] from [[Indiana University]] (1979), and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT (1987).

==Incompatible Food Triad==
The Incompatible Food Triad is a [[puzzle]] to find three foods for which any pair will taste good together, but all three together will not. The puzzle is believed to have originated with the [[philosopher]] [[Wilfrid Sellars]], and has been spread by some of his former colleagues and students, including [[Nuel Belnap]] and George W. Hart. The puzzle was also featured on WNYC's ''[[The Brian Lehrer Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt; The More the Merrier  ''The Brian Lehrer Show'' (Scott Page guest) April 5, 2007 WNYC [http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/episodes/2007/04/05#segment76688]&lt;/ref&gt;

===False solutions===
Given three foods that do not go together, it is usually because two of them don't go together. For example, [[Richard Feynman]]'s famous example of accidentally requesting milk and lemon in his tea is not a solution. While tea and lemon ''do'' go together, and tea and milk ''do'' go together, milk and lemon do ''not'' go together. For this solution to work, milk and lemon would have to go together as well.

According to Hart, most attempted solutions tend to overlook one of the three pairs. Issues of personal taste and preparation complicate the issue, as combinations some consider acceptable sound unpalatable to others, and problems such as milk curdling with the addition of lemon juice can potentially be overcome if a [[Cheesemaker|cheesemaking]] process is employed.

===Possible solutions===
In a posting on its website after the puzzle was aired on the WNYC radio show in New York; Beer, [[7Up]], and Whiskey was given as a solution with the statement that beer with 7Up makes [[shandy]], beer with whiskey makes a [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermaker]] and whiskey with 7Up is a [[7 &amp; 7]], but the three together would "make you sick". Other possible solutions from viewers included:
* pie crust, raspberries and spinach
*chocolate, peanut butter and chicken&lt;ref&gt;PUZZLES!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15836">In mathematics, the notion of a '''germ''' of an object in/on a [[topological space]] is an [[equivalence class]] of that object and others of the same kind which captures their shared local properties. In particular, the objects in question are mostly functions (or [[Map (mathematics)|maps]]) and subsets. In specific implementations of this idea, the sets or maps in question will have some property, such as being analytic or smooth, but in general this is not needed (the maps or functions in question need not even be continuous); it is however necessary that the space on/in which the object is defined is a topological space, in order that the word ''local'' have some sense.

The name is derived from ''[[cereal germ]]'' in a continuation of the [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] metaphor, as a germ is (locally) the "heart" of a function, as it is for a grain.

==Formal definition==

===Basic definition===

Given a point ''x'' of a topological space X, and two maps &lt;math&gt;f, g : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; (where ''Y'' is any set), then  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; define the same germ at ''x'' if there is a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that restricted to ''U'', ''f'' and ''g'' are equal; meaning that &lt;math&gt;f(u)=g(u)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''u'' in ''U''.

Similarly, if ''S'' and ''T'' are any two subsets of X, then they define the same germ at ''x'' if there is again a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;S \cap U = T \cap U \neq \emptyset.&lt;/math&gt;

It is straightforward to see that ''defining the same germ'' at ''x'' is an [[equivalence relation]] (be it on maps or sets), and the equivalence classes are called germs (map-germs, or set-germs accordingly). The equivalence relation is usually written

:&lt;math&gt;f \sim_x g \quad \text{or} \quad S \sim_x T.&lt;/math&gt;

Given a map ''f'' on ''X'', then its germ at ''x'' is usually denoted [''f''&amp;thinsp;]&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, the germ at ''x'' of a set ''S'' is written [''S'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;[f]_x = \{g:X\to Y \mid g \sim_x f\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A map germ at ''x'' in ''X'' which maps the point ''x'' in ''X'' to the point ''y'' in ''Y'' is denoted as

:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,x) \to (Y,y).&lt;/math&gt; 

When using this notation, ''f'' is then intended as an entire equivalence class of maps, using the same letter ''f'' for any representative map.

Notice that two sets are germ-equivalent at ''x'' if and only if their [[indicator function|characteristic function]]s are germ-equivalent at ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;S\sim_x T \Longleftrightarrow \mathbf{1}_S \sim_x \mathbf{1}_T.&lt;/math&gt;

===More generally===
Maps need not be defined on all of ''X'', and in particular they don't need to have the same domain. However, if ''f'' has domain ''S'' and ''g'' has domain ''T'', both subsets of ''X'', then ''f'' and ''g'' are germ equivalent at ''x'' in ''X'' if first ''S'' and ''T'' are germ equivalent at ''x'', say &lt;math&gt;S \cap U = T\cap U \neq \emptyset,&lt;/math&gt; and then moreover &lt;math&gt;f|_{S\cap V} = g|_{T\cap V}&lt;/math&gt;, for some smaller neighbourhood ''V'' with &lt;math&gt;x\in V \subset U&lt;/math&gt;. This is particularly relevant in two settings: 
# ''f'' is defined on a subvariety ''V'' of ''X'', and 
# ''f'' has a pole of some sort at ''x'', so is not even defined at ''x'', as for example a rational function, which would be defined ''off'' a subvariety.

===Basic properties===
If ''f'' and ''g'' are germ equivalent at ''x'', then they share all local properties, such as continuity, differentiability etc., so it makes sense to talk about a ''differentiable or analytic germ'', etc. Similarly for subsets: if one representative of a germ is an analytic set then so are all representatives, at least on some neighbourhood of ''x''.

Algebraic structures on the target ''Y'' are inherited by the set of germs with values in ''Y''.  For instance, if the target ''Y'' is a [[group (mathematics)]], then it makes sense to multiply germs: to define [''f'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;[''g'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, first take representatives ''f'' and ''g'', defined on neighbourhoods ''U'' and ''V'' respectively, and define [''f'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;[''g'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the germ at ''x'' of the map ''fg'' (which is defined on &lt;math&gt;U\cap V&lt;/math&gt;).  In the same way, if ''Y'' is an abelian group, vector space, or ring, then so is the set of germs.

The set of germs at ''x'' of maps from ''X'' to ''Y'' does not have a useful topology, except for the discrete one. It therefore makes little or no sense to talk of a convergent sequence of germs. However, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are manifolds, then the spaces of [[Jet (mathematics)|jets]] &lt;math&gt;J_x^k(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; (finite order Taylor series at ''x'' of map(-germs)) do have topologies as they can be identified with finite-dimensional vector spaces.

==Relation with sheaves==
The idea of germ is behind the definition of sheaves and presheaves. A [[Sheaf (mathematics)|presheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of [[abelian group]]s on a topological space ''X'' assigns an abelian group &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; to each open set ''U'' in ''X''. Typical examples of abelian groups here are: real valued functions on ''U'', differential forms on ''U'', vector fields on ''U'', holomorphic functions on ''U'' (when ''X'' is a complex space), constant functions on ''U'' and differential operators on ''U''.

If &lt;math&gt;V \subset U&lt;/math&gt; then there is a restriction map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{res}_{VU}:\mathcal{F}(U)\to \mathcal{F}(V),&lt;/math&gt; satisfying certain [[Sheaf (mathematics)#Presheaves|compatibility conditions]]. For a fixed ''x'', one says that elements &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathcal{F}(V)&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent at ''x'' if there is a neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;W\subset U\cap V&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' with res&lt;sub&gt;''WU''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') = res&lt;sub&gt;''WV''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') (both elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(W)&lt;/math&gt;). The equivalence classes form the [[Stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_x&lt;/math&gt; at ''x'' of the presheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. This equivalence relation is an abstraction of the germ equivalence described above.

Interpreting germs through sheaves also gives a general explanation for the presence of algebraic structures on sets of germs. The reason is because formation of stalks preserves finite limits.  This implies that if ''T'' is a [[Lawvere theory]] and a sheaf ''F'' is a ''T''-algebra, then any stalk ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a ''T''-algebra.

== Examples ==
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; have additional structure, it is possible to define subsets of the set of all maps from ''X'' to ''Y'' or more generally sub-[[presheaf|presheaves]] of a given [[presheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and corresponding germs: ''some notable examples follow''.

*If &lt;math&gt;X, Y&lt;/math&gt; are both [[topological spaces]], the subset 
::&lt;math&gt;C^0(X,Y) \subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of [[continuous function]]s defines '''germs of continuous functions'''.

*If both &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; admit a [[differentiable structure]], the [[subset]] 
::&lt;math&gt;C^k(X,Y) \subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-times continuously [[differentiable function]]s, the [[subset]] 
::&lt;math&gt;C^\infty(X,Y)=\bigcap\nolimits_k C^k(X,Y)\subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of [[smooth function]]s and the [[subset]] 
::&lt;math&gt;C^\omega(X,Y)\subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of [[analytic function]]s can be defined (&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; here is the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] for infinity; this is an [[abuse of notation]], by analogy with &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;), and then spaces of '''germs of (finitely) differentiable''', '''smooth''', '''analytic functions''' can be constructed.

*If &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; have a complex structure (for instance, are [[subsets]] of [[vector space|complex vector spaces]]), [[holomorphic function]]s between them can be defined, and therefore spaces of '''germs of holomorphic functions''' can be constructed.

*If &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; have an [[algebraic structure]], then [[Regular function|regular]] (and [[rational function|rational]]) functions between them can be defined, and '''germs of regular functions''' (and likewise '''rational''') can be defined.

*The germ of ''f'':ℝ→''Y'' at positive infinity (or simply the germ of ''f'') is &lt;math&gt;\{g: \exists x \forall y &gt; x \, f(y) = g(y)\}&lt;/math&gt;.  These germs are used in [[asymptotic analysis]] and [[Hardy field]]s.

=== Notation ===
The [[Stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] of a sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; on a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_x.&lt;/math&gt; As a consequence germs, being stalks of sheaves of various kind of functions, borrow this scheme of notation:
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^0&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of continuous functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^k&lt;/math&gt; for each [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-times-differentiable functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of infinitely differentiable ("smooth") functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of analytic functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of holomorphic functions'' (in complex geometry), or ''space of germs of regular functions'' (in algebraic geometry) at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

For germs of sets and varieties, the notation is not so well established: some notations found in literature include:

*&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{V}_x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of analytic varieties'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. When the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and known (e.g. when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological vector space]] and &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;), it can be dropped in each of the above symbols: also, when &lt;math&gt;\dim X=n&lt;/math&gt;, a subscript before the symbol can be added. As example
*&lt;math&gt;{_n\mathcal{C}^0}, {_n\mathcal{C}^k}, {_n\mathcal{C}^\infty}, {_n\mathcal{C}^\omega}, {_n\mathcal{O}}, {_n\mathfrak{V}}&lt;/math&gt; are the spaces of germs shown above when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[vector space]] and &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
The key word in the applications of germs is '''locality''': ''all [[Local property|local properties]] of a function at a point can be studied by analyzing its germ''. They are a generalization of [[Taylor series]], and indeed the Taylor series of a germ (of a differentiable function) is defined: you only need local information to compute derivatives.

Germs are useful in determining the properties of [[Dynamical system (definition)|dynamical systems]] near chosen points of their [[phase space]]: they are one of the main tools in [[singularity theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]].

When the topological spaces considered are [[Riemann surface]]s or more generally [[analytic variety|analytic varieties]], germs of [[holomorphic functions]] on them can be viewed as [[power series]], and thus the set of germs can be considered to be the [[analytic continuation]] of an [[analytic function]].

== Algebraic properties ==
As noted earlier, sets of germs may have algebraic structures such as being rings. In many situations, rings of germs are not arbitrary rings but instead have quite specific properties.

Suppose that ''X'' is a space of some sort. It is often the case that, at each ''x'' ∈ ''X'', the ring of germs of functions at ''x'' is a [[local ring]]. This is the case, for example, for continuous functions on a topological space; for ''k'' times differentiable, smooth, or analytic functions on a real manifold (when such functions are defined); for holomorphic functions on complex manifold; and for regular functions on an algebraic variety.  The property that rings of germs are local rings is axiomatized by the theory of [[locally ringed space]]s.

The types of local rings that arise, however, depend closely on the theory under consideration.  The [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]] implies that rings of germs of holomorphic functions are [[Noetherian ring]]s.  It can also be shown that these are [[regular ring]]s.  On the other hand, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0^\infty(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of germs at the origin of smooth functions on '''R'''.  This ring is local but not Noetherian.  To see why, observe that the maximal ideal ''m'' of this ring consists of all germs which vanish at the origin, and the power ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; consists of those germs whose first ''k'' &amp;minus; 1 derivatives vanish.  If this ring were Noetherian, then the [[Krull intersection theorem]] would imply that a smooth function whose Taylor series vanished would be the zero function.  But this is false, as can be seen by considering
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
e^{-1/x^2}, &amp;x \neq 0, \\
0, &amp;x = 0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
This ring is also not a [[unique factorization domain]].  This is because all UFDs satisfy the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]], but there is an infinite ascending chain of principal ideals
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \subsetneq (x^{-j+1} f(x)) \subsetneq (x^{-j} f(x)) \subsetneq (x^{-j-1} f(x)) \subsetneq \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
The inclusions are strict because ''x'' is in the maximal ideal ''m''.

The ring &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0^0(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; of germs at the origin of continuous functions on '''R''' even has the property that its maximal ideal ''m'' satisfies ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''m''.  Any germ ''f'' ∈ ''m'' can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;f = |f|^{1/2} \cdot \big(\operatorname{sgn}(f)|f|^{1/2}\big),&lt;/math&gt;
where sgn is the sign function.  Since |''f''| vanishes at the origin, this expresses ''f'' as the product of two functions in ''m'', whence the conclusion.  This is related to the setup of [[almost ring|almost ring theory]].

[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]

The system of '''hyperreal numbers''' is a way of treating [[Infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] quantities.  The hyperreals, or '''nonstandard reals''', *'''R''', are an [[Field extension|extension]] of the [[real number]]s '''R''' that contains numbers greater than anything of the form

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 &lt;/math&gt; (for any finite number of terms).

Such numbers are infinite, and their [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s are [[infinitesimal]]s.  The term "hyper-real" was introduced by [[Edwin Hewitt]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1948), p.&amp;nbsp;74, as reported in Keisler (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The hyperreal numbers satisfy the [[transfer principle]], a rigorous version of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] heuristic [[Law of Continuity]].  The transfer principle states that true [[first-order logic|first order]] statements about '''R''' are also valid in *'''R'''. For example, the commutative law of addition, ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'', holds for the hyperreals just as it does for the reals; since '''R''' is a [[real closed field]], so is *'''R'''.  Since &lt;math&gt;\sin({\pi n})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all integers ''n'', one also has &lt;math&gt;\sin({\pi H})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all [[hyperinteger]]s ''H''.  The transfer principle for [[ultrapower]]s is a consequence of [[Łoś' theorem]] of 1955.

Concerns about the [[soundness]] of arguments involving infinitesimals date back to ancient Greek mathematics, with [[Archimedes]] replacing such proofs with ones using other techniques such as the [[method of exhaustion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] proved that the hyperreals were logically consistent if and only if the reals were. This put to rest the fear that any proof involving infinitesimals might be unsound, provided that they were manipulated according to the logical rules that Robinson delineated.

The application of hyperreal numbers and in particular the transfer principle to problems of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] is called [[non-standard analysis]]. One immediate application is the definition of the basic concepts of analysis such as derivative and integral in a direct fashion, without passing via logical complications of multiple quantifiers.  Thus, the derivative of ''f(x)'' becomes &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = {\rm st}\left( \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} \right)&lt;/math&gt; for an infinitesimal &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, where ''st(&amp;middot;)'' denotes the [[standard part function]], which "rounds off" each finite hyperreal to the nearest real.  Similarly, the integral is defined as the standard part of a suitable infinite sum.

==The transfer principle==
{{Main|Transfer principle}}
The idea of the hyperreal system is to extend the real numbers '''R''' to form a system *'''R''' that includes infinitesimal and infinite numbers, but without changing any of the elementary axioms of algebra. Any statement of the form "for any number x..." that is true for the reals is also true for the hyperreals. For example, the axiom that states "for any number ''x'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" still applies. The same is true for [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over several numbers, e.g., "for any numbers ''x'' and ''y'', ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''yx''." This ability to carry over statements from the reals to the hyperreals is called the [[transfer principle]]. However, statements of the form "for any ''set'' of numbers S ..." may not carry over. The only properties that differ between the reals and the hyperreals are those that rely on quantification over sets, or other higher-level structures such as functions and relations, which are typically constructed out of sets. Each real set, function, and relation has its natural hyperreal extension, satisfying the same first-order properties.  The kinds of logical sentences that obey this restriction on quantification are referred to as statements in [[first-order logic]].

The transfer principle, however, doesn't mean that '''R''' and *'''R''' have identical behavior. For instance, in *'''R''' there exists an element ''&amp;omega;'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1&lt;\omega, \quad 1+1+1+1&lt;\omega, \ldots. &lt;/math&gt;

but there is no such number in '''R'''. (In other words, *'''R''' is not [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]].) This is possible because the nonexistence of ''&amp;omega;'' cannot be expressed as a first order statement.

==Use in analysis==

===Calculus with algebraic functions===
Informal notations for non-real quantities have historically appeared in calculus in two contexts: as infinitesimals like ''dx'' and as the symbol ∞, used, for example, in limits of integration of [[improper integrals]].

As an example of the transfer principle, the statement that for any nonzero number ''x'', ''2x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'', is true for the real numbers, and it is in the form required by the transfer principle, so it is also true for the hyperreal numbers. This shows that it is not possible to use a generic symbol such as ∞ for all the infinite quantities in the hyperreal system; infinite quantities differ in magnitude from other infinite quantities, and infinitesimals from other infinitesimals.

Similarly, the casual use of 1/0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ is invalid, since the transfer principle applies to the statement that division by zero is undefined. The rigorous counterpart of such a calculation would be that if ε is a non-zero infinitesimal, then 1/ε is infinite.

For any finite hyperreal number ''x'', its [[standard part]], st ''x'', is defined as the unique real number that differs from it only infinitesimally. The derivative of a function ''y''(''x'') is defined not as ''dy/dx'' but as the standard part of ''dy/dx''.

For example, to find the [[derivative]] ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') of the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''dx'' be a non-zero infinitesimal. Then,

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{f(x + dx) - f(x)}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{x^2 + 2x \cdot dx + (dx)^2 -x^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{2x \cdot dx +  (dx)^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(\frac{2x \cdot dx}{dx} + \frac{(dx)^2}{dx}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\operatorname{st}\left(2x + dx\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=2x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The use of the standard part in the definition of the derivative is a rigorous alternative to the traditional practice of neglecting the square {{Citation needed|reason=if dx got to zero in limit then dx square go there too and doing this faster, this is rigorous|date=February 2018}} of an infinitesimal quantity. [[Dual number]]s are a number system based this idea. After the third line of the differentiation above, the typical method from Newton through the 19th century would have been simply to discard the ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term. In the hyperreal system,
''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, since ''dx'' is nonzero, and the transfer principle can be applied to the statement that the square of any nonzero number is nonzero. However, the quantity ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  is infinitesimally small compared to ''dx''; that is, the hyperreal system contains a hierarchy of infinitesimal quantities.

===Integration===
One way of defining a definite integral in the hyperreal system is as the standard part of an infinite sum on a hyperfinite lattice defined as ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;dx'',&amp;nbsp;''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2dx'', ... ''a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ndx'', where ''dx'' is infinitesimal, n is an infinite [[hypernatural]], and the lower and upper bounds of integration are ''a'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;''dx.''&lt;ref&gt;Keisler&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The hyperreals *'''R''' form an [[ordered field]] containing the reals '''R''' as a subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a standard [[metric space]], but by virtue of their order they carry an [[order topology]].

The use of the definite article ''the'' in the phrase ''the hyperreal numbers'' is somewhat misleading in that there is not a unique ordered field that is referred to in most treatments.
However, a 2003 paper by [[Vladimir Kanovei]] and [[Saharon Shelah]]&lt;ref name=kanovei2003&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kanovei|first1=Vladimir| last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon| title=A definable nonstandard model of the reals| url=http://shelah.logic.at/files/825.pdf| journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=69|year=2004| pages=159–164 | doi=10.2178/jsl/1080938834|arxiv=math/0311165}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that there is a definable, countably [[saturated model|saturated]] (meaning [[ω-saturated]], but not, of course, countable) [[elementary substructure|elementary extension]] of the reals, which therefore has a good claim to the title of ''the'' hyperreal numbers.  Furthermore, the field obtained by the ultrapower construction from the space of all real sequences, is unique up to isomorphism if one assumes the [[continuum hypothesis]].

The condition of being a hyperreal field is a stronger one than that of being a [[real closed field]] strictly containing '''R'''. It is also stronger than that of being a [[superreal field]] in the sense of Dales and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Woodin | first1=W. H. | last2=Dales | first2=H. G. | title=Super-real fields: totally ordered fields with additional structure | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=978-0-19-853991-9 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The hyperreals can be developed either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence of at least one infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an [[ultrafilter]], but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed.

===From Leibniz to Robinson===
When [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and (more explicitly) [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced differentials, they used infinitesimals and these were still regarded as useful by later mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]. Nonetheless these concepts were from the beginning seen as suspect, notably by [[George Berkeley]].  Berkeley's criticism centered on a perceived shift in hypothesis in the definition of the derivative in terms of infinitesimals (or fluxions), where ''dx'' is assumed to be nonzero at the beginning of the calculation, and to vanish at its conclusion (see [[Ghosts of departed quantities]] for details).  When in the 1800s [[calculus]] was put on a firm footing through the development of the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]] by [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]], Cauchy, [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], and others, infinitesimals were largely abandoned, though research in [[non-Archimedean field]]s continued (Ehrlich 2006).

However, in the 1960s [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of [[non-standard analysis]].&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{Citation | last1=Robinson | first1=Abraham | author1-link=Abraham Robinson | title=Non-standard analysis | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | isbn=978-0-691-04490-3 | year=1996}}. The classic introduction to nonstandard analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson developed his theory [[Constructive_proof#Non-constructive_proofs|nonconstructively]], using [[model theory]]; however it is possible to proceed using only [[algebra]] and [[topology]], and proving the transfer principle as a consequence of the definitions. In other words hyperreal numbers ''per se'', aside from their use in nonstandard analysis, have no necessary relationship to model theory or first order logic, although they were discovered by the application of model theoretic techniques from logic.  Hyper-real fields were in fact originally introduced by Hewitt (1948) by purely algebraic techniques, using an ultrapower construction.

===The ultrapower construction===

We are going to construct a hyperreal field via [[sequence]]s of reals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Loeb | first1=Peter A. | title=Nonstandard analysis for the working mathematician | publisher=Kluwer Acad. Publ. | location=Dordrecht | series=Math. Appl. | year=2000 | volume=510 | chapter=An introduction to nonstandard analysis | pages=1–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact we can add and multiply sequences componentwise; for example:

:&lt;math&gt; (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots) + (b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots) = (a_0 +b_0, a_1+b_1, a_2+b_2, \ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

and analogously for multiplication.
This turns the set of such sequences into a [[commutative ring]], which is in fact a real [[algebra over a field|algebra]] '''A'''. We have a natural embedding of '''R''' in '''A''' by identifying the real number ''r'' with the sequence (''r'', ''r'', ''r'', …) and this identification preserves the corresponding algebraic operations of the reals. The intuitive motivation is, for example, to represent an infinitesimal number using a sequence that approaches zero. The inverse of such a sequence would represent an infinite number. As we will see below, the difficulties arise because of the need to define rules for comparing such sequences in a manner that, although inevitably somewhat arbitrary, must be self-consistent and well defined. For example, we may have two sequences that differ in their first ''n'' members, but are equal after that; such sequences should clearly be considered as representing the same hyperreal number. Similarly, most sequences oscillate randomly forever, and we must find some way of taking such a sequence and interpreting it as, say, &lt;math&gt;7+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a certain infinitesimal number.

Comparing sequences is thus a delicate matter. We could, for example, try to define a relation between sequences in a componentwise fashion:

:&lt;math&gt; (a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots) \leq (b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots) \iff  (a_0 \leq b_0) \wedge (a_1 \leq b_1) \wedge (a_2 \leq b_2) \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

but here we run into trouble, since some entries of the first sequence may be bigger than the corresponding entries of the second sequence, and some others may be smaller.   It follows that the relation defined in this way is only a [[partial order]].  To get around this, we have to specify which positions matter. Since there are infinitely many indices, we don't want finite sets of indices to matter. A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free [[ultrafilter]] ''U'' on the [[natural number]]s; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets. (The good news is that [[Zorn's lemma]] guarantees the existence of many such ''U''; the bad news is that they cannot be explicitly constructed.) We think of ''U'' as singling out those sets of indices that "matter": We write (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) ≤ (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...) if and only if the set of natural numbers { ''n'' : ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; } is in ''U''.

This is a [[total preorder]] and it turns into a [[total order]] if we agree not to distinguish between two sequences ''a'' and ''b'' if ''a''≤''b'' and ''b''≤''a''. With this identification, the ordered field '''*R''' of hyperreals is constructed. From an algebraic point of view, ''U'' allows us to define a corresponding [[ideal (ring theory)|maximal ideal]] '''I''' in the commutative ring '''A''' (namely, the set of the sequences that vanish in some element of ''U''), and then to define '''*R''' as '''A'''/'''I'''; as the quotient of a commutative ring by a maximal ideal, '''*R''' is a field. This is also notated '''A'''/''U'', directly in terms of the free ultrafilter ''U''; the two are equivalent. The maximality of '''I''' follows from the possibility of, given a sequence ''a'', constructing a sequence ''b'' inverting the non-null elements of ''a'' and not altering its null entries. If the set on which ''a'' vanishes is not in ''U'', the product ''ab'' is identified with the number 1, and any ideal containing 1 must be ''A''. In the resulting field, these ''a'' and ''b'' are inverses.

The field '''A'''/''U'' is an [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] of '''R'''.
Since this field contains '''R''' it has cardinality at least that of the continuum. Since '''A''' has cardinality

:&lt;math&gt;(2^{\aleph_0})^{\aleph_0} = 2^{\aleph_0^2} =2^{\aleph_0},&lt;/math&gt;

it is also no larger than &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and hence has the same cardinality as '''R'''.

One question we might ask is whether, if we had chosen a different free ultrafilter ''V'', the quotient field '''A'''/''U'' would be isomorphic as an ordered field to '''A'''/''V''. This question turns out to be equivalent to the [[continuum hypothesis]]; in [[ZFC]] with the continuum hypothesis we can prove this field is unique up to [[order isomorphism]], and in ZFC with the negation of continuum hypothesis we can prove that there are non-order-isomorphic pairs of fields that are both countably indexed ultrapowers of the reals.

For more information about this method of construction, see [[ultraproduct]].

===An intuitive approach to the ultrapower construction===

The following is an intuitive way of understanding the hyperreal numbers. The approach taken here is very close to the one in the book by Goldblatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Goldblatt | first1=Robert | title=Lectures on the hyperreals: an introduction to nonstandard analysis | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-98464-3 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that the sequences converging to zero are sometimes called infinitely small. These are almost the infinitesimals in a sense; the true infinitesimals include certain classes of sequences that contain a sequence converging to zero.

Let us see where these classes come from. Consider first the sequences of real numbers. They form a [[ring (abstract algebra)|ring]], that is, one can multiply, add and subtract them, but not always divide by a non-zero element. The real numbers are considered as the constant sequences, the sequence is zero if it is identically zero, that is,  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n''.

In our ring of sequences one can get ''ab''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 with neither ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 nor ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Thus, if for two sequences &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; one has ''ab''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, at least one of them should be declared zero. Surprisingly enough, there is a consistent way to do it. As a result, the equivalence classes of sequences that differ by some sequence declared zero will form a field, which is called a hyperreal [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It will contain the infinitesimals in addition to the ordinary real numbers, as well as infinitely large numbers (the reciprocals of infinitesimals, including those represented by sequences diverging to infinity). Also every  hyperreal that is not infinitely large will be infinitely close to an ordinary real, in other words, it will be the sum of an ordinary real and an infinitesimal.

This construction is parallel to the construction of the reals from the rationals given by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]. He started with the ring of the [[Cauchy sequence]]s of rationals and declared all the sequences that converge to zero to be zero. The result is the reals. To continue the construction of hyperreals, let us consider the zero sets of our sequences, that is, the &lt;math&gt;z(a)=\{i: a_i=0\}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of indexes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;a_i=0&lt;/math&gt;. It is clear that if &lt;math&gt;ab=0&lt;/math&gt;, then the union of &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z(b)&lt;/math&gt; is ''N'' (the set of all natural numbers), so:
#One of the sequences that vanish on two complementary sets should be declared zero
#If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is declared zero, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; should be declared zero too, no matter what &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is.
#If both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are declared zero, then &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; should also be declared zero.
Now the idea is to single out a bunch ''U'' of subsets ''X'' of ''N'' and to declare that  &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;z(a)&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''U''.  From the above conditions one can see that:
#From two complementary sets one belongs to ''U''
#Any set having a subset that belongs to ''U'', also belongs to ''U''.
#An intersection of any two sets belonging to ''U'' belongs to ''U''.
#Finally, we do not want the empty set to belong to ''U'' because then everything would belong to ''U'', as every set has the empty set as a subset.

Any family of sets that satisfies (2–4) is called a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] (an example: the complements to the finite sets, it is called the [[Fréchet filter]] and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an [[ultrafilter]] (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the family of sets containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the [[axiom of choice]]. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the [[ultrafilter lemma]]) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.

Now if we take a nontrivial ultrafilter (which is an extension of the Fréchet filter) and do our construction, we get the hyperreal numbers as a result.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a real function of a real variable  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; naturally extends to a hyperreal function of a hyperreal variable by composition:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\{x_n\})=\{f(x_n)\}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\{ \dots\}&lt;/math&gt; means "the equivalence class of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; relative to our ultrafilter", two sequences being in the same class if and only if the zero set of their difference belongs to our ultrafilter.

All the arithmetical expressions and formulas make sense for hyperreals and hold true if they are true for the ordinary reals. It turns out that any finite (that is, such that &lt;math&gt;|x| &lt; a&lt;/math&gt; for some ordinary real &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) hyperreal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will be of the form &lt;math&gt;y+d&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinary (called standard) real and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal. It can be proven by bisection method used in proving the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, the property (1) of ultrafilters turns out to be crucial.
Now one can see that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous means that &lt;math&gt;f(a)-f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely small whenever &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt;  is, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable means that
:&lt;math&gt;(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)-f'(a)&lt;/math&gt;
is infinitely small whenever &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is. Remarkably, if one allows &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to be hyperreal, the derivative will be automatically continuous (because, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  being differentiable at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)-(f(x)-f(a))/(x-a)=f'(x)-(f(a)-f(x))/(a-x)&lt;/math&gt;
is infinitely small when &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is, therefore &lt;math&gt;f'(x)-f'(a)&lt;/math&gt; is also infinitely small when &lt;math&gt;x-a&lt;/math&gt; is).

==Properties of infinitesimal and infinite numbers==

The finite elements '''F''' of '''*R''' form a [[local ring]], and in fact a [[valuation ring]], with the unique maximal ideal '''S''' being the infinitesimals; the quotient '''F'''/'''S''' is isomorphic to the reals. Hence we have a [[ring homomorphism|homomorphic]] mapping, st(''x''), from '''F''' to '''R''' whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] consists of the infinitesimals and which sends every element ''x'' of '''F''' to a unique real number whose difference from x is in '''S'''; which is to say, is infinitesimal. Put another way, every ''finite'' nonstandard real number is "very close" to a unique real number, in the sense that if ''x'' is a finite nonstandard real, then there exists one and only one real number st(''x'') such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;st(''x'') is infinitesimal. This number st(''x'') is called the [[standard part function|standard part]] of ''x'', conceptually the same as ''x'' ''to the nearest real number''. This operation is an order-preserving homomorphism and hence is well-behaved both algebraically and order theoretically. It is order-preserving though not isotonic; i.e. &lt;math&gt; x \le y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{st}(x) \le \operatorname{st}(y)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y &lt;/math&gt; does not imply &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{st}(x) &lt; \operatorname{st}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

* We have, if both ''x'' and ''y'' are finite,
::&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x + y) = \operatorname{st}(x) + \operatorname{st}(y)  &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x y) = \operatorname{st}(x)  \operatorname{st}(y)  &lt;/math&gt;
*  If ''x'' is finite and not infinitesimal.
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(1/x)  = 1 /  \operatorname{st}(x)  &lt;/math&gt;
* ''x'' is real if and only if
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{st}(x) = x &lt;/math&gt;
The map st is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the order topology on the finite hyperreals; in fact it is [[locally constant function|locally constant]].

==Hyperreal fields==
Suppose ''X'' is a [[Tychonoff space]], also called a T&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt; space, and C(''X'') is the algebra of continuous real-valued functions on ''X''. Suppose M is a [[prime ideal|maximal ideal]] in C(''X''). Then the [[factor ring|factor algebra]] A = C(''X'')/M is a totally ordered field F containing the reals. If F strictly contains '''R''' then M is called a '''hyperreal ideal''' (terminology due to [[Edwin Hewitt|Hewitt]] (1948)) and F a '''hyperreal field'''. Note that no assumption is being made that the cardinality of F is greater than '''R'''; it can in fact have the same cardinality.

An important special case is where the topology on ''X'' is the [[Discrete space|discrete topology]]; in this case ''X'' can be identified with a [[cardinal number]] κ and C(''X'') with the real algebra &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{R}^\kappa&lt;/math&gt; of functions from κ to '''R'''. The hyperreal fields we obtain in this case are called [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]]s of '''R''' and are identical to the ultrapowers constructed via free [[ultrafilter]]s in model theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9627">In [[mathematics]], for a [[sequence]] of complex numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... the '''infinite product'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 a_2 a_3 \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

is defined to be the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the [[Multiplication#Capital Pi notation|partial products]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n'' increases without bound.  The product is said to ''[[Limit of a sequence|converge]]'' when the limit exists and is not zero. Otherwise the product is said to ''diverge''.  A limit of zero is treated specially in order to obtain results analogous to those for [[Infinite series|infinite sums]]. Some sources allow convergence to 0 if there are only a finite number of zero factors and the product of the non-zero factors is non-zero, but for simplicity we will not allow that here. If the product converges, then the limit of the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n'' increases without bound must be 1, while the converse is in general not true.

The best known examples of infinite products are probably some of the formulae for [[pi|&amp;pi;]], such as the following two products, respectively by [[Viète]] ([[Viète's formula]], the first published infinite product in mathematics) and [[John Wallis]] ([[Wallis product]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\pi} = \frac{ \sqrt{2} }{ 2 } \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} }{ 2 } \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}} }{ 2 } \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2} =  \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{9} \cdot \cdots = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{ 4n^2 }{ 4n^2 - 1 } \right). &lt;/math&gt;

== Convergence criteria ==
The product of positive real numbers
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt;
converges to a nonzero real number if and only if the sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \log(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
converges. This allows the translation of convergence criteria for infinite sums into convergence criteria for infinite products. The same criterion applies to products of arbitrary complex numbers (including negative reals) if the logarithm is understood as a fixed [[Complex logarithm#Branches of the complex logarithm|branch of logarithm]] which satisfies ln(1) = 0, with the proviso that the infinite product diverges when infinitely many ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' fall outside the domain of ln, whereas finitely many such ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be ignored in the sum.

For products of reals in which each &lt;math&gt;a_n\ge1&lt;/math&gt;, written as, for instance, &lt;math&gt;a_n=1+p_n,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_n\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, the bounds

:&lt;math&gt;1+\sum_{n=1}^{N} p_n \le \prod_{n=1}^{N} \left( 1 + p_n \right) \le \exp \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N}p_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

show that the infinite product converges if the infinite sum of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges. This relies on the [[Monotone convergence theorem]]. We can show the converse by observing that, if &lt;math&gt;p_n \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, then 

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log(1+p_n)}{p_n} = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\log(1+x)}{x} = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and by the [[limit comparison test]] it follows that the two series 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \log(1+p_n) \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n=1}^\infty p_n,&lt;/math&gt;

are equivalent meaning that either they both converge or they both diverge.

The same proof also shows that if &lt;math&gt;a_n = 1 - q_n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;0\le q_n &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\prod_{n=1}^\infty (1-q_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges to a non-zero number if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty q_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.

If the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \log(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; diverges to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then the sequence of partial products of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to zero.  The infinite product is said to '''diverge to zero'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Methods of Mathematical Physics | series=Cambridge Mathematical Library | first1=Harold | last1=Jeffreys | author1-link=Harold Jeffreys | first2=Bertha Swirles | last2=Jeffreys | author2-link=Bertha Swirles | edition=3rd revised | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year= 1999 | isbn=1107393671 | page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product representations of functions==
{{main|Weierstrass factorization theorem}}

One important result concerning infinite products is that every [[entire function]] ''f''(''z'') (that is, every function that is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] over the entire [[complex number|complex plane]]) can be factored into an infinite product of entire functions, each with at most a single root.  In general, if ''f'' has a root of order ''m'' at the origin and has other complex roots at ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... (listed with multiplicities equal to their orders), then

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^m e^{\phi(z)} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z}{u_n} \right) \exp \left\lbrace \frac{z}{u_n} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{z}{u_n}\right)^2 + \cdots + \frac{1}{\lambda_n} \left(\frac{z}{u_n}\right)^{\lambda_n} \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative integers that can be chosen to make the product converge, and ''φ''(''z'') is some entire function (which means the term before the product will have no roots in the complex plane).  The above factorization is not unique, since it depends on the choice of values for ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  However, for most functions, there will be some minimum non-negative integer ''p'' such that ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p'' gives a convergent product, called the [[Weierstrass factorization theorem|canonical product representation]]. This ''p'' is called the ''rank'' of the canonical product. &lt;!-- The ''genus'' is the (is it max? or min?) of the degree of φ and ''p''. --&gt; In the event that ''p'' = 0, this takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^m e^{\phi(z)} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{z}{u_n}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be regarded as a generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], since for polynomials, the product becomes finite and ''φ''(''z'') is constant.

In addition to these examples, the following representations are of special note:

The last of these is not a product representation of the same sort discussed above, as ''ζ'' is not entire. Rather, the above product representation of ''ζ''(''z'') converges precisely for Re(''z'') &amp;gt; 1, where it is an analytic function. By techniques of [[analytic continuation]], this function can be extended uniquely to an analytic function (still denoted ''ζ''(''z'')) on the whole complex plane except at the point ''z'' = 1, where it has a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]].

The '''interquartile mean (IQM)''' (or '''midmean''') is a [[statistics|statistical]] measure of [[central tendency]] based on the [[truncated mean]] of the [[interquartile range]]. The IQM is very similar to the scoring method used in sports that are evaluated by a panel of judges: ''discard the lowest and the highest scores; calculate the mean value of the remaining scores''.

==Calculation==
In calculation of the IQM, only the data in the second and third [[Quartile|quartiles]] is used (as in the [[interquartile range]]), and the lowest 25% and the highest 25% of the scores are discarded. These points are called the first and third [[quartile]]s, &lt;!-- see talk page --&gt; hence the name of the IQM. (Note that the ''second'' quartile is also called the [[median]]).

:&lt;math&gt; x_\mathrm{IQM} = {2 \over n} \sum_{i=\frac{n}{4}+1}^{\frac{3n}{4}}{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;
assuming the values have been ordered.

==Examples==

===Dataset size divisible by four===
The method is best explained with an example. Consider the following dataset:

:5, 8, 4, 38, 8, 6, 9, 7, 7, 3, 1, 6

First sort the list from lowest-to-highest:

:1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 38

There are 12 observations (datapoints) in the dataset, thus we have 4 quartiles of 3 numbers. Discard the lowest and the highest 3 values:

:&lt;s&gt;1, 3, 4&lt;/s&gt;, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, &lt;s&gt;8, 9, 38&lt;/s&gt;

We now have 6 of the 12 observations remaining; next, we calculate the arithmetic [[mean]] of these numbers:

:''x''&lt;sub&gt;IQM&lt;/sub&gt; = (5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8) / 6 = 6.5

This is the interquartile mean.

For comparison, the arithmetic mean of the original dataset is

:(5 + 8 + 4 + 38 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 6) / 12 = 8.5

due to the strong influence of the outlier, 38.

===Dataset size not divisible by four===
The above example consisted of 12 observations in the dataset, which made the determination of the quartiles very easy. Of course, not all datasets have a number of observations that is divisible by 4. We can adjust the method of calculating the IQM to accommodate this. So ideally we want to have the IQM equal to the [[mean]] for symmetric distributions, e.g.:

:1, 2, 3, 4, 5

has a mean value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, and since it is a symmetric distribution, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;IQM&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 would be desired.

We can solve this by using a [[weighted average]] of the quartiles and the interquartile dataset:

Consider the following dataset of 9 observations:

:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17

There are 9/4 = 2.25 observations in each quartile, and 4.5 observations in the interquartile range. Truncate the fractional quartile size, and remove this number from the 1st and 4th quartiles (2.25 observations in each quartile, thus the lowest 2 and the highest 2 are removed).

:&lt;s&gt;1, 3&lt;/s&gt;, (5), 7, 9, 11, (13), &lt;s&gt;15, 17&lt;/s&gt;

Thus, there are 3 ''full'' observations in the interquartile range, and 2 fractional observations. Since we have a total of 4.5 observations in the interquartile range, the two fractional observations each count for 0.75 (and thus 3×1 + 2×0.75 = 4.5 observations).

The IQM is now calculated as follows:

:''x''&lt;sub&gt;IQM&lt;/sub&gt; = {(7 + 9 + 11) + 0.75 &amp;times; (5 + 13)} / 4.5 = 9

In the above example, the mean has a value x&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; = 9. The same as the IQM, as was expected. The method of calculating the IQM for any number of observations is analogous; the fractional contributions to the IQM can be either 0, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75.

==Comparison with mean and median==
The interquartile mean shares some properties of both the [[mean]] and the [[median]]:

*Like the [[median]], the IQM is insensitive to [[outlier]]s; in the example given, the highest value (38) was an obvious outlier of the dataset, but its value is not used in the calculation of the IQM. On the other hand, the common average (the [[arithmetic mean]]) is sensitive to these outliers: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.5.
*Like the [[mean]], the IQM is a distinct parameter, based on a large number of observations from the dataset. The [[median]] is always equal to ''one'' of the observations in the dataset (assuming an odd number of observations). The mean can be equal to ''any'' value between the lowest and highest observation, depending on the value of ''all'' the other observations. The IQM can be equal to ''any'' value between the first and third quartiles, depending on ''all'' the observations in the interquartile range.

'''The Lee–Carter model''' is a numerical algorithm used in [[mortality forecasting]] and [[life expectancy]] [[forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2000/january/naaj0001_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The input to the model is a matrix of age specific [[mortality rates]] ordered monotonically by time, usually with ages in columns and years in rows.  The output is another forecasted matrix of mortality rates.

The model uses the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) to find a [[univariate]] [[time series]] vector "k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;" that captures 80–90% of the mortality trend (here the subscript "t" refers to time), a vector "b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;" that describes the amount of mortality change at a given age for a unit of yearly total mortality change (here the subscript "x" refers to age), and a scaling constant (referred to here as s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; but unnamed in the literature). Surprisingly, k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is usually linear, implying that gains to life expectancy are fairly constant year after year in most populations. Before being input to the SVD, age specific mortality rates are transformed into "a&lt;sub&gt;x,t&lt;/sub&gt;", by taking their [[logarithms]], and then [[centering]] them by subtracting their age-specific means (calculated over time).  (The subscript "x,t" refers to the fact that a&lt;sub&gt;x,t&lt;/sub&gt; spans both age and time.)  Many researchers adjust the k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; vector by fitting it to empirical life expectancies for each year, using the a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; just generated with the SVD; when adjusted using this approach, changes to k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are usually small.

To forecast mortality, the above k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (either adjusted or not) is projected into the future using [[ARIMA]] time series methods, the corresponding future a&lt;sub&gt;x,t+n&lt;/sub&gt; is recovered by multiplying k&lt;sub&gt;t+n&lt;/sub&gt; by b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and the appropriate diagonal element of S (when [U S V] = svd(mort)), and the actual  mortality rates are recovered by taking exponentials of this vector.  Because of the linearity of k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, it is generally modeled as a [[random walk]] with trend. Life expectancy and other [[life table]] measures can be calculated from this forecasted matrix after adding back the means and taking exponentials to yield regular mortality rates.

In most implementations, [[confidence intervals]] for the forecasts are generated by simulating multiple mortality forecasts using [[Monte-Carlo]] methods; a band of mortality between 5% and 95% percentiles of the simulated results is considered to be a valid forecast.  These simulations are done by extending k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; into the future using randomization based on the [[standard error]] of k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; derived from the input data.

In outline and [[Matlab]]-style pseudocode, the algorithm is as follows:

#
# Create a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; by taking [[logarithms]] of the mortality rates and centering the results with the average log mortality at a given age.
# Derive k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, a scaling eigenvalue, and b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; from  U(:,1), S(1,1), V(1,:), where [U S V] = svd(mort).
# Forecast k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; with standard univariate [[ARIMA]] methods.
# Use the forecast k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; with the original b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to calculate logged mortality rates for each forecast year.
# Recover regular mortality rates by calculating the exponential of the forecasted log mortality rates. 
#

Without applying SVD or some other method of [[dimension reduction]] the table of mortality data is a highly correlated multivariate data series; the complexity of these multidimensional time series makes such them almost impossible to forecast.  SVD has become widely used as a method of dimension reduction in many disparate fields, including by [[Google]] in their [[page rank]] algorithm.

The Lee–Carter model was introduced by [[Ronald D. Lee]] and Lawrence Carter in 1992 with the article "Modeling and Forecasting the Time Series of U.S. Mortality," (Journal of the American Statistical Association 87 (September): 659–671).&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/samclark/soc533/Syllabus/Readings/7/1/Lee-R-etal_1992_Modeling-Forecasting-US-Mortality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The model grew out of their work in the late 1980s and early 1990s attempting to use [[inverse projection]] to infer rates in [[historical demography]].&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/76b3712p&lt;/ref&gt; The model has been used by the United States [[Social Security Administration]], the US [[Census Bureau]], and the United Nations.  It has become the most widely used mortality forecasting technique in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;http://gking.harvard.edu/files/lc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been extensions to the Lee–Carter, most notably to account for missing years, correlated male and female populations, and large scale coherency in populations that share a mortality regime (western Europe, for example).  Many related papers can be found on [http://www.ceda.berkeley.edu/People/rlee.html Professor Ronald Lee's] website.

There are surprisingly few software packages for forecasting with the Lee-Carter Model.  [http://lcfit.demog.berkeley.edu LCFIT] is a web-based package with interactive forms.  Professor [[Rob J. Hyndman]] provides an [http://robjhyndman.com/software/demography/  R package for demography] that includes routines for creating and forecasting a Lee-Carter Model. Professor German Rodriguez provides [http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/LeeCarter.html code for the Lee-Carter Model] using [[Stata]]. Using [[Matlab]], Professor Eric Jondeau and Professor Michael Rockinger have put together the [https://github.com/mrockinger/Matlab-Longevity-Toolbox/ Longevity Toolbox] for parameter estimation.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], '''Lieb–Thirring inequalities''' provide an upper bound on the sums of powers of the negative [[eigenvalues]] of a [[Schrödinger operator]] in terms of integrals of the potential. They are named after [[Elliott H. Lieb|E. H. Lieb]] and [[Walter Thirring|W. E. Thirring]].

The inequalities are useful in studies of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[differential equations]] and imply, as a corollary, a lower bound on the [[kinetic energy]] of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; quantum mechanical particles that plays an important role in the proof of stability of [[matter]].&lt;ref name="LT1976"&gt;E. H. Lieb, W. E. Thirring, Inequalities for the moments of the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger hamiltonian and their relation to Sobolev inequalities, Studies in Mathematical Physics, Princeton University Press (1976), 269–303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of the inequalities==
For the Schrödinger operator &lt;math&gt;-\Delta+V(x)=-\nabla^2+V(x)&lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with real-valued potential &lt;math&gt;V(x):\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the numbers &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\le\lambda_2\le\dots\le0&lt;/math&gt; denote the (not necessarily finite) sequence of negative eigenvalues. Then, for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; satisfying one of the conditions

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\gamma\ge\frac12&amp;,\,n=1,\\
\gamma&gt;0&amp;,\,n=2,\\
\gamma\ge0&amp;,\,n\ge3,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}&lt;/math&gt;, which only depends on &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, such that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{j\ge1}|\lambda_j|^\gamma\le L_{\gamma,n}\int_{\R^n}V(x)_-^{\gamma+\frac n2}\mathrm{d}^n x
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;V(x)_-:=\max(-V(x),0)&lt;/math&gt; is the negative part of the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The cases &lt;math&gt;\gamma&gt;1/2,n=1&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&gt;0,n\ge2&lt;/math&gt; were proven by E. H. Lieb and W. E. Thirring in 1976 &lt;ref name="LT1976"/&gt; and used in their proof of stability of matter. 
In the case &lt;math&gt;\gamma=0, n\ge3&lt;/math&gt; the left-hand side is simply the number of negative eigenvalues, and proofs were given independently by M. Cwikel.,&lt;ref&gt;M. Cwikel, Weak type estimates for singular values and the number of bound states of Schrödinger operators, Ann. of Math. (2) 106 (1977), no. 1, 93–100&lt;/ref&gt; E. H. Lieb &lt;ref name ="L1976"&gt;E. H. Lieb, Bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplace and Schroedinger operators, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 82 (1976), no. 5, 751–753&lt;/ref&gt; and G. V. Rozenbljum.&lt;ref&gt;G. V. Rozenbljum, Distribution of the discrete spectrum of singular differential operators, Izv. Vysš. Učebn. Zaved. Matematika (1976), no. 1(164), 75–86&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting &lt;math&gt;\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt; inequality is thus also called the Cwikel–Lieb–Rosenbljum bound. The remaining critical case &lt;math&gt;\gamma=1/2, n=1&lt;/math&gt; was proven to hold by T. Weidl &lt;ref&gt;T. Weidl, On the Lieb–Thirring constants &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,1}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\gamma \ge 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, Comm. Math. Phys. 178 (1996), no. 1, 135–146&lt;/ref&gt;
The conditions on &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are necessary and cannot  be relaxed.

The Lieb–Thirring inequalities can be compared to the semi-classical limit.  
The classical [[phase space]] consists of pairs &lt;math&gt;(p,x)\in\mathbb{R}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;. Identifying the [[momentum operator]] &lt;math&gt;-\mathrm{i}\nabla&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and assuming that every quantum state is contained in a volume &lt;math&gt;(2\pi)^n&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional phase space, the semi-classical approximation

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{j\ge 1}|\lambda_j|^\gamma\approx \frac{1}{(2\pi)^n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\big(p^2+V(x)\big)_-^\gamma\mathrm{d}^n p\mathrm{d}^n x
=L^{\mathrm{cl}}_{\gamma,n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} V(x)_-^{\gamma+\frac n2}\mathrm{d}^n x
&lt;/math&gt;

is derived with the constant

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{\gamma,n}^{\mathrm{cl}}=(4\pi)^{-\frac n2}\frac{\Gamma(\gamma+1)}{\Gamma(\gamma+1+\frac n2)}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

While the semi-classical approximation does not need any assumptions on &lt;math&gt;\gamma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the Lieb–Thirring inequalities only hold for suitable &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

===Weyl asymptotics and sharp constants===
Numerous results have been published about the best possible constant &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}&lt;/math&gt; in ({{EquationNote|1}}) but this problem is still partly open.
The semiclassical approximation becomes exact in the limit of large coupling, that is for potentials &lt;math&gt;\beta V&lt;/math&gt; the [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]] asymptotics

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{\beta\to\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{\gamma+\frac n2}}\mathrm{tr} (-\Delta+\beta V)_-^\gamma=L^\mathrm{cl}_{\gamma,n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} V(x)_-^{\gamma+\frac n2}\mathrm{d}^n x
&lt;/math&gt;

hold.  This implies that &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}^{\mathrm{cl}}\le L_{\gamma,n}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Lieb and Thirring&lt;ref name ="LT1976"/&gt; were able to show that  &lt;math&gt; L_{\gamma,n}=L_{\gamma,n}^{\mathrm{cl}}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\gamma\ge 3/2, n=1&lt;/math&gt;. [[Michael Aizenman|M. Aizenman]] and E. H. Lieb &lt;ref&gt;M. Aizenman and E. H. Lieb, On semiclassical bounds for eigenvalues of Schrödinger operators, Phys. Lett. A 66 (1978), no. 6, 427–429&lt;/ref&gt;
proved that for fixed dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the ratio &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}/L_{\gamma,n}^{\mathrm{cl}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Monotonic function|monotonic]], non-increasing function of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  Subsequently &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}=L_{\gamma,n}^{\mathrm{cl}}&lt;/math&gt; was also shown to hold for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\gamma\ge 3/2&lt;/math&gt;  by [[Ari Laptev|A. Laptev]] and T. Weidl.&lt;ref&gt;A. Laptev and T. Weidl, Sharp Lieb–Thirring inequalities in high dimensions, Acta Math. 184 (2000), no. 1, 87–111&lt;/ref&gt; 
For &lt;math&gt;\gamma=1/2,\,n=1&lt;/math&gt; D. Hundertmark, E. H. Lieb and L. E. Thomas &lt;ref&gt;D. Hundertmark, E. H. Lieb and L. E. Thomas, A sharp bound for an eigenvalue moment of the one-dimensional Schrödinger operator, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 2 (1998), no. 4, 719–731&lt;/ref&gt; proved that the best constant is given by &lt;math&gt;L_{1/2,1}=2L_{1/2,1}^{\mathrm{cl}}=1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, it is known that &lt;math&gt;L^\mathrm{cl}_{\gamma,n}&lt;L_{\gamma,n}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;1/2\le\gamma&lt;3/2, n=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name ="LT1976"/&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;1,d\ge1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;B. Helffer and D. Robert, Riesz means of bounded states and semi-classical limit connected with a Lieb–Thirring conjecture. II, Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré Phys. Théor. 53 (1990), no. 2, 139–147&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the former case Lieb and Thirring conjectured that the sharp constant is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{\gamma,1}=2L^\mathrm{cl}_{\gamma,1}\left(\frac{\gamma-\frac12}{\gamma+\frac12}\right)^{\gamma-\frac12}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The best known value for the physical relevant constant &lt;math&gt;L_{1,3}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi L_{1,3}^\mathrm{cl}/\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;J. Dolbeault, A. Laptev, and M. Loss, Lieb–Thirring inequalities with improved constants, J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 10 (2008), no. 4, 1121–1126&lt;/ref&gt; and the smallest known constant in the Cwikel–Lieb–Rosenbljum inequality is &lt;math&gt;6.869L_{0,n}^\mathrm{cl} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name ="L1976"/&gt; 
A complete survey of the presently best known values for &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}&lt;/math&gt; can be found in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;A. Laptev, Spectral inequalities for partial differential equations and their applications, Fifth International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians. Part 1, 2, AMS/IP Stud. Adv. Math., 51, pt. 1, vol. 2, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2012, pp. 629–643&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinetic energy inequalities==
The Lieb–Thirring inequality  for &lt;math&gt;\gamma=1&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a lower bound on the kinetic energy of a given normalised &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-particle [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^{Nn})&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the one-body density.  For an anti-symmetric wave function such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=-\psi(x_1,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_N)
&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;1\le i,j\le N&lt;/math&gt;, the one-body density is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_\psi(x)
=N\int_{\mathbb{R}^{(N-1)n}}|\psi(x,x_2\dots,x_N)|^2
\mathrm{d}^n x_2\cdots\mathrm{d}^n x_{N},\, x\in\mathbb{R}^n.
&lt;/math&gt;

The Lieb–Thirring inequality ({{EquationNote|1}})  for &lt;math&gt;\gamma=1&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the statement that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^N \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}|\nabla_i\psi|^2\mathrm{d}^n x_i\ge K_n\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}{\rho_\psi(x)^{1+\frac 2n}}\mathrm{d}^n x
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where the sharp constant &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined via

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\left(1+\frac2n\right)K_n\right)^{1+\frac n2}\left(\left(1+\frac n2\right)L_{1,n}\right)^{1+\frac2n}=1\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

The inequality can be extended to particles with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] states by replacing the one-body density by the spin-summed one-body density. The constant &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; then has to be replaced by &lt;math&gt;K_n/q^{2/n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the number of quantum spin states available to each particle (&lt;math&gt;q=2&lt;/math&gt; for electrons). If the wave function is symmetric, instead of anti-symmetric, such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_n)=\psi(x_1,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_n)
&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;1\le i,j\le N&lt;/math&gt;, the constant &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt; has to be replaced by &lt;math&gt;K_n/N^{2/n}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Inequality  ({{EquationNote|2}})  describes the minimum kinetic energy necessary to achieve a given density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\psi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions. 
If &lt;math&gt;L_{1,3}=L^\mathrm{cl}_{1,3}&lt;/math&gt; was proven to hold, the right-hand side of ({{EquationNote|2}}) for &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt; would be precisely the kinetic energy term in [[Thomas–Fermi model|Thomas–Fermi]] theory.

The inequality can be compared to the [[Sobolev inequality]]. M. Rumin&lt;ref&gt;M. Rumin, Balanced distribution-energy inequalities and related entropy bounds, Duke Math. J. 160 (2011), no. 3, 567–597&lt;/ref&gt; derived the kinetic energy inequality  ({{EquationNote|2}}) (with a smaller constant) directly without the use of the Lieb–Thirring inequality.

==The stability of matter==
The kinetic energy inequality plays an important role in the proof of stability of matter as presented by Lieb and Thirring.&lt;ref name = "LT1976"/&gt; The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] under consideration describes a system of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; spin states and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; fixed [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] at locations &lt;math&gt;R_j\in\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; with [[Electric charge|charges]] &lt;math&gt;Z_j&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  The particles and nuclei interact with each other through the electrostatic [[Coulomb force]] and an arbitrary [[magnetic field]] can be introduced. If the particles under consideration are [[fermions]] (i.e. the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is antisymmetric), then the kinetic energy inequality  ({{EquationNote|2}}) holds with the constant &lt;math&gt;K_n/q^{2/n}&lt;/math&gt; (not &lt;math&gt;K_n/N^{2/n}&lt;/math&gt;). This is a crucial ingredient in the proof of stability of matter for a system of fermions. It ensures that the [[ground state]] energy &lt;math&gt;E_{N,M}(Z_1,\dots,Z_M)&lt;/math&gt; of the system can be bounded from below by a constant depending only on the maximum of the nuclei charges, &lt;math&gt;Z_{\max}&lt;/math&gt;, times the number of particles,

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{N,M}(Z_1,\dots,Z_M)\ge -C(Z_{\max}) (M+N)\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

The system is then stable of the first kind since the ground-state energy is bounded from below and also stable of the second kind, i.e. the energy of decreases linearly with the number of particles and nuclei. In comparison, if the particles are assumed to be [[bosons]] (i.e. the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric), then the kinetic energy inequality  ({{EquationNote|2}}) holds only with the constant &lt;math&gt;K_n/N^{2/n}&lt;/math&gt;  and for the ground state energy only a bound of the form &lt;math&gt;-CN^{5/3}&lt;/math&gt; holds. Since the power &lt;math&gt;5/3&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be optimal, a system of bosons is stable of the first kind but unstable of the second kind.

==Generalisations==

If the Laplacian &lt;math&gt;-\Delta=-\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{i}\nabla+A(x))^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a magnetic field vector potential in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the Lieb–Thirring inequality  ({{EquationNote|1}}) remains true. The proof of this statement uses the diamagnetic inequality. Although all presently known constants &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}&lt;/math&gt; remain unchanged, it is not known whether this is true in general for the best possible constant.

The Laplacian can also be replaced by other powers of &lt;math&gt;-\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. In particular for the operator &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;, a Lieb–Thirring inequality similar to  ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds with a different constant &lt;math&gt;L_{\gamma,n}&lt;/math&gt; and with the power on the right-hand side replaced by &lt;math&gt;\gamma+n&lt;/math&gt;. Analogously a kinetic inequality similar to  ({{EquationNote|2}}) holds, with &lt;math&gt;1+2/n&lt;/math&gt; replaced by &lt;math&gt;1+1/n&lt;/math&gt;, which can be used to prove stability of matter for the relativistic Schrödinger operator under additional assumptions on the charges &lt;math&gt;Z_k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Frank, E. H. Lieb, and [[Robert Seiringer|R. Seiringer]], Hardy–Lieb–Thirring inequalities for fractional Schrödinger operators, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 21 (2008), no. 4, 925–950&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, the Lieb–Thirring inequality  ({{EquationNote|1}}) gives an upper bound on the distances of the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j&lt;/math&gt; to the [[essential spectrum]] &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the perturbation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Similar inequalities can be proved for [[Jacobi operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;D. Hundertmark and [[Barry Simon|B. Simon]], Lieb–Thirring inequalities for Jacobi matrices, J. Approx. Theory 118 (2002), no. 1, 106–130&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1776">A '''logical [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]''' is a special type of diagramatic structure in any one of several systems of graphical [[syntax (logic)|syntax]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed for [[logic]].

In his papers on ''[[qualitative logic]]'', ''[[entitative graph]]s'', and ''[[existential graph]]s'', Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [[formal system|formalism]], or a graph-theoretic [[formal language]], designed to be interpreted for logic.

In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures.

In [[computational learning theory]], '''Occam learning''' is a model of algorithmic learning where the objective of the learner is to output a succinct representation of received training data. This is closely related to [[probably approximately correct learning|probably approximately correct (PAC) learning]], where the learner is evaluated on its predictive power of a test set.

Occam learnability implies PAC learning, and for a wide variety of [[concept class]]es, the converse is also true: PAC learnability implies Occam learnability.

==Introduction==
Occam Learning is named after [[Occam’s Razor#Science and the scientific method|Occam's razor,]] which is a principle stating that, given all other things being equal, a shorter explanation for observed data should be favored over a lengthier explanation. The theory of Occam learning is a formal and mathematical justification for this principle. It was first shown by Blumer, et al.&lt;ref name="def" /&gt; that Occam learning implies PAC learning, which is the standard model of learning in computational learning theory. In other words, ''parsimony'' (of the output hypothesis) implies ''predictive power''.

==Definition of Occam learning==
The succinctness of a concept &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in [[concept class]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed by the length &lt;math&gt;size(c)&lt;/math&gt; of the shortest bit string that can represent &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Occam learning connects the succinctness of a learning algorithm's output to its predictive power on unseen data.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be concept classes containing target concepts and hypotheses respectively. Then, for constants &lt;math&gt;\alpha \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \le \beta &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is an '''&lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt;-Occam algorithm''' for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; iff, given a set &lt;math&gt;S = \{ x \}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; samples labeled according to a concept &lt;math&gt;c(x) \in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; outputs a hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is consistent with &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt; h(x)=c(x),\forall x \in S &lt;/math&gt;), and
* &lt;math&gt;size(h) \le (n \cdot size(c))^\alpha m^\beta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="kv"&gt;Kearns, M. J., &amp; Vazirani, U. V. (1994). An introduction to computational learning theory, chapter 2. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="def"&gt;Blumer, A., Ehrenfeucht, A., Haussler, D., &amp; Warmuth, M. K. (1987). ''[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2008/694/papers/occam.pdf Occam's razor]''. Information processing letters, 24(6), 377-380.&lt;/ref&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum length of any sample &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;. An Occam algorithm is called ''efficient'' if it runs in time polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;size(c).&lt;/math&gt; We say a concept class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is ''Occam learnable'' with respect to a hypothesis class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; if there exists an efficient Occam algorithm for  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}.&lt;/math&gt;

==The relation between Occam and PAC learning==
Occam learnability implies PAC learnability, as the following theorem of Blumer, et al.&lt;ref name="kv" /&gt; shows:

=== Theorem (''Occam learning implies PAC learning'') ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be an efficient  '''&lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt;'''-Occam algorithm for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \epsilon, \delta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, for any distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D} &lt;/math&gt;, given &lt;math&gt;m \ge a \left( \frac 1 \epsilon \log \frac 1 \delta + \left(\frac {(n \cdot size(c))^\alpha)} \epsilon \right)^{\frac 1 {1-\beta}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;  samples drawn from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D} &lt;/math&gt; and labelled according to a concept &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bits each, the algorithm  &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; will output a hypothesis  &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;error(h)\le \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here, &lt;math&gt;error(h)&lt;/math&gt; is with respect to the concept &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D} &lt;/math&gt;. This implies that the algorithm &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is also a PAC learner for the concept class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; using hypothesis class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;.  A slightly more general formulation is as follows:

=== Theorem (''Occam learning implies PAC learning, cardinality version'') ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \epsilon, \delta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be an algorithm such that, given &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; samples drawn from a fixed but unknown distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and labeled according to a concept &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bits each, outputs a hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}_{n,m} &lt;/math&gt; that is consistent with the labeled samples. Then, there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;\log |\mathcal{H}_{n,m}| \leq b \epsilon m - \log \frac{1}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;  is guaranteed to output a hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}_{n,m} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;error(h)\le \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the above theorems show that Occam learning is sufficient for PAC learning, it doesn't say anything about ''necessity.'' Board and Pitt show that, for a wide variety of concept classes, Occam learning is in fact necessary for PAC learning.&lt;ref&gt;Board, R., &amp; Pitt, L. (1990, April). On the necessity of Occam algorithms. In Proceedings of the twenty-second annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing (pp. 54-63). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; They proved that for any concept class that is ''polynomially closed under exception lists,'' PAC learnability implies the existence of an Occam algorithm for that concept class. Concept classes that are polynomially closed under exception lists include Boolean formulas, circuits, deterministic finite automata, decision-lists, decision-trees, and other geometrically-defined concept classes.

A concept class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is polynomially closed under exception lists if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that, when given the representation of a concept &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; and a finite list &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of ''exceptions'', outputs a representation of a concept &lt;math&gt;c' \in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that the concepts &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c'&lt;/math&gt; agree except on the set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof that Occam learning implies PAC learning==

We first prove the Cardinality version. Call a hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h\in \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt; ''bad'' if &lt;math&gt;error(h) \geq \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where again &lt;math&gt;error(h)&lt;/math&gt; is with respect to the true concept &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and the underlying distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. The probability that a set of samples &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is consistent with &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;(1 - \epsilon)^m&lt;/math&gt;, by the independence of the samples. By the union bound, the probability that there exists a bad hypothesis in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{n,m}&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt; | \mathcal{H}_{n,m} | (1 - \epsilon)^m&lt;/math&gt;, which is less than &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\log | \mathcal{H}_{n,m} |  \leq O(\epsilon m) - \log \frac{1}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;. This concludes the proof of the second theorem above.

Using the second theorem, we can prove the first theorem. Since we have a &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt;-Occam algorithm, this means that any hypothesis output by &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by at most &lt;math&gt; (n \cdot size(c))^\alpha m^\beta&lt;/math&gt; bits, and thus &lt;math&gt; \log |\mathcal{H}_{n,m}| \leq (n \cdot size(c))^\alpha m^\beta&lt;/math&gt;. This is less than &lt;math&gt;O(\epsilon m) - \log \frac{1}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; if we set &lt;math&gt; m \geq a \left( \frac 1 \epsilon \log \frac 1 \delta + \left(\frac {(n \cdot size(c))^\alpha)} \epsilon \right)^{\frac 1 {1-\beta}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for some constant &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, by the Cardinality version Theorem, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; will output a consistent hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1 - \delta&lt;/math&gt;. This concludes the proof of the first theorem above.

==Improving sample complexity for common problems==
Though Occam and PAC learnability are equivalent, the Occam framework can be used to produce tighter bounds on the sample complexity of classical problems including conjunctions,&lt;ref name="kv" /&gt; conjunctions with few relevant variables,&lt;ref&gt;Haussler, D. (1988).

Artificial intelligence, 36(2), 177-221.&lt;/ref&gt; and decision lists.&lt;ref&gt;Rivest, R. L. (1987). ''[http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/Riv87b.pdf Learning decision lists. Machine learning]'', 2(3), 229-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Allen Catlin''' ({{birth date|1948|6|25}} – {{Date of death|1995|4|20}}) was a mathematician, professor of mathematics and Doctor of Mathematics, known for his valuable contributions to [[graph theory]] and [[number theory]]. He wrote one of the most cited papers in the series of chromatic numbers and Brooks' theorem, titled '' Hajós graph coloring conjecture: variations and counterexamples''.&lt;ref name=catlin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hobbs |first1=Arthur M. |author1-link=Arthur Hobbs (mathematician)|last2= Lai |first2= Hong-Jian |last3= Robertson |first3= Neil |authorlink3=Neil Robertson (mathematician) |title= Paul Catlin 1948–1995 |postscript=; Preface pp. 3–6, |journal= Discrete Mathematics |year=2001 |volume= 230 |issue=1–3 |pages= 3–12 |url= http://www.math.wvu.edu/~hjlai/Pdf/Paul_Catlin.pdf |doi=10.1016/s0012-365x(00)00065-0}} [http://www.math.wvu.edu/~hjlai/Pdf/Catlin_Pdf/ListPublicationsCatlin.htm Publication list for Paul Catlin, math.wvu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Catlin:Paul_A=.html |title= List of publications of Paul A.

==Career==

He held a Doctorate in Mathematics degree from [[Ohio State University]], authored over fifty academic papers in [[number theory]] and [[graph theory]]. Many of his contributions and collaborations have been published in ''[[Fibonacci Quarterly|The Fibonacci Quarterly]]'', in ''[[Journal of Number Theory|The Journal of Number Theory]]'', in the ''Journal of [[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Mathematics]]'', and many other academic publications.&lt;ref name=list/&gt; He co-authored scholarly papers with Arthur M.

Originally from [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], he majored in Mathematics with a B.A. degree from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=catlin/&gt;

From 1972 to 1973, he was a research and teaching assistant at [[Ohio State University]], where he earned the Master of Science degree in Mathematics.&lt;ref name=catlin/&gt;

In 1976, he went to work at [[Wayne State University]], where he concentrated the research on [[Graph_coloring#Definition_and_terminology|chromatic numbers]] and [[Brooks' theorem]]. As a result, '''Paul A. Catlin''' published one of the most cited papers in that series: ''Hajós graph coloring conjecture: variations and counterexamples.'',&lt;ref name=catlin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]],  '''point process notation''' comprises the range of [[mathematical notation]] used to symbolically represent [[random]] [[Mathematical object|objects]] known as [[point process]]es, which are used in related fields such as [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] and [[continuum percolation theory]] and frequently serve as [[mathematical models]] of random phenomena, representable as points, in time, space or both.

The notation varies due to the histories of certain mathematical fields and the different interpretations of point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"&gt;D. Stoyan, W. S. Kendall, J. Mecke, and L. Ruschendorf. ''Stochastic geometry and its applications'', Second Edition, Section 4.1, Wiley Chichester, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/b97277 | first1 = D.

==Interpretation of point processes==

The notation, as well as the  terminology, of point processes depends on their setting and interpretation as mathematical objects which under certain assumptions can be interpreted as random [[sequences]] of points, random [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of points or random [[counting measure]]s.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

===Random sequences of points===

In some mathematical frameworks, a given point process may be considered as a sequence of points with each point randomly positioned in ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; as well as some other more abstract [[mathematical space]]s.  In general, whether  or not  a random sequence is equivalent to the other interpretations of a point process depends on the underlying mathematical space, but this holds true for the setting of finite-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daley | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Vere-Jones | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-49835-5 | title = An Introduction to the Theory of Point Processes | series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-21337-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random set of points===

A point process is called ''simple'' if no two (or more points) coincide in location with [[Almost surely|probability one]]. Given that often point processes are simple and the order of the points does not matter, a collection of random points can be considered as a random set of  points&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-38175-4_1 | first1 = A. | last1 = Baddeley | first2 = I. | last2 = Barany | first3 = R. | last3 = Schneider | first4 = W. | last4 = Weil| chapter = Spatial Point Processes and their Applications | title = Stochastic Geometry | series = Lecture Notes in Mathematics | volume = 1892 | pages = 1 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-38174-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of random sets was independently developed by [[David George Kendall|David Kendall]] and [[Georges Matheron]]. In terms of being considered as a random set, a sequence of random points is a random closed set if the sequence has no [[Limit point#Types of limit points|accumulation points]] with probability one&lt;ref name="schneider2008stochastic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = R. | last2 = Weil | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-78859-1 | title = Stochastic and Integral Geometry | series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-540-78858-4 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point process is often denoted by a single letter,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"&gt;[[J. F. C. Kingman]]. ''Poisson processes'', volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = J. | last2 = Plenge Waagepetersen | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1201/9780203496930 | title = Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes | series = C&amp;H/CRC Monographs on Statistics &amp; Applied Probability | volume = 100 | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-58488-265-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;, and if the point process is considered as a random set, then the corresponding notation:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x\in {N}, &lt;/math&gt;

is used to denote that a random point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of (or [[Element (mathematics)#Notation and terminology|belongs]] to) the point  process &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The theory of random sets can be applied to point processes owing to this interpretation, which alongside the random sequence interpretation has resulted in a point process being written as:

:&lt;math&gt;  \{x_1, x_2,\dots \}=\{x\}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

which highlights its interpretation as either a random sequence or random closed set of points.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; Furthermore, sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_i&lt;/math&gt;) belongs to or is a point of the point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X&lt;/math&gt;, or with set notation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;

===Random measures===

To denote the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in some [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;, it is sometimes written &lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(B) =\#( B \cap {N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt; is a [[counting measure]], which gives the number of points in some set. In this [[mathematical expression]] the point process is denoted by:

&lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, the symbol:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

represents the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of random measures,  one  can write:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)=n&lt;/math&gt;

to denote that there is the set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;  n&lt;/math&gt; points of &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a point process can be considered as a [[random measure]] that assigns some non-negative integer-valued [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]  to sets.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; This interpretation has motivated a point process being considered just another name for a ''random counting measure''&lt;ref name="molvcanov2005theory"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/1-84628-150-4 | title = Theory of Random Sets | first = Ilya | last = Molchanov| series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-85233-892-X | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} and the techniques of random measure theory offering another way to study point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grandell1977point"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grandell | first1 = Jan | year = 1977 | title = Point Processes and Random Measures | journal = Advances in Applied Probability  | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 502–526 | publisher = Applied Probability Trust | jstor = 1426111 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also induces the use of the various notations used in [[Integral#Terminology and notation|integration]] and measure theory. {{efn|As discussed in Chapter 1 of Stoyan, Kendall and Mechke,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; varying [[integral]] notation in general applies to all integrals here and elsewhere.}}

==Dual notation==

The different interpretations of point processes as random sets and counting measures is captured with the often used notation &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baccelli | first1 = F. O. | title = Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks: Volume I Theory | doi = 10.1561/1300000006 | journal = Foundations and Trends in Networking | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 249–449 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which:

* &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a set of random points.
* &lt;math&gt; {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a random variable that gives the number of points  of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; (hence it is a random counting measure).

Denoting the counting measure again with &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt;, this dual notation implies:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B) =\#(B \cap {N}). &lt;/math&gt;

==Sums==

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is some [[measurable function]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the sum of &lt;math&gt;  f(x)&lt;/math&gt; over all the points &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {N} &lt;/math&gt; can be written in a number of ways &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt; such as:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1) + f(x_2)+ \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

which has the random sequence appearance, or with set notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, with integration notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f(x) {N}(dx) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Sample space|space]] of all possible counting measures, hence putting an  emphasis on the interpretation of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; as a random counting measure. An alternative integration notation may be used to write this integral as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f \, d{N} &lt;/math&gt;

The dual interpretation of point processes is illustrated when writing the number of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; points in a set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B)= \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[indicator function]] &lt;math&gt;  1_B(x) =1&lt;/math&gt; if the point &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; is exists in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; and zero otherwise, which in this setting is also known as a [[Dirac measure]].&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; In this expression the random measure interpretation is on the [[left-hand side]] while the random set notation is used is on the right-hand side.

==Expectations==

The [[average]] or [[expected value]] of a sum of functions over a point process is written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E\left[\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x)\right] \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) P(d{N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where (in the random measure sense) &lt;math&gt;  P&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate [[probability measure]] defined on the space of [[counting measure]]s &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expected value of &lt;math&gt;  {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt;  can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E[{N}(B)]=E\left( \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x)\right) \qquad \text{or}  \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) P(d{N}). &lt;/math&gt;

which is also known as the first [[moment measure]] of  &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expectation of such a random sum, known as a ''shot noise process'' in the theory of point processes, can be calculated with [[Campbell's theorem (probability)#Campbell's theorem: general point process|Campbell's theorem]].&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"/&gt;

==Uses in other fields==

Point processes are employed in other mathematical and statistical disciplines, hence the notation may be used in fields such [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] or [[continuum percolation theory]], and areas which use the methods and theory from these fields.

In [[complex analysis]], the '''pseudo-zero set''' or '''root neighborhood''' of a [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]-''m'' polynomial ''p''(''z'') is the set of all [[complex number]]s that are roots of polynomials whose [[coefficient]]s differ from those of ''p'' by a small amount. Namely, given a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] {{abs|·}} on the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{m+1}&lt;/math&gt; of polynomial coefficients, the pseudo-zero set is the set of all zeros of all degree-''m'' polynomials ''q'' such that {{abs|'''''p''''' − '''''q'''''}} (as vectors of coefficients) is less than a given ''ε''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12166">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''q''-Pochhammer symbol}}
In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[combinatorics]], a '''''q''-Pochhammer symbol''', also called a '''''q''-shifted factorial''', is a [[q-analog|''q''-analog]] of the [[Pochhammer symbol]]. It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_n = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (1-aq^k)=(1-a)(1-aq)(1-aq^2)\cdots(1-aq^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

by definition. The ''q''-Pochhammer symbol is a major building block in the construction of ''q''-analogs; for instance, in the theory of [[basic hypergeometric series]], it plays the role that the ordinary Pochhammer symbol plays in the theory of [[generalized hypergeometric series]].

Unlike the ordinary Pochhammer symbol, the ''q''-Pochhammer symbol can be extended to an infinite product:

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_\infty = \prod_{k=0}^{\infty} (1-aq^k).&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[analytic function]] of ''q'' in the interior of the [[unit disk]], and can also be considered as a [[formal power series]] in ''q''.  The special case

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(q) = (q;q)_\infty=\prod_{k=1}^\infty (1-q^k)&lt;/math&gt;

is known as [[Euler's function]], and is important in [[combinatorics]], [[number theory]], and the theory of [[modular forms]].

==Identities==
The finite product can be expressed in terms of the infinite product:

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_n = \frac{(a;q)_\infty} {(aq^n;q)_\infty}, &lt;/math&gt;

which extends the definition to negative integers ''n''.  Thus, for nonnegative ''n'', one has

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_{-n} = \frac{1}{(aq^{-n};q)_n}=\prod_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{(1-a/q^k)}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_{-n} = \frac{(-q/a)^n q^{n(n-1)/2}} {(q/a;q)_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''q''-Pochhammer symbol is the subject of a number of ''q''-series identities, particularly the infinite series expansions

:&lt;math&gt;(x;q)_\infty = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n q^{n(n-1)/2}}{(q;q)_n} x^n&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(x;q)_\infty}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{(q;q)_n}&lt;/math&gt;,

which are both special cases of the [[q-binomial theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(ax;q)_\infty}{(x;q)_\infty} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(a;q)_n}{(q;q)_n} x^n.&lt;/math&gt;
[[Fridrikh Karpelevich]] found the following identity (see {{harvs|txt|last1=Olshanetsky|last2=Rogov|year=1995}} for the proof):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(q;q)_{\infty}}{(z;q)_{\infty}}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}q^{n(n+1)/2}}{(q;q)_n(1-zq^n)}, \ |z|&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Combinatorial interpretation==

The ''q''-Pochhammer symbol is closely related to the enumerative combinatorics of partitions. The coefficient of &lt;math&gt;q^m a^n&lt;/math&gt; in
:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_\infty^{-1} = \prod_{k=0}^{\infty} (1-aq^k)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is the number of partitions of ''m'' into at most ''n'' parts.

Since, by conjugation of partitions, this is the same as the number of partitions of ''m'' into parts of size at most ''n'', by identification of generating series we obtain the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;(a;q)_\infty^{-1} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\prod_{j=1}^k \frac{1}{1-q^j} \right) a^k
                         = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a^k}{(q;q)_k}&lt;/math&gt;
as in the above section.

We also have that the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;q^m a^n&lt;/math&gt; in
:&lt;math&gt;(-a;q)_\infty = \prod_{k=0}^{\infty} (1+aq^k)&lt;/math&gt;
is the number of partitions of ''m'' into ''n'' or ''n''-1 distinct parts.

By removing a triangular partition with ''n'' − 1 parts from such a partition, we are left with an arbitrary partition with at most ''n'' parts. This gives a weight-preserving bijection between the set of partitions into ''n'' or ''n'' − 1 distinct parts and the set of pairs consisting of a triangular partition having ''n'' − 1 parts and a partition with at most ''n'' parts. By identifying generating series, this leads to the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;(-a;q)_\infty = \prod_{k=0}^\infty (1+aq^k)
                     = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(q^{k\choose 2} \prod_{j=1}^k \frac{1}{1-q^j}\right) a^k
                     = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k\choose 2}}{(q;q)_k} a^k&lt;/math&gt;
also described in the above section. 
The reciprocal of the function &lt;math&gt;(q)_{\infty} := (q; q)_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; similarly arises as the generating function for the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]], &lt;math&gt;p(n)&lt;/math&gt;, which is also expanded by the second two [[q-series]] expansions given below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berndt|first1=B. C.|title=What is a q-series?|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~berndt/articles/q.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(q; q)_{\infty}} = \sum_{n \geq 0} p(n) q^n = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{q^n}{(q; q)_n} = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{q^{n^2}}{(q; q)_n^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[q-binomial theorem]] itself can also be handled by a slightly more involved combinatorial argument of a similar flavor (see also the expansions given in the [[Q-Pochhammer symbol#Relationship to other q-functions|next subsection]]) .

== Multiple arguments convention ==

Since identities involving ''q''-Pochhammer symbols so frequently involve products of many symbols, the standard convention is to write a product as a single symbol of multiple arguments:

:&lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m;q)_n = (a_1;q)_n (a_2;q)_n \ldots (a_m;q)_n.&lt;/math&gt;

== ''q''-series ==

A ''q''-series is a [[Series (mathematics)|series]] in which the coefficients are functions of ''q'', typically expressions of &lt;math&gt;(a; q)_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce C. Berndt, [http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~berndt/articles/q.pdf What is a ''q''-series?], in Ramanujan Rediscovered: Proceedings of a Conference on Elliptic Functions, Partitions, and q-Series in memory of K. Venkatachaliengar: Bangalore, 1–5 June 2009, N. D. Baruah, B. C. Berndt, S. Cooper, T. Huber, and M. J. Schlosser, eds., Ramanujan Mathematical Society, Mysore, 2010, pp. 31-51&lt;/ref&gt; Early results are due to [[Euler]], [[Gauss]], and [[Cauchy]]. The systematic study begins with [[Eduard Heine]] (1843).&lt;ref&gt;E. Heine, [https://archive.org/details/abw7150.0001.001.umich.edu Untersuchungen über die Reihe], J. Reine Angew. Math. 34 (1847), 285-328&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other ''q''-functions ==

The ''q''-analog of ''n'', also known as the '''''q''-bracket''' or '''''q''-number''' of ''n'', is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;[n]_q=\frac{1-q^n}{1-q}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this one can define the ''q''-analog of the [[factorial]], the '''''q''-factorial''', as

:{|

These numbers are analogues in the sense that  

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{q\rightarrow 1}\frac{1-q^n}{1-q}=n,&lt;/math&gt;

and so also 

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{q\rightarrow 1}[n]!_q = n!.&lt;/math&gt;

The limit value ''n''! counts [[permutation]]s of an ''n''-element set ''S''.  Equivalently, it counts the number of sequences of nested sets &lt;math&gt;E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \cdots \subset E_n = S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly ''i'' elements.&lt;ref name="EC1"&gt;{{citation | last = Stanley | first = Richard P. | authorlink = Richard P. Stanley | title = Enumerative Combinatorics | volume = 1 | edition = 2 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2011}}, Section 1.10.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparison, when ''q'' is a prime power and ''V'' is an ''n''-dimensional vector space over the field with ''q'' elements, the ''q''-analogue &lt;math&gt;[n]!_q&lt;/math&gt; is the number of complete flags in ''V'', that is, it is the number of sequences &lt;math&gt;V_1 \subset V_2 \subset \cdots \subset V_n = V&lt;/math&gt; of subspaces such that &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; has dimension ''i''.&lt;ref name = "EC1" /&gt;  The preceding considerations suggest that one can regard a sequence of nested sets as a flag over a conjectural [[field with one element]].

A product of negative integer ''q''-brackets can be expressed in terms of the ''q''-factorial as

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{k=1}^n [-k]_q = \frac{(-1)^n\,[n]!_q}{q^{n(n+1)/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

From the ''q''-factorials, one can move on to define the ''q''-binomial coefficients, also known as the [[Gaussian binomial coefficient]]s, as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
n\\
k
\end{bmatrix}_q
=
\frac{[n]!_q}{[n-k]!_q [k]!_q}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where it is easy to see that the triangle of these coefficients is symmetric in the sense that &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} n \\ m \end{bmatrix}_q = \begin{bmatrix} n \\ n-m \end{bmatrix}_q&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;0 \leq m \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

One can check that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
n+1\\
k
\end{bmatrix}_q
 &amp; =
\begin{bmatrix}
n\\
k
\end{bmatrix}_q
+
q^{n-k+1}
\begin{bmatrix}
n\\
k-1
\end{bmatrix}_q \\ 
 &amp; = 
\begin{bmatrix} n \\ k-1 \end{bmatrix}_q + q^k \begin{bmatrix} n \\ k \end{bmatrix}_q.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

One can also see from the previous recurrence relations that the next variants of the &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-binomial theorem are expanded in terms of these coefficients as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olver et. al.|title=NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions|date=2010|location=Section 17.2|page=421|url=http://dlmf.nist.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
(z; q)_n &amp; = \sum_{j=0}^n \begin{bmatrix} n \\ j \end{bmatrix}_q (-z)^j q^{\binom{j}{2}} = (1-z)(1-qz) \cdots (1-z q^{n-1}) \\ 
(-q; q)_n &amp; = \sum_{j=0}^n \begin{bmatrix} n \\ j \end{bmatrix}_{q^2} q^j \\ 
(q; q^2)_n &amp; = \sum_{j=0}^{2n} \begin{bmatrix} 2n \\ j \end{bmatrix}_q (-1)^j \\ 
\frac{1}{(z; q)_{m+1}} &amp; = \sum_{n \geq 0} \begin{bmatrix} n+m \\ n \end{bmatrix}_q z^n. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

One may further define the ''q''-multinomial coefficients
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
n\\
k_1, \ldots ,k_m
\end{bmatrix}_q
=
\frac{[n]!_q}{[k_1]!_q \cdots [k_m]!_q}, 
&lt;/math&gt;
where the arguments &lt;math&gt;k_1, \ldots, k_m&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative integers that satisfy &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^m k_i = n 
&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficient above counts the number of flags
&lt;math&gt;
V_1 \subset  \dots \subset V_m
&lt;/math&gt; 
of subspaces in an ''n''-dimensional vector space over the field with ''q'' elements such that &lt;math&gt;
\dim V_i = \sum_{j=1}^i k_j
&lt;/math&gt;.

The limit &lt;math&gt;q\to 1&lt;/math&gt; gives the usual multinomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,\dots ,k_m}&lt;/math&gt;, which counts words in ''n'' different symbols &lt;math&gt;\{s_1,\dots,s_m\}&lt;/math&gt; such that each &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; appears &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; times. 

One also obtains a ''q''-analog of the [[Gamma function]], called the '''[[q-gamma function]]''', and defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_q(x)=\frac{(1-q)^{1-x} (q;q)_\infty}{(q^x;q)_\infty}&lt;/math&gt;

This converges to the usual Gamma function as ''q'' approaches 1 from inside the unit disc. Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_q(x+1)=[x]_q\Gamma_q(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for any ''x'' and

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_q(n+1)=[n]!_q.&lt;/math&gt;

for non-negative integer values of ''n''. Alternatively, this may be taken as an extension of the ''q''-factorial function to the real number system.

A '''quantitative analyst''' (or, in financial jargon, a '''quant''') is a person who specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods – such as numerical or quantitative techniques – to financial and risk management problems.  The occupation is similar to those in [[industrial mathematics]] in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;See Definition in the Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics http://www.siam.org/about/pdf/brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original quantitative analysts were "[[sell side]] quants" from market maker firms, concerned with [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] pricing and [[risk management]], the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of [[mathematical finance|mathematics in finance]], including the [[buy side]].&lt;ref&gt;Derman, E. (2004). My life as a quant: reflections on physics and finance. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[statistical arbitrage]], quantitative [[investment management]], [[algorithmic trading]],  and electronic market making. 

==History==
[[File:Robert C. Merton.jpg|thumb|[[Robert C. Merton]], one of the pioneers of quantitative analysis, promoted [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.]]
[[Quantitative finance]] started in 1900 with [[Louis Bachelier]]'s doctoral thesis ''Theory of Speculation'', which provided a model to price [[Option (finance)|options]] under a [[Normal Distribution]].

[[Harry Markowitz]]'s 1952 doctoral [[thesis]] "Portfolio Selection" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to mathematics, statistics or specialized economics journals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowitz |first=H. |year=1952 |title=Portfolio Selection |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of "diversification" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return.  Although the language of finance now involves [[Itō calculus]], management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.

In 1965 [[Paul Samuelson]] introduced [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=P. A. |year=1965 |title=Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=13–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry McKean]] the co-founder of stochastic calculus (along with [[Kiyosi Itô]]) wrote the appendix: see {{cite journal |last=McKean |first=H. P. Jr. |year=1965 |title=Appendix (to Samuelson): a free boundary problem for the heat equation arising from a problem of mathematical economics |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=32–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] promoted continuous stochastic calculus and [[continuous-time]] processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of "equilibrium," and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue.

At the same time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]] developed the [[Black–Scholes model]], which was awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].  It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time.  Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the [[Black–Scholes]] model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=J. Michael |last2=Pliska |first2=Stanley R. |title=Martingales and Stochastic Integrals in the Theory of Continuous Trading |journal=Stochastic Processes and their Applications |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=215–260 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0304-4149(81)90026-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Derman]]'s 2004 book ''My Life as a Quant'' helped to both make the role of a quantitative analyst better known outside of finance, and to popularize the abbreviation "quant" for a quantitative analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derman |first=Emanuel |year=2004 |title=My Life as a Quant |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Quantitative analysts often come from applied mathematics, physics or engineering backgrounds rather than economics-related fields, and quantitative analysis is a major source of employment for people with mathematics and physics PhD degrees, or with financial mathematics [[Diplôme d'études approfondies|DEA]] degrees in the French education system.  Typically, a quantitative analyst will also need extensive skills in computer programming, most commonly [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[MATLAB]], [[Mathematica]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

This demand for quantitative analysts has led to a resurgence in demand for [[actuarial]] qualifications as well as creation of specialized Masters and PhD courses in [[financial engineering]], [[mathematical finance]], [[computational finance]], and/or [[financial reinsurance]].  In particular, Master's degrees in [[mathematical finance]], [[financial engineering]], [[operations research]], [[computational statistics]], [[machine Learning|machine learning]], and [[financial analysis]] are becoming more popular with students and with employers. See [[Master of Quantitative Finance]]; [[Master of Financial Economics]].

[[Data science]] and [[machine learning]] analysis and modelling methods are being increasingly employed in portfolio performance and portfolio risk modelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketsmedia.com/machine-learning-in-finance-theory-and-applications/|title=Machine Learning in Finance: Theory and Applications|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=marketsmedia.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qminitiative.org/UserFiles/files/S_Cl%C3%A9men%C3%A7on_ML.pdf|title=A Machine-Learning View of Quantitative Finance|author=|date=|website=qminitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such data science and machine learning Master's graduates are also in demand as quantitative analysts.

==Types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

===Front office quantitative analyst===
In sales &amp; trading, quantitative analysts work to determine prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically this was a distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, and it is now difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of [[algorithmic trading]] it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.

===Quantitative investment management===
Quantitative analysis is used extensively by asset managers. Some, such as FQ, AQR or Barclays, rely almost exclusively on quantitative strategies while others, such as Pimco, Blackrock or Citadel use a mix of quantitative and fundamental methods.

===Library quantitative analysis===
Major firms invest large sums in an attempt to produce standard methods of evaluating prices and risk. These differ from front office tools in that Excel is very rare, with most development being in C++, though Java and C# are sometimes used in non-performance critical tasks. LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as [[Monte Carlo methods]] and [[finite difference methods]], as well as the nature of the products being modeled.

===Algorithmic trading quantitative analyst===
Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from [[signal processing]], [[game theory]], gambling [[Kelly criterion]], [[market microstructure]], [[econometrics]], and [[time series]] analysis. [[Algorithmic trading]] includes [[statistical arbitrage]], but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].

===Risk management===
This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is [[value at risk]], and this is backed up with various forms of [[stress test (financial)]], [[economic capital]] analysis and direct analysis of the positions and models used by various bank's divisions.

===Innovation===
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there surfaced the recognition that quantitative valuation methods were generally too narrow in their approach. An agreed upon fix adopted by numerous financial institutions has been to improve collaboration.

===Model validation===
Model validation (MV) takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.

===Quantitative developer===
Quantitative developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quantitative models. They tend to be highly specialised language technicians that bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.

==Mathematical and statistical approaches==
Because of their backgrounds, quantitative analysts draw from various forms of mathematics: [[statistics]] and [[probability]], [[calculus]] centered around [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[econometrics]]. Some on the buy side may use [[machine learning]]. The
majority of quantitative analysts have received little formal education in mainstream economics, and often apply a mindset drawn from the physical sciences. Quants use mathematical skills learned from diverse fields such as computer science, physics and engineering. These skills include (but are not limited to) advanced statistics,  linear algebra and partial differential equations as well as solutions to these based upon [[numerical analysis]].

Commonly used numerical methods are:
* [[Finite difference method]] &amp;ndash; used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s;
* [[Monte Carlo method]] &amp;ndash; Also used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s, but [[Monte Carlo simulation]] is also common in risk management;
* [[Ordinary least squares]] &amp;ndash; used to estimate parameters in [[regression analysis|statistical regression analysis]];
* [[Spline interpolation]] &amp;ndash; used to interpolate values from [[yield curve|spot and forward interest rates curves]], and [[volatility smile]]s;
* [[Bisection method|Bisection]], [[Newton method|Newton]], and [[Secant method]]s &amp;ndash; used to find the [[root of a function|roots]], [[maxima and minima]] of functions (e.g. [[internal rate of return]].)

==Techniques==
A typical problem for a mathematically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative product. These quantitative analysts tend to rely more on numerical analysis than statistics and econometrics. The mindset is to prefer a deterministically "correct" answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only [[law of one price|one correct price]] for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations).

A typical problem for a statistically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. The model might include a company's book value to price ratio, its trailing earnings to price ratio, and other accounting factors. An investment manager might implement this analysis by buying the underpriced stocks, selling the overpriced stocks, or both. Statistically oriented quantitative analysts tend to have more of a reliance on statistics and econometrics, and less of a reliance on sophisticated numerical techniques and object-oriented programming. These quantitative analysts tend to be of the psychology that enjoys trying to find the best approach to modeling data, and can accept that there is no "right answer" until time has passed and we can retrospectively see how the model performed. Both types of quantitative analysts demand a strong knowledge of sophisticated mathematics and computer programming proficiency.

One of the principal mathematical tools of quantitative finance is [[stochastic calculus]].

Gaudí's work on the building is part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]],&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; and in November 2010 [[Pope Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI]] consecrated and proclaimed it a [[minor basilica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexander |last=Drummer |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-29981?l=english |title=Pontiff to Proclaim Gaudí's Church a Basilica |publisher=ZENIT |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925095015/http://www.zenit.org/article-29981?l=english |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b2_en.htm |title=The Pope Consecrates The Church of the Sagrada Familia |publisher=Vatican Information Service |location=[[Vatican City]] |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uAAUTwy8?url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b2_en.htm |archivedate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNSvisit"&gt;{{cite web |date=4 March 2010 |title=Pope to visit Santiago de Compostela, Barcelona in November |author=Delaney, Sarah |publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000887.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100407164905/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000887.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinct from a [[cathedral]], which must be the seat of a bishop.

In 1882, construction of Sagrada Família started under architect [[Francisco de Paula del Villar]]. In 1883, when Villar resigned,&lt;ref name= UNESCO/&gt; Gaudí took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and curvilinear [[Art Nouveau]] forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, when he was run down by a streetcar, less than a quarter of the project was complete.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

Relying solely on private donations, Sagrada Familia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the [[Spanish Civil War]], only to resume intermittent progress in the 1950s. Since commencing construction in 1882, advancements in technologies such as [[computer aided design]] and computerised [[numerical control]] (CNC) have enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important [[List of major biblical figures|Biblical figure]] in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt; It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026—the centenary of Gaudí's death. 

The basilica has a long history of dividing the citizens of Barcelona: over the initial possibility it might compete with [[Cathedral of Santa Eulalia|Barcelona's cathedral]], over Gaudí's design itself, over the possibility that work after Gaudí's death disregarded his design,&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; and the 2007 proposal to build an underground tunnel of Spain's [[AVE|high-speed rail]] link to France which could disturb its stability.&lt;ref name="nyt4"&gt;{{cite news| title = Warning: Trains Coming.

==History==
[[File:Inside Sagrada familia - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|300px|left|A model of the completed church]]

===Background===
The Basilica of the Sagrada Família was the inspiration of a bookseller, Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of Asociación Espiritual de Devotos de San José (Spiritual Association of Devotees of St. Joseph).&lt;ref name=gbc&gt;The Gaudí &amp; Barcelona Club [http://www.gaudiclub.com/ingles/i_vida/i_sagr.html Sagrada Família]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a visit to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1872, Bocabella returned from Italy with the intention of building a church inspired by [[Basilica della Santa Casa|the basilica]] at [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]].&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; The apse crypt of the church, funded by donations, was begun 19 March 1882, on the festival of St. Joseph, to the design of the architect [[Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano|Francisco de Paula del Villar]], whose plan was for a [[Gothic revival]] church of a standard form.&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; The apse crypt was completed before Villar's resignation on 18 March 1883, when Gaudí assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed radically.&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; Antoni Gaudí began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect Director until 1884.

===Construction===
[[File:Sagrada familia construction differences.jpg|thumb|New stonework at the Sagrada Família is clearly visible against the stained and weathered older sections.]]
On the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaudí is said to have remarked: "My client is not in a hurry."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; When Gaudí died in 1926, the basilica was between 15 and 25 percent complete.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news | title = ARCHITECTURE: Gaudí's Unfinished Masterpiece Is Virtually Complete | journal=The New York Times|first=Valerie|last= Gladstone|date= 22 August 2004 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/arts/architecture-gaudi-s-unfinished-masterpiece-is-virtually-complete.html?scp=10&amp;sq=gaudi%20sagrada%20familia&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gaudí's death, work continued under the direction of [[Domènec Sugrañes i Gras]] until interrupted by the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936.

Parts of the unfinished basilica and Gaudí's models and workshop were destroyed during the war by [[Anarchist Catalonia|Catalan anarchists]]. The present design is based on reconstructed versions of the plans that were burned in a fire as well as on modern adaptations. Since 1940 the architects Francesc Quintana, [[Isidre Puig Boada]], Lluís Bonet i Gari and Francesc Cardoner have carried on the work. The illumination was designed by [[Carles Buïgas]].
The current director and son of Lluís Bonet, Jordi Bonet i Armengol, has been introducing computers into the design and construction process since the 1980s. [[Mark Burry]] of New Zealand serves as Executive Architect and Researcher. Sculptures by [[J. Busquets]], [[Etsuro Sotoo]] and the controversial [[Josep Maria Subirachs]] decorate the fantastical façades. Barcelona-born Jordi Fauli took over as chief architect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Completion Date for Sagrada Família, Helped by Technology|url = http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/a-completion-date-for-sagrada-familia-helped-by-technology_o|website = Architect|accessdate = 9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central [[nave]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] was completed in 2000 and the main tasks since then have been the construction of the [[transept]] vaults and [[apse]]. {{As of|2006}}, work concentrated on the crossing and supporting structure for the main tower of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory façade.

The church shares its site with the [[Sagrada Família Schools]] building, a school originally designed by Gaudí in 1909 for the children of the construction workers. Relocated in 2002 from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, the building now houses an exhibition.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[File:SagradaFamiliaRoof2.jpg|thumb|Base of the Christ Tower under construction (2009).]]

Chief architect Jordi Fauli announced in October 2015 that construction is 70 percent complete and has entered its final phase of raising six immense towers. The towers and most of the church's structure are to be completed by 2026, the centennial of Gaudí's death; decorative elements should be complete by 2030 or 2032. Visitor entrance fees of 15–20 euros finance the annual construction budget of 25{{nbsp}}million euros .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barcelona's La Sagrada Familia Basilica enters final years of construction|url = http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/22/barcelonas-la-sagrada-familia-basilica-enters-final-years-of-construction|website = Toronto Sun|accessdate = 9 November 2015|first = Joseph|last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CAD/CAM|Computer-aided design]] technology has been used to accelerate construction of the building. Current technology allows stone to be shaped off-site by a [[Numerical control|CNC milling]] machine, whereas in the 20th century the stone was carved by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Paul ({{Nowrap|January 2009}}).

In 2008, some renowned Catalan architects advocated halting construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fancelli, Agustí |date=4 December 2008 |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/parar/Sagrada/Familia/elpepicul/20081204elpepicul_4/Tes |title=¿Por qué no parar la Sagrada Familia? |trans-title=Why not stop the Sagrada Familia? |language=Spanish |accessdate=7 July 2010}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/parar/Sagrada/Familia/elpepicul/20081204elpepicul_4/Tes&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt; to respect Gaudí's original designs, which although they were not exhaustive and were partially destroyed, have been partially reconstructed in recent years.&lt;ref name=Burry&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaudí Unseen |last1=Burry |first1=Mark |last2=Gaudí |first2=Antoni |publisher=Jovis Verlag |location=Berlin |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-939633-78-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AVE tunnel===
Since 2013, [[AVE]] high-speed trains have passed near the Sagrada Família through an underground tunnel that runs beneath the centre of Barcelona.

The tunnel's construction, which began on 26 March 2010, was controversial. The Ministry of Public Works of Spain (''Ministerio de Fomento'') claimed the project posed no risk to the church.&lt;ref name="tbm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ADIF (Administrator of Railway Infrastructures)|title=Madrid&amp;nbsp;– Zaragoza Barcelona&amp;nbsp;– French Border Line Barcelona Sants-Sagrera&amp;nbsp;– high-speed tunnel|url=http://www.adif.es/en_US/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/madrid_barcelona_frontera_francesa/tunel_sagrera.shtml|accessdate=9 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621024109/http://www.adif.es/en_US/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/madrid_barcelona_frontera_francesa/tunel_sagrera.shtml|archivedate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagrada Família engineers and architects disagreed, saying there was no guarantee that the tunnel would not affect the stability of the building. The Board of the Sagrada Família (''Patronat de la Sagrada Família'') and the neighborhood association ''AVE pel Litoral'' (AVE by the Coast) had led a campaign against this route for the AVE, without success.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In October 2010, the [[tunnel boring machine]] reached the church underground under the location of the building's principal façade.&lt;ref name="tbm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Comorera|first=Ramon |title=La tuneladora del AVE perfora ya a cuatro metros de la Sagrada Família |trans-title=The tunnel boring machine of the AVE is already excavating four meters from the Sagrada Família |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/barcelona/20101013/sagrada-familia-pasa-primer-test-del-ave/530676.shtml|accessdate=9 November 2010|newspaper=El Periódico de Catalunya|date=13 October 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service through the tunnel was inaugurated on 8 January 2013.&lt;ref name="AVEopen"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/ave-alcanza-girona-2288906| title= El AVE alcanza Girona| accessdate=8 January 2013| date= 8 January 2013| newspaper= [[El Periódico de Catalunya]]| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Track in the tunnel makes use of a system by [[Edilon Sedra]] in which the rails are embedded in an elastic material to dampen vibrations.&lt;ref name="Periodico_2012-03-11A"&gt;{{cite news|last=Comorera|first=Ramon |title=Doble aislante de vibraciones en las obras de Gaudí|trans-title=Double Isolation of Vibrations at the Gaudí constructions|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/barcelona/doble-aislante-vibraciones-las-obras-gaudi-1526442|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=El Periódico de Catalunya|date=12 March 2012 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; No damage to the Sagrada Família has been reported to date.

===Consecration===
The main nave was covered and an organ installed in mid-2010, allowing the still-unfinished building to be used for religious services.&lt;ref name="elpais"&gt;{{cite web | author=Montañés, José Ángel |date=13 March 2009 |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Sagrada/Familia/abrira/culto/septiembre/2010/elpepuespcat/20090313elpcat_2/Tes |title=La Sagrada Familia se abrirá al culto en septiembre de 2010| work=[[El País]] |accessdate=19 June 2009 |language=Spanish}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.elpais.com/articulo/cataluna/Sagrada/Familia/abrira/culto/septiembre/2010/elpepuespcat/20090313elpcat_2/Tes&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 English tr])&lt;/ref&gt; The church was [[Consecration|consecrated]] by Pope [[Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI]] on 7 November 2010 in front of a congregation of 6,500&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11705036 | title =Pope Benedict consecrates Barcelona's Sagrada Familia | date = 7 November 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further 50,000 people followed the consecration [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] from outside the basilica, where more than 100&amp;nbsp;bishops and 300&amp;nbsp;priests were on hand to offer [[Holy Communion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Visita histórica del Papa a Barcelona para dedicar la Sagrada Família | url = http://www.lavanguardia.es/ciudadanos/noticias/20101107/54065744060/visita-historica-del-papa-a-barcelona-para-dedicar-la-sagrada-familia.html | newspaper=La Vanguardia | date = 7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on 9 July 2017, there is an international mass celebrated at the basilica on every Sunday and [[holy day of obligation]], at 9 a.m, open to the public (until the church is full). Occasionally, Mass is celebrated at other times, where attendance requires an invitation. When masses are scheduled, instructions to obtain an invitation are posted on the basilica's website.

==Design==
[[File:Σαγράδα Φαμίλια 2941.jpg|thumb|right|East view, with the Nativity façade (2017)]]

The style of la Sagrada Família is variously likened to [[Spanish Gothic architecture|Spanish Late Gothic]], [[Catalan Modernism]] and to [[Art Nouveau]] or Catalan [[Noucentisme]]. While the Sagrada Família falls within the Art Nouveau period, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] points out that, along with [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, Gaudí carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration.&lt;ref name=Pevsner/&gt;

===Plan===
While never intended to be a [[cathedral]] (seat of a bishop), the Sagrada Família was planned from the outset to be a cathedral-sized building.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as [[Burgos Cathedral]], [[León Cathedral]] and [[Seville Cathedral]]. In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Família is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an [[ambulatory]] with a [[chevet]] of seven [[apsidal]] chapels, a multitude of towers and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of this church has an unusual feature: a covered passage or [[cloister]] which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the [[narthex]] of each of its three portals. With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar's crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaudí's design or its deviations from traditional church architecture.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  There are no exact [[right angle]]s to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|last2=Handy|first2=Amy|title=The Annotated Arch: A Crash Course in the History of Architecture|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rdiFhC6XOWwC|accessdate=26 October 2018|volume=2|date=11 April 2001|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=9780740710247|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaudí|first1=Antoni |last2=Cuito|first2=Aurora |last3=Montes|first3=Cristina |title=Gaudí|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f90NukJl5cIC|accessdate=26 October 2018|year=2002|publisher=A. Asppan S.L|isbn=9788489439917|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spires===
Gaudí's original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the [[Twelve Apostles]],&lt;ref&gt;Note: the two Apostles who are also Evangelists are left out and replaced by St. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and also St. [[Barnabas]].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], the [[four Evangelists]] and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ. Eight spires have been built {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, corresponding to four apostles at the Nativity façade and four apostles at the Passion façade.

According to the 2005 "Works Report" of the project's official website, drawings signed by Gaudí and recently found in the Municipal Archives, indicate that the spire of the Virgin was in fact intended by Gaudí to be shorter than those of the evangelists. The spire height will follow Gaudí's intention, which according to the report will work with the existing foundation.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} 

The Evangelists' spires will be surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull ([[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]]), a winged man ([[Matthew the Apostle|Saint Matthew]]), an eagle ([[John the Evangelist|Saint John]]), and a winged lion ([[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]]). The central spire of Jesus Christ is to be surmounted by a giant [[Christian cross|cross]]; its total height ({{convert|170|m|ft}}) will be one metre less than that of [[Montjuïc]] hill in Barcelona as Gaudí believed that his creation should not surpass God's. The lower spires are surmounted by communion hosts with sheaves of wheat and chalices with bunches of grapes, representing the [[Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Plans call for tubular bells to be placed within the spires, driven by the force of the wind, and driving sound down into the interior of the church. Gaudí performed acoustic studies to achieve the appropriate acoustic results inside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Álvaro Muñoz |first1=Mari Carmen |last2=Llop i Bayo |first2=Francesc |title=Tubular bell |url=http://www.campaners.com/php/catedral.php?numer=2043 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only one bell is currently in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inventario de campanas de las Catedrales de España |url=http://www.campaners.com/php/cat_campanes1.php?numer=2043 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of the spires will make Sagrada Família the [[List of tallest church buildings|tallest church building in the world]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Façades===
[[File:TTTT6.JPG|thumb|right|The Nativity façade]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
The Church will have three grand façades: the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] façade to the East, the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] façade to the West, and the [[Glory (religion)|Glory]] façade to the South (yet to be completed). The Nativity Façade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaudí influence. The Passion façade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the towers, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the [[Christian cross|Cross]]. These controversial designs are the work of [[Josep Maria Subirachs]]. The Glory façade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the [[Seven deadly sins]] and the [[Seven heavenly virtues]].

====Nativity Façade====
[[File:Die Geburtsfassade der Sagrada Familia im Detail.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the choir of angel children]]

Constructed between 1894 and 1930, the Nativity façade was the first façade to be completed. Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaudí's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the façade, and are symbolic of change.

The façade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The [[Tree of Life]] rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity. Four towers complete the façade and are each dedicated to a Saint ([[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], [[Barnabas]], [[Jude the Apostle]], and [[Simon the Zealot]]).

Originally, Gaudí intended for this façade to be [[polychrome]]d, for each [[archivolt]] to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bergós i Massó | first = Joan | title = Gaudí, l'home i l'obra | year = 1999 | publisher=Ed. Lunwerg |place= Barcelona | isbn= 84-7782-617-X |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudí chose this façade to embody the structure and decoration of the whole church. He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this façade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Façade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Façade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barral i Altet | first = Xavier | title = Art de Catalunya. Arquitectura religiosa moderna i contemporània | year = 1999 | publisher=L'isard |place= Barcelona | isbn = 84-89931-14-3 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the statues were destroyed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and subsequently were reconstructed by the Japanese artist [[Etsuro Sotoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalannews.com/life-style/item/first-door-of-the-nativity-facade-of-the-sagrada-familia-has-now-been-fitted|title=First door of the Nativity Façade of the Sagrada Família has now been fitted|last=Sendra|first=Enric|date=17 July 2014|website=Catalan News|access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Passion Façade====
[[File:SF - Passió 2018-m.jpg|thumb|right|Passion façade of the Sagrada Família in 2018]]
In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Façade, the Passion Façade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his [[crucifixion]], the façade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaudí for future architects and sculptors. The towers were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the façade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaudí intended for this façade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to "break" arcs and "cut" columns, and to use the effect of [[chiaroscuro]] (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.

Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Façade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble [[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]] trunks. Above there is a pyramidal [[pediment]], made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four towers is dedicated to an apostle ([[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]]) and, like the Nativity Façade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.

The scenes sculpted into the façade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an ''S'' form and reproduce the stations of the Cross ([[Via Crucis]] of Christ).&lt;ref name="gimeno"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gómez Gimeno | first = María José | title = La Sagrada Família | year = 2006 | publisher=Mundo Flip Ediciones | isbn = 84-933983-4-9 |pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the [[Last Supper]], [[Kiss of Judas]], [[Ecce homo]], and the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]]. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes [[The Three Marys]], Saint [[Longinus]], [[Saint Veronica]], and a [[hollow-face illusion]] of Christ on the [[Veil of Veronica]]. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the [[Resurrection of Christ]] can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the towers of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the [[Ascension of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html |title=La Sagrada Familia abrirá al culto en 2008, según sus responsables |trans-title=The Sagrada Familia opens for worship in 2008, according to its leaders |date=2 June 2005 | agency=Europa Press |language=Spanish| publisher=Mundinteractivos, SA |work=El Mundo| accessdate=7 July 2010 }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The largest and most striking of the façades will be the Glory Façade, on which construction began in 2002. It will be the principal façade and will offer access to the central [[nave]]. Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while [[Hell]] is left for those who deviate from God's will. Aware that he would not live long enough to see this façade completed, Gaudí made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were base for the development of the design for the façade. The completion of this façade may require the partial demolition of the block with buildings across the Carrer de Mallorca.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.barcelonas.com/future-of-la-sagrada-familia.html&lt;/ref&gt;


To reach the Glory Portico the large staircase will lead over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. On other projects Carrer de Mallorca will have to go underground.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AA012c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground. The portico will have seven large columns dedicated to [[gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. At the base of the columns there will be representations of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], and at the top, The [[Seven Heavenly Virtues|Seven Virtues]].
*'''Gifts''': wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord.
*'''Sins''': greed, anger, pride, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy.
*'''Virtues''': kindness, diligence, patience, charity, temperance, humility, chastity.
[[File:Puerta Gloria.jpg|thumb|right|Eucharist Door of the Glory Facade showing, at bottom, the "A...G" for Anoni Gaudí]]
This facade will have five doors corresponding to the five naves of the temple, with the central one having a triple entrance, that will give the Glory Façade a total seven doors representing the sacraments:

*[[Baptism]]
*[[Confirmation]]
*[[Eucharist]]
*[[Penance]]
*[[Holy orders]]
*[[Marriage]]
*[[Unction of the sick]]

In September 2008, the doors of the Glory façade, by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], were installed.  Inscribed with the [[Lord's prayer]], these central doors are inscribed with the words "Give us our daily bread" in fifty different languages.  The handles of the door are the letters "A" and "G" that form the initials of Antoni Gaudí within the phrase "lead us not into temptation".

===Interior===

File:La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona, Spain - panoramio (2).jpg
File:Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia,_Columns.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The central nave vaults reach {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} while the side nave vaults reach {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a 7.5{{nbsp}}metre (25&amp;nbsp;ft) grid. However, the columns of the [[apse]], resting on del Villar's foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. Gaudí intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse; thus the graduated increase in vault loft.

There are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view down into the crypt below.

The columns of the interior are a unique Gaudí design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counter-clockwise).

Essentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration.

====Organ====
In 2010 an [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard.

To overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church's architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8000 pipes when completed.&lt;ref&gt;Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat, [http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903070257/http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf |date=3 September 2011 }} {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometric details===
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

[[File:AlphaOmega.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alpha and Omega]] carving at Sagrada Família entrance]]

The towers on the Nativity façade are crowned with [[Mathematics and art|geometrically shaped]] tops that are reminiscent of [[Cubism]] (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of [[Art Nouveau]], but Gaudí's unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization.

Gaudí used [[hyperboloid structure]]s in later designs of the Sagrada Família (more obviously after 1914), however there are a few places on the nativity façade—a design not equated with Gaudí's [[ruled surface|ruled-surface]] design—where the [[hyperboloid]] crops up. For example, all around the scene with the pelican there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures). There is a hyperboloid adding structural stability to the cypress tree (by connecting it to the bridge). And finally, the "bishop's mitre" spires are capped with hyperboloid structures.&lt;ref name=BDM&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. C. |last1=Burry |first2=J. R. |last2=Burry |first3=G.

===Symbolism===
[[File:SagradaFamiliaSanctus.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a tower of the Passion Façade decorated with the word [[Sanctus]]]]
Themes throughout the decoration include words from the liturgy. The towers are decorated with words such as "Hosanna", "Excelsis", and "Sanctus"; the great doors of the Passion façade reproduce excerpts of the [[Passion of Jesus]] from the New Testament in various languages, mainly [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; and the Glory façade is to be decorated with the words from the [[Apostles' Creed]], while its main door reproduce the entire [[Lord's Prayer]] in Catalan, surrounded by multiple variations of "Give us this day our daily bread" in other languages. The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ's life. The Nativity Façade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory façade is dedicated to his glory period. The Passion façade is symbolic of his suffering. The apse tower bears Latin text of [[Hail Mary]]. All in all, the Sagrada Família is symbolic of the lifetime of Christ.

Areas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match.

===Burials===

*[[Antoni Gaudí]]

==Appraisal==
The art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaudí's buildings as growing "like [[Sugarloaf|sugar loaves]] and anthills" and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly "bad taste" but handled with vitality and "ruthless audacity".&lt;ref name=Pevsner&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Penguin Books, (1963), pp. 394–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's design itself has been polarizing. Assessments by Gaudí's fellow architects were generally
positive; [[Louis Sullivan]] greatly admired it, describing Sagrada Família as the
"greatest piece of creative architecture in the last twenty-five years. It is spirit symbolised
in stone!"&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;[[David Mower]], ''Gaudí'', Oresko Books Limited, 1977, (p.6) {{ISBN|0905368096}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Walter Gropius]] also praised the Sagrada Família, describing the building's walls as "a marvel of
technical perfection".&lt;ref name="dm" /&gt;

===World Heritage status===
Together with six other Gaudí buildings in Barcelona, part of la Sagrada Família is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], as testifying "to Gaudí's exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology", "having represented el Modernisme of Catalonia" and "anticipated and influenced many of the forms and techniques that were relevant to the development of modern construction in the 20th century". The inscription only includes the Crypt and the Nativity Façade.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 Works of Antoni Gaudí]'', UNESCO World Heritage Centre, Retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visiting==
Visitors can access the Nave, Crypt, Museum, Shop, and the Passion and Nativity towers. Entrance to either of the towers requires a reservation and advance purchase of a ticket. Access is possible only by lift (elevator) and a short walk up the remainder of the towers to the bridge between the towers. Descent is via a very narrow spiral staircase of over 300 steps. There is a posted caution for those with medical conditions.

As of June 2017, on-line ticket purchase has been available. As of August 2010, there had been a service whereby visitors could buy an entry code either at Servicaixa [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] kiosks (part of "La Caixa") or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/tickets/ |website=Basílica de la Sagrada Família |title=Tickets |access-date=8 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608050100/http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/tickets/ |archive-date=8 June 2017 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the peak season, May to October, reservation delays for entrance of up to a few days are not unusual.

==Funding and Building permit==
Construction on Sagrada Família is not supported by any government or official church sources.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement ==
If &lt;math&gt;\{v_1, \dots, v_m\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; [[Linear independence|linearly independent]] vectors in a vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{w_1, \dots, w_n\}&lt;/math&gt; [[Linear span|span]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, then:

1. &lt;math&gt;m \leq n&lt;/math&gt;;

2. Possibly after reordering the &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\{v_1, \dots, v_m, w_{m+1}, \dots, w_n\}&lt;/math&gt; spans &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof==

Suppose that we have the indicated sets of vectors. We wish to show that for each &lt;math&gt;k \in \{0, \dots, m\}&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;k \le n&lt;/math&gt;, and that the set &lt;math&gt;\{v_1, \dotsc, v_k, w_{k + 1}, \dotsc, w_n\}&lt;/math&gt; spans &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (where the &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt; have possibly been reordered, and the reordering depends on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;). We proceed by [[mathematical induction]] on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

For the base case, suppose &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is zero.
In this case, the claim holds because there are no vectors &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the set &lt;math&gt;\{w_1, \dotsc, w_n\}&lt;/math&gt; spans &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; by hypothesis.

For the inductive step, assume the proposition is true for some &lt;math&gt;k &lt; m&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;v_{k+1}\in V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{ v_1,\ldots, v_k,w_{k+1},\ldots,w_n\}&lt;/math&gt; spans &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (by the induction hypothesis), there exist coefficients &lt;math&gt;\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;v_{k+1}=\sum_{j=1}^k \mu_j v_j+\sum_{j=k+1}^n \mu_j w_j&lt;/math&gt;.
At least one of &lt;math&gt;\{\mu_{k+1},\ldots,\mu_n\}&lt;/math&gt; must be non-zero, since otherwise this equality would contradict the linear independence of &lt;math&gt;\{ v_1,\ldots,v_m \}&lt;/math&gt;; note that this additionally implies that &lt;math&gt;k+1 \le n&lt;/math&gt;. By reordering the &lt;math&gt;\mu_{k+1}w_{k+1},\ldots,\mu_{n}w_n&lt;/math&gt;, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;\mu_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is not zero. Therefore, we have
: &lt;math&gt;w_{k+1}= \frac{1}{\mu_{k+1}}\left(v_{k+1} - \sum_{j=1}^k \mu_j v_j - \sum_{j=k+2}^n \mu_j w_j\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, &lt;math&gt;w_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is in the span of &lt;math&gt;\{ v_1,\ldots, v_{k+1},w_{k+2},\ldots,w_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. The latter span therefore contains each of the vectors &lt;math&gt; v_1, \ldots, v_k, w_{k+1}, w_{k+2}, \ldots, w_n &lt;/math&gt;, and hence must contain the span of these latter vectors as a subset. But since the latter span is &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (by the induction hypothesis), this simply means that the span of &lt;math&gt;\{ v_1,\ldots, v_{k+1},w_{k+2},\ldots,w_n\}&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as a subset (thus is &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;). We have therefore shown that our claim is true of &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt;, completing the inductive step.

==Applications==
The Steinitz exchange lemma is a basic result in [[computational mathematics]], especially in [[numerical linear algebra|linear algebra]] and in [[Matroid#Greedy_algorithm|combinatorial algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;Page v in Stiefel:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3304">In mathematics, the '''Tutte homotopy theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Tutte|authorlink=William Thomas Tutte|year=1958}}, generalises the concept of "path" from [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] to [[matroid]]s, and states roughly that closed paths can be written as compositions of elementary closed paths, so that in some sense they are homotopic to the trivial closed path.

==Statement==

A [[matroid]] on a set ''Q'' is specified by a class of non-empty subsets ''M'' of ''Q'', called '''circuits''', such that no element of ''M'' contains another, and if ''X'' and ''Y'' are in ''M'', ''a'' is in ''X'' and ''Y'', ''b'' is in ''X'' but not in ''Y'', then there is some ''Z'' in ''M'' containing ''b'' but not ''a'' and contained in ''X''∪''Y''.

The subsets of ''Q'' that are unions of circuits are called '''flats'''.  The elements of ''M'' are called 0-flats, the minimal non-empty flats that are not 0-flats are called 1-flats, the minimal nonempty flats that are not 0-flats or 1-flats are called 2-flats, and so on.

A '''path''' is a finite sequence of 0-flats such that any two consecutive elements of the path lie in some 1-flat.

An '''elementary path''' is one of the form (''X'',''Y'',''X''), or (''X'',''Y'',''Z'',''X'') with ''X'',''Y'',''Z''  all lying in some 2-flat.

Two paths ''P'' and ''Q'' such that the last 0-flat of ''P'' is the same as the first 0-flat of ''Q'' can be composed in the obvious way to give a path ''PQ''.

Two paths are called '''homotopic''' if one can be obtained from the other by the operations of adding or removing elementary paths inside a path, in other words changing a path ''PR'' to ''PQR'' or vice versa, where ''Q'' is elementary.

A weak form of Tutte's homotopy theorem states that any closed path is homotopic to the trivial path. A stronger form states a similar result for paths not meeting certain "convex" subsets.

{{distinguish|Well-ordering principle}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''well-ordering theorem''' states that every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] can be [[well-order]]ed. A set ''X'' is ''well-ordered'' by a [[strict total order]] if every non-empty subset of ''X'' has a [[least element]] under the ordering. This is also known as '''Zermelo's theorem''' and is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] (see also {{section link|Axiom of choice|Equivalents}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqqvbKOC4c8C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15 |title=An introduction to the theory of functional equations and inequalities |page=15 |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-7643-8748-3 |first=Marek |last=Kuczma |year=2009 |authorlink=Marek Kuczma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewIaZqqm46oC&amp;pg=PA458&amp;lpg=PA458 |title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics: Supplement |first=Michiel |last=Hazewinkel |year=2001 |authorlink=Michiel Hazewinkel |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-4020-0198-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Zermelo]] introduced the axiom of choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem. This is important because it makes every set susceptible to the powerful technique of [[transfinite induction]]. The well-ordering theorem has consequences that may seem paradoxical, such as the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]].

==History==
[[Georg Cantor]] considered the well-ordering theorem to be a "fundamental principle of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Georg Cantor (1883), “Ueber unendliche, lineare Punktmannichfaltigkeiten”, ''Mathematische Annalen'' 21, pp. 545–591.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most mathematicians however find it difficult to visualize a well-ordering of, for example, the set '''R''' of [[real number]]s. In 1904, [[Gyula Kőnig]] claimed to have proven that such a well-ordering cannot exist.  A few weeks later, [[Felix Hausdorff]] found a mistake in the proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hausdorff on Ordered Sets|volume=25|series=History of Mathematics|first=J. M.|last=Plotkin|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=9780821890516|year=2005|contribution=Introduction to "The Concept of Power in Set Theory"|pages=23–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_skkA3r-QAC&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It turned out, though, that the well-ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice, in the sense that either one together with the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] is sufficient to prove the other, in [[first order logic]] (the same applies to [[Zorn's Lemma]]). In [[second order logic]], however, the well-ordering theorem is strictly stronger than the axiom of choice: from the well-ordering theorem one may deduce the axiom of choice, but from the axiom of choice one cannot deduce the well-ordering theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stewart Shapiro |first=Stewart |last=Shapiro |year=1991 |title=Foundations Without Foundationalism: A Case for Second-Order Logic |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-853391-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
The well-ordering theorem follows from [[Zorn's lemma]]. Take the set ''A'' of all well-orderings of subsets of ''X'': an element of ''A'' is an ordered pair (''a'',''b'') where ''a'' is a subset of ''X'' and ''b'' is a well-ordering of ''a''. ''A'' can be [[partially ordered]] by continuation. That means, define ''E'' ≤ ''F'' if ''E'' is an [[initial segment]] of ''F'' and the ordering of the members of ''E'' is the same as their ordering in ''F''. If ''E'' is a [[total order|chain]] in ''A'', then the union of the sets in ''E'' can be ordered in a way that makes it a continuation of any set in ''E''; this ordering is a well-ordering, and therefore, an upper bound of ''E'' in ''A''. We may therefore apply Zorn's Lemma to conclude that ''A'' has a maximal element, say (''M'',''R''). The set ''M'' must be equal to ''X'', for if ''X'' has an element ''x'' not in ''M'', then the set ''M''∪{''x''} has a well-ordering that restricts to ''R'' on ''M'', and for which ''x'' is larger than all elements of ''M''. This well ordered set is a continuation of (''M'',''R''), contradicting its maximality, therefore ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''. Now ''R'' is a well-ordering of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Halmos |first=Paul |last=Halmos |year=1960 |title=Naive Set Theory |publisher=Litton Educational |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Axiom of Choice can be proven from the well-ordering theorem as follows. To make a choice function for a collection of non-empty sets, ''E'', take the union of the sets in ''E'' and call it ''X''. There exists a well-ordering of ''X''; let ''R'' be such an ordering. The function that to each set ''S'' of ''E'' associates the smallest element of ''S'', as ordered by (the restriction to ''S'' of) ''R'', is a choice function for the collection ''E''. An essential point of this proof is that it involves only a single arbitrary choice, that of ''R''; applying the well-ordering theorem to each member ''S'' of ''E'' separately would not work, since the theorem only asserts the existence of a well-ordering, and choosing for each ''S'' a well-ordering would not be easier than choosing an element.

He was born in [[Comber]], [[County Down]] and educated at [[Methodist College Belfast]] and [[Queen's College, Belfast]] under [[John Purser (mathematician)|John Purser]], before entering [[St John's College, Cambridge]] and graduating as [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=OR885WM|name=Orr, William McFadden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a fellow of his college, and became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1909.

He was appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal College of Science for Ireland]] in 1892 and professor of [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]] when the college merged with [[University College Dublin]] in 1926.  He retired in 1933 and died in 1934, and is interred in [[Mount Jerome Cemetery]], Dublin.
