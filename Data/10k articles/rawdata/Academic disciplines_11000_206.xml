The APEX Business-IT Global Case Challenge is an annual event held in May which typically lasts for 4 or 5 days. Each year, the competition features a unique, “live” case which highlights genuine challenges that businesses face. Participating teams compete in a 24-hour deliberation to develop and present integrated solutions that use [[IT]] to address these challenges and meet business needs.&lt;ref name="SMU hosts inaugural international business-IT competition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apex.smu.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SMU-hosts-inaugural-intl-business-IT-competition.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023054924/http://apex.smu.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SMU-hosts-inaugural-intl-business-IT-competition.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2014 |title=SMU hosts inaugural international business-IT competition |last=Zhang |first=Y |publisher=The Business Times |date=4 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the competition, participants also partake in a topical workshop held by industry experts.

[[Image:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|An illustration of Hero's aeolipile]]
An '''aeolipile''' (or '''aeolipyle''', or '''eolipile'''), also known as a '''Hero's engine''', is a simple bladeless [[radial turbine|radial steam turbine]] which spins when the central water container is heated. Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine, much like a [[tip jet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/J/jet_engine.html jet engine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or rocket engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html NASA Glenn Learning Technologies Project (LTP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Hero of Alexandria]] described the device in [[Roman Egypt]], and many sources give him the credit for its invention.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Herons von Alexandria Druckwerke und Automatentheater|author-last=Hero|author-link=Hero of Alexandria|others=Wilhelm Schmidt (translator)|place=Leipzig|publisher=B.G. Teubner|date=1899|language =Greek, German|url=https://archive.org/stream/heronsvonalexandhero#page/228/mode/2up|pages=228–232|chapter=Pneumatika, Book II, Chapter XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aeolipile Hero described is considered to be the first recorded [[steam engine]] or reaction [[steam turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;"turbine." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 July 2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45691&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name – derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word Αἴολος and [[Latin]] word ''pila'' – translates to "the ball of [[Aeolus]]", Aeolus being the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of the air and wind.

Pre-dating Heron's writings, a device called an aeolipile was described in the 1st century BC by [[Vitruvius]] in his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''; however, it is unclear if it is the same device or a predecessor, as he does not mention rotating parts.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"/&gt;

==Description and physics==
[[Image:Herosenginesmall.jpg|thumb|A classroom model of an aeolipile]]
The aeolipile consists of a vessel, usually a "simple" [[solid of revolution]], such as a [[sphere]] or a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], arranged to rotate on its axis, having oppositely bent or curved [[nozzle]]s projecting from it ([[tipjets]]). When the vessel is pressurized with steam, steam is expelled through the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the [[rocket engine|rocket]] principle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/aeolipile.html Aeolipile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of the 2nd and 3rd of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]]), or [[torque]], causing the vessel to spin about its axis. Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed ([[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) and consume the accelerating torque, eventually cancelling it and achieving a [[steady state]] speed.

Typically, and as Heron described the device, the water is heated in a simple [[boiler]] which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel. Where this is the case, the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the [[wiktionary:Pivot|pivot]]s for the chamber. Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler, and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot/bearing arrangements, as they then do not need to pass steam. This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model to the right.

==History==
[[File:Aeolipile (from Pneumatica).jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from Hero's ''Pneumatica'']]
Both Heron and Vitruvius draw on the much earlier work by [[Ctesibius]] (285–222 BC), Ctesibius or Ktesibios or Tesibius was an inventor and mathematician in [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]]. He wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps.

===Vitruvius's description===
[[Vitruvius]] (c. 80 BC – c. 15 AD) mentions aeolipiles by name:

"Æolipylæ are hollow brazen vessels, which have an opening or mouth of small size, by means of which they can be filled with water.  Prior to the water being heated over the fire, but little wind is emitted. As soon, however, as the water begins to boil, a violent wind issues forth."&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"&gt;''"De Architectura": Chapter VI (paragraph 2)&lt;br /&gt;from "Ten Books on Architecture" by [[Vitruvius]] (1st century BC), published 17, June, 08 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html] accessed 2009-07-07&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heron's description===
Heron (c. 10–70 AD) takes a more practical approach, in that he gives instructions how to make one:

{{quote|№ 50. The Steam-Engine.&lt;br /&gt;
PLACE a cauldron over a fire: a ball shall revolve on a pivot. A fire is lighted under a cauldron, A B, (fig. 50), containing water, and covered at the mouth by the lid C D; with this the bent tube E F G communicates, the extremity of the tube being fitted into a hollow ball, H K. Opposite to the extremity G place a pivot, L M, resting on the lid C D; and let the ball contain two bent pipes, communicating with it at the opposite extremities of a diameter, and bent in opposite directions, the bends being at right angles and across the lines F G, L M. As the cauldron gets hot it will be found that the steam, entering the ball through E F G, passes out through the bent tubes towards the lid, and causes the ball to revolve, as in the case of the dancing figures.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;}}

==Practical usage==
[[Image:aeolipile.jpg|thumb|right|A modern replica of Hero's aeolipile]]
It is not known whether the aeolipile was put to any practical use in ancient times, and if it was seen as a pragmatic device, a whimsical novelty, an object of reverence, or some other thing. A source described it as a mere curiosity for the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry|last=Gruntman|first=Mike|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=156347705X|location=Reston, VA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hero's drawing shows a standalone device, and was presumably intended as a "temple wonder," like many of the other devices described in ''[[Pneumatica]]''{{what|date=April 2017}}.&lt;ref name = "HeroSteamEngine"&gt;{{citation | title = Pneumatica | chapter = Section 50 – The Steam Engine | author = Hero | place = Alexandria | date = 1851 | origyear = reprint of 1st century CE original | publisher = Taylor Walton and Maberly | publication-place = London | chapter-url =http://himedo.net/TheHopkinThomasProject/TimeLine/Wales/Steam/URochesterCollection/Hero/section50.html | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}   Translated from the original Greek by Bennet Woodcroft '' (Professor of Machinery in [[University College London]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius, on the other hand, mentions use of the aeolipile for demonstrating the physical properties of the weather. He describes the aeolipile as
{{quote|…a scientific invention [to] discover a divine truth lurking in the laws of the heavens.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius" /&gt;}}
After describing the device's construction (see above) he concludes:
{{quote|…Thus from this slight and very short experiment we may understand and judge the mighty and wonderful laws of the heavens and the nature of winds.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius" /&gt;}}In 1543, [[Blasco de Garay]], a scientist and a captain in the Spanish navy, demonstrated before the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V]] and a committee of high officials an invention he claimed could propel large ships in the absence of wind using an apparatus consisted of copper boiler and moving wheels on either side of the ship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation and Technological Diffusion: An economic history of early steam engines|last=Kitsikopoulos|first=Harry|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138948112|location=Oxon|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account was preserved by the royal Spanish archives at [[Simancas]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Floating Palaces of the Great Lakes: A History of Passenger Steamships on the Inland Seas|last=Stone|first=Joe|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=9780472071753|location=Ann Arbor|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that de Garay used Hero's aeolipile and combined it with the technology used in Roman boats and late medieval galleys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Here, de Garay's invention introduced an innovation where the aeolipile had practical usage, which was to generate motion to the paddlewheels, demonstrating the feasibility of steam-driven boats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10596">'''Autoregulation''' is a process within many biological systems, resulting from an internal adaptive mechanism that works to adjust (or mitigate) that system's response to stimuli.  While most systems of the body show some degree of autoregulation, it is most clearly observed in the [[kidney]], the [[heart]], and the [[brain]].&lt;ref name="cvphysiology"&gt;[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Flow/BF004.htm Autoregulation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perfusion]] of these organs is essential for life, and through autoregulation the body can divert blood (and thus, [[oxygen]]) where it is most needed.

==Cerebral autoregulation==
{{Main|Cerebral autoregulation}}
More so than most other organs, the brain is very sensitive to increased or decreased blood flow, and several mechanisms (metabolic, myogenic, and neurogenic) are involved in maintaining an appropriate cerebral blood pressure. Brain blood flow autoregulation is abolished in several disease states such as [[traumatic brain injury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3171/2009.6.PEDS096 | issn = 1933-0715 | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 420–428 | last = Figaji | first = Anthony A. |author2=Eugene Zwane |author3=A.

==Homeometric and heterometric autoregulation of the heart==
'''Homeometric autoregulation''', in the context of the [[circulatory system]], is the heart's ability to increase [[contractility]] and restore [[stroke volume]] when [[afterload]] increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Homeometric autoregulation in the heart |vauthors=Sarnoff SJ, Mitchell JH, Gilmore JP, Remensnyder JP |volume=8 |journal=Circulation Research |issue= 5|year=1960 |pages=1077–1091 |url=http://circres.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/5/1077.pdf |pmid=13746560 |doi=10.1161/01.res.8.5.1077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homeometric autoregulation occurs '''independently of cardiomyocyte fiber length,''' via the Bowditch and/or Anrep effects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470720066.ch14/summary|title=Ciba Foundation Symposium 24 - Physiological Basis of Starling's Law of the Heart|last=Monroe|first=R.

* Via the [[Bowditch effect]], positive [[Inotrope|inotropy]] occurs secondary to an increased cardiac frequency. The exact mechanism for this remains unknown, but it appears to be the result of an increased exposure of the heart to contractile substances arising from the increased flow caused by an increased cardiac frequency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Via the [[Anrep effect]], positive inotropy occurs secondary to increased ventricular pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This is in contrast to [[Frank–Starling law of the heart|'''heterometric regulation''']], governed by the Frank-Starling law, which results from a more favorable positioning of actin and myosin filaments in cardiomyocytes '''as a result of changing fiber lengths'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology|last=Hall|first=John E.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=9781455770052|location=Philadelphia|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coronary circulatory autoregulation==
Since the heart is a very aerobic organ, needing oxygen for the efficient production of ATP &amp; Creatine Phosphate from fatty acids (and to a smaller extent, glucose &amp; very little lactate), the coronary circulation is auto regulated so that the heart receives the right flow of blood &amp; hence sufficient supply of oxygen. If a sufficient flow of oxygen is met and the resistance in the coronary circulation rises (perhaps due to vasoconstriction), then the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) increases proportionally, to maintain the same flow. In this way, the same flow through the coronary circulation is maintained over a range of pressures. This part of coronary circulatory regulation is known as auto regulation and it occurs over a plateau, reflecting the constant blood flow at varying CPP &amp; resistance. The slope of a CBF (coronary blood flow) vs. CPP graph gives 1/Resistance.

==Renal autoregulation==
{{Main|Tubuloglomerular feedback}}

Regulation of renal blood flow is important to maintaining a stable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite changes in systemic blood pressure (within about 80-180 mmHg).  In a mechanism called [[tubuloglomerular feedback]], the kidney changes its own blood flow in response to changes in sodium concentration.  The sodium chloride levels in the urinary filtrate are sensed by the [[macula densa]] cells at the end of the [[Ascending limb of loop of Henle|ascending limb]].  When sodium levels are moderately increased, the macula densa releases [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11302-009-9148-0 | issn = 1573-9538 | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–471 | last = Bell | first = P.

Bell  | title = Current mechanisms of macula densa cell signalling | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | date = 2004 | pmid = 15283759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[juxtaglomerular cells]] nearby. The juxtaglomerular cells in the afferent arteriole constrict, and juxtaglomerular cells in both the afferent and efferent arteriole decrease their renin secretion.  These actions function to lower GFR.  Further increase in sodium concentration leads to the release of [[nitric oxide]], a vasodilating substance, to prevent excessive vasoconstriction.&lt;ref name="Komlosi 2004 463–469"/&gt;  In the opposite case, juxtaglomerular cells are stimulated to release more renin, which stimulates the [[renin–angiotensin system]], producing angiotensin I which is converted by Angio-Tensin Converting Enzyme  (ACE) to [[angiotensin II]]. Angiotensin II then causes preferential constriction of the efferent arteriole of the glomerulus and increases the GFR.

== Autoregulation of genes ==

This is so-called "steady-state system". An example is a system in which a protein P that is a product of gene G "positively regulates its own production by binding to a regulatory element of the gene coding for it,"&lt;ref name=Jablonka&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Evidence, Mechanisms and Models for the Inheritance of Acquired Characters |author=Jablonka E. |author2=Lachmann M. |author3=Lamb M.J.| journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=158|issue=2|year=1992|pages=245–268 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(05)80722-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the protein gets used or lost at a rate that increases as its concentration increases. This feedback loop creates two possible states "on" and "off". If an outside factor makes the concentration of P increase to some threshold level, the production of protein P is "on", i.e. P will maintain its own concentration at a certain level, until some other stimulus will lower it down below the threshold level, when concentration of P will be insufficient to make gene G express at the rate that would overcome the loss or use of the protein P.
This state ("on" or "off") gets inherited after cell division, since the concentration of protein a usually remains the same after mitosis. However, the state can be easily disrupted by outside factors.
&lt;ref name=Jablonka/&gt;

Similarly, this phenomenon is not only restricted to genes but may also apply to other genetic units, including mRNA transcripts. Regulatory segments of mRNA called a [[Riboswitch]] can autoregulate its transcription by sequestering cis-regulatory elements (particularly the [[Shine-Dalgarno]] sequence) located on the same transcript as the Riboswitch. The Riboswitch stem-loop has a region complementary to the Shine-Dalgarno but is sequestered by complimentary base pairing in the loop. With sufficient ligand, the ligand may bind to the stem-loop and disrupt intermolecular bonding, resulting in the complimentary Shine-Dalgarno stem-loop segment binding to the complimentary Riboswitch segment, preventing Ribosome from binding, inhibiting translation.
&lt;ref name="arXiv:1210.6998 [q-bio.MN]"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Jong-Chin|last2=Thirumalai|first2=D.|title=Gene Regulation by Riboswitches with and without Negative Feedback Loop|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=103|issue=11|date=2012-10-25|pages=12|arxiv=1210.6998|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2012.10.026|pmid=23283231|pmc=3514527|bibcode=2012BpJ...103.2320L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bark''' is the outermost layers of [[Plant stem|stems]] and [[root]]s of [[woody plant]]s.  Plants with bark include [[tree]]s, woody [[vine]]s, and [[shrub]]s. Bark refers to all the tissues outside the [[vascular cambium]] and is a nontechnical term.&lt;ref name=Raven1981&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Raven | first1 = Peter H. | last2 = Evert | first2 = Ray F. | last3 = Curtis | first3 = Helena | year = 1981 | title = Biology of Plants | page = 641 | isbn = 0-87901-132-7 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, N.Y. | oclc = 222047616}}&lt;/ref&gt; It overlays the wood and consists of the inner bark and the outer bark. The inner bark, which in older [[Plant stem|stem]]s is living tissue, includes the innermost area of the '''periderm'''. The outer bark in older stems includes the dead tissue on the surface of the stems, along with parts of the innermost periderm and all the tissues on the outer side of the periderm. The outer bark on trees which lies external to the last formed periderm is also called the '''rhytidome'''.

Products derived from bark include: bark shingle siding and wall coverings, spices and other flavorings, [[tanbark]] for tannin, [[resin]], [[latex]], medicines, poisons, various [[hallucinogen]]ic chemicals and [[Cork (material)|cork]]. Bark has been used to make cloth, canoes, and ropes and used as a surface for paintings and map making.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Luke. 1996. ''Seeing the Inside: Bark Painting in Western Arnhem Land. Oxford Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of plants are also grown for their attractive or interesting bark colorations and surface textures or their bark is used as landscape [[mulch]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandved, Kjell Bloch, Ghillean T.

==Botanic description==
What is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues.  Cork is an external, secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases, and is also called the phellem. The cork is produced by the [[cork cambium]] which is a layer of [[meristem]]atically active [[cell (biology)|cells]] which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm. The cork cambium, which is also called the phellogen, is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork. The phelloderm, which is not always present in all barks, is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium. Together, the phellem (cork), phellogen (cork cambium) and phelloderm constitute the periderm.&lt;ref name="Dickison, WC 2000"&gt;Dickison, WC. 2000. Integrative Plant Anatomy, Academic Press, San Diego, 186–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork cell walls contain [[suberin]], a waxy substance which protects the stem against water loss, the invasion of insects into the stem, and prevents infections by bacteria and fungal spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.puc.edu/Faculty/Gilbert_Muth/botglosp.htm |title=Botany Glossary "P" |publisher=.puc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cambium tissues, i.e., the cork cambium and the [[vascular cambium]], are the only parts of a woody stem where [[cell division]] occurs; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary [[xylem]] to the inside and secondary [[phloem]] to the outside. Phloem is a [[nutrient]]-conducting tissue composed of sieve tubes or sieve cells mixed with [[parenchyma]] and fibers. The [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] is the primary tissue of [[Plant stem|stem]]s and roots. In stems the cortex is between the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] layer and the phloem, in roots the inner layer is not phloem but the [[pericycle]].

[[File:Tree secondary components diagram.png|thumb|500px|right|Tree cross section diagram]]
From the outside to the inside of a mature woody stem, the layers include:&lt;ref name=Pereira2007&gt;{{Citation | last = Pereira | first =  Helena | year = 2007 | title = Cork | page = 8 | isbn = 0-444-52967-5 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | oclc = 162131397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pine bark tecpan guatemala.JPG|thumb|Bark of a pine tree in [[Tecpán Guatemala|Tecpán]], Guatemala.]]

In young stems, which lack what is commonly called bark, the tissues are, from the outside to the inside:

# [[Epidermis (botany)|Epidermis]], which may be replaced by periderm
# Cortex
# Primary and secondary phloem
# Vascular cambium
# Secondary and primary xylem.

As the stem ages and grows, changes occur that transform the surface of the stem into the bark. The epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body, including the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, that protects the plant from the outside world.  In old stems the epidermal layer, cortex, and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork.  Due to the thickening cork layer these cells die because they do not receive water and nutrients.  This dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and other stems.

==Periderm==
Often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants, which is composed of cork (phellem), the [[cork cambium]] (phellogen), and the phelloderm. The periderm forms from the phellogen which serves as a lateral meristem. The periderm replaces the epidermis, and acts as a protective covering like the epidermis. Mature phellem cells have [[suberin]] in their walls to protect the stem from desiccation and pathogen attack. Older phellem cells are dead, as is the case with woody stems. The skin on the potato tuber (which is an underground stem) constitutes the cork of the periderm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Artschwager | first1 = E | year = 1924 | title = Studies on the potato tuber | url = | journal = J. Agr. Res. | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 809–835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Barker | first2 = W.G. | year = 1979 | title = Early tuber development from explanted stolon nodes of Solanum tuberosum var. Kennebec | url = | journal = Bot. Gaz. | volume = 140 | issue = | pages = 398–406 | doi=10.1086/337104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In woody plants the epidermis of newly grown stems is replaced by the periderm later in the year. As the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis, called the cork cambium, these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork. A limited number of cell layers may form interior to the cork cambium, called the phelloderm.
As the stem grows, the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm, namely the epidermis, cortex and older secondary phloem die.&lt;ref name=Mauseth2003&gt;{{citation| last = Mauseth | first =  James D.| year = 2003| title = Botany: an Introduction to Plant Biology| ISBN=0-7637-2134-4| page = 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the periderm are [[lenticel]]s, which form during the production of the first periderm layer.  Since there are living cells within the cambium layers that need to exchange gases during metabolism, these lenticels, because they have numerous intercellular spaces, allow gaseous exchange with the outside atmosphere. As the bark develops, new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers.

==Rhytidome==
[[File:BarkAndWire-0308.jpg|thumb|right|Living tree bark enveloping [[barbed wire]]]]
The rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark, being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees. It is composed mostly of dead cells and is produced by the formation of multiple layers of [[suberin|suberized]] periderm, cortical and phloem tissue.&lt;ref name="Dickison, WC 2000"/&gt; The rhytidome is especially well developed in older stems and roots of trees. In shrubs, older bark is quickly [[Exfoliation (botany)|exfoliated]] and thick rhytidome accumulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anatomy of Seed Plants |series=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |author=Katherine Easu |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=185 |year= 1977 |isbn=0-471-24520-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally thickest and most distinctive at the trunk or [[Trunk (botany)|bole]] (the area from the ground to where the main branching starts) of the tree.

==Chemical composition==
Bark tissues make up by weight between 10–20% of woody vascular plants and consists of various [[biopolymer]]s, [[tannin]]s, [[lignin]], [[suberin]], suberan and [[polysaccharide]]s.&lt;ref name="bark decay"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vane | first1 = C. H. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2006 | title = Bark decay by the white-rot fungus Lentinula edodes: Polysaccharide loss, lignin resistance and the unmasking of suberin | url = | journal = International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 14–23 | doi=10.1016/j.ibiod.2005.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 40% of the bark tissue is made of lignin which forms an important part of a plant providing structural support by crosslinking between different polysaccharides, such as cellulose.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt;

Condensed [[tannin]], which are in fairly high concentration in bark tissue, is thought to inhibit decomposition.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt; It could be due to this factor that the degradation of lignin is far less pronounced in bark tissue than it is in wood. 
It has been proposed that, in the cork layer (the phellogen), suberin acts as a barrier to microbial degradation and so protects the internal structure of the plant.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kolattukudy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kolattukudy | first1 = P.E. | year = 1984 | title = Biochemistry and function of cutin and suberin | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Botany | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 2918–2933 | doi=10.1139/b84-391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the [[lignin]] in bark wall during decay by the white-rot fungi ''Lentinula edodes'' ([[Shiitake mushroom]]) using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR revealed that the lignin polymers contained more Guaiacyl [[lignin]] units than Syringyl units compared to the interior of the plant.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt; Guaiacyl units are less susceptible to degradation as, compared to syringyl, they contain fewer aryl-aryl bonds, can form a condensed lignin structure and have a lower [[redox potential]].&lt;ref name="Degradation of lignin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vane | first1 = C. H. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = Degradation of Lignin in Wheat Straw during Growth of the Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) Using Off-line Thermochemolysis with Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide and Solid-State 13C NMR | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 2709–2716 | doi=10.1021/jf001409a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could mean that the concentration and type of lignin units could provide additional resistance to fungal decay for plants protected by bark.&lt;ref name="bark decay" /&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Rindenmulch016.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Barkdust|Bark chips]]'']]
Cork, sometimes confused with bark in colloquial speech, is the outermost layer of a woody stem, derived from the [[cork cambium]]. It serves as protection against damage from [[parasite]]s, [[Herbivory|herbivorous]] animals and diseases, as well as dehydration and fire. Cork can contain [[antiseptic]]s like [[tannin]]s, that protect against fungal and bacterial attacks that would cause [[Decomposition|decay]].

In some plants, the bark is substantially thicker, providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges. In the cork oak (''[[Quercus suber]]'') the bark is thick enough to be harvested as a [[cork (material)|cork product]] without killing the tree;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Aronson J. |editor2=Pereira J.S. |editor3=Pausas J.G. |year= 2009 |title=Cork Oak Woodlands on the Edge: conservation, adaptive management, and restoration |publisher=Island Press |location= Washington DC |url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/corkoak.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this species the bark may get very thick (e.g. more than 20&amp;nbsp;cm has been reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paulo Fernandes |url=http://jgpausas.blogs.uv.es/2011/01/03/bark-thickness/ |title=j.g. pausas' blog " Bark thickness: a world record? |doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2010.07.010 |publisher=Jgpausas.blogs.uv.es |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some barks can be removed in long sheets; the smooth surfaced bark of [[birch]] trees has been used as a covering in the making of canoes, as the drainage layer in roofs, for shoes, backpacks etc. The most famous example of using birch bark for canoes is the birch canoes of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Adney, Tappan, and Howard Irving Chapelle. 1964.'' The Bark Canoes and Skin Boats of North America''. Washington: Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner bark ([[phloem]]) of some trees is edible; in Scandinavia, [[bark bread]] is made from [[rye]] to which the toasted and ground innermost layer of bark of [[scots pine]] or [[birch]] is added. The [[Sami people|Sami]] people of far northern Europe used large sheets of ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'' bark that were removed in the spring, prepared and stored for use as a staple food resource and the inner bark was eaten fresh, dried or roasted.&lt;ref name=Zackrisson200&gt;{{citation | last1 = Zackrisson | first1 = O. | last2 = Östlund | first2 = L. | last3 = Korhonen | first3 = O. | last4 = Bergman | first4 = I. | year = 200 | title = The ancient use of Pinus sylvestris L.

=== Mechanical bark processing ===
Bark contains strong fibres known as [[bast fibre|bast]], and there is a long tradition in northern Europe of using bark from [[coppice]]d young branches of the small-leaved lime (''[[Tilia cordata]]'') to produce [[Rope|cordage]] and [[rope]], used for example in the [[rigging]] of [[Viking age]] [[longship]]s.&lt;ref name=Myking&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myking | first1 = T. | last2 = Hertzberg | first2 = A. | last3 = Skrøppa | first3 = T. | year = 2005 | title = History, manufacture and properties of lime bast cordage in northern Europe | url = | journal = Forestry | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 65–71 | doi = 10.1093/forestry/cpi006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the commercial products made from bark are [[cork (material)|cork]], [[cinnamon]], [[quinine]]&lt;ref&gt;Duran-Reynals, Marie Louise de Ayala. 1946. ''The Fever Bark Tree; the Pageant of Quinine''. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; (from the bark of [[Cinchona]])&lt;ref&gt;Markham, Clements R. 1880. ''Peruvian Bark. A Popular Account of the Introduction of Chinchona Cultivation into British India''. London: J. Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aspirin]] (from the bark of [[willow]] trees). The bark of some trees notably oak (''Quercus robur'') is a source of [[tannic acid]], which is used in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. Bark chips generated as a [[by-product]] of [[lumber]] production are often used in bark [[mulch]] in western North America. Bark is important to the horticultural industry since in shredded form it is used for plants that do not thrive in ordinary soil, such as [[epiphyte]]s.

=== Bark chip extraction ===
;Wood Adhesives from Bark-Derived Phenols: Wood Bark has [[lignin]] content and when it is pyrolyzed (subjected to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen), it yields a liquid [[bio-oil]] product rich in [[natural phenol]] derivatives. The phenol derivatives are isolated and recovered for application as a replacement for fossil-based phenols in phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins used in [[Oriented Strand Board]] (OSB) and plywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/fy04/wood_adhesives.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411073832/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/fy04/wood_adhesives.pdf |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bark removal==
Cut logs are inflamed either just before cutting or before curing.  Such logs and even trunks and branches found in their natural state of decay in forests, where the bark has fallen off, are said to be decorticated.

A number of living organisms live in or on bark, including insects,&lt;ref&gt;Lieutier, François. 2004. ''Bark and Wood Boring Insects in Living Trees in Europe, a Synthesis''. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; fungi and other plants like mosses, algae and other vascular plants. Many of these organisms are pathogens or parasites but some also have symbiotic relationships.

== Bark repair ==

The degree to which trees are able to repair gross physical damage to their bark is very variable. Some are able to produce a callus growth which heals over the wound rapidly, but leaves a clear scar, whilst others such as oaks do not produce an extensive callus repair. [[Frost crack]] and [[Sun scald (flora)|sun scald]] are examples of damage found on tree bark which trees can repair to a degree, depending on the severity.

==Overview==
It is one of [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ten principle capabilities (see [[capabilities approach]]). She defines bodily integrity as: "Being able to move freely from place to place; being able to be secure against violent assault, including [[sexual assault]] ... having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex and Social Justice''. Oxford UP, 1999. 41–42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and law==

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], bodily integrity has been recognised by the courts as an [[Unenumerated rights|unenumerated right]], protected by the general guarantee of "[[personal rights]]" contained within Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]]. In ''Ryan v Attorney General'' it was pronounced that ""you have the right not to have your body or [[personhood]] interfered with. This means that the State may not do anything to harm your life or health. If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered while in prison".&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v Attorney General [1965] 1 IR 294 at 295. Judgement by Kenny J: "That the general guarantee of personal rights in section 3 (1) of Art. 40 extends to rights not specified in Art. 40. One of the personal rights of the citizen protected by the general guarantee is the right to bodily integrity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Right to Bodily Integrity." Citizens Information. 19 Mar. 2008. Citizens Information Board. 4 Apr. 2011 &lt;http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/right_to_bodily_integrity.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a separate case ''M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality &amp; ors,'' the Irish Supreme Court ruled that the right to bodily integrity extended to the unborn.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement by the Irish Supreme Court: M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality &amp; ors, 7th March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In a summary of the case in section 5.19, the Supreme Court stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;“…the only right of the unborn child as the Constitution now stands which attracts the entitlement to protection and vindication is that enshrined by the amendments in Article 40.3.3 namely, the right to life or, in other words, the right to be born and, possibly, (and this is a matter for future decision) allied rights such as the right to bodily integrity which are inherent in and inseparable from the right to life itself”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/09859e7a3f34669680256ef3004a27de/2ca87fab5fd004ff8025824a00329063?OpenDocument | title=M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality &amp; ors : Judgments &amp; Determinations : Courts Service of Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States Constitution]] does not contain any specific provisions regarding the rights one has with respect to his or her physical body or the specific extent to which the state can act upon bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has upheld [[right to privacy]], which, as articulated by Julie Lane, often protects rights to bodily integrity. In ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965) the Court supported women's rights to obtain birth control (and thus, retain reproductive autonomy) without marital consent. Similarly, a woman's right to privacy in obtaining [[abortion]]s was protected by ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973). In ''[[McFall v. Shimp]]'' (1978), a Pennsylvania court ruled that a person cannot be forced to donate bone marrow, even if such a donation would save another person's life.

Conversely, the Supreme Court has also protected the right of governmental entities to infringe upon bodily integrity. Examples include laws prohibiting the use of drugs, laws prohibiting [[euthanasia]], laws requiring the use of seatbelts and helmets, [[strip search]]es of prisoners, and forced [[Blood test|blood tests]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie. "Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie." All Academic Inc. 2005. 05 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-14.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In general, the Canadian [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] defends personal liberty and the right not to be interfered with. However, in certain unique circumstances government may have the right to temporarily override the right to physical integrity in order to preserve the life of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of supported autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socscience.com/social-sciences/7327.html | title=琪琪布电影网}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the [[forced feeding]] of a person dying from the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], or the temporary treatment of a person living with a [[psychotic disorder]] with [[antipsychotic]] medication).

One unique example of a Canadian law that promotes bodily integrity is the [[Ontario Health Care Consent Act]]. This Ontario law has to do with the capacity to [[consent]] to medical treatment.  The HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that a person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to ''understand'' and ''appreciate'' the information that is relevant to making such a decision.

== Human rights ==

Two key international documents protect these rights: the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

The Human Rights and Constitutional Rights project, funded by Columbia Law School, has defined four main areas of potential bodily integrity abuse by governments. These are: Right to Life, [[Slavery]] and Forced Labor, Security of One's Person, [[Torture]] and Inhumane, [[cruel and unusual punishment |Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]].

== Women's rights ==
Though bodily integrity is (according to the [[capabilities approach]]) afforded to every human being, women are more often affected in violations of gender-based violence.[citation needed] These include [[sexual assault]], unwanted pregnancy, [[domestic abuse]], and limited access to [[contraception]]. These principles were addressed in the CCL Working Conference on Women's Rights as Human Rights. The conference defined bodily integrity as a right deserved by all women: "bodily integrity unifies women and that no woman can say that it does not apply to them".

As defined by the conference participants, the following are bodily integrity rights that should be guaranteed to women:
* [[Freedom of movement]]
* [[Security of person]]s
* [[Reproductive rights|Reproductive and sexual rights]]
* [[Women's health]]
* Breaking women's [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]]
* [[Education]]
* Networking&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Niamh. "Bodily Integrity and Security of Person." Women's Human Rights Campaign Ireland. 05 Apr. 2011 &lt;http://whr1998.tripod.com/documents/icclbodily.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's rights ==
{{see also|Children's rights|Child grooming}}
=== United States ===
The debate over children's rights to bodily integrity has grown in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, Patricia. ''Researching Children's Rights to Integrity'' in ''Children's Childhoods: Observed And Experienced''. The Falmer Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the highly publicized [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|Jerry Sandusky trial]],&lt;ref&gt;''
Overheard on CNN.com: Are you a 'huggy' person? Would you make a child hug?''. CNN, 20 June 2012.&lt;http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/20/overheard-on-cnn-com-are-you-a-huggy-person-would-you-make-a-child-hug/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  parents have been increasingly encouraged to promote their child's sense of bodily integrity as a method of reducing children's vulnerability to being victims of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual violence]], [[Trafficking of children|human trafficking]] and [[child prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Hetter, Katia. ''I don't own my child's body''. CNN, 20 July 2015. &lt;http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/20/living/give-grandma-hug-child/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of increasing children's sense of bodily autonomy include:
* Allowing children to choose when to give hugs/kisses
* Encouraging children to communicate about [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]]
* Offer alternative actions (e.g. a [[high five]], handshake, etc.)

== Medicine ==
The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] states the following: "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

==The Thirteen Towers solar observatory==
The  regularly-spaced thirteen towers of Chankillo were constructed atop the ridge of a low hill running near north to south, forming a "toothed" horizon with narrow gaps at regular intervals. To the east and west investigators designated two possible observation points. From these vantages, the 300m long spread of the towers along the horizon corresponds very closely to the rising and setting positions of the sun over the year,&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; albeit they are not all visible. On the winter solstice, the sun would rise behind the leftmost tower of Chankillo and rise behind each of the towers until it reached the rightmost tower six months later on the summer solstice, marking the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://hila.webcentre.ca/projects/chankillo/ | title=Archaeoastronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirteen Towers of Chankillo could be the earliest known observatory in the Americas. Inhabitants of Chankillo would have been able to determine an accurate date, with an error of a day or two, by observing the sunrise or sunset from the correct tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.wmf.org/project/chankillo | title=Chankillo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The towers had been known to travelers for centuries, the astronomical function of the towers were speculated famously by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] in his [[The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas|book Kon-Tiki]] of the 1940s but only recently hypothesized at length in 2007 by Iván Ghezzi and Clive Ruggles.&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Roger.

A '''circle jerk''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual practice]] in which a group of men or boys form a circle and [[masturbate]] themselves or each other. In the metaphorical sense, the term is used to refer to [[Echo chamber (media)|self-congratulatory behavior or discussion among a group of people]], usually in reference to a "boring or time-wasting meeting or other event".&lt;ref name="Murphy2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Francis Murphy|title=Studs, tools, and the family jewels: metaphors men live by|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMwDCHI3QbMC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=20 February 2011|date=12 February 2001|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-17130-8|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Circle jerks are typically an experience of adolescents and college students{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. Often, they feature a competitive element, with the "winner" being the participant able to ejaculate first, last, or farthest depending on the pre-established rules.&lt;ref name="Murphy2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mechling2004" /&gt; They can serve as an introduction to sexual relations with other males, or as a sexual outlet at an age or situation when regular sexual activity with another person is not possible.&lt;ref name="Murphy2001" /&gt; Circle jerking may or may not involve physical contact with others in the groups. Masturbating other participants, or stimulating other participants' [[human penis|penises]] or [[scrotum]]s often occurs. [[Non-penetrative sex|Non-penetrative sexual rubbing]] against another participant's body may also occur, such as [[frot]], the rubbing of two (or more) penises against each other. Frot, which may jokingly be called 'sword-fighting', usually involves the competitive element of trying to make the other participant(s) [[ejaculate]] first.

==Motivation==
While circle jerks feature a [[homoerotic]] element, some analysts interpret adolescent boys' group activities such as circle jerks as an effort to establish heterosexual, masculine dominance within the group.&lt;ref name="Murphy2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mechling2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Mechling|title=On My Honor: Boy Scouts and the Making of American Youth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8aSN5GSxZIC&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=20 February 2011|date=1 May 2004|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-51705-6|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Lefkowitz|title=Our guys: the Glen Ridge rape and the secret life of the perfect suburb|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QjG5QpOKcoC&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate=20 February 2011|date=11 July 1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20596-3|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=October 2018}} Author Bernard Lefkowitz states that what actually motivates participation is to have friends witness and acknowledge one's sexual prowess, helping to counter teenage feelings of inadequacy related to sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz1997" /&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=October 2018}}

'''Discover Primary Science''' is a flagship [[project]] of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt05/developing/discover.html Forfás Annual Report 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120014325/http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt05/developing/discover.html |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It facilitates [[teacher training]] in general primary science and provides teachers with online resources and classroom activity packs which can also be used by parents and students.

In 2008, just over 3,100 [[primary school]]s and their teachers participated in activities which included hands-on induction days which were hosted throughout the country in [[college]]s of education, [[institute of technology]], [[universities]] and education centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishscientist.ie/2006/contents.asp?contentxml=06p14.xml&amp;contentxsl=is06pages.xsl Article on Discover Primary Science - Irish Scientist website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119235342/http://www.irishscientist.ie/2006/contents.asp?contentxml=06p14.xml&amp;contentxsl=is06pages.xsl |date=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards of Science Excellence ==

Discover Primary Science also manages the Awards of Science Excellence each year, as well as coordinating a series of Discover Science Centres across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sciencetoday/2008/0605/1212568972777.html Article on Discover Primary Science - The Irish Times newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/images-making-the-news-692435.html?ino=4 Picture on Discover Primary Science - Front of the Irish Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools registered on the Discover Primary Science project can opt to apply for an Award of Science Excellence after they have met certain criteria for science-related activities. In 2007 and 2008, more than 1,000 schools received awards nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/news/june07/061107_primary_school.html UCD Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sciencetoday/2008/0605/1212568972777.html Article on Discover Primary Science - Irish Times newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5412">[[Image:Energese.jpg|thumb|140px|right| The Energy Systems Language of Systems Ecology]]

The '''Energy Systems Language''', also referred to as '''Energese''', '''Energy Circuit Language''', or '''Generic Systems Symbols''', was developed by the [[ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] and colleagues in the 1950s during studies of the tropical forests funded by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. They are used to compose energy flow diagrams in the field of [[systems ecology]].

==Design intent==
The design intent of the energy systems language was to facilitate the generic depiction of energy flows through any scale system while encompassing the [[laws of physics]], and in particular, the laws of [[thermodynamics]] (see [[energy transformation]] for an example).

In particular H.T. Odum aimed to produce a language which could facilitate the intellectual analysis, engineering synthesis and management of global systems such as the geobiosphere, and its many subsystems. Within this aim, H.T. Odum had a strong concern that many abstract mathematical models of such systems were not thermodynamically valid. Hence he used analog computers to make system models due to their [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]; that is, the electronic circuits are of value for modelling natural systems which are assumed to obey the laws of energy flow, because, in themselves the circuits, like natural systems, also obey the known laws of energy flow, where the [[energy forms|energy form]] is electrical. However Odum was interested not only in the electronic circuits themselves, but also in how they might be used as formal analogies for modeling other systems which also had energy flowing through them. As a result, Odum did not restrict his inquiry to the analysis and synthesis of any one system in isolation. The discipline that is most often associated with this kind of approach, together with the use of the energy systems language is known as [[systems ecology]].

==General characteristics==
[[Image:PassiveAnalog.jpg|thumb|220px|left| Passive electrical equivalent of Energy Systems Language storage icon]]
When applying the electronic circuits (and schematics) to modeling ecological and economic systems, Odum believed that generic categories, or characteristic modules, could be derived. Moreover he felt that a general symbolic system, fully defined in electronic terms (including the mathematics thereof) would be useful for depicting real system characteristics, such as the general categories of production, storage, flow, transformation, and consumption. Central principles of electronics also therefore became central features of the energy systems language – Odum's generic symbolism.

Depicted to the left is what the generic symbol for storage, which Odum named the Bertalanffy module, in honor of the [[General systems theory|general systems]] theorist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]].

For Odum, in order to achieve a [[holistic]] understanding of how many apparently different systems actually affect each other, it was important to have a generic language with a massively scalable modeling capacity – to model global-to-local, ecological, physical and economic systems. The intention was, and for those who still apply it, is, to make biological, physical, ecological, economic and other system models thermodynamically, and so also [[energetics|energetically]], valid and [[Verification and validation|verifiable]]. As a consequence the designers of the language also aimed to include the energy metabolism of any system within the scope of inquiry.

==Pictographic icons==
In order to aid learning, in ''Modeling for all Scales'' Odum and Odum (2000) suggested systems might first be introduced with pictographic icons, and then later defined in the generic symbolism.  [[Pictograms]] have therefore been used in software programs like ExtendSim to depict the basic categories of the  Energy Systems Language. Some have argued that such an approach shares similar motivations to [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|isotype]] project, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s ([[Characteristica Universalis]]) [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Project and [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s works.

'''Energy engineering''' or '''energy systems engineering''' is a broad field of [[engineering]] dealing with [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[energy services]], [[facility management]], plant engineering, [[environmental compliance]] and [[alternative energy]] technologies. Energy engineering is one of the more recent engineering disciplines to emerge. Energy engineering combines knowledge from the fields of [[physics]], [[math]], and [[chemistry]] with economic and environmental engineering practices. Energy engineers apply their skills to increase efficiency and further develop renewable sources of energy.
The main job of energy engineers is to find the most efficient and sustainable ways to operate buildings and manufacturing processes. Energy engineers audit the use of energy in those processes and suggest ways to improve the systems. This means suggesting advanced lighting, better insulation, more efficient heating and cooling properties of buildings.&lt;ref name=Berkeley&gt;Berkeley Engineering (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Although an energy engineer is concerned about obtaining and using energy in the most environmentally friendly ways, their field is not limited to strictly renewable energy like hydro, solar, biomass, or geothermal. Energy engineers are also employed by the fields of oil and natural gas extraction.&lt;ref name=Berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AGCAS editors (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Energy minimization is the purpose of this growing discipline. Often applied to building design, heavy consideration is given to [[HVAC]], [[lighting]], [[refrigeration]], to both reduce energy loads and increase [[efficiency]] of current systems. Energy engineering is increasingly seen as a major step forward in meeting [[Carbon neutrality|carbon reduction targets]]. Since buildings and houses consume over 40% of the United States energy, the services an energy engineer performs are in demand.&lt;ref&gt;Science Buddies (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Human beings have been transferring [[energy]] from one form to another since their use of fire. The efficiency of the transfer of energy is a new field. The [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis of 1979]] brought to light the need to get more work out of less energy. The [[United States]] government passed several laws in the seventies to promote increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], such as United States public law 94-413, the [[Federal Clean Car Incentive Program]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power engineering==
Considered a subdivision of energy engineering, [[power engineering]] applies math and physics to the movement and transfer of energy to work in a system.

==Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design==
[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a program created by the [[United States Green Building Council]] (USGBC) in March 2000. LEED is a program that encourages green building and promotes sustainability in the construction of buildings and the efficiency of the utilities in the buildings.

In 2012 the United States Green Building Council asked the independent firm [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] to conduct a study on the effectiveness of LEED program. "This study confirmed that green buildings generate substantial energy savings. From 2000–2008, green construction and renovation generated $1.3 billion in energy savings. Of that $1.3 billion, LEED-certified buildings accounted for $281 million." The study also found the summation of all green construction supported 2.4 million jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Booz Allen Hamilton (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
[[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] is seen two ways. The first view is that more work is done from the same amount of energy used. The other perception is that the same amount of work is accomplished with less energy used in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Battles and Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some ways to get more work out of less energy is to "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" the materials used in daily life. The advancement of technology has led to other uses of waste. Technology such as [[waste-to-energy]] facilities which convert solid wastes through the process of [[gasification]] or [[pyrolysis]] to liquid fuels to be burned. The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] stated that the United States produced 250 million tons of municipal waste in 2010. Of that 250 million tons roughly 54% gets thrown in land fills, 33% is recycled, and 13% goes to [[energy recovery]] plants.&lt;ref name=Crawford_2013&gt;Crawford (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In European countries who pay more for fuel, such as Denmark where the price for a gallon of gas neared $10 in 2010, have more fully developed waste-to energy facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Denmark sent 7% of waste to landfills, 69% was recycled, and 24% was sent to waste-to-energy facilities. There are several other developed Western European countries that also have taken energy engineering into consideration.&lt;ref name=Crawford_2013/&gt; [[Germany]]'s "[[Energiewende]]", a policy which set the goal by 2050 to meet 80% of electrical needs from renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;Baake and Morgan (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The median yearly salary for an energy engineer is $64,587 U.S. dollars. 83% of energy engineers are male while the remaining 17% are female. 65% of energy engineers have less than five years of experience in their profession.&lt;ref&gt;PayScale (June 12, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
Energy engineers have one main professional organization. The [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE) founded in 1977. It now has 16,000 members in 89 countries. The organizations main responsibility is to lead energy certification programs to teach individuals across the world and certify as qualified to perform the job of an energy engineer.

==Education==

A bachelor’s degree is a primary requirement of becoming an energy engineer. Some energy engineers are registered [[Professional Engineer|Professional Engineers]] (P.E.); although the completion of that program is not a necessity. Of the 16,000 energy engineers that are in the [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE), 58.4% have post-graduate degrees from accredited colleges. If the engineer is not a P.E. he or she would need a Certified Energy Manager (CEM) or Certified Energy Auditor (CEA) certificate from a group like the [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE). Both CEM and CEA Certifications are recognized by the [[United States Department of Energy]]&lt;ref&gt;https://commonwealthengineers.com/cea-program-receives-recognition-from-department-of-energy/&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student who wants to become an energy engineer does not directly need to get a degree in energy engineering, several universities across the world have established departments or centers offering energy engineering degrees, to better prepare future engineers for their career. One of those programs is the IEP PEM Certification which is offered at [[Virginia Tech]] University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpe.vt.edu/pemcert/&lt;/ref&gt; The Certified Professional Energy Manager (PEM) was created in conjunction by the Institute of Energy Professionals (IEP) and Energy University. Since 2009, Energy University has provided energy efficiency education to more than 130,000 professionals worldwide. The program offers more than 150 courses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energymanagertoday.com/energy-university-intros-online-energy-manager-certification-086994/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Genera Plantarum 1742.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Title page of the second edition of [[Linnaeus]]'s ''Genera Plantarum'', [[Leiden]], 1742&lt;center&gt;]]
'''''Genera Plantarum''''' is a publication of Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778). The first edition was issued in [[Leiden]], 1737. The fifth edition served as a complementary volume to ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753). Article 13 of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] states that "''Generic names that appear in Linnaeus' ''Species Plantarum'' ed. 1 (1753) and ed. 2 (1762–63) are associated with the first subsequent description given under those names in Linnaeus' ''Genera Plantarum'' ed. 5 (1754) and ed. 6 (1764)''." This defines the starting point for nomenclature of most groups of plants.&lt;ref name="Stafleu, p. 102"&gt;Stafleu, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''Genera Plantarum'' contains brief descriptions of the 935 plant genera that were known to Linnaeus at that time. It is dedicated to [[Herman Boerhaave]], a Leiden physician who introduced Linnaeus to [[George Clifford III|George Clifford]] and the medico-botanical Dutch establishment of the day. ''Genera Plantarum'' employed his [[Linnaean_taxonomy#Classification_for_plants|“sexual system” of classification]], in which plants are grouped according to the number of stamens and pistils in the flower. ''Genera Plantarum'' was revised several times by Linnaeus, the fifth edition being published in August 1754 (eds. 3 and 4 were not edited by Linnaeus) and linked to the first edition of ''Species Plantarum''.&lt;ref name="Stafleu, p. 102"/&gt; Over the 16 years that passed between the publication of the first and fifth editions the number of genera listed had increased from 935 to 1105.

Linnaeus established the system of [[binomial nomenclature]] through the widespread acceptance of his list of plants in the 1753 edition of ''Species Plantarum'', which is now taken as the starting point for all [[botanical nomenclature]]. ''Genera Plantarum'' was an integral part of this first stepping stone towards a universal standardised [[biological nomenclature]].

==History==
From 1735 to 1738 Linnaeus worked in the Netherlands where he was personal physician to [[George Clifford III|George Clifford]] (1685–1760) a wealthy Anglo-Dutch merchant–banker with an impressive garden containing four large glasshouses that were filled with warmth-loving plants from overseas. Linnaeus was enthralled by these collections and prepared a detailed systematic catalogue of the plants in the garden, which he published in 1738 as ''[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]''. This list was published with engravings by [[Georg Dionysius Ehret|Georg Ehret]] (1708–1770) and [[Jan Wandelaer]] (1690–1759). Linnaeus included Ehret's Tabella (an illustration of his "Sexual System" of plant classification) in his ''Genera Plantarum'' but without credit to the artist. This provoked the accusation from Ehret that "When he was a beginner [Linnaeus] appropriated everything for himself which he heard of, to make himself famous".&lt;ref&gt;Stearn in Blunt, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ehret probably met Linnaeus again when the latter visited London for a month. The time in the Netherlands was a productive one for Linnaeus because in these four years he also published ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735), ''[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]'' (1736), ''[[Fundamenta Botanica]]'' (1736), ''[[Flora Lapponica]]'' (1737) and ''[[Critica Botanica]]'' (1737), this is in addition to his ''Genera Plantarum'' (1737).&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, 1986 p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Linnaeus's main points is that a botanist can and must know all genera, and must memorise their ‘definitions’ (diagnosis). The natural definitions given in the various editions of the ''Genera Plantarum'' are intended to facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Stability of generic taxonomy was one of his first aims, and the way he went about achieving it aroused the criticism of many of his contemporaries. Yet, this generic reform was one of his greatest achievements: his genera and their nomenclature stand at the beginning of the victory of [[Linnaean taxonomy]].&lt;ref name=s&gt;Stafleu, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; He dealt with the theory of generic names in the ''Critica Botanica'' which was a prelude to his main practical work on the subject, the ''Genera Plantarum''.&lt;ref name=s /&gt; The rules for the formation of generic names are contained in the ''Fundamenta'' but are worked out in greater detail in the ''Critica''.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a reform of generic definitions that appeared in the ''Genera Plantarum''.

==Publication and dedication==
The type-setting of ''Genera Plantarum'' started in 1736&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the publication of the first edition in early 1737; the book was dedicated to Herman Boerhaave, the great Leiden physician to whom Linnaeus owed his introduction into the medico-botanical Dutch establishment of the day. Linnaeus published a revised edition in 1742. The fifth edition appeared in Stockholm, in 1754, and the sixth, the last one edited by Linnaeus himself, in 1764, also in Stockholm. The last edition that was based on Linnaeus's work was the 9th edition, revised by [[Kurt Sprengel]], and issued in [[Göttingen]], 1830-31.

==Botanical background==
[[File:Ehret-Methodus Plantarum Sexualis-original.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|Ehret's illustrations, in ''Systema Naturae'', showing the characters used to determine Linnaeus's 24 classes of plants.]]
In the work Linnaeus divided the plant kingdom into 24 classes, each of which he named according to the number of stamens and their arrangement in the flowers. In Ehret’s engraved plate these classes are represented by the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet. In Ehret’s original drawing for the plate, preserved in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, he has written the name of the plant he had chosen as an example of each particular class, but only for the first ten and last four classes. Each of the first ten classes (A–K) is named according to the number of stamens, beginning with Monandria (one stamen), Diandria (two stamens), etc. up to Decandria (ten stamens). The flowers in the eleventh (L) class, Dodecandria, have 12–19 stamens. The following four classes (M–P) are characterized not only by the number of stamens but also by their position; the four classes (Q–T) have stamens united in a bundle or phalanx, the next three classes (V–Y) have stamens and pistils in separate flowers. The whole is completed with Cryptogamia (Z), which are plants without proper flowers. For this class Ehret chose the fig as an example.

==Nomenclatural importance==
By far the most important edition for nomenclature today is the fifth, published in August 1754 (editions 3 and 4 were not edited by Linnaeus); this is the edition which is linked nomenclaturally with the ''Species Plantarum'', the starting point for the naming of most groups of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus descriptions in this edition were original, methodically and tersely drafted according to his own plan, with an asterisk * following the generic name to indicate that he had studied living material, a dagger † to indicate that he had seen only herbarium material, and the absence of these signs to indicate he had seen no material himself and hence depended upon the literature or correspondence. In preparing a description of a genus he would describe the flower and fruit of the main species most familiar to him and then remove the characters that did not occur in other species. As new species were added Linnaeus should have updated his genus descriptions but in practice did not have time to do so. As a result, some species listed in ''Species Plantarum'' do not fit the descriptions in ''Genus Plantarum''.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1971, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;
All generic names in ''Genera Plantarum'' ed. 5 are treated as validly published on 1 May 1753.&lt;ref name="Stafleu, p. 102"/&gt;

==Significance==
[[William Stearn]] states: “The clear typographical layout, the elimination of verbs such as est, occupant and abit, and the much greater detail given for all floral parts … immediately catch the attention. Such improvements in technique made Linnaeus's ''Genera Plantarum'' the model for later works on the genera of plants.”&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, 1960 p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frans Stafleu]] regards ''Genera Plantarum'' as Linnaeus’s most important book with respect to the practical introduction of his ideas – even more than ''Systema Naturae''. The notion that the genus is the basic unit of taxonomy remained in force until the advent of evolutionary biology and biosystematics. “''His reform was daring and thorough, based on an exceptional and practical knowledge of plants; although influenced by somewhat outmoded ideas, it had exactly the salutary effect which he wanted it to have: consistency and simplicity. These two were prime needs for taxonomy in 1737''." &lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid mechanics]], a [[fluid]] is said to be in '''hydrostatic equilibrium''' or '''hydrostatic balance''' when it is at rest, or when the flow velocity at each point is constant over time. This occurs when external forces such as [[gravity]] are balanced by a [[pressure-gradient force]].&lt;ref&gt;White (2008). p 63, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into space.

Hydrostatic equilibrium is the current distinguishing criterion between [[dwarf planet]]s and [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]], and has other roles in [[astrophysics]] and [[planetary geology]]. This qualification typically means that the object is symmetrically rounded into a [[spheroid]] or [[ellipsoid]] shape, where any irregular surface features are due to a relatively thin solid [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. There are [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System|32 observationally confirmed&lt;!--of the DPs, only Ceres, Pluto, and Eris are obs. confirmed. the others rely on mathematical modeling.--&gt; such objects]] (apart from the Sun), sometimes called ''[[planemo]]s,''&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Stern]] considers these all to be "planets", but that conception was rejected by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Solar System]], seven more&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |title=Astronomer Mike Brown |publisher=Gps.caltech.edu |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018154917/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |archivedate=2011-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--3 accepted by the IAU, &amp; 4 more that "must" be according to Mike Brown--&gt; that are virtually certain, and [[List of possible dwarf planets|a hundred or so more]] that are likely.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

==Mathematical consideration==
[[File:Hydrostatic equilibrium.svg|thumb|right|If the highlighted volume of fluid is not accelerating, the forces on it upwards must equal the forces downwards.]]

===Derivation from force summation===
[[Newton's laws of motion]] state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium.

The fluid can be split into a large number of [[cuboid]] volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived.

There are 3 forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, P, of the fluid above it is, from the definition of [[pressure]],
:&lt;math&gt;F_{top} = - P_{top} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is
:&lt;math&gt;F_{bottom} = P_{bottom} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the [[weight]] of the volume element causes a force downwards.  If the [[density]] is ρ, the volume is V and g the [[standard gravity]], then:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot V.&lt;/math&gt;
The volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height&amp;nbsp;— the formula for finding the volume of a cube.
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

By balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum F = F_{bottom} + F_{top} + F_{weight} = P_{bottom} \cdot A - P_{top} \cdot A - \rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
This sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant.  Dividing by A,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = P_{bottom} - P_{top} - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
Or,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{top} - P_{bottom} = - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
P&lt;sub&gt;top&lt;/sub&gt; − P&lt;sub&gt;bottom&lt;/sub&gt; is a change in pressure, and h is the height of the volume element—a change in the distance above the ground.  By saying these changes are [[infinitesimal]]ly small, the equation can be written in [[differential equation|differential]] form.
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho \cdot g \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;
Density changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be:
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho(P) \cdot g(h) \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation from Navier–Stokes equations===
Note finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional [[Navier–Stokes equations]] for the equilibrium situation where
:&lt;math&gt;u=v=\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the only non-trivial equation is the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-equation, which now reads
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+\rho g=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the Navier–Stokes equations.

===Derivation from general relativity===
By plugging the energy momentum tensor for a [[perfect fluid]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}=(\rho c^{-2}+P)u^\mu u^\nu+Pg^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
into the [[Einstein field equations]]
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}T)&lt;/math&gt;
and using the conservation condition
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0&lt;/math&gt;
one can derive the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation]] for the structure of a static, spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{G M(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, ''Ρ'' and ''ρ'' are related by an equation of state of the form ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0, with ''f'' specific to makeup of the star. ''M''(''r'') is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density ''ρ''(''r''), with the largest sphere having radius ''r'':
:&lt;math&gt;M(r)=4\pi\int_0^r dr' r'^2\rho(r').&lt;/math&gt;
Per standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit, we let ''c''→∞, so that the factor
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, in the nonrelativistic limit the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation reduces to Newton's hydrostatic equilibrium:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{GM(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}=-g(r)\,\rho(r)\longrightarrow dP = - \rho(h)\,g(h)\, dh&lt;/math&gt;
(we have made the trivial notation change ''h''=''r'' and have used ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0 to express ''ρ'' in terms of ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zee|first1=A.|title=Einstein gravity in a nutshell|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691145587|pages=451–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar equation can be computed for rotating, axially symmetric stars, which in its gauge independent form reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial_i P}{P+\rho} - \partial_i \ln u^t + u_t u^{\phi}\partial_i\frac{u_{\phi}}{u_t}=0&lt;/math&gt; 
Unlike the TOV equilibrium equation, these are two equations (for instance, if as usual when treating stars, one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates &lt;math&gt;(t,r,\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the index ''i'' runs for the coordinates ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;).

==Applications==

===Fluids===
The hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to [[hydrostatics]] and the [[principles of equilibrium]] of [[fluid]]s.  A hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water.  Hydrostatic balance allows the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of their [[specific gravity|specific gravities]].

===Astrophysics===
In any given layer of a [[star]], there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below and the weight of the material above pressing inward.  The [[isotropic]] gravitational field compresses the star into the most compact shape possible. A rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an [[oblate spheroid]] up to a certain (critical) angular velocity. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the star [[Vega]], which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than at the poles. A star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a [[Jacobi ellipsoid|Jacobi (scalene) ellipsoid]], and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but [[wikt:pyriform|piriform]] or [[oviform]], with yet other shapes beyond that, though shapes beyond scalene are not stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josleys.com/show_gallery.php?galid=313 |title=Gallery : The shape of Planet Earth |publisher=Josleys.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the star has a massive nearby companion object then [[tidal force]]s come into play as well, distorting the star into a scalene shape when rotation alone would make it a spheroid.  An example of this is [[Beta Lyrae]].

Hydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the [[intracluster medium]], where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a [[cluster of galaxies]].

We can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the [[velocity dispersion]] of [[dark matter]] in clusters of galaxies. Only [[baryon]]ic matter (or, rather, the collisions thereof) emits [[X-ray]] radiation. The absolute X-ray [[luminosity]] per unit volume takes the form &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X=\Lambda(T_B)\rho_B^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(T)&lt;/math&gt; is some function of temperature and fundamental constants. The baryonic density satisfies the above equation &lt;math&gt;dP=-\rho gdr&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;p_B(r+dr)-p_B(r)=-dr\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
The integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster, with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; being the proper distance to the center of the cluster. Using the [[ideal gas law]] &lt;math&gt;p_B=kT_B\rho_B/m_B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles) and rearranging, we arrive at
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)=-\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;r^2/\rho_B(r)&lt;/math&gt; and differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_B(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
If we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution, then the same derivation applies to these particles, and their density &lt;math&gt;\rho_D=\rho_M-\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the non-linear differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_D(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_D(r)\rho_D(r)}{m_D}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
With perfect X-ray and distance data, we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density. We could then calculate the velocity dispersion &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D&lt;/math&gt; of the dark matter, which is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D=\frac{kT_D}{m_D}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The central density ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on the [[redshift]] &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the cluster and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)\propto (1+z)^2\left(\frac{\theta}{s}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular width of the cluster and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the proper distance to the cluster. Values for the ratio range from .11 to .14 for various surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Cosmology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-852682-7|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary geology===
The concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[small Solar System body]]. According to the [[definition of planet]] adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body will normally have the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a [[planemo]]), though near-hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet [[4 Vesta]] may also be differentiated. Sometimes the equilibrium shape is an [[oblate spheroid]], as is the case with Earth. However, in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit, nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a [[scalene ellipsoid]]. Also, the dwarf planet {{dp|Haumea}} is scalene due to its rapid rotation.

It had been thought that icy objects with a diameter larger than roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km are usually in hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas those smaller than that are not. Icy objects need less mass for hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects. The smallest object that is known to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] at 397&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the largest object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the rocky asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] at 532&amp;nbsp;km (582&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;556&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;km). However, Mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation. The smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], at 945 km, whereas the largest body known to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], at 1,470&amp;nbsp;km.

Because the [[terrestrial planet]]s and dwarf planets (and likewise the larger [[natural satellite|satellites]], like the [[Moon]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]]) have irregular surfaces, this definition evidently has some flexibility, but a specific means of quantifying an object's shape by this standard has not yet been announced. Local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest&lt;!--as opposed to highest--&gt; mountain on Earth, [[Mauna Kea]], has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust, so that the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium. The amount of leeway afforded the definition could affect the classification of the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], which may have solidified while in hydrostatic equilibrium but was subsequently significantly deformed by large impacts (now 572.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;557.2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;446.4&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="Hubble"&gt;{{cite web

===Atmospherics===
In the atmosphere, the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude. This pressure difference causes an upward force called the [[pressure-gradient force]]. The force of gravity balances this out, keeping the atmosphere bound to Earth and maintaining pressure differences with altitude.

The '''IP Code''', '''International Protection Marking''', IEC  standard 60529, sometimes interpreted as '''Ingress Protection Marking''', classifies and rates the degree of protection provided against intrusion  (body parts such as hands and fingers), [[dust]], accidental contact, and water by mechanical casings and [[electrical enclosures]]. It is published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC). The equivalent European standard is EN 60529.

The standard aims to provide users more detailed information than vague marketing terms such as ''waterproof''. For example, a cellular phone rated at IP68 is "dust resistant" and can be "immersed in 1.5 meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes". Similarly, an electrical socket rated IP22 is protected against insertion of fingers and will not be damaged or become unsafe during a specified test in which it is exposed to vertically or nearly vertically dripping water. IP22 or IP2X are typical minimum requirements for the design of electrical accessories for indoor use.

The digits indicate conformity with the conditions summarized in the tables below. The digit ''0'' is used where no protection is provided. The digit is replaced with the letter ''X'' when insufficient data has been gathered to assign a protection level.

There are no hyphens in a genuine IP code. IPX-8 (for example) is thus an invalid IP code.&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60529, Edition 2.2, 2013, page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

This page contains a combination of IEC 60529 (also EN 60529) and other standards, such as ISO 20653. The original documents are available for purchase, and have important and specific requirements that cannot be fully reprinted due to copyright restrictions. This often includes drawings specifying the required test equipment, such as the shape of water nozzles used for water jet testing. Additional standards are often referenced that may contain important information. One must refer to the latest revision of the required standard when conducting tests for agency certification.

===First digit: Solid particle protection===
The first digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure provides against access to hazardous parts (e.g., electrical conductors, moving parts) and the ingress of solid foreign objects.&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60529, Edition 2.2, 2013, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Second digit: Liquid ingress protection===&lt;!--where does this info come from? it doesn't seem to be using the standard terminology for the ratings.--&gt;
The second digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure provides against harmful ingress of water.&lt;ref name="NE Laser"&gt;{{citation|title=Ingress Protection: The System of Tests and Meaning of Codes|url=http://www.ce-mag.com/archive/06/ARG/bisenius.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGYoRMwp?url=http://www.ce-mag.com/archive/06/ARG/bisenius.htm|deadurl=yes|archivedate=2012-12-29|df=}}.&lt;!-- http://www.webcitation.org/6DGYoRMwp?url=http://www.ce-mag.com/archive/06/ARG/bisenius.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The ratings for water ingress are not cumulative beyond IPX6. A device which is compliant with IPX7, covering immersion in water, need not be compliant with IPX5 or IPX6, covering exposure to water jets. A device which meets both tests is indicated by listing both tests separated by a slash, e.g. IPX5/IPX7.

The letter K is specified in DIN 40050-9, and not in IEC 60529.

== IP69K ==
IP codes with the letter "K" are from ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code), which states that it is in accordance with IEC 60529 except for the "K" tests, which describe special requirements for road vehicles.

The test specifies a spray nozzle that is fed with 80&amp;nbsp;°C water at 8–10&amp;nbsp;[[MPa]] (80–100 bar) and a flow rate of 14–16&amp;nbsp;L/min. The nozzle is held 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm from the tested device at angles of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° for 30&amp;nbsp;seconds each. The test device sits on a turntable that completes a rotation once every 12&amp;nbsp;seconds (5&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]). The IPx9 specification in IEC 60529 has details for testing larger specimens that will not fit on a turntable test fixture (see table above).

The IP69K test specification was initially developed for road vehicles, especially those that need regular intensive cleaning (dump trucks, cement mixers, etc.), but it also finds use in other areas (for example, the food industry and car wash centers).

German standard [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 40050-9 extended the older IEC 60529 rating system with an '''IP69K''' rating for high-pressure, high-temperature wash-down applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = [[DIN]] 40050-9: ''Straßenfahrzeuge; IP-Schutzarten; Schutz gegen Fremdkörper, Wasser und Berühren; Elektrische Ausrüstung'' [Road vehicles; degrees of protection (IP-code); protection against foreign objects, water and impact; electrical equipment] | date = May 1993}}. An English translation of the German original is available from DIN.&lt;/ref&gt; DIN 40050-9 has been replaced by ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code).&lt;ref&gt;ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code) Protection of electrical equipment against foreign objects, water and access&lt;/ref&gt; Such enclosures must not only be dust-tight (IP6X), but it must also be able to withstand high-pressure and steam cleaning. By 2013 IEC 60529 added level 9 water ingress testing, with IPx9 being essentially the same spray test as IP69K, also adding a drawing of a fixture to verify the water pressure.

== North America (NEMA rating) ==&lt;!--The following section is a target of internal redirects.--&gt;
{{main|NEMA enclosure types}}
In the USA, the [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] defines [[NEMA enclosure types]] in NEMA standard number 250. The following table outlines which IEC 60529 IP code each respective NEMA rating meets. Ratings between the two standards are not directly equivalent: NEMA ratings also require additional product features and tests (such as functionality under icing conditions,  enclosures for [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous areas]], knock-outs for cable connections and others) not addressed by IP ratings.

== Ingress Protection for consumer electronics ==
The inclusion of an Ingress Protection rating has become increasingly common for use in the [[consumer electronics]] market with devices such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and [[camera]]s now being sold as water resistant, waterproof and dustproof.

Some manufacturers have produced IP rated [[smartphone]]s, aimed at consumers who are concerned about their handsets getting submerged in liquids or getting covered in dust.

With the availability of portable devices, and the desire to get outside with active lifestyles, portable speakers have become popular with the rugged consumer market for those who enjoy [[outdoor recreation]], [[extreme sport]]s as well.

'''Iberian Books''' is a bibliographical research project set up to chart the development of printing in Spain, Portugal and the New World in the early-modern period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = website of the project team | accessdate = 2016-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a catalogue of what was known to have been printed, along with a survey of surviving copies and links to digital editions.&lt;ref&gt; Alexander S. Wilkinson, 'Exploring the Print World of Early-Modern Iberia', ''Bulletin of Spanish Studies'' (2012), 89 (4):491-506 and Alejandra Ulla Lorenzo, 'Iberian Book Project (1472-1650): sobre los usos del catálogo en el estudio del impreso científico antiguo'. ''Ciencias y traducción en el mundo hispánico. 3, Mantua, "Pliegos" &lt;/ref&gt;  It is funded by the [[Andrew W.

Established in 2007 and based in the School of History at [[University College Dublin]], as of December 2016 the project has made available data for the period from the beginning of printing in the Iberian Peninsula around 1472 to the middle of the seventeenth century. In late 2017, the project expects to publish the datasets for the second half of the seventeenth century.  The datasets currently available online (1472-1650) hold information on 66,000 items, 339,000 copies, and 15,000 digital copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project works in partnership with the [[University College Dublin Library|Digital Library Group]] at University College Dublin and with the [[Universal Short Title Catalogue|Universal Short Title Catalogue Project]] based at the [[University of St Andrews]].

'''Induced ovulation''' is when a female animal ovulates due to an externally derived stimulus during, or just prior, to mating, rather than ovulating cyclically or spontaneously. Stimuli causing induced ovulation include the physical act of [[coitus]] or mechanical stimulation simulating this, [[sperm]] and [[pheromones]].

Ovulation occurs at the [[ovary]] surface and is described as the process in which an [[oocyte]] (female germ cell) is released from the follicle. Ovulation is a non-deleterious 'inflammatory response' which is initiated by a [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=J. S.|last2=Hedin|first2=L.|date=1988|title=Molecular aspects of hormone action in ovarian follicular development, ovulation, and luteinization|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|volume=50|pages=441–463|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.50.030188.002301|issn=0066-4278|pmid=3288100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of ovulation varies between species. In humans the ovulation process occurs around day 14 of the menstrual cycle, this can also be referred to as 'cyclical spontaneous ovulation'. However the monthly menstruation process is typically linked to humans and primates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strassmann|first=B. I.|date=June 1996|title=The evolution of endometrial cycles and menstruation|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=181–220|issn=0033-5770|pmid=8693059|doi=10.1086/419369}}&lt;/ref&gt; all other animal species ovulate by various other mechanisms.

'''Spontaneous ovulation''' is the ovulatory process in which the maturing ovarian follicles secrete ovarian steroids to generate pulsatile [[GnRH]] (the neuropeptide which controls all vertebrate reproductive function) release into the median eminence (the area which connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary gland) to ultimately cause a pre-ovulatory LH surge.  Spontaneously ovulating species go through [[menstrual cycle]]s and are fertile at certain times based on what part of the cycle they are in. Species in which the females are spontaneous ovulators include rats, mice, guinea pigs, sheep, monkeys, and humans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=J.|last2=Baum|first2=M. J.|date=July 2000|title=Neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH release in induced ovulators|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=220–262|doi=10.1006/frne.2000.0198|issn=0091-3022|pmid=10882541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Induced ovulation''' is the process in which the pre-ovulatory LH surge and therefore ovulation is induced by some component of coitus e.g. receipt of genital stimulation. Usually spontaneous steroid-induced LH surges are not observed in induced ovulator species throughout their reproductive cycles, which indicates that GnRH release is absent or reduced due to lack of positive feedback action from steroid hormones. However, by contradiction some spontaneously ovulating species can occasionally undergo mating-induced preovulatory LH surges. Species in which the females are induced ovulators include cats, rabbits, ferrets, and camels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1985, Chen ''et al.'', used [[Bactrian camel]]s to investigate the factor(s) that induce ovulation during breeding season. They monitored the camel ovaries for ovulation by rectal palpation following insemination of semen samples. Chen ''et al.'', concluded that in this particular camel species ovulation was induced by the seminal plasma, and not by the spermatozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=B. X.|last2=Yuen|first2=Z. X.|last3=Pan|first3=G. W.|date=1985-07-01|title=Semen-induced ovulation in the bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus)|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/74/2/335|journal=Journal of Reproduction and Fertility|language=en|volume=74|issue=2|pages=335–339|doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0740335|issn=1470-1626|pmid=3900379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
Although the evolution of these two types of ovulation is not well understood, the type of ovulation that would be advantageous in some species can be understood by looking at social groups.  Animals that have large, complex social groups benefit from spontaneous ovulation as only the best males get to breed with females. If there are few males suitable for breeding it makes sense to spread out the times at which females are fertile, therefore increasing the proportion in which conception occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conaway|first=C. H.|date=June 1971|title=Ecological adaptation and mammalian reproduction|journal=Biology of Reproduction|volume=4|issue=3|pages=239–247|issn=0006-3363|pmid=5000279|doi=10.1093/biolreprod/4.3.239}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not explain the evolution of ovulation in all species however, for example some species appear to show estrus synchronisation.

== Mechanism ==
In spontaneous ovulators, [[estrogen]] secreted by the follicles as they grow and mature affects the release of GnRH, and therefore causes an LH surge.

Ovulation is triggered in induced ovulators by a LH surge from the anterior pituitary that is induced during mating. Animals this has been recorded in include rabbits, voles, ferrets and camels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some species such as the ferret the duration of intromission has no effect on the LH surge, whereas in other species such as the cat these are related and higher levels of LH were produced by mating multiple times. In many species, for a LH surge to occur, little intromission is required.

The pathways in which information reaches the brain and causes GnRH release are not understood well, however midbrain and brainstem noradrenergic neurones appear to be activated in response to intromission during mating. These neurones then go on to stimulate the mediobasal hypothalamic to release GnRH from the median eminence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most experiments on GnRH and LH release have been focused on spontaneous ovulators, however there have been studies completed on some induced ovulators - rabbit and ferret. From this, it appears that norepinephrine facilitates GnRH release in the rabbit and ferret and the [[Locus coeruleus|locus coereuleus]] which is the part of the brain involved in conveying genital-somatosensory information to the GnRH neurones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spies|first=H.

== Species ==
Many species have been found to be induced ovulators and the reasons for this are not always clear.  However, one possible reason is that induced ovulation could provide a better reproductive potential for those species that typically have shorter life spans and less encounters resulting in lower mating opportunities throughout their lifetime.&lt;ref name=Katandukila&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katandukila|first1=Jestina V.|last2=Bennett|first2=Nigel C.|title=Pattern of ovulation in the East African root rat (''Tachyoryctes splendens'') from Tanzania: induced or spontaneous ovulator?|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=May 2016|volume=94|issue=5|pages=345–351|doi=10.1139/cjz-2015-0217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodents such as [[Mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s are known induced ovulators.  In rats the [[East African root rat]] and the Cape-Dune, Natal, Highvield and [[blind mole rat]]s are known induced ovulators.  These species require mating to stimulate the vagina and cervix, resulting in ovulation in the females.  The East African root rat has been found to have small [[penile spines|spines on its penis]] which are also thought to contribute to this stimulation of induced ovulation.&lt;ref name=Katandukila /&gt;

Mice are also thought to be induced ovulators.  Studies have found that the [[Luteinizing hormone|lutenising hormone]] (LH) is crucial to bring about the induced ovulation.  Disruption in LH surges in the mice and knockout of the [[progesterone]] receptor (progesterone is known to help maintain a pregnancy) results in lowered fertility of the mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Shannon B. Z.|last2=Tolson|first2=Kristen P.|last3=Rouse|first3=Melvin L.|last4=Poling|first4=Matthew C.|last5=Hashimoto-Partyka|first5=Minako K.|last6=Mellon|first6=Pamela L.|last7=Kauffman|first7=Alexander S.|date=September 2015|title=Absent Progesterone Signaling in Kisspeptin Neurons Disrupts the LH Surge and Impairs Fertility in Female Mice|journal=Endocrinology|volume=156|issue=9|pages=3091–3097|doi=10.1210/en.2015-1300|issn=1945-7170|pmc=4541622|pmid=26076042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[koala]] species are a lesser known induced ovulator.  The koalas require mating in which the presence of ejaculated semen is needed to stimulate the female to produce a LH surge (which would cause ovulation of a follicle).  Unlike many other animals, simply being in the presence of a male koala is not enough to induce ovulation itself, nor is vaginal stimulation on its own sufficient to cause induced ovulation to occur.&lt;ref name="Johnston 629–634"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=S. D.|last2=O'Callaghan|first2=P.|last3=Nilsson|first3=K.|last4=Tzipori|first4=G.|last5=Curlewis|first5=J.

The presence of koala semen in female koalas is known to be able to cause induced ovulation on its own, however only in just under 50% of the subjects tested but statistical [[Student's t-test|t tests]] confirmed this to be significant.&lt;ref name="Johnston 629–634"/&gt;

[[Cat]]s are another widely known induced ovulator.  After mating, the LH levels in female cats surge, and the time to ovulation can be predicted to occur between 1–2 days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shille|first=V.

[[Goat]]s too have been found to be induced ovulators.  A 1984 study saw [[LHRH]] injections were able to cause ovulation in goats that were of sexual maturity and already in [[oestrus]].  These injections had no influence on goats that were not in oestrus and could be because there is reduced sensitivity to LH and FSH receptors in the non oestrus stages of the cycle so the LHRH may not have been able to induce a great enough response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mizinga|first=K. M.|last2=Verma|first2=O.

[[Wolverine]]s are other known induced ovulators which require physical mating to cause ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mead|first=Rodney A.|last2=Bowles|first2=Mark|last3=Starypan|first3=Greg|last4=Jones|first4=Mike|date=1993-01-01|title=Evidence for pseudopregnancy and induced ovulation in captive wolverines (Gulo gulo)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zoo.1430120405/abstract|journal=Zoo Biology|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=353–358|doi=10.1002/zoo.1430120405|issn=1098-2361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horse]]s are induced ovulators and studies using combinations of PGF2alpa analogues, Lipsostiol, d-cloprostenol and hCG were able to artificially induce ovulation in this species though these neural pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Juliane|last2=Aurich|first2=Jörg|last3=Aurich|first3=Christine|date=2017-10-01|title=Effects of the Prostaglandin F2α Analogues Cloprostenol and Luprostiol in Combination With hCG on Synchronization of Estrus and Ovulation in Mares|url=http://www.j-evs.com/article/S0737-0806(17)30088-6/fulltext|journal=Journal of Equine Veterinary Science|language=English|volume=57|pages=67–70|doi=10.1016/j.jevs.2017.07.004|issn=0737-0806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Induced ovulation occurs in various [[carnivoran]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larivière | first1 = Serge | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Steven H. | year = 2003 | title = Evolution of induced ovulation in North American carnivores | url = https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/84/3/937/907965 | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 937–947 | doi=10.1644/bme-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bear species are able to have induced ovulation including the [[grizzly bear]], black [[bear]] and [[polar bear]] where both the presence of a male and mating itself are requirements for induced ovulation.  However, there are some suggestions that mating is not as strict a requirement for ovulation in bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Geng-Ruei|last2=Yang|first2=Chieh-Chung|last3=Hsu|first3=Son-Haur|last4=Lin|first4=Chang|last5=Chiu|first5=Chun-Lung|last6=Chan|first6=Fang-Tse|last7=Mao|first7=Frank Chiahung|title=Fecal Reproductive Steroid Profiles for Monitoring Reproductive Patterns in Female Formosan Black Bears (''Ursus thibetanus formosanus'')|url=http://www.bioone.org.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/doi/full/10.5735/086.048.0502|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|language=en|volume=48|issue=5|pages=275–286|doi=10.5735/086.048.0502|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black bears are widely confirmed induced ovulators.  It was observed that most females kept separate from males did not ovulate, where as females kept in areas with male bears did.  Mating between the bears caused elevated progesterone levels, and this was seen by increased progesterone levels measured in the bears in the months that followed the mating seasons.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okano|first=Tsukasa|last2=Nakamura|first2=Sachiko|last3=Nakashita|first3=Rumiko|last4=Komatsu|first4=Takeshi|last5=Murase|first5=Tetsuma|last6=Asano|first6=Makoto|last7=Tsubota|first7=Toshio|date=2006|title=Incidence of Ovulation without Coital Stimuli in Captive Japanese Black Bears (''Ursus thibetanus japonicus'') based on Serum Progesterone Profiles|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/68/10/68_10_1133/_article/-char/ja/|journal=Journal of Veterinary Medical Science|volume=68|issue=10|pages=1133–1137|doi=10.1292/jvms.68.1133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In black bears the presence of a males was enough to cause a notable rise in progesterone levels even without mating but mating. This could suggest that [[Pheromone|pheromonal]]/[[chemosensory]] factors could also contribute to induced ovulation in some species.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Induced ovulation is able to occur in some fish species.  In China freshwater fish including a variety of [[carp]] types, [[bream]] and loach are able to be induced to ovulate by using agonists of [[dopamine]].  This induction of ovulation from drugs is able to cause a predictable ovulation period and is very beneficial to farming of these species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Richard E.|last2=Lin|first2=Hao-Ren|last3=Van Der Kraak|first3=Glen|date=1988-11-01|title=Induced ovulation and spawning of cultured freshwater fish in China: Advances in application of GnRH analogues and dopamine antagonists|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0044848688900804|journal=Aquaculture|series=Induced Spawning of Asian Fishes|volume=74|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/0044-8486(88)90080-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In cattle ==
The natural cycle of spontaneous ovulation occurs in species such as [[Cattle|cows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogle|first=O. A.|last2=Ratto|first2=M. H.|last3=Adams|first3=G. P.|date=2011-08-01|title=Evidence for the conservation of biological activity of ovulation-inducing factor in seminal plasma|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/142/2/277|journal=Reproduction|language=en|volume=142|issue=2|pages=277–283|doi=10.1530/REP-11-0042|issn=1470-1626|pmid=21652637}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a great demand for ovulation to be induced in cattle, as it allows farmers to synchronize their cattle to ovulate at the same time, helping improve the efficiency of dairy farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiltbank|first=Milo C.|last2=Pursley|first2=J. Richard|date=2014-01-01|title=The cow as an induced ovulator: Timed AI after synchronization of ovulation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X13003828|journal=Theriogenology|volume=81|issue=1|pages=170–185|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.09.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Induced ovulation can be utilized during the warmer seasons to increase plasma progesterone and improve the fertility of the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Rensis|first=F.|last2=Valentini|first2=R.|last3=Gorrieri|first3=F.|last4=Bottarelli|first4=E.|last5=Lopez-Gatius|first5=F.|date=2008-06-01|title=Inducing ovulation with hCG improves the fertility of dairy cows during the warm season|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X08000642|journal=Theriogenology|volume=69|issue=9|pages=1077–1082|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.01.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ovulation can only be induced in cows with mature follicles and merely initiates lutenization, it does not reduce the time for ovulation.

There are a number of methods that are used to induce ovulation in cattle such as: artificial insemination, introducing a number of hormones such as chorionic gonadotrophin,  hCG and LH. As well as injecting progesterone by intravaginal devices called PRIDs (progesterone-releasing intravaginal devices)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yavas|first=Y.|last2=Wallon|first2=J.S.|date=2000-07-01|title=Induction of ovulation in postpartum suckled beef cows: A review|url=http://www.theriojournal.com/article/S0093-691X(00)00322-8/pdf|journal=Theriogenology|language=English|volume=54|issue=1|doi=10.1016/S0093-691X(00)00322-8|issn=0093-691X|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cats==
Domestic [[cat]]s are often described as induced ovulators. During intromission, the penis probably causes distension of the posterior vagina and induces release of [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] (GnRH) from the [[hypothalamus]] via neuroendocrine reflexes. A surge of [[Luteinizing hormone|luteinising hormone]] (LH) occurs within minutes of mating. With multiple matings, the LH surge is greater and lasts longer than when only one mating occurs.  There are reports of ovulation without mating in cats. Spontaneous ovulation not only occurs in cats, but occurs with some frequency. It appears that non-copulatory ovulation may be possible in response to a variety of visual, auditory or olfactory cues. It is more appropriate to consider domestic cats to be both an induced and spontaneous ovulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estrus|url=http://vetbook.org/wiki/cat/index.php/Estrus|year=2012|publisher=The University of Sydney|accessdate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rabbits==
It has been known since 1905&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heape, W.|year=1905|title=Ovulation and degeneration of ova in the rabbit|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|volume=76|pages=260–268|doi=10.1098/rspb.1905.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; that domestic [[rabbit]]s are physically induced ovulators, although they may also ovulate spontaneously.  Early reports stated that simply having an oestrous doe in close proximity to a buck can induce ovulation, although there were no data presented in these early reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staples, R.E.|journal=J.

===Bactrian camel===
Bactrian camels ovulate after insemination into the vagina; it is the seminal plasma, but not the spermatozoa, which induces ovulation.  Ovulation occurs in 87% of females after insemination: 66% ovulate within 36 h and the rest by 48 h (the same as natural mating). The least amount of semen required to elicit ovulation is about 1.0 ml.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J. Reprod.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9968">{{Star formation}}

In [[astronomy]], the '''initial mass function''' ('''IMF''') is an [[empirical]] function that describes the initial [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of masses for a population of stars.  The IMF is an output of the process of [[star formation]].  The IMF is often given as a [[Probability distribution|probability distribution function]] (PDF) for the mass at which a star enters the [[main sequence]] (begins [[nuclear fusion|hydrogen fusion]]).  The distribution function can then be used to construct the [[mass distribution]] (the [[histogram]] of stellar masses) of a population of stars.  It differs from the '''present day mass function''' (PDMF), the current distribution of masses of stars, due to the evolution and death of stars which occurs at different rates for different masses as well as dynamical mixing in some populations.

The properties and evolution of a star are closely related to its mass, so the IMF is an important diagnostic tool for astronomers studying large quantities of stars.  For example, the initial mass of a star is the primary factor determining its [[Stellar classification|colour]], [[luminosity]], and lifetime.  At low masses, the IMF sets the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] mass budget and the number of substellar objects that form.  At intermediate masses, the IMF controls chemical enrichment of the [[interstellar medium]].  At high masses, the IMF sets the number of core collapse [[supernovae]] that occur and therefore the kinetic energy feedback.

The IMF is relatively invariant from one group of stars to another, though some observations suggest that the IMF is different in different environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2012ApJ...760...71C | title=The Stellar Initial Mass Function in Early-type Galaxies From Absorption Line Spectroscopy.

==Form of the IMF==
[[File:Plot of various initial mass functions.svg|thumbnail|Initial mass function]]

The IMF is often stated in terms of a series of [[power law]]s, where &lt;math&gt;N(m) \mathrm{d}m&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes also represented as &lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m&lt;/math&gt;), the number of stars with masses in the range &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m + \mathrm{d}m
&lt;/math&gt; within a specified volume of space, is proportional to &lt;math&gt;m^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless exponent. The IMF can be inferred from the present day stellar [[luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]] by using the stellar  [[mass-luminosity relation]] together with a model of  how the star formation rate varies with time. Commonly used forms of the IMF are the Kroupa (2001) [[broken power law]]&lt;ref name="Kroupa01"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Pavel | last = Kroupa | title = On the variation of the initial mass function | journal = MNRAS | volume = 322 | issue = 2 | pages =  231–246 | date = 2001 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04022.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0009005 |bibcode = 2001MNRAS.322..231K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chabrier (2003) log-normal.&lt;ref name="Chabrier03"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Gilles | last = Chabrier | title = Galactic stellar and substellar initial mass function | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | volume = 115 | issue = 809 | pages = 763–795 | date = 2003 | doi=10.1086/376392|arxiv = astro-ph/0304382 |bibcode = 2003PASP..115..763C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salpeter (1955) ===
The IMF of stars more massive than our sun was first quantified by [[Edwin Salpeter]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  first = Edwin | last = Salpeter | title = The luminosity function and stellar evolution | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 121 | pages = 161 | date = 1955 | doi=10.1086/145971|bibcode = 1955ApJ...121..161S }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work favoured an exponent of &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2.35&lt;/math&gt;. This form of the IMF is called the '''Salpeter function''' or a Salpeter IMF. It shows that the number of stars in each mass range decreases rapidly with increasing mass.  The Salpeter Initial Mass Function is 
:&lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m= \xi_{0}\left(\frac{m}{M_\odot}\right)^{-2.35}\left(\frac{\Delta m}{M_\odot}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;M_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar mass]], and &lt;math&gt;\xi_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant relating to the local stellar density.

=== Miller-Scalo (1979) ===
Later authors extended the work below one [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}). Glenn E. Miller and [[John M. Scalo]] suggested that the IMF "flattened" (approached &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;) below one solar mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Glenn | last2 = Scalo | first2 = John | title = The initial mass function and stellar birthrate in the solar neighborhood | journal = Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume = 41 | pages = 513 | date = 1979 | doi=10.1086/190629|bibcode = 1979ApJS...41..513M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kroupa (2001) ===
[[Pavel Kroupa]] kept &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2.3&lt;/math&gt; above half a solar mass, but introduced &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1.3&lt;/math&gt; between {{Solar mass|0.08-0.5|link=y}} and &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.3&lt;/math&gt; below {{Solar mass|0.08}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\xi(m) = m^{-\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = 0.3 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m&lt;0.08,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = 1.3 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; 0.08&lt;m&lt;0.5,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = 2.3 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m&gt;0.5 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Chabrier (2003) ===
Chabrier 2003 for individual stars:
:&lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m= 0.158 (1/(\ln(10) m)) \exp[- (\log(m)-\log(0.08))^2/(2 \times 0.69^2)]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\xi(m) = k m^{-\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &gt; 1, \alpha = 2.3 \pm 0.3 &lt;/math&gt;

Chabrier 2003 for stellar systems (e.g. binaries):
:&lt;math&gt;\xi (m) \Delta m= 0.086 (1/(\ln(10) m)) \exp[- (\log(m)-\log(0.22))^2/(2 \times 0.57^2)]&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\xi(m) = k m^{-\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; m &gt; 1, \alpha = 2.3 \pm 0.3 &lt;/math&gt;

==Slope==
The initial mass function is typically graphed on a logarithm scale of log(N) vs log(m).  Such plots give approximately straight lines with a slope Γ equal to 1-α.  Hence Γ is often called the slope of the initial mass function.  The present day mass function, for coeval formation, has the same slope except that it rolls off at higher masses which have evolved away from the main sequence.&lt;ref name=massey&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1998ASPC..142...17M|title=The Initial Mass Function of Massive Stars in the Local Group|journal=The Stellar Initial Mass Function (38Th Herstmonceux Conference)|volume=142|pages=17|last1=Massey|first1=Philip|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainties ===
There are large uncertainties concerning the [[Brown dwarf|substellar region]]. In particular, the classical assumption of a single IMF covering the whole substellar and stellar mass range is being questioned in favour of a two-component IMF to account for possible different formation modes of substellar objects. I.e. one IMF covering brown dwarfs and very-low-mass stars on the one hand, and another ranging from the higher-mass brown dwarfs to the most massive stars on the other. Note that this leads to an overlap region between about 0.05 and {{Solar mass|0.2}} where both formation modes may account for bodies in this mass range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |arxiv= 1112.3340| last1 = Kroupa | first1 = Pavel | display-authors = etal | booktitle = Stellar Systems and Galactic Structure, Vol. V | title = The stellar and sub-stellar IMF of simple and composite populations | date = 2012|bibcode = 2013pss5.book..115K |doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-5612-0_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology''' is an independent qualifying body for food professionals based in the UK and is concerned with all aspects of food science and technology.

The IFST was established to advance food science and technology, to advance education in the area and to make progress in applying principles of food science for the benefit, safety and health of the public. It serves the public by taking into account the many elements that are important for the efficient and responsible supply, manufacture and distribution of safe, wholesome, nutritious, and affordable foods with due regard for the environment, animal welfare and the rights of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Poole, Chief Executive of the Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology|url=http://www.research-europe.com/index.php/2011/08/jon-poole-chief-executive-of-institute-of-food-science-technology/|publisher=Research Media Ltd|author=Tom Spencer|date=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the 1950s, food science and technology became a subject in its own right. The UK National College of Food Technology was established in 1955 and food science degree courses began to be taught in four UK universities and one polytechnic. By the 1960s, food science and technology graduates and other scientists who were working with food felt the need for an institution that recognised the new discipline of food science and technology. The IFST was formed in 1964 to cater for this new breed of scientists and work began rapidly on creating and developing the new organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanchfield|first=Ralph|title=My 62 years in food science and technology: some reflections|url=http://www.jralphb.co.uk/62%20years%20in%20fst.pdf|work=International Review of Food Science and Technology 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968, the Institute became an incorporated body, with a Memorandum and Articles of Association and Bye-Laws.

===Development===
During the 1970s, IFST further development its range of professional activities. In 1980, IFST became a full member of the Council of Science and Technology Institutes (the predecessor to the [[Science Council]]).&lt;ref name="IFST History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Institute of Food Science and Technology|url=http://www.ifst.org/about_ifst/history/|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following decade, IFST focused on its public benefit role, in particular, the initiative to form the [[European Federation of Food Science and Technology]] (EFFoST), and the further development of its scientific publications.

===Into the 21st century===
In November 2007, the Charity Commission granted charitable status to the IFST company. IFST is a member-based organisation governed by a Board of Trustees, who are elected by the members. The Board is assisted by a Finance Committee and a small Executive Team. There are six standing committees, each of which deals with a particular aspect of the Institute and advises the Board on relevant topics.&lt;ref name="IFST Organisational Structure"&gt;{{cite web|title=IFST Organisational Structure|url=http://www.ifst.org/documents/misc/organogram%20governance%20structure%20070411.pdf|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt; These committees are made up of IFST members and chaired by a member of the Board, all volunteer based. The IFST member base represents the largest food science and technology community in Europe. IFST is the only qualifying body in the UK dedicated to food science and technology.

==IFST's activities==
The IFST aims to serve the public with competence and integrity.  The IFST lists its aims as:
# Benefiting the public supply of safe, wholesome, nutritious, tasty and attractive food through the application of sound science and technology;
# Improving public knowledge and awareness of important issues relating to the supply, production, safety and quality of food ;
# Developing and communicating the knowledge underlying food science and technology, and furthering the education of food scientists and technologists;
# Safeguarding the public by defining, promoting and upholding professional standards of competence, integrity and ethical behaviour; and
# Maintaining these standards by encouraging members to continue their professional education and development throughout their careers.

As an independent body, the IFST claims it can take an independent and objective evidence-based position on all matters relevant to food science, food technology and food professionalism.

The IFST retains strong links with the US-based [[Institute of Food Technologists]] (IFT) and with the [[International Union of Food Science and Technology]] (IUFoST).

===Events===
IFST hold a number of regional and national events in the UK, some of which are organised by IFST's regional branches or professional groups. The majority of these events are open to the public. IFST hold a number of conferences including the IFST Annual Spring Conference and AGM, The Changing Face of Auditing (organised by the IFST Western branch), and the IFST Professional Food Sensory Group (PFSG) Annual Conference. They also organise lectures, discussions, and various other events. On a regional level, many branches organise food-themed outings to breweries, factories, orchards and related places.

===Careers===
IFST does a great deal to promote careers within food science and technology to young people. IFST, in partnership with the [[Food and drink federation]] (FDF) and The National Skills Academy for Food and Drink, have launched Taste Success, a campaign dedicated to demonstrating the vast opportunities within food science and technology, particularly the food and drink manufacturing sector.

IFST's Learning Zone&lt;ref name="Learning Zone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Zone|url=http://www.ifst.org/learninghome/|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a great deal of information about careers in food science and technology including a list of UK universities offering food science and technology related courses (from foundation level to postgraduate) and testimonials from IFST members about their careers. IFST have also designed a ''Graduate Guide to Food Science and Technology'' which is available in print or online.&lt;ref name="Graduate Guide to Food Science and Technology"&gt;{{cite web|title=IFST Graduate Guide to Food Science and Technology|url=http://www.excelpublishing.co.uk/IFST/|publisher=Excel Publishing Company on behalf of IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, IFST, in partnership with Camden BRI, held the first of their annual Student Career LaunchPad event, supporting university students from across the UK. The event included a series of sessions aimed to enhance the students' understanding of the food science industry, opportunities to network with food professionals and a student competition sponsored by Heinz.
IFST offers a number of prizes and awards for students studying food science and technology.

===Prizes and awards===
IFST offers a great deal of prizes and awards:&lt;ref name="IFST Prizes and Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prizes and Awards|url=http://www.ifst.org/professional_development/prizesandawards/|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accreditation schemes===
The Safe and Local Supplier Approval (SALSA) is a food safety certification scheme which assists small food and drink businesses in supplying their products to national and regional buyers. IFST operate the scheme throughout the UK. SALSA have also developed a [[HACCP]] training initiative designed to support small and micro businesses. There are two courses: ''Level 1 – HACCP awareness'' and ''Level 2 – HACCP understanding''. Successful participants are awarded a nationally recognised food industry qualification accredited by IFST.

Through the Professional Food Sensory Group (PFSG), IFST offers accreditation of sensory training courses at both the Foundation and Intermediate level for any organisation providing sensory training/education.

IFST have developed a Register of Professional Food Auditors and Mentors (RPFAM),&lt;ref name="Specialist Register - Food Auditors and Mentors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Specialist Register – Food Auditors and Mentors|url=http://www.ifst.org/professional_development/auditors_and_mentors/register_of_food_auditors_and_mentors/|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent measure of the skills, experience, and knowledge of professionals offering audit and consultancy services to food companies. This is available to both members and non-members.

IFST has also compiled a list of its Members and Fellows who are prepared to act as consultants or provide other technical services. This list is accessible to the public on the IFST website.

==Membership==
IFST members are drawn from all over the world from varied backgrounds including industry (manufacturing, retailing and food service), academia, government, research and development, quality assurance and food law enforcement.

===Types of membership===
Membership is open to professionals who are active or interested in food science and technology. Membership requirements vary depending on the type. To qualify as a Member (MIFST) or Fellow (FIFST), the applicant must present a recognised academic or professional qualification (or be able to demonstrate attainment of comparable knowledge), a certain amount of relevant experience and well-informed comments from two suitable referees. Members are bound by an ethical Code of Professional Conduct.

===UK regional branches===
IFST has a number of regional branches across the UK, allowing members to network with other IFST members, attend meetings, and partake in activities on a local level. Each branch has their own Committee, which organises activities including conferences, meetings, competitions, lectures, and other various events.

The regional branches are:
* Scottish
* Northern Ireland
* North of England
* Midland
* South Eastern
* Eastern
* Western

===Professional development===
IFST offers many opportunities for professional development. Like many other professional organisations, IFST run a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) scheme to encourage members to remain active in their careers.

The '''International Association of Master Penmen, Engrossers and Teachers of Handwriting''' ('''IAMPETH''') (pronounced "I am Peth") is an international association for practicing and preserving the arts of [[calligraphy]], engrossing and [[penmanship]]. IAMPETH was founded in 1949.

IAMPETH maintains an archive of works of past masters (viewable, in person, only to members during the Annual Conference) in addition to online instruction guides on lettering styles such as [[Copperplate script|Copperplate]], [[Spencerian script]], [[Illuminated manuscript]] production (engrossing) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iampeth.com/lessons |title=Lessons |publisher=IAMPETH |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the organization's collection has been digitally preserved and is available on their Internet Archive profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/@iampeth |title=IAMPETH |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual conference is held each year during the months of July or August in a US city. The convention consists of various classes, banquets, and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iampeth.com/conferences |title=Annual Conference |publisher=IAMPETH |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 IAMPETH introduced a new Certificate Program, replacing the Master Penman Program which was discontinued in 2015. This program allows all members who have been with the organization for three or more years to submit work to be considered for Certificate of Proficiency, Certificate of Excellence, and finally a  Master Penman's Certificate. Current application requirements and associated costs are viewable by members only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iampeth.com/certificate |title=Certificate |publisher=IAMPETH |accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAMPETH is composed of members from various countries. Dues range from $25 to $55 USD. Membership occasionally closes, temporarily, prior to the Annual Conference. 

==IAMPETH Goals==
*Practice and teach the arts of calligraphy, engrossing and fine penmanship
*Restore the teaching of penmanship in schools
*Improve the handwriting of young people
*Preserve and share with others the rich tradition of American Penmanship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4649">"'''Joke'''" is a [[comedy]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]] written and performed by [[English people|English]] [[comedian]]s [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Richard Curtis]]. It was performed live during Atkinson's 1980 tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. A live recording was made at the [[Grand Opera House (Belfast)|Grand Opera House]] in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], on 19 or 20 September 1980 and released as the last track on Atkinson's [[live album|live]] comedy [[album]], ''[[Live in Belfast]]''.

==Synopsis==
At the start of the sketch, Rowan Atkinson's character tells Richard Curtis' character he's "got a [[joke]]". He goes on to explain, "It's one of those ones where I ask a question and you say 'I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot'." Rowan begins the joke by saying, "I say, I say, I say, what is the secret of great comedy?" Richard replies by literally saying, "I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot." After laughing at his own wit, Richard tells the annoyed Rowan that he'll "do it again." Rowan repeats the question and Richard replies, "I don't know. What is the secret to great comedy?" However, before Richard can finish his reply, Rowan interrupts, "timing." The point of the joke is that Rowan deliberately got his timing wrong when saying that timing is the secret to great comedy; however, Richard does not understand the joke. Bewildered by Richard's stupidity, Rowan enquires, "But didn't you see?" "Sorry, was it a visual joke?" Richard replies, still confused. After trying the joke a third time, Richard still does not understand the [[irony]] of the joke. Annoyed by Richard, Rowan asks, "Don't you think that's a clever joke?" to which Richard replies, "Clever... no. Joke... no." Disheartened by his joke falling flat with Richard, he claims "it was very funny when Michael told it," then makes the excuse that his timing might be out to which Richard replies, "It could be other factors like the complete absence of anything funny in the joke." Rowan proclaims, "It's so difficult telling jokes," before suddenly exclaiming that he has another joke that is "far more straightforward" to which Richard replies, "As long as it's funny, I don't mind."

The second joke begins with Rowan saying, "Knock! Knock! Who's there? Death..." but he is interrupted by Richard who complains that [[knock-knock joke]]s "are meant to be two-handers". Rowan argues that this joke "doesn't work that way". It becomes apparent that Rowan is attempting to tell the same joke told by Toby, the [[Devil]], during a previous sketch. The joke is meant to go "Knock, Knock. Who's there? Death. Death wh..." at which point the person telling the joke pretends to die. If a second person was replying in the joke, they would not know to pretend to die when saying "Death who?". Richard protests and Rowan gives in and the pair attempt the knock-knock joke in the "old way". Richard, ignorant to the fact he is meant to say the [[punch line]], replies "Death who?" and Rowan replies "Ah, now, that's where it goes wrong." Rowan explains to Richard how he is meant to say the punch-line but after another attempt at the joke, Richard replies wrong. Rowan, getting increasingly more annoyed as the sketch goes on, says he has another joke and this time he will be "third time lucky".

Rowan explains that the third joke is "a very old joke but a very good joke". Rowan begins to tell the classic joke, which begins "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to [[Jamaica]]". The person replying is meant to say, "Jamaica?" which sounds like "D'you make 'er?" or "Did you make her?". The joke-teller then replies, "No, of her own accord." However, when Rowan says, "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to Jamaica," Richard replies, "Of her own accord?" which ruins the whole joke and causes Rowan to [[profanity|swear]] loudly and give up telling jokes to Richard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6206">'''Julian Sleigh''', (6 October 1927 in [[Florence]] - 2 October 2013 in [[Cape Town]]) was a [[Christian Community]] priest, councillor, founding member of [[Camphill]] in [[South Africa]] and author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florisbooks.co.uk/authors/julian-sleigh.php Author Page, Floris Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Julian Sleigh was born in [[Florence, Italy]] on October 6, 1927 where his father lectured at the [[British Institute]], and was  baptised in the [[Florence Baptistery]] in the Roman Catholic faith. He spent his early childhood and schooling there before the family moved to London just before the war. On completing school he studied at the [[London School of Economics]]. This was followed by two years of national service in which he was selected for officer training.

Having since his early years longed for a community of people within which to work, he sought out, then joined Camphill, Scotland before helping to found the Camphill School in [[Hermanus]], South Africa in 1958. Peter Roth, a priest, flew to South Africa to conduct the service and inspired Sleigh in his endeavour to become a priest himself.&lt;ref name="Walk"&gt;Julian Sleigh "A Walk Through My Life" The Visual Junction, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Christian Community==

In 1963 Sleigh left Camphill to study for the priesthood in Germany and Britain, closely mentored and later accompanied in setting up the work in South Africa by Dr Alfred Heidenreich and Evelyn Francis Derry. After he was ordained in 1965, he returned to South Africa and together with Heinz Maurer, became the founding priest of the Christian Community in Southern Africa. Shortly after this, he and his family moved from Hermanus to set up the first Camphill village, Alpha, that is today the Camphill Village West Coast to the north of Cape Town. Here many of the children with [[Special Needs]] that had gone through the Camphill schools could find a home and place to work. At the same time, Sleigh was a priest in the Camphill communities, arranging for a chapel to be built at Alpha.

==Public engagement, counseling and outreach==

Through his long association with Professor Vera Grover from the early days in Hermanus, Sleigh joined forces with her in founding the Western Cape Forum for Mental Handicap (today the Western Cape Forum for Intellectual Disability) in an attempt to uplift the quality of life and the awareness of people with special needs more effectively throughout the country. He was the founding chairman from 1971-1985 and the first Honorary Life Member of the Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcfid.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WCFID_AR2014-Sept-RunPages.pdf Death Notice Julian Sleigh - Annual Report 2013-2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074531/http://wcfid.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WCFID_AR2014-Sept-RunPages.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcfid.co.za/download/Annual-Report-WCFID-40Years.pdf Forty Years - 1971-2011 Western Cape Forum for Intellectual Disability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074429/http://wcfid.co.za/download/Annual-Report-WCFID-40Years.pdf |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, he was on the Executive of the National Council's (SANC) division for Mental Health and succeeded Prof. Grover as chairperson (1980-1984).

Soon after its inception in 1968, through his friendship with Rosemary van Niekerk, Western Cape Secretary of Lifeline South Africa, the telephone counseling service, Sleigh took the training as counsellor with Rev. Peter Storey. [[Lifeline (crisis support service)|Lifeline]] had been founded in Australia in 1963 by [[Alan Walker (theologian)|Sir Alan Walker]], using the counseling psychology and techniques developed by [[Carl Rogers]] and there are now centres in many different countries. Sleigh worked there as a volunteer for many years and helped set up the training together with Alan Hardie after the transfer of Peter Storey to Johannesburg as a Methodist bishop and inspired his book ''Crisis Points''.&lt;ref name="Walk" /&gt;

From 1968 onwards, beginning with the resettlement of former residents from [[District Six]], the [[coloured]] [[Township (South Africa)|township]] of [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] began to develop close to the Camphill village. Sleigh realised that facilities for the inevitable Special Needs requirements that are present in every community would have to be developed there. So he started the project that was, in time, to be taken over by Veronica Jackson and later by Mellville Segal, who wrote the book ''Turn Right At Magnolia Street'' to commemorate these experiences. Both had been long time co-workers of Camphill. They named the project Orion and it continues to function independently today under the name Orion Friendship Organisation.&lt;ref name="Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orion in South Africa II Melville Segal in Camphill Correspndence May/June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orion - Executive Annual Report: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionfriendship.org/home.php Homepage Orion Friendship Organisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073619/http://www.orionfriendship.org/home.php |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florisbooks.co.uk/authors/julian-sleigh-eulogy.php Eulogy by the Rev.

==Early life and education==
Louis Bancel LaFarge was born into a prominent American family. His grandfather, [[John LaFarge]], was a noted American artist. His grandmother was a granddaughter of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] and a direct descendant of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890279-1,00.html  "Religion: Reasoned Optimist,"] ''Time.'' March 3, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Bancel LaFarge, was an artist who continued his father's work in glass,&lt;ref name="mfaa"&gt;Monuments Men Foundation: [http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/monumentsmen/ Monuments Men] LaFarge, Maj. L. Bancel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Time.'' March 3, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother Tom was a mural painter.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, T. ''Emigrés in the Wilderness''. New York: Macmilland, 1941, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaFarge was a graduate of [[Harvard College]] and the [[Yale School of Architecture]].&lt;ref name="mfaa"/&gt; He married Margaret Hockaday, with whom he had three children: Timothy, Benjamin, and Celestine.

==Career==
LaFarge established himself as an architect in New York specializing in domestic architecture.  His practice was interrupted by military service in the Second World War.  At war's end, he returned to his work as an architect. At one time he served as president of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects (1958-1960), and he was a founding member of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (1965–70).&lt;ref name="nyt1989obit"/&gt;

==World War II==
Major LaFarge was assigned to the 7th Army in Europe during the Second World War.  He was the Chief of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives]] (MFAA) section.  LaFarge was the first MFAA officer to arrive in France after [[D-Day]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="mfaa"/&gt;

'''Law and development''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study of law and economic and [[social development]].  It examines the relation between law and development and analyzes how to use law as an instrument to promote economic and social development.

In the 1960s, some American organizations such as the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the law reform in [[developing countries]]. Legal scholars from leading American law schools wrote many articles discussing the contribution of law reform to economic development.  This was called the law and development movement. However, after only one decade, both key involved scholars and former [[Ford Foundation]] officials declared this movement failed.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek &amp; Galanter (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumably failed law and development revived in the 1980s, with the proliferation of law reform projects based on neoliberal ideals. These projects supported liberal reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization, with the emphasis on the rule of law. Substantial investments were made on these projects by international development agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, and other public agencies and private foundations, but these law reform projects were criticized for being ineffective or causing adverse impacts on development in many places in the world. 

The cause of the failure in the first and second law and development movements is that the law reform projects were developed and implemented without sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which LFIs impact economic and social development, which is affected by various socio-economic factors on the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Lee (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.lawanddevelopment.net The Law and Development Institute] was set up in 2009 to promote studies in law and development and develop a comprehensive analytical model for law and development, and the [http://www.degruyter.com/ldr Law and Development Review] was launched in 2008 as the only peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to law and development.

Many of the treatments—including physiotherapy, massage and others—are neither generally considered as 'alternative therapies' nor as standard treatments for developmental and learning disabilities. They are, however, sometimes given or recommended as treatments specifically for these disabilities and therefore included in the list. None of these therapies are supported by scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autism-watch.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Arthur Evans]] developed a relative dating scheme of '''Minoan chronology''' based on the excavations initiated and managed by him at the site of the ancient city of [[Knossos]]. He called the civilization that he discovered there [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]. The same scheme was later applied to the [[Greece|Greek]] mainland and the [[Cyclades]] Islands to form a general plan for dating events of the prehistoric and early historic [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. The relative chronology is based on the shapes and decorative styles of [[Minoan pottery]] found at many sites on [[Crete]] and elsewhere.

==Evans and Knossos==
[[Arthur Evans]] began excavating on a hill called ''tou tseleve he [[kephala]]'', "the headland of the chieftain", some three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the north coast of [[Crete]], on March 23, 1900. Two of the palace storerooms had been uncovered by Minos Kalokairinos in 1878, whose work ceased at the demand of the land owners. Simultaneously, coins and [[Seal (device)|seal]]s inscribed with a mysterious script were also discovered. These came to Evans' attention as the curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford]], a position he held from 1884 to 1908. The area was rumored to have been the site of the ancient city of [[Knossos]].

Evans examined the site on March 19, 1894. Nothing further could be done at that time, but in 1898 Crete became an independent republic. In 1899 Evans purchased the land with his own funds (his family had been factory owners in industrial Britain) and decided to set up an excavation. In the first two weeks he discovered the [[Linear A]] tablets, a streak of luck exceeded only by [[Carl Blegen]]'s legendary first day's dig at [[Pylos]], when he uncovered the Pylos tablets, written in [[Linear B]], a script also found at Kephala and named by Evans.

Attacking the site with crews of hundreds of diggers, Evans uncovered most of the site's {{convert|6|acre|m2}} within 6 seasons. By 1905 he had named the civilization whose traces he found there ''Minoan'', after the legendary king [[Minos]], and had created a detailed chronology of the serial phases of the pottery styles in Minoan Crete, based on what he found at [[Knossos]]. Subsequently he concerned himself mainly with restoration, an activity frowned upon by archaeologists of today. He continued to excavate there and elsewhere and to restore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webfea-lb.fea.aub.edu.lb/arch121/Aegean%20Art/page4.htm |title=Page 4 |publisher=Webfea-lb.fea.aub.edu.lb |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1935.

Evans was knighted in 1911 for his work. In 1921, the first edition of his monumental work, ''Palace of Minos'', was released, which became indispensable for any department of classical archaeology. On Evans' death in 1941, the British School of Archaeology assumed responsibility for the excavation, later turning the property over to the Greek government, while retaining excavation rights.

==Evans' chronology==
Evans' chronological framework had triple divisions each triply divided, a formula that has been retained, thus Early Minoan (EM) I, II and III, Middle Minoan (MM) I, II and III etc. Each subsection he divided into A and B, early and late. In 1918 [[Alan Wace|Alan J. B. Wace]] and [[Carl Blegen]] adapted Evans' chronology to the Greek mainland and the islands, where the culture was termed [[Helladic]] and [[Cycladic]]. In 1941 [[Arne Furumark]] applied the term Mycenaean to LH and LC. As it is clear that the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] dominated at Knossos at some point in Late Minoan (LM), the latter is often included under "Mycenaean" or called "Minoan-Mycenaean".
&lt;!---bunko: Usefully conceptualized in this artificially rigid serial organization, actual ceramics show blends of styles, either attesting gradual shifts in style or the conservative instincts of apprenticeship-trained potters and their patrons.--&gt;

The major study of Cretan pottery was Evans'. A very general stylistic trend was from dark decoration on a light background in the Early Minoan to white and red decorations on a dark wash or [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] in Middle Minoan. Finally, there was a return to the earlier manner of [[dark on light]] in Late Minoan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinclair Hood]], ''The Home of the Heroes: The Aegean before the Greeks'', 1975, {{ISBN|0-500-29009-1}}, Chapter 3, ''Dating the Bronze Age''.&lt;/ref&gt; New body shapes for vessels also emerged and various styles of decoration are evident within Evans' chronology.

Evans never intended to give exact calendrical dates to the pottery periods. He did correlate them roughly&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061206131707/http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/RA/HJK/HJKX.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; to better dated Egyptian periods using finds of Egyptian artifacts in association with Cretan ones and obvious similarities of some types of Cretan artifacts with Egyptian ones. Subsequent investigators checking Evans' work varied the dates of some of the periods a little, usually less than a few hundred years, but the chronological structure remains basically as Evans left it, a solid framework for placing events of Aegean prehistory.

Most criticism does not aim at the overthrow of Evans' system, but only complains that it does not capture all the data, such as local variations. Even with these faults the system has no competitors. In 1958 [[Nikolaos Platon]] proposed a new chronology at the Prehistoric Conference in Hamburg. In it, the terms "Pre-palace", "Old Palace" and "New Palace" were to replace Evans' scheme. The academic community accepted the scheme but not the replacement, simply stating where in Evans' system the new terms fit.

The one serious question&lt;ref&gt;There are many questions, of course, but this one persists and would overthrow an important part of Evans' chronology. A brief review can be found at the Stanford [http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/123 Archaeopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216052913/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:3455/Archaeopaedia/123 |date=2006-12-16 }} site.&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the date of the Knossos tablets. Allegations were made that Evans falsified the stratum in which the tablets were found to place the tablets at 1400 BCE when they ought to have been the same date as the Pylos tablets, 1200 BCE. This dispute became known as the [[Palmer-Boardman Dispute]] when it first appeared. Despite the intense debate that developed on the subject no conclusive evidence has yet been found to settle the question. A key part of the case was that a certain kind of vase, a stirrup jar (named from the handles) found in tablet contexts, is dated only to 1200. Other archaeologists hastened to the journalistic scene with instances of similar jars going back to 1400. The search for closure goes on. By default, archaeologists tend to use Evans' dating.

!'''Other names'''
!'''Relative chronology'''&lt;ref&gt;It is well-nigh impossible to peruse several books and articles on Crete and come up with anything like a uniform chronology. The underlying reason is no doubt that the time windows of the artifacts are not uniform. Some sites did not experience the full complement of periods; one period got extended over more than one elsewhere. The dates of the periods are not the same everywhere. The utility of a scheme such as Evans' becomes evident in a context such as this. It might be viewed as a median chronological framework.&lt;/ref&gt;
!'''Conventional dates, BCE'''&lt;ref&gt;The dates given below are a sampling from the noted works listed in the ''References'' section below. Many samples of other noted works might be selected with little likelihood of finding the same dates, but they would tend to vary about Evans' relative chronology. Note also that some of the authors, such as Hutchinson, revised their dates as part of the ongoing process of discovery. Even in different chapters of the same book the reader will find the same period dated differently by the same author.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the authors from Evans on recognize that some areas of the palaces found religious uses. On the other hand the throne rooms and private quarters tend to support the "great king" idea.

|Palaces were so destroyed by an earthquake ca. 1700 that they had to be rebuilt. This is the dividing line between Old and New Palace and between II and III.&lt;ref&gt;The events of course are not quite so simple. There was more than one earthquake. Old Palace at Knosses seems to have gone on modified until the middle of IIIA. There is some equivocation also about what building activities constitute "old" and "new", as earthquakes in Crete were frequent and rebuilding ongoing. The transition from old to new should not be regarded as any sharp event. The quest for precision goes on.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natality in population ecology''' is the scientific term for [[birth rate]].  Along with [[mortality rate]], natality rate is used to calculate the dynamics of a population.  They are the key factors in determining whether a population is increasing, decreasing or staying the same in size.  Natality is the greatest influence on a population’s increase.  Natality is shown as a crude birth rate or specific birth rate.  [[Crude birth rate]] is used when calculating population size (number of births per 1000 population/year), whereas specific birth rate is used relative to a specific criterion such as age.  By calculating specific birth rate, the results are seen in an age-specific schedule of births.

== Definitions ==
*Natality Rate – number of births per 1000 individuals per year.            
*Absolute Natality – the number of births under ideal conditions (with no competition, abundance of resources such as food and water, etc.). 
*Realized Natality – the number of births when environmental pressures come into play.

== Animal natality ==
Specific birth rate is used when calculating animal natality.  The criterion used is age.  Animal natality is expressed as an age-specific schedule of births.  This is represented by the quantity of young/unit of time by females in various age classes.  The age-specific birth schedule will count females that have only given birth to females.  Showing the number of females that have been born relative to the previous generation will show how much of that generation may have the ability to reproduce.  To construct the age-specific schedule, the average number of females born must be calculated.  A survivorship column must also be included to construct a fertility table.  Taking the survivorship column and the mx values from the life table, the number of offspring will be shown, giving us the natality rate.

=== Larger implications ===

[[File:Ursus maritimus us fish.jpg|thumb|alt=Two Polar Bear Cubs.|Calculating natality of animals such as these ''[[polar bear]]'' cubs can help with preservation efforts.]]

Calculating Natality for Animals has become an important part of the research for preservation of species.  Studies have been conducted to determine whether a species may be going extinct because of climate or availability of resources.  Measuring the natality of a species during extreme conditions such as drastic climate shift or a decrease in prey density will show scientists the measures that need to be taken to keep that species alive.  Studies have been conducted about the Polar Bear population in Svalbard, Norway from 1988 to 2002 (Derocher 2005).  As the average adult ages of both female and male increased, the natality rate decreased.  Due to this observation, there was an interest in discovering why.  The study was able to correlate the density of ringed seals, which are the polar bears’ main prey, to the low natality rates.

== Plant natality ==
Plants’ natality is more difficult to determine than animals.  The factors that make it difficult to measure are:

*Seed production of individual plants varying year to year.
*Seed production will also vary age class to age class.
*The seeds will become dormant for long periods of time before germinating
Plant natality is an uncertain factor to measure.  The time it takes for a plant to germinate its seeds may be extended over too long of a time period for accurate measurement.

== Natality in humans ==
Calculating and concluding the natality rate of humans is similar to animals.  Age-specific schedules are constructed when determining growth rate.  It can be used to find the effects that environmental chemicals/toxins have on women of a childbearing age (Axelrad 2010).  Birth rates are helpful in making government policies regarding population growth.  The [[birth rate]] is an item of concern and policy for a number of national governments. Some, including those of Italy and Malaysia, seek to increase the national birth rate using measures such as financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies to reduce the birth rate, for example, China's one child policy. Measures such as improved information about and availability of birth control have achieved similar results in countries such as Iran.

== Calculations where natality is a factor ==
*Natality rate: number of births/unit of time/Average Population
*For wildlife management:  N1 = N0 + (B − D) + (I − E)  Where:
**N1 = number of individuals at time 1
**N0 = number of individuals at time 0
**B = number of individuals born
**D = number of individuals that died
**I = number of individuals that immigrated
**E = number of individuals that emigrated between time 0 and time 1.
*Intrinsic rate of increase:  (dN/dt)(1/N) = r
**r= intrinsic rate of increase
**(dN/dt) = rate that population increases
**N = population size

An '''ore dock''' is a large structure used for loading [[ore]] (typically from railway cars or [[Ore jenny|ore jennies]]) onto ships, which then carry the ore to steelworks or to transshipment points. Most known ore docks were constructed near [[iron mines]] on the upper [[Great Lakes]] and served the lower Great Lakes. Ore docks still in existence are typically about {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|80|ft|m}} high, and vary from {{convert|900|ft|m}}  to {{convert|2400|ft|m}} in length. They are commonly constructed from wood, steel, [[reinforced concrete]], or combinations of these materials.&lt;ref name="sia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siahq.org/conference/duluth/papersessions/abstracts.html|work=ABSTRACTS from Paper Sessions of the [[Society for Industrial Archeology|SIA]] Annual Conference held on June 3, 2000 in Duluth, MN|title=Iron ore docks of the Great Lakes|author= Cooleybeck, Patrick — Moshe Safdie &amp; Associates, Somerville, MA|accessdate=2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are commonly used for loading [[bulk ore carrier]]s with high mass, low-value ore, such as [[iron ore]], in raw or [[taconite]] form.

==Construction ==
Ore docks are typically long, high structures, with a railway track or tracks along the top and a number of "pockets" into which ore is unloaded from railcars, typically by gravity. Each pocket has a chute that can be lowered to discharge the ore into the hold of a ship berthed alongside. The use of pockets and chutes allows the dock itself to be loaded with ore before it is transferred into the [[cargo ship|freighter]].&lt;ref name="marqCountry"&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.marquettecountry.org/ore.php|title=Check out Marquette's Iron Ore Docks|accessdate=2008-01-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214111324/http://www.marquettecountry.org/ore.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The docks' storage bins or pockets typically are wider at the top than the bottom, and they lead to movable steel chutes. These chutes project out over the water at a slight angle from the sides of the docks. The hinged chutes, which are lowered to drop ore from the pockets into ships, are located at twelve-foot intervals over the length of the dock.

This spacing is not coincidental, as the docks and the [[lake freighter|lakers]] they could load evolved together, and laker hatch spacing is typically 12, or {{convert|24|ft|m|sing=on}} on center.

==History==

Since the late 1800s, ore docks have been a common sight in many [[Lake Superior]] ports of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]] and especially [[Michigan]]. Rich [[iron ore]] deposits were first discovered in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] in the 1840s and remain a significant source of wealth for the state. By the 1890s, Michigan was the largest supplier of iron ore in the United States. Railroads would haul ore from the mines to the ore docks on the [[Great Lakes]] in places such as [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]] and [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]], where the cargo would be loaded onto ore freighters and transported to the rest of the country.

Iron ore was first discovered in Michigan's [[Upper Peninsula]] on September 19, 1844, by [[William A. Burt]], who was then employed to lead a party engaged in surveying the Upper Peninsula on behalf of the United States government. Variations in the readings of magnetic compasses employed suggested that something was disturbing the local magnetic fields, and, on investigation of part of the [[Marquette Iron Range]], ore was found as close to the surface as just below the sod.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.ulib.csuohio.edu/SpecColl/glihc/articles/carrhist.html|title=History of the Iron Ore Trade|work= 1910 Annual Report of the Lake Carriers' Association|accessdate=2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of this find was ongoing throughout the 1840s and early 1850s. The initial focus was on producing iron locally, as shipping was difficult. Early shipping attempts using [[mule]] teams, [[plank road]]s, and barrels loaded as deck cargo on [[schooner]]s required transshipment after [[portage|portaging]] the [[St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario)|St. Marys River]] rapids, and costs proved prohibitive. However, as the mines continued to develop and railways were put in place, the volume of ore increased, far outstripping the local production capacity. In 1855, the [[Soo Locks]] opened, and the volume of ore shipped increased, with the first year seeing 1447 tons on various brigs and schooners. The first dock specifically for the ore trade was built in Marquette in 1857. It was flat rather than elevated, and the vessels were loaded with wheelbarrows.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt;

By 1860, the volume of ore shipped through the Soo Locks had increased to 114,401 tons, only to fall again to 49,909 tons in 1861 after the [[American Civil War]] broke out. However, by 1862, an additional wooden dock had been constructed at Marquette, this time featuring an elevated railway trestle for ore jennies to discharge ore into pockets. In 1911 another iron ore loading dock was built, where the wooden frame work was replaced with a concrete and steel frame work.  The new iron ore loading dock at Marquette was 1200 feet long; 75 feet high; and 60 feet wide.  Four railroad tracks ran across the top and there was storage space inside the bottom concrete part for 60,000 tons of iron ore.  The new iron ore loading dock incorporated a concrete bottom half with and a light steel frame work on top; doing away with the wooden supports used in previous iron ore docks.  While more expensive than previous iron ore loading docks, that used both iron and wood frame works, the builders claimed the new construction would hold up far longer than the old construction method.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-t0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA878&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y4zsT9OSGMriqAGU1PW8BQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Concrete Steel Iron Ore Docks"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1911, p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt; Schooners now started to feature regularly spaced hatch covers, speeding up loading.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt; However [[steamship|steamer]]s of the day were not well adapted for bulk cargoes such as iron ore. They did not have hatches through their decks. Instead they had gangways through the sides. So ore shipments were loaded via wheelbarrows through the gangways. The docks had provisions for this by having a flat surface on one side and moorings directly under the pockets for schooners to receive the ore directly, while steamers moored on the opposite side of the dock.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt; However, unloading was still a laborious hand-powered affair.

During this period, the iron ore trade was dwarfed by the grain and lumber trade. For example, grain received at the port of [[Buffalo, New York]], alone in 1866 were about 1,500,000 tons, and the lumber received at [[Chicago, Illinois]], were about 400,000 tons, whereas the received amount of iron ore at all [[Lake Erie]] ports amounted to only 278,976 gross tons.&lt;ref name="ironOreHist"/&gt; Marquette remained the only port on [[Lake Superior]] that shipped iron ore until 1876.
&lt;ref name="MarqMarit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mqtinfo.org/history0006.asp |title=Maritime History |work=Marquette County Community Information site |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Civil War, advancement was rapid. The [[Cleveland-Cliffs|Cleveland Iron Mining Company]]'s dock was {{convert|30|ft|m}} above the lake level and was originally built with 29 schooner pockets and 6 steam boat pockets but, by 1872, had been extended an additional {{convert|350|ft|m}}, providing 54 additional pockets. During the 1873 season, the total tonnage of iron ore shipped from the port of Marquette was 1,175,000 tons.&lt;ref name="MarqMarit"/&gt;

As additional ranges (the Gogebic, Menominee East, and Menominee West) began to be developed, with the acceleration of the US as an industrial power, other (primarily Lake Superior) ports also constructed ore docks. For example, [[Ashland, Wisconsin]], the natural port for the Gogebic Range, had three docks by 1916, the first built by the Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railway in 1884-1885. It was {{convert|1400|ft|m}} long, with 234 pockets, and four tracks on the dock, and could hold 25,000 tons of ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsincentral.net/Culture041907.html |title=Ashland's iron ore docks, a fascinating history |work=Wisconsin Central |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural port for the Menominee East range was [[Escanaba, Michigan]]; the first docks there were built in 1865.

By 1884, locomotives played a vital part in hauling ore from the mines to the docks. The pockets and chutes were filled using the hopper type ore cars. In 1889, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway operated a dock with 284 pockets. The railroads also provided alternate transportation for people, goods and eventually, iron ore.

The length and capacity of docks corresponded with the capacity of the ore freighters which they were designed to accommodate. As ore carriers increased in height and width, higher pocket openings were required and it was necessary to construct new docks and rebuild old ones. In 1867, vessels carried ore cargoes of 550 tons. The first steel ore freighters introduced in the 1880s had a capacity of 2,500 tons. By 1898, ships were carrying 6,400 tons and by 1938, 15,000 tons.

The demand for iron ore grew, faster dispatch of vessels was necessary and larger cars and the number of more powerful locomotives for transporting the ore from mines to the docks increased with improved technology. These developments caused the old wooden Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway ore dock built in 1898 to become obsolete. A new dock was constructed by the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad Company of reinforced concrete and steel in 1911 and 1912 in the Upper Harbor near Presque Isle Park. This dock is {{convert|75|ft|m}} high, {{convert|1200|ft|m}} long and has 200 pockets with a total capacity of 50,000 tons of ore pellets. By 1929, more than one and one half times the combined yearly tonnage of the Panama and Suez Canals passed through the Soo Locks. The dock is still in use today.

Activity also continued in Marquette's Lower Harbor. The Duluth, South Short and Atlantic Railway, in order to remain competitive, completed construction of a new dock in 1932. This dock was constructed of steel and concrete, {{convert|85.5|ft|m}} high, {{convert|969|ft|m}} long, with 150 pockets. The total capacity was 47,500 tons. The D.S.S. &amp; A. Railway merged with other companies to form the Soo Line. The dock remained in operation until the late 1960s when a decrease in demand for iron ore forced it to close. In 1987, the Soo Line sold its Lake States Division to Wisconsin Central Ltd. and the ownership passed to the latter railroad where it remains today.

==Today==
Many docks have been torn down or abandoned, but a few remain in operation. The Lake Superior &amp; Ishpeming dock, one of the docks at [[Marquette, Michigan]], recently loaded its 400 millionth ton of ore after 90 years of service.&lt;ref name="miningJournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/49.html?nav=6|title=Ore dock marks 94-year milestone|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other dock, built later by [[Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott]] for the [[Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway]] (DSS&amp;A) was taken out of service in 1971. The largest dock of the type in the world exist in Superior, Wisconsin as part of BNSF's Allouez Taconite Facility, however, these docks have been abandoned since 1978. Two ore docks, one in Duluth, MN and one in Two Harbors, MN, are still in service  and operated by Canadian National Railway. Ore docks are mentioned in popular culture, at least one high school athletic team, the [[Ashland, Wisconsin]] Oredockers takes their name from them,&lt;ref name="milw_js"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=673733|title=Ore dock walks the plank, tower gets new ones|accessdate=2008-01-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214055959/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=673733 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have been mentioned in song.&lt;ref name="30th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesa12.k12.wi.us/30thstar/sceneIX/sceneIX.htm|title=Scene IX|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oriental studies''' is the academic field of study that embraces [[Near East]]ern and [[Far East]]ern societies and cultures, languages, peoples, history and archaeology; in recent years the subject has often been turned into the newer terms of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]]. Traditional Oriental studies in Europe is today generally focused on the discipline of [[Islamic studies]], while the study of China, especially traditional China, is often called [[Sinology]]. The study of [[East Asia]] in general, especially in the United States, is often called [[East Asian studies]], while the study of [[Israel]] and [[Jews]] are called [[Israel studies]] and [[Jewish studies]] respectively, although they are often considered the same field.

European study of the region formerly known as "the [[Orient]]" had primarily religious origins, which has remained an important motivation until recent times. Learning from Arabic medicine and philosophy, and the Greek translations from Arabic, was an important factor in the Middle Ages. Linguistic knowledge preceded a wider study of cultures and history, and as Europe began to encroach upon the region, political and economic factors encouraged growth in academic study. From the late 18th century archaeology became a link from the discipline to a wide European public, as treasures brought back filled new European museums. The modern study was influenced both by [[Imperialism|imperialist]] attitudes and interests, and also the sometimes naive fascination of the exotic East for Mediterranean and European writers and thinkers, captured in images by artists, that is embodied in a repeatedly-surfacing theme in the [[history of ideas]] in the West, called "[[Orientalism]]". In the last century, scholars from the region itself have participated on equal terms in the discipline.

== History of Oriental studies ==

=== Pre-Islam ===
The original distinction between the "West" and the "East" was crystallized in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] of the 5th century BC, when [[Athens|Athenian]] historians made a distinction between their "[[Athenian democracy]]" and the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] monarchy. An institutional distinction between East and West did not exist as a defined polarity before the ''Oriens-'' and ''Occidens''-divided administration of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s [[Roman Empire]] at the end of the 3rd century AD, and the division of the Empire into [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking portions. The classical world had intimate knowledge of their [[Ancient Persia]]n neighbours (and usually enemies), but very [[Sino-Roman relations|imprecise]] knowledge of most of the world further East, including the "[[Seres]]" (Chinese). However, there was substantial direct [[Roman trade with India]] (unlike with China) in the Imperial period.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:HaytonRemittingHisReportToThePope.JPG|left|thumb|[[Hayton of Corycus]] remitting his report on the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], to [[Pope Clement V]], in 1307.]]
The [[Spread of Islam|rise of Islam]] and [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century established a sharp opposition, or even a sense of polarity, between medieval European [[Christendom]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (which stretched from the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] to [[North Africa]] and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]]). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s were considered the "alien" enemies of Christendom. Popular medieval European knowledge of cultures farther to the East was poor, dependent on the wildly fictionalized travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]] and legends of [[Prester John]], although the equally famous, and much longer, account by [[Marco Polo]] was a good deal more accurate.

Scholarly work was initially very largely linguistic in nature, with primarily a religious focus on understanding both [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] and languages like [[Syriac language|Syriac]] with early Christian literature, but also from a wish to understand [[Arabic language|Arabic]] works on [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Islamic science|science]]. This effort, also called the ''[[Studia Linguarum]]'' existed sporadically throughout the Middle Ages, and the "[[Renaissance of the 12th century]]" witnessed a particular [[Latin translations of the 12th century|growth in translations]] of Arabic texts into Latin, with figures like [[Constantine the African]], who translated 37 books, mostly medical texts, from Arabic to Latin, and [[Herman of Carinthia]], one of the translators of the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete|earliest translation]] of the Qur'an into [[Latin]] was completed in 1143, although little use was made of it until it was printed in 1543, after which it was translated into other European languages. [[Gerard of Cremona]] and others based themselves in [[Al-Andaluz]] to take advantage of the Arabic libraries and scholars there. Later, with the Christian [[Reconquista]] in full progress, such contacts became rarer in Spain. Chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic were briefly established at Oxford, and four other universities following the [[Council of Vienne]] (1312).&lt;ref&gt;''Hebrew to Latin, Latin to Hebrew: the mirroring of two cultures'' 2006 Page 75 Giulio Busi, Freie Universität Berlin. Institut für Judaistik - 2006 "According to the famous decision of the council of Vienne (1311–1312), Oxford was chosen as one of four universities (with Paris, Bologna and Salamanca) where Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Aramaic were to be taught."&lt;/ref&gt;

There was [[Chronology of European exploration of Asia|vague but increasing]] knowledge of the complex civilizations in [[China]] and [[History of India|India]], from which luxury goods (notably [[cotton]] and [[silk]] textiles as well as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]]) were imported. Although the [[Crusades]] produced relatively little in the way of scholarly interchange, the eruption of the [[Mongol Empire]] had strategic implications for both the [[Crusader kingdoms]] and Europe itself, and led to [[Franco-Mongol alliance|extended diplomatic contacts]]. From the [[Age of Exploration]], European interest in [[Cartography of Asia|mapping Asia]], and especially the sea-routes, became intense, though mostly pursued outside the universities.

=== Renaissance to 1800 ===

[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (徐光啟) (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' (幾何原本) published in 1607.]]
University Oriental studies became systematic during the Renaissance, with the linguistic and religious aspects initially continuing to dominate. There was also a political dimension, as translations for diplomatic purposes were needed, even before the West engaged actively with the East beyond the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A landmark was the publication in Spain in 1514 of the first [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Polyglot Bible]], containing the complete existing texts in [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], in addition to Greek and Latin. At [[Cambridge University]] there has been a [[Regius Professor of Hebrew (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Hebrew]] since 1540 (the fifth oldest regular chair there), and the [[Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic|chair in Arabic]] was founded in about 1643. Oxford followed for Hebrew in 1546 (both chairs were established by Henry VIII). Distinguished scholars included [[Edmund Castell]], who published his ''Lexicon Heptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum, et Persicum'' in 1669, whilst some scholars like [[Edward Pococke]] had travelled to the East and wrote also on the modern history and society of Eastern peoples. The [[University of Salamanca]] had Professors of Oriental Languages from at least the 1570s. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] initiated a training programme for "Les Jeunes de langues", young linguists with the diplomatic service, like [[François Pétis de la Croix]], who like his father and his son served as Arabic interpreter to the King. Study of the [[Far East]] was pioneered by missionaries, especially [[Matteo Ricci]] and others in the [[Jesuit China missions]], and missionary motives were to remain important, at least in linguistic studies.

During the 18th century Western scholars reached a reasonable basic level of understanding of the geography and most of the history of the region, though knowledge of the areas least accessible to Western travellers, like [[Japan]] and [[Tibet]], and their languages, remained limited. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers characterized aspects of the pagan East as superior to the Christian West, in [[Montesquieu]]'s ''Lettres Persanes'' or [[Voltaire]]'s ironic promotion of [[Zoroastrianism]]; others, like [[Edward Gibbon]], praised the relative religious tolerance of the Middle East as opposed to the intolerant Christian West, and many, including [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], the high social status of scholarship in [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] China.
The [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"]] (English: University of Naples "L'Orientale"), founded in Naples, Italy, in 1732, is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent.

The end of the century saw the beginnings in the great increase in study of the [[archaeology]] of the period, which was to be an ever-more important aspect of the field through the next century. [[Egyptology]] led the way, and as with many other ancient cultures, provided the linguists with new material for decipherment and study.

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Kolkata Asiatic Society2.jpg|thumb|The old building of the [[Asiatic Society]] in [[Calcutta]], founded by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] in 1784]]
With a great increase in knowledge of Asia among Western specialists, increasing political and economic involvement in the region, and in particular the realization of the existence of [[Indo-European languages|close relations between Indian and European languages]], by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], there emerged more complex intellectual connections between the early history of Eastern and Western cultures. Some of these developments occurred in the context of Franco–British rivalry for control of India. Liberal economists, such as [[James Mill]], denigrated Eastern civilizations as static and corrupt. [[Karl Marx]], himself of [[Jewish]] origin, characterized the [[Asiatic mode of production]] as unchanging, because of the economic narrowness of village economies and the State's role in production. [[Oriental despotism]] was generally regarded in Europe as a major factor in the relative failure of [[progress (history)|progress]] of Eastern societies. The study of Islam in particular was central to the field since the majority of people living in the geographical area termed 'the Orient' were Muslims. Interest in understanding Islam was partly fueled by economic considerations of growing trade in the Mediterranean region and the changing cultural and intellectual climate of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004:44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the century Western archaeology spread across the Middle East and Asia, with spectacular results. In the 1850s, for example, the French Government was determined to mount large-scale operations in Assyria  and Mesopotamia to showcase its dominance in the region. An archaeological team led by [[Victor Place]] excavated the palace of the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]] in [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]] (formerly [[Nineveh]]), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. &lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition resulted in a pioneering publication entitled ''Ninevah and Assyria'', jointly authored by [[Victor Place]] and [[Felix Thomas]] and published in around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K., ''The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization,'' Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., “Ancient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,” ''Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin,'' Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on ''Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration,'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set],  Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio-min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;  New national museums provided a setting for important archaeological finds, most of which were in this period bought back to Europe, and put Orientalists in the public spotlight as never before.

The first serious European studies of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were by the scholars [[Eugene Burnouf]] and [[Max Müller]]. In that time, the academic [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|study of Islam]] also developed, and, by the mid-19th century, Oriental Studies was a well-established academic discipline in most European countries, especially those with imperial interests in the region. Yet, while scholastic study expanded, so did [[Racism|racist]] attitudes and stereotypes of "inscrutable", "wily" Orientals. This frequently extended to local [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] communities, who were also of [[Genetic studies on Jews|Oriental origin]] and widely recognized as such. Scholarship often was intertwined with prejudicial racist and religious presumptions,&lt;ref&gt;J. Go, "'Racism' and Colonialism: Meanings of Difference and Ruling Practice in America's Pacific Empire" in ''Qualitative Sociology' '''27'''.1 (March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; to which the new [[biology|biological sciences]] tended to contribute until the middle of the following century.

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Experts inspecting the [[Rosetta Stone]] during the [[Second International Congress of Orientalists]] in London, 1874]]
The participation in academic studies by scholars from the newly independent nations of the region itself inevitably changed the nature of studies considerably, with the emergence of [[post-colonial studies]] and [[Subaltern Studies]]. The influence of [[Orientalism]] (in the sense used by Edward Said in his [[Orientalism (book)|book of the same name]]) in scholarship on the Middle East was seen to have re-emerged and risen in prevalence again after the end of the Cold War. It is contended that this was partly a response to "a lacuna" in identity politics in international relations generally, and within the 'West' particularly, which was brought about by the absence of Soviet communism as a global adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Hippler and Andrea Lueg (eds.), ''The Next Threat: Western Perceptions of Islam'' (Pluto Press/The Transnational Institute, London, 1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The post–Cold War era has been marked by discussions of Islamist terrorism framing views on the extent to which the culture of the [[Arab world]] and Islam is a threat to that of the West. The essence of this debate reflects a presupposition for which Orientalism has been criticized - that the 'Orient' is defined exclusively by Islam. Such considerations as these were seen to have occurred in the wider context of the way in which many Western scholars responded to international politics in the post–Cold War world; and they were arguably heightened following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004), pp. 223–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of this type of response to the end of the [[Cold War]] was the popularization of the '[[clash of civilizations]]' thesis. This particular idea of a fundamental conflict between East and West was first advanced by [[Bernard Lewis]] in an article entitled "The Roots of Muslim Rage", written in 1990. Again, this was seen as a way of accounting for new forms and lines of division in post–Cold War international society. The 'clash of civilizations' approach involved another characteristic of Orientalist thought; namely, the tendency to see the region as being one, homogenous 'civilization', rather than as comprising various different and diverse cultures and strands. It was an idea that was taken on more famously by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] in his 1993 article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', called "The Clash of Civilizations?".&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Orientalism}}
The term ''Orientalism'' has come to acquire negative connotations in some quarters and is interpreted to refer to the study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by [[Edward Said]] in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=J.J.|title=Oriental enlightenment the encounter between Asian and Western thought|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;For example Thomas R. Trautmann in ''Aryans and British India'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-520-20546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From "Oriental Studies" to "Asian Studies" ==

{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}
Like the term ''[[Orient]]'', ''Orientalism'' derives from the Latin word ''oriens'' (rising) and, equally likely, from the Greek word ('he'oros', the direction of the rising sun). "Orient" is the opposite of ''[[Western world|Occident]]'', a term for the Western world. In terms of the [[Old World]], [[Europe]] was considered the [[Western world|Occident]] (the west), and its farthest-known extreme the [[Orient]] (the east).  Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the [[Middle East]]' was then considered 'the Orient'.  However, use of the various terms and senses derived from "Orient" has greatly declined in the 20th century, not least as trans-Pacific links between Asia and America have grown; nowadays, Asia usually arrives at the USA from the West.

In most [[North America]]n universities, Oriental Studies has now been replaced by [[Asian Studies]] localised to specific regions, such as [[Middle East]]ern or Near Eastern Studies, [[South Asia]]n studies, and [[East Asia]]n Studies.  This reflects the fact that the Orient is not a single, monolithic region but rather a broad area encompassing multiple [[civilization]]s. The generic concept of Oriental Studies, to its opponents, has lost any use it may have once had and is perceived as obstructing changes in departmental structures to reflect actual patterns of modern scholarship.  In many universities, like Chicago, the faculties and institutions have divided; the Biblical languages may be linked with theological institutes, and the study of ancient civilizations in the region may come under a different faculty to studies of modern periods.

In 2007 the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Cambridge University]] was renamed the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, but Oxford still has its [[Oriental Institute, Oxford|Faculty for Oriental Studies]], as do [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Chicago]], [[Pontifical Oriental Institute|Rome]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies|London]] (covering African studies also), and [[Oriental Institute (disambiguation)|other universities]].

Various explanations for the change to "Asian studies" are offered; a growing number of professional scholars and students of Asian Studies are themselves Asian or from groups of Asian origin (like [[Asian American]]s). This change of labeling may be correlated in some cases to the fact that sensitivity to the term "Oriental" has been heightened in a more [[politically correct]] atmosphere, although it began earlier: Bernard Lewis' own department at [[Princeton University]] was renamed a decade ''before'' Said wrote his book, a detail that Said gets wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etc.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/near_eastern_studies.html Princeton University, Near Eastern Studies department]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   By some, the term "Oriental" has come to be thought offensive to non-Westerners. [[Area studies]] that incorporate not only philological pursuits but [[identity politics]] may also account for the hesitation to use the term "Oriental".

Supporters of "Oriental Studies" counter that the term "[[Asia#Etymology|Asian]]" is just as encompassing as "Oriental," and may well have originally had the same meaning, were it derived from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for "East" (a more common derivation is from one or both of two Anatolian proper names). Replacing one word with another is to confuse historically objectionable ''opinions'' about the East with the concept of "the East" itself. The terms Oriental/Eastern and Occidental/Western are both inclusive concepts that usefully identify large-scale cultural differences. Such general concepts do not preclude or deny more specific ones.

PGIS combines [[Participatory Learning and Action]] (PLA) methods with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |title=Overview: Mapping for Change: The emergence of a new practice |author1=Jon Corbett |author2=Giacomo Rambaldi |author3=Peter Kyem |author4=Dan Weiner |author5=Rachel Olson |author6=Julius Muchemi |author7=Mike McCall |author8=Robert Chambers |year=2006 |work=54:13-19 IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081053/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGIS combines a range of geo-spatial information management tools and methods such as sketch maps, [[participatory 3D modelling]] (P3DM), [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[global positioning system]] (GPS) data to represent peoples' spatial knowledge in the forms of (virtual or physical) two- or three-dimensional maps used as interactive vehicles for spatial learning, discussion, information exchange, analysis, decision making and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=246&amp;article=263&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication in Developing Countries |author=Rambaldi G., Kwaku Kyem A.

PGIS practice is geared towards community empowerment through measured, demand-driven, user-friendly and integrated applications of geo-spatial technologies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} GIS-based maps and spatial analysis become major conduits in the process. A good PGIS practice is embedded into long-lasting spatial decision-making processes, is flexible, adapts to different socio-cultural and bio-physical environments, depends on multidisciplinary facilitation and skills and builds essentially on visual language. The practice integrates several tools and methods whilst often relying on the combination of 'expert' skills with socially differentiated local knowledge. It promotes interactive participation of stakeholders in generating and managing spatial information and it uses information about specific landscapes to facilitate broadly-based decision making processes that support effective communication and community advocacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17393">[[File:Position angle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of how position angle is estimated through a telescope eyepiece; the primary star is at center.]]
'''Position angle''', usually abbreviated '''PA''', is the convention for measuring angles on the sky  in astronomy. The [[International Astronomical Union]] defines it as the angle measured relative to the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]] (NCP), turning positive into the direction of the [[right ascension]]. In the standard (non-flipped) images this is a counterclockwise measure relative to the axis into the direction of positive [[declination]].

In the case of  observed [[Visual binary|visual binary stars]], it is defined as the angular offset of the secondary star from the primary relative to the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]].

As the example illustrates, if one were observing a hypothetical binary star with a PA of 135 degrees, that means an imaginary line in the eyepiece drawn from the north celestial pole to the primary (P) would be offset from the secondary (S) such that the NCP-P-S angle would be 135 degrees.

When graphing visual binary orbits, the NCP line is traditionally drawn downward—that is, with north at bottom—and PA is measured counterclockwise.

Also the direction of the [[proper motion]] can for example be given by its position angle.

The definition of position angle is also applied to extended objects like galaxies, where it refers to the angle made by the major axis of the object with the NCP line.

==Nautics==
The concept of the position angle is inherited from nautical navigation on the oceans, where the optimum [[compass]] course is the course from a known position {{math|'''s'''}} to a target position {{math|'''t'''}} with minimum effort. Setting aside the influence of winds and ocean currents, the optimum course is the course of smallest distance between the two positions on the ocean surface. Computing the compass course is known as the ''inverse problem'' of [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesics]].

This article considers only the abstraction of minimizing the distance between {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}} traveling on the surface of a sphere with some radius {{math|R}}. In which direction angle {{math|p}} relative to North should the ship steer to reach the target position?

===Global geocentric coordinate system===
[[File:PositionAngle.svg|thumb|400px|The position angle of the point '''t''' at the point '''s''' is the angle at which the green and the dashed great circles intersect at '''s'''. The unit directions {{math|u&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the rotation axis {{math|&amp;omega;}} are marked by arrows.]]
Detailed evaluation of the optimum direction is possible if the sea surface is approximated by a sphere surface. The standard computation places the ship at a geodetic [[latitude]] {{math|φ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and geodetic [[longitude]] {{math|λ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|φ}} is considered positive if north of the equator, and where {{math|λ}} is considered positive if east of [[Prime meridian|Greenwich]]. In the global coordinate system centered at the center of the sphere, the Cartesian components are

::&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf s}=R\left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\varphi_s \cos\lambda_s \\
\cos\varphi_s \sin\lambda_s \\
\sin\varphi_s
\end{array}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
and the target position is

::&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf t}=R\left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\varphi_t \cos\lambda_t \\
\cos\varphi_t \sin\lambda_t \\
\sin\varphi_t
\end{array}\right). &lt;/math&gt;
The North Pole is at
::&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf N}=R\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{array}\right). &lt;/math&gt;
The [[Great-circle distance|minimum distance]] {{math|d}} is the distance along a great circle that runs through {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}}. It is calculated in a plane that contains the sphere center and the [[great circle]],
::&lt;math&gt; d_{s,t}=R\theta_{s,t}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|θ}} is the angular distance of two points viewed from the center of the sphere, measured in [[radian]]s. The cosine of the angle is calculated by the [[dot product]]  of the two vectors
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}\cdot \mathbf{t} = R^2\cos \theta_{s,t} = R^2(\sin\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t+\cos\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s))&lt;/math&gt;
If the ship steers straight to the North Pole, the travel distance is
::&lt;math&gt;d_{s,N} = R\theta_{s,N} = R(\pi/2-\varphi_s)&lt;/math&gt;
If a ship starts at {{math|'''t'''}} and swims straight to the North Pole, the travel distance is
::&lt;math&gt;d_{t,N} = R\theta_{t,n} =R(\pi/2-\varphi_t)&lt;/math&gt;

===Brief Derivation===
The ''cosine formula'' of [[spherical trigonometry]] &lt;ref name=AS&gt;&lt;cite&gt; {{AS ref|4.3.149}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; yields for the 
angle {{math|p}} between the great circles through {{math|'''s'''}} that point to the North on one hand and to {{math|'''t'''}} on the other hand
::&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_{t,N} = \cos\theta_{s,t}\cos\theta_{s,N}+\sin\theta_{s,t}\sin\theta_{s,N}\cos p.&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sin\varphi_t = \cos\theta_{s,t}\sin\varphi_s +\sin\theta_{s,t}\cos\varphi_s\cos p.&lt;/math&gt;
The ''sine formula'' yields
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin p}{\sin \theta_{t,N}} = \frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this for {{math|sin θ&lt;sub&gt;s,t&lt;/sub&gt;}} and insertion in the previous formula gives an expression for the tangent of the position angle,
::&lt;math&gt;\sin\varphi_t = \cos\theta_{s,t}\sin\varphi_s +\frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}{\sin p}\cos\varphi_t\cos\varphi_s\cos p;&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tan p = \frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)\cos\varphi_t\cos\varphi_s}{\sin\varphi_t-\cos\theta_{s,t}\sin\varphi_s}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Long Derivation===
Because the brief derivation gives an angle between 0 and {{math|π}} which does not reveal the sign (west or east of north ?), a more explicit derivation is desirable which yields separately the sine and the cosine of {{math|p}} such that use of the [[Atan2|correct branch of the inverse tangent]] allows to produce an angle in the full range {{math|-π≤p≤π}}.

The computation starts from a construction of the great circle between {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}}. It lies in the plane that contains the sphere center, {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}} and is constructed rotating {{math|'''s'''}} by the angle {{math|θ&lt;sub&gt;s,t&lt;/sub&gt;}} around an axis {{math|ω}}. The axis is perpendicular to the plane of the great circle and computed by the normalized vector [[cross product]] of the two positions:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega} = \frac{1}{R^2\sin \theta_{s,t}}\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{t} 
= \frac{1}{\sin \theta_{s,t}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
\cos\varphi_s\sin\lambda_s\sin\varphi_t -\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\sin\lambda_t
\\
\sin\varphi_s\cos\lambda_t\cos\varphi_t -\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t\cos\lambda_s
\\
\cos\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)
\end{array}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
A right-handed tilted coordinate system with the center at the center of the sphere is given by the
following three axes: the
axis {{math|'''s'''}}, the axis
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_\perp = \omega \times \frac{1}{R}\mathbf{s} =
\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\cos\varphi_t\cos\lambda_t(\sin^2\varphi_s+\cos^2\varphi_s\sin^2\lambda_s)-\cos\lambda_s(\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t+\cos^2\varphi_s\sin\lambda_s\cos\varphi_t\sin\lambda_t)\\
\cos\varphi_t\sin\lambda_t(\sin^2\varphi_s+\cos^2\varphi_s\cos^2\lambda_s)-\sin\lambda_s(\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t+\cos^2\varphi_s\cos\lambda_s\cos\varphi_t\cos\lambda_t)\\
\cos\varphi_s[\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t-\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)]
\end{array}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the axis {{math|ω}}.
A position along the great circle is
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}(\theta) = \cos\theta \mathbf{s}+\sin\theta \mathbf{s}_\perp,\quad 0\le\theta\le 2\pi.&lt;/math&gt;
The compass direction is given by inserting the two vectors {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''s'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sub&gt;}} and computing the gradient of the vector with respect to {{math|θ}} at {{math|θ{{=}}0}}.
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\mathbf{s}_{\mid \theta=0}=\mathbf{s}_\perp.&lt;/math&gt;
The angle {{math|p}} is given by splitting this direction along two orthogonal directions in the plane tangential to the sphere at the point {{math|'''s'''}}. The two directions are given by the partial derivatives of {{math|'''s'''}} with respect to {{math|&amp;phi;}} and with respect to {{math|&amp;lambda;}}, normalized to unit length:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_N = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
-\sin\varphi_s\cos\lambda_s\\
-\sin\varphi_s\sin\lambda_s\\
\cos\varphi_s
\end{array}\right);&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_E = \left(\begin{array}{c}
-\sin\lambda_s\\
\cos\lambda_s\\
0
\end{array}
\right);&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_N\cdot \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{u}_E\cdot \mathbf{u}_N =0 &lt;/math&gt;
{{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}} points north and {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}} points east at the position {{math|'''s'''}}.
The position angle {{math|p}} projects {{math|'''s'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sub&gt;}}
into these two directions,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_\perp = \cos p \,\mathbf{u}_N+\sin p\, \mathbf{u}_E&lt;/math&gt;,
where the positive sign means the positive position angles are defined to be north over east. The values of the cosine and sine of {{math|p}} are computed by multiplying this equation on both sides with the two unit vectors,
::&lt;math&gt;\cos p = \mathbf{s}_\perp \cdot \mathbf{u}_N
=\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}[\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t - \sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)];
&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sin p = \mathbf{s}_\perp \cdot \mathbf{u}_E
=\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}[\cos\varphi_t\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)].
&lt;/math&gt;
Instead of inserting the convoluted expression of {{math|'''s'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the evaluation may employ that the [[Triple product#Scalar triple product|triple product]] is invariant under a circular shift
of the arguments:
::&lt;math&gt;\cos p = (\mathbf{\omega}\times \frac{1}{R}\mathbf{s})\cdot \mathbf{u}_N
= \omega\cdot(\frac{1}{R}\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{u}_N).&lt;/math&gt;

If [[atan2]] is used to compute the value, one can reduce both expressions by division through {{math|cos &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}}
and multiplication by {{math|sin &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;s,t&lt;/sub&gt;}},
because these values are always positive and that operation does not change signs; then effectively
::&lt;math&gt;\tan p = \frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}{\cos\varphi_s\tan\varphi_t -\sin\varphi_s\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Astronomy==
The [[parallactic angle]] of [[Spherical astronomy|astronomy]] is the position angle of the [[zenith]] (considered the target position) as seen from the star (considered the starting position), where the [[Celestial pole|North Celestial Pole]] (NCP) of the celestial sphere defines the reference direction.
The sign of the angle is basically kept, north over east in both cases,
but as astronomers look at stars from the inside of the celestial sphere, 
the definition uses the convention that the {{math|q}} is the angle in an image that turns the direction to the NCP [[clockwise|counterclockwise]] into the direction of the zenith.

===Brief Derivation===
The formulas are special cases of the formulas shown above. In the [[Celestial coordinate system|equatorial system]] of right ascension {{math|α}} and declination {{math|δ}} of a star
one considers the spherical triangle with an angle {{math|q}} at the position of the star,
with an angle {{math|h}}, the hour angle, at the NCP, and with an angle {{math|&amp;pi;-A}} at the
zenith, where {{math|A}} is the azimuth in the [[Celestial coordinate system#Converting coordinates|south-over-west convention]]. The side lengths of the spherical triangle are (i) {{math|&amp;pi;/2-&amp;phi;}} as the distance from the zenith to the NCP, where {{math|&amp;phi;}} is the observer's geographic latitude, (ii) {{math|&amp;pi;/2-&amp;delta;}} as the distance between the star and the NCP, and  (iii) {{math|z{{=}}&amp;pi;/2-a}}, the zenith distance, complement to the star elevation, as the distance between the zenith and the star.

The cosine formula (one of the three cosine formulas) is
::&lt;math&gt;\cos(\pi/2-\varphi) = \cos(\pi/2-\delta)\cos z + \sin(\pi/2-\delta)\sin z \cos q.&lt;/math&gt;
The sine formula is
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin |q|}{\sin(\pi/2-\varphi)}=\frac{\sin |h|}{\sin z}=\frac{\sin(\pi-A)}{\sin(\pi/2-\delta)}.&lt;/math&gt;
The 4-parts formula is
::&lt;math&gt;\cos q = -\cos h \cos(\pi-A) + \sin |h| \sin(\pi-A) \cos (\pi/2-\varphi).&lt;/math&gt;
As in the brief derivation above, these formulas hide the sign of {{math|q}} and {{math|h}}, which
we indicated by placing the absolute values in arguments of the sines, which are sign-dependent.

===Long Derivation===
The explicit vector algebra to recover the correct sign is equivalent to the calculation of the 
long derivation for the compass course. In the global equatorial system the star is at
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = \left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\delta \cos \alpha \\
\cos \delta\sin\alpha\\
\sin\delta\end{array}
\right).&lt;/math&gt;
In the same coordinate system the zenith is found by inserting {{math|a{{=}}&amp;pi;/2}}, {{math|cos a{{=}}0}}
into the [[Celestial coordinate system#Converting coordinates|transformation formulas]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\varphi \cos l\\
\cos\varphi \sin l\\
\sin\varphi\end{array}
\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&amp;phi;}} is the observer's geographic latitude, {{math|a}} the star's altitude,
{{math|z{{=}}&amp;pi;/2-a}} the zenith distance, and {{math|l}} the local sidereal time. The North Celestial Pole is at
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} = \left(\begin{array}{c}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The normalized cross product is the rotation axis that turns the star into the direction of the zenith:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}_z = \frac{1}{\sin z}\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{z}
= \frac{1}{\sin z}\left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\delta\sin\alpha\sin\varphi -\sin\delta\cos\varphi\sin l\\
-\cos\delta\cos\alpha\sin\varphi +\sin\delta \cos\varphi\cos l\\
\cos\delta \cos\varphi \sin(\alpha-l) \end{array}
\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Finally {{math|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; X '''s'''}} is the third axis of the tilted coordinate system and the direction into which the star is moved on the great circle towards the zenith.

The plane tangential to the celestial sphere at the star is spanned by the unit vectors to the north,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\delta = \left(\begin{array}{c} -\sin\delta\cos\alpha\\
-\sin\delta\sin\alpha\\
\cos\delta \end{array}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
and to the east
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\alpha = \left(\begin{array}{c} -\sin\alpha \\
\cos\alpha\\
0 \end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
These are orthogonal:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\delta \cdot \mathbf{u}_\alpha=0;\quad
\mathbf{u}^2_\delta = \mathbf{u}^2_\alpha=1.
&lt;/math&gt;
The parallactic angle {{math|q}} is the angle of the initial section of the great circle
at '''s''', east of north,
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_z\times \mathbf{s} = \cos q\, \mathbf{u}_\delta + \sin q \, \mathbf{u}_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\cos q = (\omega_z\times \mathbf{s})\cdot \mathbf{u}_\delta =
\frac{1}{\sin z}(\cos\delta\sin\varphi -\sin\delta \cos\varphi \cos h),&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sin q = (\omega_z\times \mathbf{s})\cdot \mathbf{u}_\alpha =
\frac{1}{\sin z}\sin h \cos\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;
The values of {{math|sin z}} and of {{math|cos &amp;phi;}} are positive, so using [[atan2]] functions one may
divide both expressions through these without losing signs; eventually
::&lt;math&gt;\tan q = \frac{\sin h\cos\varphi}{\cos\delta \sin\varphi -\sin\delta \cos\varphi \cos h}=
\frac{\sin h}{\cos\delta \tan\varphi-\sin\delta \cos h}&lt;/math&gt;
yields the angle in the full range {{math|-&amp;pi; &amp;le; q &amp;le; &amp;pi;}}. The advantage of this expression is that it 
does not depend on the various offset conventions of {{math|A}}; the uncontroversial offset
of the hour angle {{math|h}}
takes care of this.

For a sidereal target, by definition a target where {{math|&amp;delta;}} and {{math|&amp;alpha;}} are not time-dependent,
the angle changes with a period of a [[Sidereal time|sidereal day]] {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
Let dots denote time derivatives; then the hour angle changes as
::&lt;math&gt;\dot h =\frac{2\pi}{T_s}&lt;/math&gt;
and the time derivative of the {{math|tan q}} expression is 
::&lt;math&gt;\dot q \frac{1}{\cos^2 q}= \frac{\cos\varphi[\cos h \cos\delta \sin\varphi-\sin\delta\cos\varphi]}{(\cos\delta \sin\varphi-\sin\delta \cos\varphi \cos h)^2} \dot h;&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\dot q 
= \frac{\cos \varphi[\cos h \cos\delta \sin \varphi -\sin \delta \cos\varphi]}{\sin ^2z}\dot h
= \frac{\cos \varphi \cos a \cos A}{\sin^2 z}\dot h
=\frac{\cos\varphi \cos A}{\sin z}\dot h.
&lt;/math&gt;

''Rapid serial visual presentation'' is an experimental model frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention. The RSVP paradigm requires participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around 10 items per second. They are all shown in the same place. The targets are placed inside this stream of continuous items. They are separate from the rest of the items known as distracters. The distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers.

==Overview==
There is a delay of several hundred milliseconds. A person might be asked to identify numbers in a string of letters which are shown one by one. The first number which is an important target, would be caught by the person, however, the second number flashed seconds later might not be observed. RSVP asks the question, What would reading be like if there were no eye movements? A text is delivered at a spot on the screen, like a series of flash cards. The user can set how long each card is to be displayed. The readers are liberated from having to decide how much time to spend on each word because that is set in advance, and saccades, regressive eye movements, line sweeps, and page turning have been eliminated. A reader can fully concentrate on comprehending the text as it flashes through, however, with longer texts the reading experience is found to be monotonous and exhausting. There are a number of theories to explain how and why this works and studies have explored its limitations and parameters to learn more about visual perception. The brain deals with a quick stream of incoming information at all times. With the attentional blink, the brain has to distribute its attentional resources to comprehend, interpret, and store the information properly. The human brain is capable of processing complex tasks, but it has restrictions. The attentional blink is an illustration that has a significant insinuation for individuals who work in environments where they are usually swamped with information. An example of this is an airport baggage screener who might see a knife in one bag, but misses a second knife in another bag that is right behind the first bag.  The failure to recognize the second target is because of the attentional processes that are linked with the identification of the first target.

==History==

Potter (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.2.5.509| title = Short-term conceptual memory for pictures| journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 509–522| year = 1976| last1 = Potter | first1 = M. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  explored the amount people who are able to comprehend and memorize information from fast series of stimuli. Potter had participants search for the RSVP series of pictures for a specific picture which was the target. This was depicted before the appearance of the RSVP series. Results showed that participants performed well on this task. Here, the RSVP rate was eight items per second; however, participants were still able to accurately find the target on 75% of the trials. Performance was not different in the pictures that were previously presented or described. Each picture was acknowledged within 125 milliseconds. However, Potter &amp; Levy (1969) found that performance did change when participants were assessed on a recognition task for the pictures presented in the RSVP sequence. The results showed that the participants’ performance accurately scored 10% in the task when the RSVP rate was eight items per second.

Sperling and colleagues  examined the RSVP paradigm to investigate the dynamics of shifts of spatial attention (e.g., Reeves &amp; Sperling, 1986; Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.180| pmid = 3714927| title = Attention gating in short-term visual memory| journal = Psychological Review| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 180–206| year = 1986| last1 = Reeves | first1 = A. | last2 = Sperling | first2 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=G|author2=Weichselgartner, E. |title=Episodic theory of the dynamics of spatial attention|journal=Psychological Review|year=1995|volume=102|pages=503–522|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spatial attention is defined as the ability to center on specific stimuli in a visual environment (Johnson &amp; Proctor, 2004). Sperling used an attention shift procedure in which two RSVP series were presented altogether. There was a central point where one was to the left and the other was to the right of the focus point. One series contained letters and the other series contained numbers. The object of the task was for participants to focus on the letter stream and to report items from the number series following a certain letter. Results showed that participants frequently reported numbers that were heard around 400 milliseconds after the cue. They concluded that the findings were parallel with the time participants were required to shift attention from the series that had the letters to the series that had the numbers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  examined if the same conclusions would be made if the participants had to report items from one RSVP series. Participants had to acknowledge and point out a certain letter and report other items that came after that letter. Results showed participants were more likely to report the items after the letter roughly around 400 milliseconds after the letter was presented. No spatial shift of attention was required. Participants only reported accurately the item following right after the cue but not any other item.

Broadbent and Broadbent (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03210498| title = From detection to identification: Response to multiple targets in rapid serial visual presentation| journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics| volume = 42| issue = 2| pages = 105–13| year = 1987| last1 = Broadbent | first1 = D.

P. | pmid=3627930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  discovered the attentional blink when they used a rapid serial visual presentation task to look at the recognition of multiple target words. Results showed that following the presence of a target, attentional processing is restricted and people can’t report the items that came after the target, however the presence of the item that comes after the target usually misses attentional blindness. This concludes that when two targets are shown within 500 milliseconds of one another and they are separated by one or more distractors, the second target usually falls within an attentional blink and will not be seen.

[[Inattentional blindness]] as also been looked at as a variation of the rapid serial visual presentation. Rees, Russell, Frith, and Driver (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5449.2504| pmid = 10617465| title = Inattentional Blindness Versus Inattentional Amnesia for Fixated but Ignored Words| journal = Science| volume = 286| issue = 5449| pages = 2504–7| year = 1999| last1 = Rees | first1 = G.| last2 = Russell| first2 = C| last3 = Frith| first3 = C. D.| last4 = Driver| first4 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  investigated participants’ brain activity as they looked at rapid displays of a letter string or of a word above a picture. Participants were asked to watch out for repeats in the letter string or in the pictures that were displayed. They found that the attended words in the task were related to semantic processing.

==Modes==

There are two common modes that are used to describe rapid serial visual presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Robert|title=Rapid Serial Visual Presentation: Design for Cognition|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781447150855|author2=Witkowski, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modes is the static mode. Here, the pictures come into view and then disappear without moving. The other mode, the moving mode is where pictures come into view serially, move about the display and then disappear.

===Static mode===
The pictures in the rapid serial visual presentation have the same entry and exit locations.  Pictures are shown one by one at the same rate. Here, participants must attend to a target that is shown for about 100 milliseconds. This is an advantage of this static mode. A disadvantage of the static mode is that there is no chance after that time to validate what was seen.  The attentional blink which usually lasts between 300-400 milliseconds leads up to the other stimuli not being seen. The static mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: steady gaze, search to steady and visual search.

===Moving modes===
We are usually represented with presentations that rely a great deal on movement of pictures in a 2D plane. These are more difficult to register in comparison than pictures that move back and forth. The basic psychology of human visual perception explains that people are inclined to register imagery in a 3D world. This mode believes rapid serial visual presentation is important when approaching and processing objects. The moving mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: diagonal, stream and ring.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Advantages over conventional reading==
The unique method used by RSVP allows for the reading of unlimited text in a limited position. Researchers from [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] have found that as many as 12 words per second are readable in controlled situations (720wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/571985.572014| chapter = Web ''Thumb''| title = Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '02| pages = 205| year = 2002| last1 = Wobbrock | first1 = J. O. | last2 = Forlizzi | first2 = J. | last3 = Hudson | first3 = S. E. | last4 = Myers | first4 = B. A. | isbn = 1581134886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further research has shown that for shorter pieces of text, RSVP formats increased reading speed by 33% with no significant differences in comprehension or task load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45756-9_18| chapter = Towards an Improved Readability on Mobile Devices: Evaluating Adaptive Rapid Serial Visual Presentation| title = Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices| volume = 2411| pages = 225| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2002| last1 = Öquist | first1 = G. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = M. | isbn = 978-3-540-44189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by the [[Wichita State University]] suggests that at 250 words per minute (WPM) comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using Palm Reader ([[EReader]]).  Display at 650 WPM reduced comprehension by about 20% versus display at 250 WPM, from a score of 74.6 to 52.1, resulting in an effective 82% increase in words comprehended per minute, assuming the scoring is linear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222063502/http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/41/rsvp_palm.htm Wichita State]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that reading rate is determined by size of text and spacing. RSVP allows users to obtain a maximum reading rate through the ability to adjust text size and eliminate space by displaying one item at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D. G.| last2 = Tillman | first2 = K. A.| last3 = Freeman | first3 = J.| last4 = Su | first4 = M.| last5 = Berger | first5 = T. D.| last6 = Majaj | first6 = N. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and limitations==

Several limitations are presented in the rapid serial visual presentation. The RSVP can cause an unnecessary need for cognitive demand. The memory load for each individual differs and can be high, because using RSVP, more attention is needed. Also, RSVP allows us to miss vital information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | pmid = 3672124
| year = 1987

| issue = 4828
| pages = 778–80
| last2 = Sperling
| first2 = G
 | doi=10.1126/science.3672124
}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP also often results with [[repetition blindness]] during use. When presented with a sequence of visual stimuli in rapid succession at the same location, readers often fail to detect words prominently repeated in a series, thus potentially missing the main ideas of the text.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Other disadvantages include [[attentional blink]], in which the mind focuses longer on certain words which may strike an emotional chord and puts the reader behind in a sequence, {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} as well as [[temporal masking]], causing certain words when being read aloud in a series may evoke a striking sound or response that makes inaudible the mental articulation of the following word.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Web browsing on small-screen devices===

Using RSVP-based browsers offers a space–time trade-offs for information presentation on small screen devices such as cell phones and PDAs. However to make this solution functional location and context related questions like 'Where am I', 'Where can I usefully go', 'Where have I been' and 'How do I get back to X', need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s007790200024| title = RSVP Browser: Web Browsing on Small Screen Devices| journal = Personal and Ubiquitous Computing| volume = 6| issue = 4| pages = 245–252| year = 2002| last1 = De Bruijn | first1 = O.| last2 = Spence | first2 = R.| last3 = Chong | first3 = M. Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
RSVP can aid those with poor eyesight with its one text at a time display that enlarges and highlights the words.

===Peripheral reading===
Peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from [[Central scotoma|central field loss]], which is most commonly seen in the elderly.  Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements.  Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D.

===Adolescent sexual offenders===
Limited existing previous research by Beech et al. suggests that images presented in RSVP have the potential to elicit a response from adolescent sexual offenders by measuring the effects of attentional blink.  A stronger attentional blink is expected among adolescent sexual offenders after viewing a series of child related images.  However, this hypothesis has not held up to subsequent research and remains an area of continued debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1079063208328677| title = Applying Rapid Serial Visual Presentation to Adolescent Sexual Offenders: Attentional Bias as a Measure of Deviant Sexual Interest?| journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment| volume = 21| issue = 2| pages = 135–148| year = 2009| last1 = Crooks | first1 = V.

A '''sagittal plane''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|dʒ|ɪ|t|əl}}), or '''longitudinal plane''', is an anatomical plane which divides the body into right and left parts.&lt;ref name="Vella2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Vella|title=Anatomy for Strength and Fitness Training|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Beed0ml1t6IC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=4 January 2013|date=May 2008|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84773-153-1|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane may be in the center of the body and split it into two halves ([[mid-sagittal plane|mid-sagittal]]) or away from the midline and split it into unequal parts (para-sagittal).

Most elements of [[Irish dancing]] occur in the sagittal plane.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, Christopher; Putukian, Margot; McCarty, Eric; and Young, Craig (2017). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hWclDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1822&amp;dq=%22dance+moves+are%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBm-SC1LbSAhVpxlQKHTHJB7MQ6AEIQDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dance%20moves%20are%22&amp;f=false Netter's Sports Medicine]'', {{unpaginated}}. Elsevier Health Sciences. {{ISBN|9780323442572}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations in terminology==
Examples include:

* The terms ''[[median plane]]'' or ''mid-sagittal plane'' are sometimes used to describe the [[wikt:sagittal plane|sagittal plane]] running through the midline. This plane cuts the body into halves (assuming [[bilateral symmetry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000083004|Median plane}}&lt;/ref&gt; passing through midline structures such as the [[navel]] and [[Vertebral column|spine]]. It is one of the planes which, combined with the [[Umbilical plane]], defines the [[Quadrant (abdomen)|four quadrants]] of the [[human abdomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kapit | first = Wynn | title = The anatomy coloring book | publisher = Pearson | location = San Francisco | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780321832016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The term ''parasagittal'' is used to describe any plane parallel to the sagittal plane. In practice, such a section is often referred to simply as a "sagittal" view because viewing is achieved along the sagittal axis (see below). Owing to the specific nature of its definition, only one true sagittal plane exists, and it corresponds to the "mid-sagittal" view. Be aware that the term "sagittal view" may be applied to any parasagittal section as well as the sagittal plane, as the parasagittal and sagittal axes are identical (parallel to the sagittal plane). &lt;br&gt; Specific named parasagittal planes include:
** The [[midclavicular line]] crosses through the [[clavicle]].
** Other sagittal lines/planes include the ''lateral sternal'' and ''parasternal''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-9013-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Yokochi, Chihiro; [[Rohen, Johannes W.]] |title=Color Atlas of Anatomy: A Photographic Study of the Human Body |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |pages=2006. 217 p. |isbn=0-7817-9013-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sagittal'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:sagitta#Latin|sagitta]]'', meaning "arrow". An image of an arrow piercing a body and passing from front (anterior) to back (posterior) on a parabolic [[trajectory of a projectile|trajectory]] would be one way to demonstrate the derivation of the term.

'''Sense of community''' (or '''psychological sense of community''') is a concept in [[community psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], and [[Community practice|community social work]], as well as in several other research disciplines, such as [[urban sociology]], which focuses on the ''experience'' of community rather than its structure, formation, setting, or other features. The latter is the province of [[public administration]] or community services administration which needs to understand how structures influence this feeling and psychological sense of community. [[Sociologist]]s, [[social psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have theorized about and carried out [[empirical research]] on community, but the [[psychological]] approach asks questions about the individual's [[perception]], [[understanding]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[emotion|feelings]], etc. about community and his or her relationship to it and to others' participation—indeed to the complete, multifaceted community experience.

In his seminal 1974 book, psychologist [[Seymour B. Sarason]] proposed that psychological sense of community become the conceptual center for the psychology of [[community]], asserting that it "is one of the major bases for self-definition." By 1986 it was regarded as a central overarching concept for [[community psychology]] (Sarason, 1986; Chavis &amp; Pretty, 1999).In addition, the theoretical concept entered the other applied academic disciplines as part of "communities for all" initiatives in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Magrab, P. (1999). The meaning of community. (pp. 3-30). In: R.N. Roberts &amp; P. R. Magrab, ''Where Children Live: Solutions for Serving Young Children and their Families''. Stamford, Ct: Ablex Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among theories of sense of community proposed by [[psychologist]]s, McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) is by far the most influential, and is the starting point for most of the recent research in the field. It is discussed in detail below.

== Definitions ==

For Sarason, psychological sense of community is "the [[perception]] of similarity to others, an acknowledged [[interdependence]] with others, a willingness to maintain this interdependence by giving to or doing for others what one expects from them, and the feeling that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure" (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;157).

McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) define sense of community as "a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their [[personal commitment|commitment]] to be together."

Gusfield (1975) identified two dimensions of community: territorial and relational. The relational dimension of community has to do with the nature and quality of relationships in that community, and some communities may even have no discernible territorial demarcation, as in the case of a community of scholars working in a particular specialty, who have some kind of contact and quality of relationship, but may live and work in disparate locations, perhaps even throughout the world. Other communities may seem to be defined primarily according to territory, as in the case of [[neighborhood]]s, but even in such cases, proximity or shared territory cannot by itself constitute a community; the relational dimension is also essential.

[[Factor analysis]] of their urban neighborhoods [[questionnaire]] yielded two distinct factors which Riger and Lavrakas (1981) characterized as "social bonding" and "physical rootedness", very similar to the two dimensions proposed by Gusfield.
Early work on psychological sense of community was based on neighborhoods as the referent, and found a relationship between psychological sense of community and '''greater participation''' (Hunter, 1975; Wandersman &amp; Giamartino, 1980), '''perceived safety''' (Doolittle &amp; McDonald, 1978), '''ability to function competently in the community''' (Glynn, 1981), '''social bonding''' (Riger &amp; Lavrakas, 1981), '''social fabric''' (strengths of [[interpersonal relationship]]) (Ahlbrandt &amp; Cunningham, 1979), '''greater sense of purpose and perceived control''' (Bachrach &amp; Zautra, 1985), and '''greater civic contributions''' ([[Donation|charitable contributions]] and civic involvement) (Davidson &amp; Cotter, 1986). These initial studies lacked a clearly articulated [[conceptual framework]], however, and none of the measures developed were based on a [[theoretical definition]] of psychological sense of community.

== Primary theoretical foundation: McMillan and Chavis ==

McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) theory (and instrument) are the most broadly validated and widely utilized in this area in the psychological literature. They prefer the abbreviated label "sense of community", and propose that sense of community is composed of four elements.

===Four elements of sense of community===
There are four elements of "sense of community" according to the McMillan &amp; Chavis theory:

====Membership====
Membership includes five attributes:
* boundaries
* emotional safety
* a sense of belonging and identification
* personal investment
* a common symbol system

====Influence====
Influence works both ways: members need to feel that they have some influence in the group, and some influence by the group on its members is needed for group cohesion. Current researches (e.g. Chigbu, 2013) on rural and urban communities have found that sense of community is a major factor.

====Integration and fulfillment of needs====
Members feel rewarded in some way for their participation in the community.

====Shared emotional connection====
The "definitive element for true community" (1986, p.&amp;nbsp;14), it includes shared history and shared participation (or at least identification with the history).

===Dynamics within and between the elements===
McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) give the following example to illustrate the dynamics within and between these four elements (p.&amp;nbsp;16):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members). Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Current research====
In their 2002 study of a [[community of interest]], specifically the science fiction fandom community, Obst, Zinkiewicz, and Smith suggest Conscious Identification as the fifth dimension (Obst, 2002).

== Empirical assessment ==

Chavis et al.'s '''Sense of Community Index''' ('''SCI''') (see Chipuer &amp; Pretty, 1999; Long &amp; Perkins, 2003), originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[school]]s, [[religious communities]], communities of interest, etc.

The '''South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity''' (SAIAB), is involved in research, education and in applications of its knowledge and research to African fish fauna, for either economic or conservation benefit.

The institute was formerly named the '''JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology''', in honour of Professor [[James Leonard Brierley Smith]], who named and described the living coelacanth ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]''.

Situated in Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB) is an internationally recognised centre for the study of aquatic biodiversity.

As a National Facility of the NRF SAIAB serves as a major scientific resource for knowledge and understanding the biodiversity and functioning of globally significant aquatic ecosystems. With both marine and freshwater biogeographical boundaries, southern Africa is ideally placed to monitor and document climate change.

From a '''marine''' perspective South Africa forms the southern apex of a major continental mass, flanked by very different marine ecosystems on the east and west coasts, and projecting towards the cold southern Ocean large marine ecosystem. SAIAB’s scientific leadership and expertise in '''freshwater''' aquatic biodiversity is vital to the national interest when dealing with issues arising from exponentially increasing pressures of human population growth and development.

The '''Sydney APEC Leaders' Declaration on Climate Change, Energy Security and Clean Development''' was adopted at [[APEC Australia 2007]] on 8 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/apec/sydney-declaration-on-climate-change-and-energy/2007/09/09/1189276526002.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 Sydney Declaration on Climate Change and Energy]'', Sydney Morning Herald, 9 September 2007. See also ''[http://www.smh.com.au/pdf/leadersstatement.pdf Leaders Statement (PDF)]'' Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement indicates the wish of signatories to work towards aspirational goals on energy efficiency per unit of [[GDP]] while encouraging [[forest cover]] in the region. The APEC wide regional aspirational goal is to reduce energy intensity by at least 25 percent by 2030 from the 2005 level, and set an APEC-wide regional goal of increasing forest cover in the region by 200,000 square kilometres by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/apec-climate-agreement-a-diplomatic-breakthrough/2007/09/09/1189276521977.html APEC climate agreement a 'diplomatic breakthrough]'', The Age, 9 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Environmental and climate organisations such as [[Greenpeace]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Climate Action Network]] criticised the agreement for not setting binding targets on [[greenhouse gas emissions]] for developed countries, and that the statement was little more than a political stunt.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/09/2027701.htm Govt, green groups face off over Sydney Declaration]'' ABC News,  9 September 2007.

Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenpeace]] pointed out that Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] told an APEC lecture in Melbourne in April 2007 that aspirational targets are a "political stunt" and "not a real target at all".&lt;ref&gt;Liz Micnchin, ''[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/q-when-is-a-stunt-not-a-stunt-a-when-the-boss-likes-the-idea/2007/09/06/1188783413265.html Q: When is a stunt not a stunt? A: When the boss likes the idea]'', The Age, 7 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One Greenpeace spokesperson said the declaration should be named the "'''Sydney Distraction'''" on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gartrell, ''[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22384889-5005961,00.html Greenpeace slams APEC climate pact]'', Herald Sun, 8 September 2007. Accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] called the declaration "very weak" and said the "declaration does not advance global discussions on climate change."&lt;ref&gt;Australian Conservation Foundation Meadia Release, ''[http://www.acfonline.org.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=1408 APEC’s Sydney Declaration is weak on climate ]'' Australian Conservation Foundation website, 8 September 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7288">Germany has an [[air pollution]] control [[regulation]] titled "Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control" (''Technische Anleitung zur Reinhaltung der Luft'') and commonly referred to as the '''''TA Luft'''''.&lt;ref name="TA Luft"&gt;[http://www.bmub.bund.de/fileadmin/Daten_BMU/Download_PDF/Luft/taluft_engl.pdf Complete text of the TA Luft]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first version of the ''TA Luft'' was established in 1964. It has subsequently been revised in 1974, 1983, 1988 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030123190721/http://www.inece.org/1stvol2/Ubing%20&amp;%20Krop.htm History of the TA Luft]&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the ''TA Luft'' have been adopted by other countries as well.

In 1974, 10 years after the ''TA Luft'' was first established, the [[German government]] enacted the "Federal Pollution Control Act" (''Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz''). It also has subsequently been amended a number of times, the last of which was in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/bimschengl.pdf Complete text of the Federal Air Pollution Control Act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911214827/http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/bimschengl.pdf |date=2006-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first version of the ''TA Luft'' existed 10 years before the enactment of the "Federal Pollution Control Act", it is often called the "First General Administrative Regulation" pertaining to the "Federal Pollution Control Act".

The German government created the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and [[Nuclear safety|Nuclear Safety]] (''Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit'') in June, 1986&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmu.de/english/the_ministry/tasks/the_ministry/doc/3261.php Web site of the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now responsible for implementing the ''TA Luft'' regulation under the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act".

==Overview==
The TA Luft is a comprehensive air pollution control regulation that includes:
* A discussion of the scope of the TA Luft application, which is to review applications for licenses to construct and operate new industrial facilities (or altered existing facilities) and to determine whether the proposed new or altered facilities will comply with the requirements of the TA Luft and the requirements of other air pollutant emission regulations promulgated under the ''Federal Pollution Control Act''.

==AUSTAL2000==
[[AUSTAL2000]] is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austal2000.de/en/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines.

It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a [[random walk]] process ([[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian simulation model]]) and it has capabilities for [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|building effects]], complex terrain, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollutant plume]] depletion by [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet or dry deposition]], and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austal2000.de/en/downloads.html Austal2000 download web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden-Württemberg.

'''Telecommunications engineering''' is an [[engineering]] discipline centered on [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]] which seeks to support and enhance [[telecommunication]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jee.org/2001/october/417.pdf |title=The First Telecommunications Engineering Program in the United States |author=Burnham, Gerald O.|journal=[[Journal of Engineering Education]] |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=653–657 |date=October 2001 |publisher=[[American Society for Engineering Education]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|09|22}}|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abet.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation/Accreditation_Process/Accreditation_Documents/Current/tac-criteria-2012-2013.pdf |title=Program criteria for telecommunications engineering technology or similarly named programs |work=Criteria for accrediting engineering technology programs 2012-2013 |page=23 |date=October 2011 |publisher=[[ABET]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|09|22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work ranges from basic [[circuit design]] to strategic mass developments. A telecommunication engineer is responsible for designing and overseeing the installation of telecommunications equipment and facilities, such as complex [[electronic switching system]]s, and other [[plain old telephone service]] facilities, [[optical fiber]] cabling, [[IP network]]s, and [[microwave transmission]] systems. Telecommunication engineering also overlaps with [[broadcast engineering]].

Telecommunication is a diverse field of engineering connected to [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[systems engineering]]. Ultimately, telecom engineers are responsible for providing high-speed [[data transmission]] services. They use a variety of equipment and transport media to design the telecom network infrastructure; the most common media used by wired telecommunications today are [[twisted pair]], [[coaxial cable]]s, and [[optical fiber]]s. Telecommunications engineers also provide solutions revolving around [[wireless]] modes of communication and information transfer, such as wireless telephony services, radio and [[satellite communications]], and [[internet]] and [[broadband]] technologies.

==History==
Telecommunication systems are generally designed by telecommunication engineers which sprang from technological improvements in the telegraph industry in the late 19th century and the radio and the telephone industries in the early 20th century. Today, telecommunication is widespread and devices that assist the process, such as the television, radio and telephone, are common in many parts of the world. There are also many networks that connect these devices, including computer networks, [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} radio networks, and television networks. Computer communication across the Internet is one of many examples of telecommunication.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Telecommunication plays a vital role in the world economy, and the telecommunication industry's revenue has been placed at just under 3% of the gross world product.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Telegraph and telephone ===

[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. Soon after he was joined by [[Alfred Vail]] who developed the register &amp;mdash; a telegraph terminal that integrated a logging device for recording messages to paper tape. This was demonstrated successfully over three miles (five kilometres) on 6 January 1838 and eventually over forty miles (sixty-four kilometres) between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Baltimore]] on 24 May 1844. The patented invention proved lucrative and by 1851 telegraph lines in the [[United States]] spanned over 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm The Electromagnetic Telegraph], J. B. Calvert, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time. Earlier transatlantic cables installed in 1857 and 1858 only operated for a few days or weeks before they failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/hst/atlantic-cable/ The Atlantic Cable], Bern Dibner, Burndy Library Inc., 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The international use of the telegraph has sometimes been dubbed the "[[Victorian Internet]]".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Redfern, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4475394.stm Wiring up the 'Victorian internet']'', [[BBC News]], 29 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial telephone services were set up in 1878 and 1879 on both sides of the Atlantic in the cities of [[New Haven]] and [[London]]. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] held the master patent for the telephone that was needed for such services in both countries. The technology grew quickly from this point, with inter-city lines being built and [[telephone exchange]]s in every major city of the United States by the mid-1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Telecommunicationsage/Thetelephone/index.htm Connected Earth: The telephone], BT, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html History of AT&amp;T], AT&amp;T, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Page |first=Arthur W. |authorlink= |date=January 1906 |title=Communication By Wire And "Wireless": The Wonders of Telegraph and Telephone |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIII |issue= |pages=8408–8422 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3IfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8408|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, transatlantic voice communication remained impossible for customers until January 7, 1927 when a connection was established using radio. However no cable connection existed until [[TAT-1]] was inaugurated on September 25, 1956 providing 36 telephone circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cables/CableTimeLine/index1951.htm History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Submarine Telegraphy], Bill Glover, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Bell and co-inventor [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] conducted the world's first wireless telephone call via modulated lightbeams projected by [[photophone]]s. The scientific principles of their invention would not be utilized for several decades, when they were first deployed in military and [[fiber-optic communication]]s.

=== Radio and television ===
[[File:Marconi crystal radio receiver.jpg|thumb|[[Marconi]] crystal radio receiver]]
{{Main|History of radio|History of television}}

Over several years starting in 1894 the Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] built the first complete, commercially successful wireless telegraphy system based on airborne electromagnetic waves ([[radio transmission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klooster|first=John W.|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|pages=161–168|date=2009|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1901, he would go on to established wireless communication between Britain and Newfoundland, earning him the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] in 1909 (which he shared with [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Karl Braun]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslasociety.com/biography.htm Tesla Biography], Ljubo Vujovic, Tesla Memorial Society of New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Reginald Fessenden]] was able to wirelessly transmit a human voice. On March 25, 1925, Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] publicly demonstrated the transmission of moving silhouette pictures at the London department store [[Selfridges]].  In October 1925, Baird was successful in obtaining moving pictures with [[halftone]] shades, which were by most accounts the first true television pictures.&lt;ref name="The Baird Television Website"&gt;[http://www.bairdtelevision.com The Baird Television Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a public demonstration of the improved device on 26 January 1926 again at [[Selfridges]]. Baird's first devices relied upon the [[Nipkow disk]] and thus became known as the [[mechanical television]]. It formed the basis of semi-experimental broadcasts done by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] beginning September 30, 1929.

=== Satellite ===
{{Main|Communications satellite|Satellite phone|Satellite radio|Satellite television|Satellite Internet access}}
The first U.S. satellite to relay communications was [[Project SCORE]] in 1958, which used a tape recorder to [[store and forward]] voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In 1960 [[NASA]] launched an [[Echo satellite]]; the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications.  [[Courier 1B]], built by [[Philco]], also launched in 1960, was the world's first active repeater satellite. Satellites these days are used for many applications such as uses in GPS, television, internet and telephone uses.

[[Telstar]] was the first active, direct relay commercial [[communications satellite]]. Belonging to [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company|AT&amp;T]] as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&amp;T, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], NASA, the British [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], and the [[Orange S.A.|French National PTT]] (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from [[Cape Canaveral]] on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch. [[Relay 1]] was launched on December 13, 1962, and became the first satellite to broadcast across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref name="NASA-SP-93"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf|title=Significant Achievements in Space Communications and Navigation, 1958-1964|year=1966|work=NASA-SP-93|publisher=NASA|pages=30–32|accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental [[long distance telephony]]. The fixed [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] relays [[telephone call]]s from [[land line]] telephones to an [[earth station]], where they are then transmitted a receiving [[satellite dish]] via a [[geostationary satellite]] in Earth orbit.  Improvements in [[submarine communications cable]]s, through the use of [[fiber-optics]], caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century, but they still exclusively service remote islands such as [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Diego Garcia]], and [[Easter Island]], where no submarine cables are in service. There are also some continents and some regions of countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent, for example [[Antarctica]], plus large regions of [[Australia]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Northern Canada]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Greenland]].

After commercial long distance telephone service was established via communication satellites, a host of other commercial telecommunications were also adapted to similar satellites starting in 1979, including [[satellite phone|mobile satellite phones]], [[satellite radio]], [[satellite television]] and [[satellite Internet access]]. The earliest adaption for most such services occurred in the 1990s as the pricing for commercial [[Transponder (satellite communications)|satellite transponder channels]] continued to drop significantly.

=== Computer networks and the Internet ===
{{main|Computer networking|History of the Internet}}
[[File:Arpanet 1974.svg|thumb|Symbolic representation of the Arpanet as of September 1974]]

On 11 September 1940, [[George Stibitz]] was able to transmit problems using [[teleprinter]] to his Complex Number Calculator in New York and receive the computed results back at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/stibitz.htm George Stlibetz], Kerry Redshaw, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This configuration of a centralized computer or [[mainframe computer]] with remote "dumb terminals" remained popular throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]] — a technology that allows chunks of data to be sent between different computers without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969. This network soon became the [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hafner | first = Katie | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARPANET's development centered around the Request for Comment process and on 7 April 1969, RFC 1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet, and many of the [[communication protocol]]s that the Internet relies upon today were specified through the Request for Comment process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the [[Internet Protocol]] version 4 (IPv4) and RFC 793 introduced the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) — thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the Internet relies upon today.

===Optical fiber===
{{main |Fiber-optic communication}}
[[File:U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Gary Chitwood, a tactical automated security system (TASS) administrator with the 380th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron, tests a fiber optic wire 130320-F-ME639-036.jpg|thumb|[[Optical fiber]]]]

Optical fiber can be used as a medium for telecommunication and [[computer network]]ing because it is flexible and can be bundled into cables. It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with little attenuation compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few [[optical communications repeater|repeater]]s.

In 1966 [[Charles K. Kao]] and [[George Hockham]] proposed optical fibers at STC Laboratories (STL) at [[Harlow]], England, when they showed that the losses of 1000&amp;nbsp;dB/km in existing glass (compared to 5-10&amp;nbsp;dB/km in coaxial cable) was due to contaminants, which could potentially be removed.

Optical fiber was successfully developed in 1970 by [[Corning Glass Works]], with attenuation low enough for communication purposes (about 20[[Decibel|dB]]/km), and at the same time GaAs (Gallium arsenide) [[Laser diode|semiconductor lasers]] were developed that were compact and therefore suitable for transmitting light through fiber optic cables for long distances.

After a period of research starting from 1975, the first commercial fiber-optic communications system was developed, which operated at a wavelength around 0.8&amp;nbsp;µm and used GaAs semiconductor lasers. This first-generation system operated at a bit rate of 45&amp;nbsp;[[Mbps]] with repeater spacing of up to 10&amp;nbsp;km. Soon on 22 April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics sent the first live telephone traffic through fiber optics at a 6 Mbit/s throughput in Long Beach, California.

The first wide area network fibre optic cable system in the world seems to have been installed by Rediffusion in Hastings, East Sussex, UK in 1978. The cables were placed in ducting throughout the town, and had over 1000 subscribers. They were used at that time for the transmission of television channels,not available because of local reception problems.

The first [[transatlantic telephone cable]] to use optical fiber was [[TAT-8]], based on Desurvire optimized laser amplification technology. It went into operation in 1988.

In the late 1990s through 2000, industry promoters, and research companies such as KMI, and RHK predicted massive increases in demand for communications bandwidth due to increased use of the [[Internet]], and commercialization of various bandwidth-intensive consumer services, such as [[video on demand]]. [[Internet protocol]] data traffic was increasing exponentially, at a faster rate than integrated circuit complexity had increased under [[Moore's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hellman |first=Martin E. |title=Moore's Law and Communications |url=http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/moore.html |date=11 June 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

===Basic elements of a telecommunication system===
{{Main|Telecommunication}}

====Transmitter====
{{Main|Transmitter}}
[[Transmitter]] (information source) that takes information and converts it to a signal for transmission. In [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]] a transmitter or radio transmitter is an [[electronic device]] which, with the aid of an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], produces [[radio wave]]s. In addition to their use in [[broadcasting]], transmitters are necessary component parts of many electronic devices that communicate by [[radio communication|radio]], such as [[cell phone]]s, 
[[File: Lautsprecherkabel Makro nah.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Copper]] wires]]

====Transmission medium====
{{Main|Transmission medium}}
[[Transmission medium]] over which the signal is transmitted. For example, the transmission medium for [[sound]]s is usually air, but solids and liquids may also act as transmission media for sound. Many transmission media are used as [[communications channel]]. One of the most common physical medias used in networking is [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]]. Copper wire to carry signals to long distances using relatively low amounts of power.Another example of a physical medium is [[optical fiber]], which has emerged as the most commonly used transmission medium for long-distance communications. Optical fiber is a thin strand of glass that guides light along its length.

The absence of a material medium in [[vacuum]] may also constitute a transmission medium for [[electromagnetic wave]]s such as [[light]] and [[radio wave]]s.

====Receiver====
{{Main|Receiver (radio)}}
[[Receiver (radio)|Receiver]] ([[information sink]]) that receives and converts the signal back into required information. In [[radio communications]], a radio receiver is an electronic device that receives [[radio wave]]s and converts the information carried by them to a usable form. It is used with an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The information produced by the receiver may be in the form of sound (an [[audio signal]]), images (a [[video signal]]) or [[digital data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |title=Radio Frequency, RF, Technology and Design, ''Radio Receiver Technology'' |website=Radio-Electronics.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127132225/http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |archivedate=27 January 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wireless communication tower.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Wireless]] communication tower, [[cell site]]]]

===Wired communication===
{{Main|Wired communication}}
Wired communications make use of underground communications cables (less often, overhead lines), electronic signal amplifiers (repeaters) inserted into connecting cables at specified points, and terminal apparatus of various types, depending on the type of wired communications used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Wired+Communications |title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia |edition=3rd |chapter=Wired Communications |publisher=The Gale Group, Inc.|date=1979 |origyear=First published 1970 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless communication===
{{Main|Wireless}}
Wireless communication involves the transmission of information over a distance without help of wires, cables or any other forms of electrical conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/wireless_communication |title=What is wireless communication technology and its types |website=EngineersGarage |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wireless operations permit services, such as long-range communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. The term is commonly used in the [[telecommunications]] industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls etc.) which use some form of energy (e.g. [[radio waves]], acoustic energy, etc.) to transfer information without the use of wires.&lt;ref name="FS1037C"&gt;{{cite web|title=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007 |url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |publisher=atis.org |accessdate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302071329/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Roles==

===Telecom equipment engineer===
A telecom equipment engineer is an electronics engineer that designs equipment such as routers, switches, multiplexers, and other specialized computer/electronics equipment designed to be used in the telecommunication network infrastructure.

===Network engineer===
A network engineer is a computer engineer who is in charge of designing, deploying and maintaining computer networks. In addition, they oversee network operations from a [[network operations center]], designs [[backbone network|backbone]] infrastructure, or supervises interconnections in a [[data center]].

===Central-office engineer===
[[File:Typical Northern Telecom DMS100 Telephone Central Office Installation.jpg|thumb|Typical Northern Telecom DMS100 Telephone [[Telephone exchange|Central Office]] Installation]]
A central-office engineer is responsible for designing and overseeing the implementation of telecommunications equipment in a [[Telephone exchange|central office]] (CO for short), also referred to as a wire center or [[telephone exchange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Overstreet |first=Frank |url=http://www.frankoverstreet.com/pages/co/what-is-a-central-office.aspx |title=What is a Central Office |website=www.frankoverstreet.com |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CO engineer is responsible for integrating new technology into the existing network, assigning the equipment's location in the wire center, and providing power, clocking (for digital equipment), and alarm monitoring facilities for the new equipment. The CO engineer is also responsible for providing more power, clocking, and alarm monitoring facilities if there are currently not enough available to support the new equipment being installed. Finally, the CO engineer is responsible for designing how the massive amounts of cable will be distributed to various equipment and wiring frames throughout the wire center and overseeing the installation and turn up of all new equipment.

====Sub-roles====
As [[structural engineer]]s, CO engineers are responsible for the structural design and placement of racking and bays for the equipment to be installed in as well as for the plant to be placed on.

As [[electrical engineer]]s, CO engineers are responsible for the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[capacitance]], and [[inductance]] (RCL) design of all new plant to ensure telephone service is clear and crisp and data service is clean as well as reliable. [[Attenuation]] or gradual loss in intensity{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and loop loss calculations are required to determine cable length and size required to provide the service called for. In addition, power requirements have to be calculated and provided to power any electronic equipment being placed in the wire center.

Overall, CO engineers have seen new challenges emerging in the CO environment. With the advent of Data Centers, [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) facilities, cellular radio sites, and other emerging-technology equipment environments within telecommunication networks, it is important that a consistent set of established practices or requirements be implemented.

Installation suppliers or their sub-contractors are expected to provide requirements with their products, features, or services. These services might be associated with the installation of new or expanded equipment, as well as the removal of existing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1275&amp; GR-1275, ''Central Office/Network Environment Equipment Installation/Removal Generic Requirements,''] Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1502&amp; GR-1502, ''Central Office/Network Environment Detail Engineering Generic Requirements,''] Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other factors must be considered such as:
*Regulations and safety in installation
*Removal of hazardous material
*Commonly used tools to perform installation and removal of equipment

===Outside-plant engineer===
[[File:VZ SAI workers Secaucus jeh.JPG|thumb|Engineers working on a [[cross-connect]] box, also known as a [[serving area interface]]]]
[[Outside plant]] (OSP) engineers are also often called field engineers because they frequently spend much time in the field taking notes about the civil environment, aerial, above ground, and below ground.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} OSP engineers are responsible for taking plant (copper, fiber, etc.) from a wire center to a distribution point or destination point directly. If a distribution point design is used, then a [[cross-connect]] box is placed in a strategic location to feed a determined distribution area.

The [[cross-connect]] box, also known as a [[serving area interface]], is then installed to allow connections to be made more easily from the wire center to the destination point and ties up fewer facilities by not having dedication facilities from the wire center to every destination point.  The plant is then taken directly to its destination point or to another small closure called a terminal, where access can also be gained to the plant if necessary.  These access points are preferred as they allow faster repair times for customers and save telephone operating companies large amounts of money.

The plant facilities can be delivered via underground facilities, either direct buried or through conduit or in some cases laid under water, via aerial facilities such as telephone or power poles, or via microwave radio signals for long distances where either of the other two methods is too costly.

====Sub-roles====
[[File:Lady pole climbing Telephone Engineer - geograph.org.uk - 467324.jpg|thumb|Engineer (OSP) climbing a telephone pole]]
As [[structural engineers]], OSP engineers are responsible for the structural design and placement of cellular towers and telephone poles as well as calculating pole capabilities of existing telephone or power poles onto which new plant is being added.  Structural calculations are required when boring under heavy traffic areas such as highways or when attaching to other structures such as bridges. Shoring also has to be taken into consideration for larger trenches or pits.  Conduit structures often include encasements of slurry that needs to be designed to support the structure and withstand the environment around it (soil type, high traffic areas, etc.).

As [[electrical engineers]], OSP engineers are responsible for the resistance, capacitance, and inductance (RCL) design of all new plant to ensure telephone service is clear and crisp and data service is clean as well as reliable.  [[Attenuation]] or gradual loss in intensity{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and loop loss calculations are required to determine cable length and size required to provide the service called for.  In addition power requirements have to be calculated and provided to power any electronic equipment being placed in the field.  Ground potential has to be taken into consideration when placing equipment, facilities, and plant in the field to account for lightning strikes, high voltage intercept from improperly grounded or broken power company facilities, and from various sources of electromagnetic interference.

As [[civil engineer]]s, OSP engineers are responsible for drafting plans, either by hand or using [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD) software, for how telecom plant facilities will be placed.  Often when working with municipalities trenching or boring permits are required and drawings must be made for these.  Often these drawings include about 70% or so of the detailed information required to pave a road or add a turn lane to an existing street.  Structural calculations are required when boring under heavy traffic areas such as highways or when attaching to other structures such as bridges.  As civil engineers, telecom engineers provide the modern communications backbone for all technological communications distributed throughout civilizations today.

Unique to telecom engineering is the use of air-core cable which requires an extensive network of air handling equipment such as compressors, manifolds, regulators and hundreds of miles of air pipe per system that connects to pressurized splice cases all designed to pressurize this special form of copper cable to keep moisture out and provide a clean signal to the customer.

As political and social [[ambassador]], the OSP engineer is a telephone operating company's face and voice to the local authorities and other utilities. OSP engineers often meet with municipalities, construction companies and other utility companies to address their concerns and educate them about how the telephone utility works and operates.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Additionally, the OSP engineer has to secure real estate to place outside facilities on, such as an easement to place a cross-connect box on.

''' Tzippori Synagogue''' ('''Sepphoris Synagogue''') is an ancient synagogue discovered in [[Tzippori]], a Roman-era Jewish city in the [[Galilee]], now an archaeological site and a national park in [[Israel]]. 

==History==
Based on numismatic evidence, the synagogue appears to have been built in the first half of the fifth century. It was located on the northern side of the city, not far from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/Zippori/mosaic.htm The Mosaic Pavements of Roman and Byzantine Zippori]&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring 20.7 meters long and 8 meters wide, it is the narrowest ancient synagogue uncovered in the [[Land of Israel]]. The [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] was located in the western wall, not oriented towards Jerusalem as in other synagogues of that era.&lt;ref name=aviam&gt;Mordechai Aviam, ''Ancient Synagogues in the Land of Israel'', Israel Nature and Parks Authority, 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mishna]] describes Tzippori as having had 18 synagogues at the time of the funeral of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] in the late second century CE.&lt;ref name=aviam/&gt;

==Discovery==
The mosaic floor of the ancient synagogue was discovered in 1993 by a crew building a parking lot at the edge of the national archaeological park of Tzippori.&lt;ref name=art&gt;Steven Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a handful of illustrated synagogue mosaics uncovered in Israel. Archaeologist [[Zeev Weiss]], then a graduate student at the Hebrew University, and his teacher, archaeologist [[Ehud Netzer]] were called to the scene, and Weiss uncovered the floor and its environs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23883856/The-Sepphoris-Synagogue-Deciphering-an-Ancient-Message-through-Its-Archaeological-and-SocioHistorical-Contexts|title=The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|date= May 2006|author=Steven Fine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaics==
The mosaic floor is divided into seven parts. Near the entrance is a scene showing the angels visiting [[Sarah]]. The next section shows the binding of [[Isaac]]. There is a large Zodiac with the names of the months written in Hebrew. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot. Next, there is a row of three panels depicting the offerings in the [[Temple at Jerusalem]], including the [[Kodashim|"tamid" sacrifice]], the [[showbread]] and the basket of [[first fruits]]. Above this is a depiction of [[Aaron]] offering sacrifices in the [[Tabernacle]]. Above that is another row of three panels, a [[Torah Ark]], depicted as a pedimented building, and an incense shovel representing the incense shovels used in the Temple, flanked by two panels each displaying the seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] from the Temple at Jerusalem surrounded by symbols of the Jewish holidays including the [[Lulav]] and [[Shofar]]. The top, or front of the building section of the floor, another row of three panels, shows two lions flanking a wreath, their paws resting on the head of an ox.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Weiss, ''The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts''.Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society; Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The largest panel or central sections of the mosaic is laid out as a large square containing a circle within a circle. This shows the Zodiac with Helios driving his chariot. As with the [[Hammat Tiberias Synagogue]] and the [[Beit Alfa Synagogue]], the Zodiac panel at Tzippori features [[Spandrels]] depicting the four seasons.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

A '''windpump''' is a type of [[windmill]] which is used for pumping water.

[[File:Molendeolifant.jpg|thumb|[[De Olifant, Burdaard|De Olifant]] at [[Burdaard]], [[Friesland]]]]
Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of wind pumps became widespread across the [[Muslim world]] and later spread to [[China]] and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69. (cf. [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt; Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[East Anglia]] area of [[Great Britain]], from the late [[Middle Ages]] onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.

[[Simon Stevin]]'s work in the ''waterstaet'' involved improvements to the [[sluice]]s and [[spillway]]s to control [[flood]]ing. [[Windmill]]s were already in use to pump the water out, but in ''Van de Molens'' (''On mills''), he suggested improvements, including the idea that the wheels should move slowly, and a better system for meshing of the [[gear teeth]]. These improvements increased the efficiency of the windmills used to pump water out of the [[polder]]s by three times.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Science: Power, Proof &amp; Passion - EP4: Can We Have Unlimited Power?&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[patent]] on his innovation in 1586.&lt;ref name=isis/&gt;

Eight- to ten-bladed windmills were used in the [[Region of Murcia]], [[Spain]], to raise water for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yachtmollymawk.com/2008/11/spanish-water-works/ Water-lifting mills in the [[Region of Murcia]], [[Spain]]&lt;/ref&gt; The drive from the windmill's rotor was led down through the tower and back out through the wall to turn a large wheel known as a ''[[noria]]''. The ''noria'' supported a bucket chain which dangled down into the well. The buckets were traditionally made of wood or clay. These windmills remained in use until the 1950s, and many of the towers are still standing.

Early immigrants to the [[New World]] brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe.&lt;ref name="Brief History"&gt;[http://www.windmillersgazette.com/history.html "Brief History of Windmills in the New World"]&lt;/ref&gt; On US farms, particularly on the [[Great Plains]], wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding ([[tankhouse]]). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by [[Daniel Halladay]] in 1854.&lt;ref name="Brief History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2003/2/2003_2_56.shtml americanheritage.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/ferminews03-02-14/p4.html fnal.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe, ''Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995  {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, pages 123-127&lt;/ref&gt; Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the pump rods down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity.  Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the pump rods buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.

The multi-bladed wind pump or wind [[turbine]] atop a lattice tower made of wood or steel hence became, for many years, a fixture of the landscape throughout rural America. These mills, made by a variety of manufacturers, featured a large number of blades so that they would turn slowly with considerable [[torque]] in moderate winds and be self-regulating in high winds.  A tower-top [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and [[crankshaft]] converted the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Today, rising energy costs and improved pumping technology are increasing interest in the use of this once declining technology.

==Worldwide use==
[[File:Wicken Fen Windpump.jpg|thumb|A working wooden windpump on [[The Fens]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], UK]]
The [[Netherlands]] is well known for its windmills.  Most of these iconic structures situated along the edge of [[polders]] are actually windpumps, designed to drain the land.  These are particularly important as much of the country lies below [[sea level]].

In the UK, the term ''windpump'' is rarely used, and they are better known as ''drainage windmills''. Many of these were built in [[The Broads]] and [[The Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] for the draining of land, but most of them have since been replaced by [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or electric powered pumps. Many of the original windmills still stand in a derelict state although some have been restored.

Windpumps are used extensively in [[Southern Africa]], Australia, and on farms and ranches in the central plains and Southwest of the United States. In South Africa and Namibia thousands of windpumps are still operating. These are mostly used to provide water for human use as well as drinking water for large sheep stocks.

[[Kenya]] has also benefited from the African development of windpump technologies. At the end of the 1970s, the UK [[NGO]] [[Intermediate Technology Development Group]] provided engineering support to the Kenyan company Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd for the development of the Kijito windpumps. Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd is still manufacturing the Kijito windpumps, and more than 300 of them are operating in the whole of [[East Africa]].

In many parts of the world, a [[rope pump]] is being used in conjunction with wind turbines. This easy-to- construct pump works by pulling a knotted rope through a pipe (usually a simple PVC pipe) causing the water to be pulled up into the pipe. This type of pump has become common in [[Nicaragua]] and other places.

==Construction==
To construct a windpump, the bladed rotor needs to be matched to the pump. With non-electric windpumps, high [[Blade solidity|solidity]] rotors are best used in conjunction with positive displacement (piston) pumps, because single-acting piston pumps need about three times as much torque to start them as to keep them going. Low solidity rotors, on the other hand, are best used with [[centrifugal pump]]s, [[waterladder pump]]s and chain and washer pumps, where the torque needed by the pump for starting is less than that needed for running at design speed. Low solidity rotors are best used if they are intended to drive an electricity generator; which in turn can drive the pump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E10.htm Water lifting devices; matching bladed rotors to pumps]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-bladed windpumps==
[[File:Wind-powered-agricultural-pump-1.jpg|thumb|Wind powered water pump on Oak Park Farm, Shedd, Oregon.]]
Multi-bladed wind pumps can be found worldwide and are manufactured in the United States, Argentina, China, New Zealand, and South Africa. A 16&amp;nbsp;ft (4.8&amp;nbsp;m) diameter wind pump can lift up to 1600 US gallons (about 6.4 metric tons) of water per hour to an elevation of 100&amp;nbsp;ft with a 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;mph wind (24–32&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmanwindmill.com Iron Man Windmill Website pumping capacity calculator], retrieved January 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However they take a strong wind to start so they turn over the crank of the piston pump. Wind pumps require little maintenance—usually only a change of gear box oil annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aermotorwindmill.com/Sales/CommonQuestions.asp Aermotor Web site frequently asked questions], retrieved Sept. 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 60,000 wind pumps are still in use in the United States. They are particularly attractive for use at remote sites where electric power is not available and maintenance is difficult to provide.

A common multi-bladed windpump usefully pumps with about 4%–8% of the annual windpower passing through the area it sweeps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/30361.pdf Argaw, N.,"Renewable Energy for Water Pumping Applications in Rural Villages",2003, NREL Report 30361, page 27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cprl.ars.usda.gov/REMM%20Pubs/1997%20Performance%20and%20Economic%20Comparison%20of%20a%20Mechanical%20Windmill%20to%20a%20Wind-Electric%20Water%20Pumping%20System.pdf Brian Vick, Nolan Clark "Performance and Economic Comparison of a Mechanical Windmill to Wind-Electric Water Pumping System", 1997, USDA-Agricultural Research Service, see Figure-2]&lt;/ref&gt;  This lower conversion is due to poor load matching between wind rotors and fixed-stroke piston pumps.

==Fundamental problems of multi-bladed windpumps==

===Inefficient rotor===

The main design feature of a multi-bladed rotor is "high starting torque", which is necessary for cranking a piston pump operation. Once started a multi-bladed rotor runs at too high a tipspeed ratio at less than its best efficiency of 30%  .&lt;ref name="Hau 2005, page 101"&gt;Hau, Erich "Wind Turbines", 2005, page 101, Fig.5-10&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, modern wind rotors can operate at an aerodynamic efficiency of more than 40% at higher tipspeed ratio for a smaller swirl added and wasted to the wind.&lt;ref name="Hau 2005, page 101"/&gt; But they would need a highly variable stroke mechanism rather than just a crank to piston pump.

===Poor load matching===

A multi-bladed windmill is a mechanical device with a piston pump. Because a piston pump has a fixed stroke, the energy demand of this type of pump is proportional to pump speed only. On the other hand, the energy supply of a wind rotor is proportional to the cube of wind speed. Because of that, a wind rotor runs at over speed (more speed than needed), yielding a loss of aerodynamic efficiency.

A variable stroke would match the rotor speed according to wind speed, functioning like a "variable-speed generator".  The flow rate of variable stroke windpump can be increased two times, compared to fixed stroke windpumps at the same wind speed.&lt;ref name="ena.com.tr"&gt;[http://www.ena.com.tr/Wind90.pdf Clark, Nolan "Variable Stroke Pumping for Mechanical Windmills", 1990, AWEA Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclic torque variation===

A piston pump has a very light   suction phase,  but the upstroke is heavy and puts a big backtorque on a starting rotor when the crank is horizontal and ascending.   A counterweight on the crank up in the tower and yawing with the wind direction can at least spread the torque to the crank descent.

==Development of improved windpumps==

Although multi-bladed windpumps are based on proven technology and are widely used, they have the fundamental problems mentioned above and need a practical variable stroke mechanism .

===USDA experiments at Texas===
Between 1988 and 1990, a variable stroke windpump was tested at the USDA-Agriculture Research Center-Texas, based on two patented designs (Don E. Avery Patent #4.392.785, 1983 and Elmo G. Harris Patent #617.877, 1899).&lt;ref name="ena.com.tr"/&gt; Control systems of the variable stroke wind pumps were mechanical and hydraulic; however, those experiments did not attract the attention of any windpump manufacturer. After experiments with this variable stroke windpump, research focused on wind-electric water pumping systems; no commercial variable stroke windpump exists yet.

===Fluttering windpumps===

Fluttering windpumps have been developed in Canada with a  pump stroke varying strongly with amplitude to absorb all the variable power in the wind and to stop the uniblade from swinging too far beyond horizontal from its vertical mean position. They are much lighter and use less material than multiblade windpumps and can pump effectively in lighter wind regimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econologica.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIj7LCtX0U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish experiments===
A Turkish engineer re-designed the variable stroke windpump technology by using modern electronic control equipment. Research began in 2004, with governmental R&amp;D support. The first commercial new generation variable stroke wind pumps have been designed after ten years of R&amp;D. The 30&amp;nbsp;kW variable stroke windpump design includes a Darrieus-type modern wind rotor, counterbalance and regenerative brake technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.com.tr/english.htm ENA Yelkapan Technologies Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tjasker''===
{{Main article|tjasker}}
[[File:Tjasker Sanpoel 04.JPG|thumb|The ''tjasker'']]
In the [[Netherlands]], the ''tjasker'' is a drainage mill with [[windmill sail#Common sails|common sails]] connected to an [[Archimedean screw]]. This is used for pumping water in areas where only a small lift is required. The windshaft sits on a tripod which allows it to pivot. The Archimedean screw lifts water into a collecting ring, where it is drawn off into a ditch at a higher level, thus draining the land.&lt;ref name=Tjasker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/types.htm|title=The types of windmills|publisher=Odur|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thai windpumps===
In Thailand, windpumps are traditionally built on Chinese windpump designs. These pumps are constructed from wire-braced bamboo poles carrying fabric or bamboo-mat sails; a paddle pump or [[waterladder pump]] is fixed to a [[Thai bladed rotor]]. They are mainly used in [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] where the water lift required is typically less than 1 meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smulders|first=P.T.|date=January 1996|title=Wind water pumping: the forgotten option|journal=[[Energy for Sustainable Development]]|volume=11|issue=5|url=http://www.energieautark.at/cms/dmdocuments/WindwaterpumpingAfrica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission''' ('''XRISM'''), formerly named the X-ray Astronomy Recovery Mission (XARM, pronounced "charm"),&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;According to Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, this is because the project "does need some luck"&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[X-ray astronomy]] satellite of the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) to provide breakthroughs in the study of structure formation of the universe, outflows from galaxy nuclei, and [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name=Hertz201706&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/attachments/190966/public/HertzAAAC2017Jun22FINAL2.pdf |title=Astrophysics |last1=Hertz |first1=Paul |format=PDF |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=22 June 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HEAPA2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/609732/1/SA6000060006.pdf |title=ASTRO-Hに対する高エネルギーコミュニティの総括と今後の方向性について |last1=Fujimoto |first1=Ryuichi |last2=Tashiro |first2=Makoto |format=PDF |publisher=[[JAXA]] |date=5 January 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the only international X-ray observatory project of its period, XRISM will function as a next generation space telescope in the X-ray astronomy field, similar to how the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi Space Telescope]], and the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] Observatory are placed in their respective fields.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/shiryo/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2016/10/06/1377887_7.pdf |title=Ｘ線天文衛星代替機の検討状況について |format=PDF |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=29 September 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission will crosslink X-ray telescopes of the present ([[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]], [[XMM-Newton]]) with that of the future ([[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics|ATHENA]], [[List of proposed space observatories#Design studies|Lynx]]/X-Ray Surveyor), thus preventing the formation of a blank period in X-ray astronomy in the early 2020s resulting from the loss of [[Hitomi (satellite)|''Hitomi'']].&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; During its formulation, XRISM/XARM was also known as the "ASTRO-H Successor", "ASTRO-H2".
 
==Overview==
[[File:Astro-H schema (en).png|thumbnail|The XRISM project will be based on the [[Astro-H|ASTRO-H]] mission]]
With the retirement of [[Suzaku (satellite)|''Suzaku'']] in August 2015, and the detectors onboard [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[XMM-Newton]] operating for more than 15 years and gradually aging, the failure of ''Hitomi'' meant that X-ray astronomers will have a 12-year blank period in soft X-ray observation, until the launch of ATHENA (which according to [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] director general Saku Tsuneta is a "super ASTRO-H"&lt;ref name="Foust20160613"&gt;{{cite news |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=June 13, 2016 |title=NASA and JAXA begin discussions on aftermath of Hitomi failure |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-and-jaxa-begin-discussions-on-aftermath-of-hitomi-failure/ |newspaper=[[SpaceNews]] |accessdate=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 2028.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISASnews430"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/outreach/isas_news/files/ISASnews430.pdf |title=ISASニュース 2017.1 No.430 |publisher=[[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] |format=PDF |date=22 January 2017 |access-date=2016-03-23 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in a major setback for the international community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www8.cao.go.jp/space/comittee/dai52/siryou2-1.pdf |title=Ｘ線天文衛星「ひとみ」の異常事象への対応と代替機の開発について |format=PDF |publisher=Committee on National Space Policy of Japan |date=18 August 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; as there will be no telescope to cover the most important part of X-ray astronomy, when in other wavelengths the operation of large scale observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the [[Thirty Meter Telescope]] will commence.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; A lack of missions could also deprive young astronomers a chance to gain hands-on experience from participating in a project.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; For these reasons, as well as to recover the science that was to be gained from ''Hitomi'', the XRISM project began.

In Japan, the project is led by JAXA's [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] (ISAS) division, and the U.S. participation is led by NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC).

A team of astronomers from GSFC suggests pairing the XARM satellite with a source satellite containing radioactive sources. XRISM will observe the source sat to conduct absolute calibration of its telescopes, thus functioning as a in-orbit X-ray "standard candle".  With its broad effective area, the telescope could potentially establish several standard candles in the sky by observing constant celestial sources. If this concept proves successful, later missions such as ATHENA and Lynx may have their own source sats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/iachec/meetings/2017/presentations/IACHEC2017_Markevitch_session12.pdf |title=Cal X-1: an in-orbit X-ray standard candle |last1=Markevitch |first1=M |last2=Jahoda |first2=K |last3=Hill |first3=J |format=PDF |publisher=[[MIT]] |date=29 March 2017 |access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes from ''Hitomi''===
The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission will be one of the first projects for ISAS to place a separate Project Manager (PM) and a Primary Investigator (PI). This measure was taken as part of ISAS's reform in project management to prevent the recurrence of the ''Hitomi'' accident.&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; In traditional ISAS missions, the PM was also responsible for tasks that would typically be allocated to PI's in a NASA mission.

While ''Hitomi'' had an array of instruments spanning from soft X-ray to soft gamma ray, XRISM will focus around the Resolve instrument (equivalent to ''Hitomi''{{'s}} SXS),&lt;ref name="x-rayuniverse2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/332006/1402684/MTashiro_t.pdf |title=X‐ray Astronomy Recovery Mission XARM |last1=Tashiro |first1=Makoto |last2=Kelley |first2=Richard |format=PDF |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=8 June 2017 |access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Xtend (SXI), which has a high affinity to Resolve.&lt;ref name="mext30"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/gijiroku/1379220.htm |title=宇宙開発利用部会（第30回） 議事録 |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=29 September 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elimination of a hard X-ray telescope is based on the launch of NASA's [[NuSTAR]] satellite, a development that wasn't put to consideration when the [[Hitomi (satellite)|NeXT]] proposal was initially formulated.&lt;ref name="mext29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/gijiroku/1376305.htm |title=宇宙開発利用部会（第29回） 議事録 |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=14 July 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; NuSTAR's spatial and energy resolution is analogous to ''Hitomi''{{'s}} hard X-ray instruments.&lt;ref name="mext29"/&gt; Once the operation of XRISM starts, collaborative observations with NuSTAR will likely be essential.&lt;ref name="HEAPA2017"/&gt; Meanwhile, the scientific value of the soft and hard X-ray band width boundary has been noted; therefor the option of upgrading XRISM's instruments to be partially capable of hard X-ray observation is under consideration.&lt;ref name="mext30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext29"/&gt; Furthermore, a hard X-ray telescope proposal with abilities surpassing ''Hitomi'' has also been proposed.&lt;ref name="FORCE2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/609717/1/SA6000060036.pdf |title=軟Ｘ線から硬Ｘ線の広帯域を高感度で撮像分光する小型衛星計画 FORCE - Focusing On Relativistic universe and Cosmic Evolution - |last1=Nakazawa |first1=Kazuhiro |last2=Mori |first2=Koji |format=PDF |publisher=[[JAXA]] |date=6 January 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''FORCE'' (Focusing On Relativistic universe and Cosmic Evolution) space telescope is a candidate for the next ISAS competitive medium class mission. If selected, FORCE is to be launched after the mid 2020s, with an eye towards conducting simultaneous observations with ATHENA.&lt;ref name="FORCE2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HEAPA2017"/&gt;

==History==
Following the premature termination of the ''Hitomi'' mission, on 14 June 2016 JAXA announced their proposal to rebuild the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://smd-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/APD_ImpPlan_2016-12-15_0.pdf#page=16 |title=Astrophysics Implementation Plan: 2016 Update |format=PDF |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=15 December 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XARM pre-project preparation team was formed in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/outreach/isas_news/files/ISASnews435.pdf#page=6 |title=ISASニュース 2017.6 No.435 |publisher=[[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] |format=PDF |date=23 June 2017 |access-date=2017-07-04 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. side, formulation is to begin in the summer of 2017.&lt;ref name="Hertz201706"/&gt; In June 2017, ESA announced that they will participate in XRISM as a mission of opportunity.&lt;ref name="ESAcv0620"/&gt;

==Instruments==
XRISM will carry two instruments for studying the soft X-ray energy range, Resolve and Xtend. The satellite will have telescopes for each of the instruments, SXT-I (Soft X-ray Telescope for Imager) and SXT-S (Soft X-ray Telescope for Spectrometer).&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; The pair of telescopes will have a focal length of {{convert|5.6|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;

===Resolve===
Resolve is a X-ray micro calorimeter. The instrument will likely not be a complete remanufacture of ''Hitomi''{{'s}} SXS, as there are some space-qualified hardware left from developing SXS, and these spare parts may be utilized to build Resolve.&lt;ref name="Foust20160613"/&gt;

===Xtend===
Xtend is a X-ray [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera. Unlike Resolve, which will be a "built-to-print" version of its predecessor, Xtend differs in that its energy resolution will be improved from ''Hitomi''{{'s}} SXI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/shiryo/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2017/06/20/1386893_1.pdf |title=X線天文衛星ASTRO-Hのプロジェクト終了について |format=PDF |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=30 May 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
