The '''1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery''', sometimes called the '''Skylight Caper''',&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sezgin|first1=Catherine Schofield|title=The Skylight Caper: The Unsolved 1972 Theft of the Montreal Museum of  Fine Arts|journal=The Journal of Art Crime|date=Fall 2010|issue=4|pages=57–68|url=http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/JAC-Fall-2010-eVersion-Final.pdf|accessdate=August 27, 2017|issn=1947-5934}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place very early in the morning of September 4 of that year. Three [[armed robbery|armed robbers]] used a [[skylight]] under repair to gain entry to [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|the museum]] from its roof, tied up the three guards on duty, and left on foot with 18 paintings, including a rare [[Rembrandt]] [[Landscape painting|landscape]] and works by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Thomas Gainsborough]], as well as some [[figurine]]s and jewellery. One of the Brueghels was returned by the thieves as an initiative to start [[ransom]] negotiations. None of the other paintings has ever been recovered and the robbers have never been arrested or even publicly identified, although there is at least one informal suspect.

Collectively, the missing paintings have been valued at $11.7 million in 2017 dollars; although their value may have diminished since the theft as scholars have called the attribution of some of the works into question. However, the Rembrandt alone has been valued at $1 million; in 2003 ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' estimated it to have appreciated in value to $20 million. The thieves appeared to know what works they were looking for; many of the works had been part of ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that had been to many museums in the U.S. and Canada prior to [[Expo 67]], as well as some other special exhibits put on by the museum in the preceding years. It is not only the largest [[art theft]] in Canada but the largest theft in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="CBC digital archives story"&gt;{{cite news|title=1972: Art heist at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1972-art-heist-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=September 4, 1972|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadaartsconnect.com/2014/09/art-theft-montreal-museum-fine-arts-1972/|title=Today in Canadian Art History: The Largest Art Theft in Canadian History Occurred at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts / Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 31, 2017|publisher=Canada Arts Connect|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720185443/http://canadaartsconnect.com/2014/09/art-theft-montreal-museum-fine-arts-1972/|archive-date=2017-07-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of the crime proved difficult in the early going, since it occurred over the [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] holiday weekend, when many of the museum's officials including its director were vacationing far away from [[Montreal]]. It was further complicated by continuing news coverage of the [[Blue Bird Café fire]], Montreal's deadliest [[arson]], three days earlier, dominating the headlines; the next day the [[Munich massacre|killings of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Munich]] further diminished media coverage. A [[sting operation]] conceived after the thieves returned the Brueghel (later reattributed to his students) and mailed photos of the other works to the museum seeking a ransom payment went awry; a later attempt to negotiate their return cost the museum $10,000 with no results.

The thieves took advantage of weakened security, resulting from the renovations at the museum, which had left the skylight's alarm disabled. The renovations and the security flaws were themselves a consequence of the museum's tightening finances, which had worsened during the 1960s as many of the wealthy [[English-speaking Quebecers|Anglophone]] community in Montreal that had supported the museum since its founding in 1860 began to leave for [[Toronto]] due to increasing concerns over [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]],&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Unsolved '72 Theft of Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after terrorist acts by the [[Front de libération du Québec]] had led to [[October Crisis|martial law in the Montreal area]] two years earlier. [[Sûreté du Québec]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and [[Interpol]] continue to investigate the crime. Theories as to who might be responsible have ranged from the [[Montreal Mafia]] to Quebec separatists.

==Background==
[[File:New Art Gallery Building, Montreal 06.jpg|thumb|right|The Hornstein Pavilion, the original museum building, in 2013|alt=A three-story light stone building with a flat green-trimmed roof from which the Canadian, Quebec and Montreal flags are flying from poles at the center, seen from a three-quarters angle about midway up its height from across an intersection. On its front face is a recessed entry area with four fluted columns topped by Corinthian capitals. Banners to either side have the word "Chihuly", and the entablature has "Montreal Museum of Fine Arts" and "Musée de Beaux Art du Montréal in capital metal letters]]
The [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] (MMFA) was established in 1860 as the Art Association of Montreal, to encourage art appreciation in the city. It did not start to exhibit works until the late 1870s and 1880s, when wealthy patrons who had prospered from Canada's [[industrialization]] began to donate both cash and works, and it was soon able to build Canada's first space explicitly intended for the exhibition of art. In 1913 it built what is currently its main building, now known as the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion, on Sherbrooke Street in the neighborhood known even today as the [[Golden Square Mile]], because it was home to many of the wealthiest and most successful families in Canada.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part II: 'The Skylight Caper' |url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-ii-skylight-caper.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[patronage|patrons]] were predominantly of British descent, all members of Montreal's [[English-speaking Quebecers|Anglophone]] elite. At the end of the 1950s, their political and economic domination of the city began to yield to its majority [[Québécois people|Francophone]] population, as [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]] began to gain political influence in the province as a whole. Fearing the consequences should the province succeed in seceding, and mindful of the terrorist attacks of the [[Front de libération du Québec]] which had led to [[October Crisis|martial law being declared in the city in 1970]],&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; the Anglophone elite began leaving the city over the course of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt;

This slowly deprived the museum of much of its traditional financial support. In 1957, Bill Bantey, a former journalist who was appointed the museum's head of [[public relations]], began reaching out for the first time in its history to Francophones, with some success. But the contributions from newer philanthropists in the city were not as much as their predecessors had been able to give, and public funds from the province only covered 40 percent of the museum's annual budget.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt;

As a result, the museum was having to cut back financially in the early 1970s, going from a strictly private institution to a semi-public [[nonprofit organization]].&lt;ref name="Museum history page"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of MMFA 1860–2016|url=https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/about-the-museum/history-of-the-mmfa-1860-2016/|publisher=[[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]|date=2017|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum needed to expand, and it needed to renovate the 1913 [[William Sutherland Maxwell]] [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building on Sherbrooke Street. The latter was particularly unsuited to the demands of a late-20th century art museum, with many cramped rooms and corridors.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt; The museum planned to close it in 1973 for a three-year renovation project.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part VI: Closing the museum and another ransom demand|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-vi-closing-museum-and-another.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous thefts and attempts===

On two prior occasions thieves took, or attempted to take, works from the museum.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

One night in 1933, a person who had hidden in the museum overnight passed 14 paintings, mostly by Canadian artists, to someone else through an open window in the women's lavatory. Later the museum received a ransom note asking $10,000 for the return of the paintings. Three months later, the English-language ''[[Montreal Star]]'' and the French ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' each received half of one of the paintings in the mail. A note along with them said if a ransom of 25 percent of the remaining paintings' total value was not paid, they too would be returned in pieces.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The paintings were recovered before that could occur when Paul Thouin, a petty criminal, was arrested after burglarizing a rail freight car. During interrogation, he confessed to stealing the paintings and led police to where he had buried them, wrapped in a [[tarpaulin]] with newspapers, in a one-metre-deep (3&amp;nbsp;ft) sandpit near the village of [[L'Épiphanie, Quebec (town)|L'Épiphanie]] a short distance northeast of Montreal. Thouin, who had shot and killed a police officer attempting to apprehend him in a railroad warehouse, was reportedly terrified at the prospect of being returned to prison for what would likely be a very long time. He committed suicide by [[Strychnine poisoning|poisoning himself with a concealed dose of strychnine]] in the police lockup that night, before he could stand trial.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

A gang of armed robbers attempted to steal some [[van Gogh]] paintings during a special exhibition of the artist's work at the museum in 1960. They were foiled and escaped. They have never been identified.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Labour Day weekend 1972 in Montreal===

In Montreal, [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] weekend of 1972 began with two major news events, neither of them positive. On the night of Friday, September 1, four men who had been refused entry to a downtown country-and-western bar for being too intoxicated retaliated by [[arson|setting the club's steps afire]]; [[Blue Bird Café fire|the ensuing blaze]] killed 37, making it the deadliest fire in the city in 45 years.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; On the following evening, the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet national hockey team]] defeated [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|their Canadian counterparts]] 7–3 in the first game of the [[Summit Series]] at the  [[Montreal Forum]].&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt; Canadians, who had expected their team, composed of [[National Hockey League]] stars, to overwhelmingly defeat the Soviets, who had only begun competing in international ice hockey a quarter-century earlier, at what Canadians considered their national sport were stunned.&lt;ref name="Summit Series game 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Red|authorlink=Red Fisher (journalist)|title=Summit Series Game 1: Canada reels at shocking loss|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/summit+series+game+canada+reels+shocking+loss/7176790/story.html|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=September 3, 2012|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans in Montreal were eagerly looking ahead to the next game in the series, to be held Monday evening in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt;

At the museum, the board president, director, and director of security were all on vacation in either the [[United States]] or [[Mexico]] for the holiday weekend. Bantey, the public relations director, was the most senior official in charge.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Robbery==

Shortly after midnight on the morning of September 4, police believe, a group of three men gathered out in front of the museum on [[Sherbrooke Street]]. They went to the museum's west wall, between it and the [[Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul]]. One of the men, who had the same sort of pick-equipped boots used by utility-company workers to climb telephone poles, went up a tree next to the museum and got high enough in it to gain access to the roof. He was able to find a ladder, and lowered it to the other two, who climbed up.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Once the group was on the roof, they went to a [[skylight]] that had been covered by a plastic sheet in the course of some ongoing work. They opened the skylight, without setting off any alarm as the plastic sheet had rendered it inoperative, and lowered a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} [[nylon]] rope to the museum's second floor. All three slid down.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It had taken them almost an hour and a half to gain entry to the museum. Shortly after they did, around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., one of the three guards on duty was walking to the kitchen to get some tea. He encountered the thieves, their faces covered by [[ski mask]]s, who fired both barrels of a [[pump action]] shotgun into the ceilings to get his attention and made him lie down on the floor. The noise brought the other two guards, who were unable to resist, and soon all three guards were taken to a lecture hall where they were bound and gagged.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

There, one of the robbers, who carried a .38-caliber [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] handgun,&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt; stood guard while the other two removed paintings, jewellery and figurines from their displays and brought them to the museum's shipping department. The thieves originally seemed to have planned to leave via the same skylight they had come in through, but eventually they concluded it would take too much time to put together a system of [[pulley]]s to get themselves and the stolen artwork out. After finding that one of the guards had a set of keys to one of the museum's [[panel truck]]s, they decided instead to flee that way.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, this alternative also went awry. They chose to exit through one of the museum's side entrances, where an alarm went off as they did so. Leaving half their take behind, they fled on foot down Sherbrooke.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Back in the museum, one of the guards worked to free himself. An hour after the robbery ended, around 3 a.m., he succeeded and called Bill Bantey, who told him to call the police. He arrived shortly after the police, along with Ruth Jackson, the museum's curator of decorative arts. After surveying the broken frames, smashed display cases and general disorder the thieves had left, they found that 18 paintings and 38 other pieces had been taken. Collectively they estimated the value of the stolen work at $2 million.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Works stolen==
[[File:Rembrandt- landscape with cottages - stolen.jpg|right|thumb|Rembrandt's ''Landscape with Cottages'', the most valuable of the stolen works, seen here in a black-and-white image from the artist's 1968 [[catalogue raisonné]].|alt=A slightly sepia-toned image of a painting showing a cottage surrounded by dark trees under an overcast late-evening sky]]
All of the stolen paintings were by European artists from the 17th through 19th centuries:

*''Landscape with Vehicles and Cattle'', attributed at the time to [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] but later reattributed to his students (subsequently recovered)
*''Landscape with Buildings and Wagon'', Jan Brueghel the Elder
*''La rêveuse á la fontaine'' (''The Dreaming Woman at the Fountain''), [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]
*''Jeune fille accoudée sur le bras gauche'' (''Young Girl Leaning on Her Left Arm''), Corot
*''Landscape with rocks and stream'', [[Gustave Courbet]]
*''Head'', [[Honoré Daumier]]
*''Lioness and Lion in a Cave'', [[Eugène Delacroix]]
*''The Sorceress'', [[Narcisse Virgilio Díaz]]
*''Portrait of Brigadier General Sir Thomas Fletcher'', [[Thomas Gainsborough]]
*''Still Life: Vanitas'', [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]
*''Still Life with a Fish'', de Heem
*''La barrateuse'' (''Young Woman Churning''), [[Jean-François Millet]]
*''Portrait of Madame Millet'', Millet
*''Portrait of a Man, Possibly a Self-portrait'', [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]]
*''Landscape with Cottages'', [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]
*''Head of a Young Man'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]]
*''Portrait of a Lady'', [[François-André Vincent]]
*''Portrait of a Man'', Vincent

Most of the paintings taken were small works around a foot (31&amp;nbsp;cm) along their longest dimension; the three smallest (the Brueghels and Millet's ''La barrateuse'') were less than {{convert|80|sqin}}, smaller than a standard [[Letter (paper size)|letter-size]] piece of paper. The largest was the Courbet, at 28{{frac|7|8}} by 36{{frac|1|8}} inches ({{convert|28.875|by|36.125|in|cm|disp=output only}}), with the Gainsborough and Corot's ''Dreamer'' close behind. It was possible that when the thieves ran away each of them held a batch of smaller paintings in one hand and a larger one in the other.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part V: Comparable Crimes and the 'Masterpieces from Montreal'|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-v-comparable-crimes-and.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thieves also took 38 pieces of jewellery and figurines. Among the former pieces were an 18th-century gold watch once owned by the wife of [[Jacques Viger (1787–1858)|Jacques Viger]], Montreal's first mayor; a 19th-century French blue enamel latch box set with diamonds and two 17th-century Spanish pendants.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Investigation==

Later that morning, Bantey, who had covered the crime beat in Montreal as a journalist prior to his tenure at the museum, held a [[news conference]] to discuss the theft. He identified all the stolen works and described how the robbers had entered the museum and taken them. "They did show quite discriminating taste," he told reporters, "though as far as the objects are concerned, they could do with more art and historical training." In their haste to leave, he noted, the thieves had left behind another Rembrandt as well as works by [[El Greco]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Tintoretto]] that they could as easily have taken.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The news conference was initially effective in publicizing the theft. It, as well as lists of the stolen paintings, were reported as front-page news in many major newspapers across the U.S. and Canada the next morning. As soon as they learned of the theft, Montreal police had also put out the alert to the crossings along the [[Canada–United States border|U.S. border]], about {{convert|60|km}} from Montreal, to look out for the thieves and/or the paintings should anyone attempt to take them to [[New York City]], {{convert|330|mi|km|disp=flip}} farther south.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, further publicity that might have drawn attention to the theft and perhaps helped solve it was stymied by news events of September 5. At that year's [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terrorists]] with [[Black September]] took 11 Israeli athletes hostage, eventually [[Munich massacre|killing them]] along with a German police officer, the following day. Those events were of particular interest in Montreal since the city was preparing to host [[1976 Summer Olympics|the next Olympics]], and as a result further news about the art theft got less priority in the media. The investigation would continue, however.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

From interviews with the three guards, police learned that there had been three thieves. The guards saw two of them, describing them as both about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} in height. One spoke French and the other English. The guards also reported that the two spoke with a third, also a Francophone, whom they never were able to see.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Investigators were immediately struck by the similarity to another recent art theft in the Montreal area. On August 30, another group of three thieves had broken into the summer home of Agnes Meldrum, wife of a Montreal moving-company owner, in [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]], roughly 30 kilometres (20 miles) west of the city. They had all climbed up a 200-metre (600-foot) cliff from a powerboat on [[Lake of Two Mountains]] to do so. Witnesses said that while they wore hoods to prevent identification, two spoke French and the other, English. Once inside the home they stole paintings worth $50,000 in total.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Inside-job theory===

The presence of two Francophones and one Anglophone, plus the climbing skills involved, led the chief investigator on the case to believe the thieves involved in both incidents had been local, and possibly the same. That, and their apparent knowledge of the skylight's non-functional alarm, had at first fostered a theory that someone on the inside at the museum had aided the thieves in some way. This is a common phenomenon when museums are robbed; two [[New York City Police Department|New York City detectives]] who specialized in [[art theft|art crime]] said as much when commenting about the Montreal case later in 1972.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, the Montreal police considered that speculation too broad to be helpful in focusing their investigation, and evidence did not bear it out. While it was possible that the thieves had indeed actively involved someone working on the skylight, it was as possible that they, or others involved with them, had learned of the security flaw through an overheard remark somewhere. An intense investigation of the workers involved with the skylight did not find any evidence they had passed information about it to anyone criminally inclined.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It was also seen as possible that the robbers had learned of the skylight flaw by simply [[Reconnaissance|reconnoitering]] their target. Roughly two weeks before the theft, someone reported encountering two men sitting on chairs on the roof, wearing sunglasses and smoking. When asked by the person who reported the incident, they claimed to be museum employees. But when investigators looked for the chairs on the roof after the theft, they could not be found. Likewise, no fingerprints or other evidence was left on either the ladder or nylon rope.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Theories of an inside job were also undermined by the thieves' poorly planned exit. After abandoning their improvised plan to leave by the same skylight when they realized it would take too long to set up a system of [[pulley]]s, they instead chose to try to flee in one of the museum's trucks. If they had based that alternative on inside information they had obtained, they would have known how to disable the alarm they set off on the side entrance before opening it. And even if they had not chosen to do so, they would have known it did not sound anywhere else besides the museum—and thus not have abandoned half of what they had stolen to escape on foot.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Selection of works===

While the jewellery and figurines seem to have been chosen only because they could be easily carried, the paintings stolen seem to have been a matter of choice. Their small size, in addition to making them easy to carry and conceal, would also facilitate quick sales. The robbers, and any dealer working with them, might, investigators have speculated, have been looking to sell to private collectors who display their paintings in their homes. Indeed, the pairs of small paintings with similar subject matter by the same artist—Brueghel, Corot, Millet and Vincent—would be excellent choices to decorate a room.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Interest in art in recent years had driven up prices, a phenomenon which had been widely reported in both French- and English-language media, and the thieves would have known even if they had no interest in art what collectors were willing to pay large sums for. Some [[art dealer]]s in the Montreal area refused to discuss their business with police absent a legal order such as a [[subpoena]] or [[warrant (law)|warrant]]. Around Christmas 1972, a ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' columnist reported that, in fact, most of the paintings had been delivered to the homes of wealthy collectors in [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Mount Royal]], with a small portion diverted to the U.S. This led police to interrogate two unnamed individuals, but no new leads developed as a result.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The robbers might not even have had to visit the museum to decide what works to take. Half of those they did keep when they ran away had been in ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that had been to several cities in the U.S. during the year before [[Expo 67]]. The Rembrandt had been included in a 1969 exhibit to commemorate the tricentennial of the artist's death, and the following year many of the French paintings had been in another exhibit that the press in that language gave great attention to.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

All those works in the special exhibitions would have been depicted in handbooks or catalogues produced in association with them. Only the Brueghels, the Rubens and the Vincent portraits had not been included in those exhibits nor mentioned in any publication save the museum's own catalogue.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Possible early suspects===

Early in their investigation, the police began looking into a group of students at the nearby [[École des beaux-arts de Montréal]]. Mostly French-speaking, they had often visited the museum but had frequently been asked to leave before its official closing time so that the mostly English-speaking staff could [[Tea (meal)|take their tea]]. This had engendered considerable resentment on the students' part.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Police kept five of these students under 24-hour [[surveillance]] for two weeks. Eventually they decided they could not find any evidence, and dropped that part of the investigation. Alain Lacoursière, an art-theft specialist with the Montreal police who investigated the [[cold case]] in later years,&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; by his own account taking it over just before the files were slated to be shredded in 1984,&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post" /&gt; believes the students were not involved. "This crime was organized with a guy in charge who was 35 to 40 years old," well past his student years, he said in 2010.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Ransom negotiations and recovery attempts==

In many art thefts the thieves seek ransom payments in return for the stolen works, and this happened twice in the MMFA thefts. Within a week of the robbery museum director David Giles Carter received a phone call from, he believed, one of the thieves. A man with a gravelly voice and an accent Carter described as "European" gave him directions to a phone booth near [[McGill University]], near which one of the stolen pendants was found.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Soon afterwards, a brown manila [[Port of Montreal]] envelope arrived at the museum with snapshots of the stolen paintings. Carter nicknamed the thief "Port of Montreal" as a result, and dialogue was opened up between the museum and the thieves to negotiate a ransom. At first the thieves demanded $500,000, about a quarter of the works' stated value; later they halved that.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;
[[File:Montreal Central Station.JPG|right|thumb|Montreal Central Station, where one of the stolen paintings was found, in 2008|alt=A dark modern brick building with lighter buildings rising to the top of the image behind it. On a corner in front is signage in French advertising offices for rent in the building]]
Carter demanded the thieves, or whoever it was negotiating on their behalf, give more proof they had the paintings than snapshots. In response, they told the museum's security director to go to a locker in [[Montreal Central Station]]. Inside, he found the Brueghel ''Landscape with Buildings and Wagon''. It is the only one of the stolen paintings that has so far been recovered.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

As a result of these negotiations, approximately a month later the museum's insurance companies and the Montreal police set up a [[sting operation]]. An undercover detective posed as an [[Claims adjuster|insurance adjustor]] and agreed to meet the thieves or their representative in an empty field in one of the city's suburbs, where he hoped the thieves would believe he was ready to hand over $5,000 for another one of the paintings. However, when one of the local police cruisers passed by, completely unaware of the plans, the thieves apparently came to realize what was actually going on and never met the undercover officer. The next day they called Carter and complained that they had been set up.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière believes that it was actually the museum and the police who were being set up. The field the robbers had chosen as the meeting site had few nearby houses at the time and could easily have been monitored from some distance away, allowing the robbers to detect even the more subtle police presence necessary to support a sting operation. "It was all a smokescreen", he says. Since the thieves never reopened negotiations afterwards, he believes they never had any intention of returning the paintings at the time and were using the purported ransom negotiations as a [[Feint|diversion]] while they bought themselves more time to sell or otherwise dispose of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The second attempt took place the following year. A few months after the museum closed for its three-year renovation project in May 1973, a caller to a member of the museum's board said he would share where the paintings were hidden for $10,000. André DeQuoy, one of the adjusters handling the case, was involved in the discussion and made it clear that while the insurance companies would pay for information leading to the discovery of the painting, they would not pay for the paintings themselves. After he agreed to deliver it personally to the source, the board made the money available.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The caller had instructed DeQuoy, who was being discreetly followed by police, to go to a certain phone booth in [[downtown Montreal]] one afternoon. From there the caller sent him to other phone booths elsewhere in the city, such as the [[Blue Bonnets (raceway)|Blue Bonnets]] race track, on [[Saint Laurent Boulevard|St. Laurent Boulevard]] and at the [[Henri-Bourassa station]] on the [[Montreal Metro]]. The caller then informed DeQuoy that he had picked up the police tail and DeQuoy was to return to his office and await further instructions while the caller had the unmarked car called off.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

DeQuoy did, and an hour later the caller said the police had been taken care of. Again he was sent out to phone booths, ultimately traveling back and forth across the [[island of Montreal]] to 11 of them, until at 4 a.m. the next morning he was told he could leave the envelope at the base of a sign in a vacant lot on St. Martin Boulevard, then return to the Henri-Bourassa phone booth where the caller would contact him again with the location of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

While DeQuoy waited for the call, he let the police know where he had been all night. But the caller never called, so the adjustor returned to his office. At 8 a.m. the caller called him there and told him the paintings were in a motel in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], north of Montreal. An intensive search of the building, however, produced neither the paintings nor any sign they had ever been there. The $10,000 was not recovered.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Later developments==

Due to the minimal news coverage, in January 1973 Bill Bantey put together a circular, ''Attention: Stolen'', depicting the stolen paintings and giving information such as their dimensions, in English and French. The idea was to distribute it widely throughout the international art community and familiarize possible buyers with the stolen works, a practice that was not common in art thefts at the time as most museums preferred to keep the news of their victimization to themselves. Major [[auction]] houses like [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]] would not routinely check for whether art offered for sale through them was on lists of stolen works until 1985. "[We hope that] the works become so catalogued and so well-known that it would be unlikely that any collector or museum buyer could innocently purchase them," Bantey told the ''[[Montreal Gazette|Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The museum and investigators did not make the ransom negotiations in the year after the thefts public knowledge until ten years later. "For years we thought our chances of recovery were better keeping everything quiet," said one police detective, explaining the decision. "But now our hopes are small. Maybe this will stimulate interest and produce something." But while it did allow police to confirm what they have only described as "certain facts", those have apparently not led to any progress in the case.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The recovered Brueghel was kept in storage at the museum by Ruth Jackson for ten years until a new frame could be purchased, after which it was returned to the place it had been exhibited prior to the theft. However, it was later determined that it was not by Brueghel but one of his students; Lacoursière believes the thieves may have chosen to return it due to doubts about its authenticity. It nevertheless remains on exhibit.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

A similar fate befell the painting the museum bought with the money it received from its insurers. A group of 20 of them paid out nearly $2 million to settle the claim; they in turn posted a $50,000 reward for the return of the paintings, which under the terms of the insurance policies they legally owned as a result of paying the theft claim. The museum used the money to purchase a [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], ''The Leopards'',&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; which the museum promoted as the largest Rubens exhibited in Canada. But like the Brueghel, it was later reattributed to the painter's assistants, after a [[art conservation|conservationist]] determined that its red pigments were mixed four decades after Rubens' death,&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part One: Alain Lacoursière's biographer Sylvain Larocque Dedicates Sixth Chapter to The Theft of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.|url=http://thelacoursieresociety.com/retired-quebec-art-cop-alain-lacoursiere/|newspaper=The Lacours/Cière Society|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing its value and interest to museumgoers. On the 35th anniversary of the robbery, in 2007, the museum thus returned it to storage and has never put it on display again.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Even the attribution of some of the stolen work has been called into question. When the de Heems were being prepared for their inclusion in ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a Parisian [[art history|art historian]] the museum contacted suggested that they were in fact the work of another [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch master]], [[Evert Collier]]. The Rembrandt landscape, while indeed signed and dated by the artist, is one that both he and his students frequently returned to as a subject, and some historians are not entirely confident the painting was his even with the signature. The Gainsborough portrait, too, may in fact be the work of [[Joshua Reynolds]], Gainsborough's rival, since its subject, Thomas Fletcher, is shown wearing a [[Madras]] regimental uniform, which he only started wearing in 1771, three years before his portrait was painted by Reynolds.&lt;ref name="Sezgin site page 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part VIII: The theft today |url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-viii-theft-today.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the theft, a [[Radio-Canada]] story reported that the insurance companies now considered the paintings' value to have appreciated to $20 million.&lt;ref name="Le crime parfait"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lester|first=Normand|title=Le crime parfait|url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sante/criminalite_justice/clips/5010/|newspaper=[[Radio-Canada]]|language=French|date=September 1, 1992|accessdate=August 29, 2017|quote=Vingt ans plus tard, le journaliste Normand Lester révèle les intentions des compagnies d'assurances de relancer l'enquête pour retrouver les toiles volées. Pour y arriver, elles promettent une récompense de 100 000 $ et plus ... Actuellement, les toiles sont évaluées à plus de 12 millions de dollars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had consequently increased the reward offer to $100,000. On behalf of the Montreal police, Lacoursière, who began investigating art crime in 1994, offered an additional million in 1999. No one has yet come forward to claim these rewards.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière has had some promising leads over the years that have yielded nothing. He has been told that the paintings, or some of them, are in Italy, and that two Montreal men in the French city of [[Nice]] were possible suspects. One heroin addict he interviewed in [[Vancouver]] seemed to have inside information about the robbery, but everything he knew had been previously reported in the media; when he was asked about two details that police have withheld since only the actual robbers would know them, he was unable to do so.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==="Smith"===

One lead, however, has not been so easy for Lacoursière to dismiss. In 1998, a dealer he had gotten to know introduced him to a man who has been identified publicly only by the [[pseudonym]] "Smith". Smith told the detective he, too, had been a student at the [[École des beaux-arts de Montréal|École des beaux-arts]] at the time of the theft, explaining to him the tension between the students and museum staff.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

In the course of their initial conversation, Lacoursière quickly came to believe Smith knew a great deal about the robbery, perhaps more than the police did. Although Smith said he had not been one of the five students kept under surveillance afterward, he told the detective that the rope used by the thieves to enter from the skylight was not gray as had been reported at the time, but yellow like the ones used at the school building. However, upon reviewing the original file and talking with one of the original investigators, Lacoursière found that any information on the colour of the rope had been deliberately withheld by police in order to confirm any later confessions or statements by possible suspects. He considered Smith's statements "highly suspicious".&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière investigated Smith's background, and found that a year after finishing his five-year course at the school, Smith had spent a quarter of a million dollars to buy himself a house and a local [[woodworking]] company. Lacoursière could not determine how Smith might have acquired that amount of money at such a relatively young age. He implied in 2010 it might have been from selling the stolen work.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

According to Lacoursière, Smith even told him that he would at some point in the future tell him something about the robbery. In 2007, during the filming of "L'Colombe d'art" ("The Colombo of Art"), a Radio-Canada special on his career as an art-theft detective, Lacoursière visited Smith and offered him the million-dollar cheque on camera. Smith, however, simply laughed, and invited the camera crew into his house so they could see for themselves that he had none of the stolen paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

In 2010, Quebec journalist Sylvain Larocque interviewed Smith by telephone. While he again denied any role in the theft himself, he claimed that professors and porters at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], which the École des beaux-arts had been merged into in 1969, were behind the robbery. They were possibly, he claimed, the same people behind a robbery at the university a few weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post" /&gt;

The following year Lacoursière received a link to a video in email from Smith, possibly intended to tease the detective, who by then had retired.&lt;ref name="ARCA video blog post 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part One: Suspected art thief uses the Internet to tease retired art crime investigator Alain Lacoursière about the location of the paintings stolen from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 1972|url=https://art-crime.blogspot.com/2011/05/suspected-art-thief-uses-internet-to.html|newspaper=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art|ARCA]] blog|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[Mercedes-Benz]] advertisement from [[Hong Kong]] in which [[bank robbery|bank robbers]] steal a briefcase from a bank vault, then escape in a Mercedes. They elude capture but leave the briefcase behind; inside is a long-lost stolen [[Da Vinci]] painting.&lt;ref name="ARCA video blog post 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part Two: Alain Lacoursière, the Mercedes-Benz Commercial Video, and Madonna and the Yarnwinder|url=http://art-crime.blogspot.com/2011/05/part-two-alain-lacoursiere-mercedes.html|newspaper=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art|ARCA]] blog|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of the paintings' current whereabouts==

The robbery is now largely forgotten, except by the insurance companies and police, who continue to search. "Like a death in the family, you have to let it drop," Bantey says.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; However, in 2009, Paul Lavallée, the museum's director at the time, said it continues to affect the museum, since it might not be able to reclaim the works even if they were recovered. "[W]e would be strapped for funds," he said, even if the insurer offered them to the museum at a discount.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It is possible the paintings may have been destroyed to prevent them from being used as evidence against those in possession of them. But Lacoursière believes they were likely sold through smaller dealers who may not have known they were stolen, or cared if they did, to collectors who likewise keep them private, especially today, since they cannot sell them. He also notes that [[organized crime|criminal organizations]] have found stolen art useful in other ways. During the 1994–2002 [[Quebec Biker war]], he recalls, he learned that one member of the Montreal-area [[Hell's Angels]] served as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] for art thieves, selling stolen art to the [[Italian Mafia]] at 10 percent of its price, who in turn used the names of dead residents of the affluent suburb of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]] on faked [[provenance]] forms.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

While it is not believed likely that the original robbers were affiliated with organized crime, the ransom attempts may point in that direction. The [[Port of Montreal]] envelope in which the snapshots of the stolen art was sent may suggest the involvement of the [[West End Gang]], an Irish-dominated group that is one of Canada's oldest and strongest criminal organizations, which has historically been based in the city's port. Bantey, however, doubts this based on his familiarity with the city's criminal element from his journalism days. "[They] were interested in prostitution and drugs" exclusively at the time, he says, and no one involved would have had the expertise required to pull off the robbery. Nor does he believe the thieves were motivated by separatism or any other political cause, just a desire to enrich themselves.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Despite some suggestions the paintings, assuming they still exist, are still in Montreal, or elsewhere in Canada or the U.S. or Europe, the investigators who will discuss this believe the art has been moved to [[Latin America]]. Lacoursière notes that many of the West End Gang often spend their winters in, and retire to, [[Costa Rica]]. [[Public Forces of Costa Rica|Police there]] have not responded to requests for assistance from their counterparts in Montreal. Bantey believes the paintings are in [[South America]] somewhere. "I've heard several people I respect say that."&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The police files on the robbery remain closed to public inspection as the case is still considered open.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2662">'''Akka bakka bonka rakka''' is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[nursery rhyme]] of mostly nonsense words used to select or point out a participant in children's games, such as who will be "it" in a game like [[hide-and-seek]] ({{lang-no|gjemsel}}) or [[Tag (game)|tag]] ({{lang-no|sisten}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berulfsen |first1=Bjarne |title=Ordet går videre: Nye kåserier om ordenes liv |date=1969 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=Oslo |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Svensen |first1=Åsfrid |title=Tekstens mønstre: innføring i litterær analyse |date=1985 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is classified as a [[Counting-out game|counting rhyme]] in Nora Kobberstad's ''Norsk Lekebok'' (Book of Norwegian Games) from 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hagemann |first1=Sonja |title=Barnelitteratur i Norge 1850–1914 |date=1970 |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |pages=269-270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different versions of the rhyme. The following version was recorded in [[Elverum]] in the early 1920s by [[Sigurd Nergaard]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nergaard |first1=Sigurd |title=Eventyr, barnevers, spurningar og ordspraak.

:''Akka bakka,''
:''banka ranka,''
:''etla metla, sang dang,''
:''fil i fang, isa, bisa, topp!''

In 1936, it was included in a collection of children's rhymes published by [[Rikka Deinboll]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deinboll |first1=Rikka |title=Barnerim og barneregler |date=1936 |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Albino''''' (also known as '''''The Night of the Askari''''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=67656&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Death in the Sun'''''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioffer.com/i/albino-christopher-lee-178645961&lt;/ref&gt; and '''''Whispering Death''''') is a 1976 [[Germany|German]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] directed by [[Jürgen Goslar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ALBINO:  Directed by Jürgen Goslar, 1976|url=http://www.albinism.org/popcult/film.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and starring [[Christopher Lee]], [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] and [[Sybil Danning]] filmed on location during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. The film is based on the novel ''The Whispering Death'' by [[Daniel Carney]].

==Plot==
Terrick ([[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]]), a [[British South Africa Police]] officer in rural [[Rhodesia]], looks forward towards the end of his police service and early retirement to his farm with his fiancée, Sally ([[Sybil Danning]]). Terrick's hopes for a peaceful life with Sally are shattered, however, when black nationalist guerrillas attack the farm. Sally is raped and murdered by the guerrilla leader, an [[albino]] known only by the moniker ''"Whispering Death"'' ([[Horst Frank]]). Consumed by grief, Terrick and his farmworkers, led by Katchemu ([[Sam Williams (actor)|Sam Williams]]) set out to avenge Sally on their own. They subsequently learn that the guerrillas have summoned the local villagers to a meeting to politicize them and lay an ambush for "Whispering Death" there. However Terrick's party opens fire prematurely, killing and injuring some of the civilians present. The Rhodesian government demands that Terrick's police superior, Bill ([[Christopher Lee]]) hold him accountable for his recklessness and bring him to justice. From its perspective he has endangered the war effort by inflaming the relationship between the security forces and the locals through his irresponsible actions. Bill obligingly orders a manhunt for Terrick, but most of the policemen sympathize with their onetime colleague and are demoralized by the fact they are being ordered to pursue him instead of the guerrillas. They abandon the manhunt and return to their homes. Due to the apparent unwillingness of the police to apprehend Terrick, a crack army unit is called in to assist with the manhunt. 

"Whispering Death" and his guerrillas decide to flee across the border to their sanctuaries in a neighbouring country. However, Terrick and Katchemu, who is an expert tracker, are hot on their trail. The duo become increasingly desperate, with Katchemu torturing a captured guerrilla for information. During a series of bloody skirmishes, Katchemu and nearly all the guerrillas are killed, leaving only Terrick and "Whispering Death" to face each other. Terrick gains the upper hand and stabs his opponent to death. The next morning, pursuing Rhodesian troops finally catch up to Terrick, but he is no longer coherent, having lost his mind as a result of the collective trauma he endured. When he threatens the soldiers with his rifle, they shoot him dead.

==Reception==
Film scholars Mark Miller and Tom Johnson described ''Albino'' as "a nasty, repugnant tale of racial hatred and revenge", criticizing the "exploitative" treatment which contemporary Rhodesian sociopolitical issues received.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Mark|last2=Johnson|first2=Tom|title=The Christopher Lee Filmography: All Theatrical Releases, 1948–2003|date=1997|pages=281-282|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Incorporated|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0786446919}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also praised Lee and Faulkner's performances.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

'''Aud Egede-Nissen''' (30 May 1893 – 15 November 1974) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] actress, director and producer. She  appeared in many early 20th-century German silent films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-aud-egede-nissen-gerd-egede-nissen-and-ada-egede-nissen/|title=Aud Egede-Nissen|work=Women Film Pioneers Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography in brief==
Born in [[Bergen, Norway]] in 1893, Egede-Nissen was a daughter of Norwegian postmaster and politician [[Adam Egede-Nissen|Adam Hjalmar Egede-Nissen]] (1868–1953) and his wife Georga "Goggi" Wilhelma Ellertsen (1871–1959); she had ten siblings.
Four younger sisters and two younger brothers all became actors as well: [[Gerd Grieg]] (1895–1988), [[Ada Kramm]] (1899–1981), Oscar Egede-Nissen (1903–1976), Stig Egede-Nissen (1907–1988), Lill Egede-Nissen (1909–1962) and [[Gøril Havrevold]] (1914–1992).

==German film career==
Aud made her acting debut on the Norwegian stage in 1911, appearing next in Norwegian director [[Bjørn Bjørnson]]'s 1913 film ''Scenens børn''. In 1913 she moved to Denmark and started working for Dania Biofilm Kompagni in Copenhagen. In 1914, Bjørn Bjørnson invited her to Berlin, where there were opportunities in the rapidly expanding film industry. In 1916, she appeared in [[Otto Rippert]]'s six-part [[sci-fi]] [[Movie serial|serial]] ''[[Homunculus (film)|Homunculus]]''. Also that year, she starred as the character "[[Christine Daaé]]" in a German adaptation, directed by [[Ernst Matray]], of [[Gaston Leroux]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' opposite Swedish actor [[Nils Olaf Chrisander]].
&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url =https://snl.no/Aud_Richter|title=Aud Richter|publisher = Store norske leksikon |accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 Aud Egede-Nissen was not contented with being an actor in other companies' films in Berlin. In partnership with her husband Georg Alexander, she started the Egede-Nissen Film Co. (''Egede-Nissen Filmbyrå'') where she was the artistic and financial manager. Alexander directed most of their films, while Aud Egede-Nissen and her sisters Ada Kramm and Gerd Grieg usually played the female lead roles. Production notes suggest that these were mainly [[melodrama]]s in [[Serial film|serial form]] or [[Crime film|detective films]]. In the two years between 1917 and 1919 her film company produced at least 29 films. Harder times and centralization in the German film industry after [[World War I]] ultimately contributed to the closing of Egede-Nissen's film company at the beginning of the 1920s. In 1920, she starred in two films directed by Ernst Lubitsch.

|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period before 1931 she acted in over 80 films and directed 18 more, having worked with many noted directors of early German cinema, including [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[F. W. Murnau|Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau]], [[Karl Grune]], and [[Gerhard Lamprecht]]. She had major roles in movies of 1922 including Fritz Lang's ''[[Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler]]'' and F. W. Murnau's ''[[Phantom (1922 film)|Phantom]]''. Paul Richter, who was to become her second husband, also had a role in ''Dr. Mabuse''. In 1924, the year Aud married him, he ascended to superstar status, taking the lead role of [[Sigurd|King Siegfried]] in Lang's ''[[Die Nibelungen]].'' Along with Paul Richter, Aud also played in the 1928  Norwegian-German co-production ''[[Snowshoe Bandits]]''  (German:''Schneeschuhbanditen'') and based on a crime novel by [[Nils Lie]] and [[Nordahl Grieg]]. Egede-Nissen's German film career came to an end shortly after the advent of [[sound film]]s, though she did return to Norway to make two films there in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="nbl"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Egede-Nissen was twice married to actors. In 1915 she married the German actor [[Georg Alexander]] (1888–1945), by whom she had her son Georg Richter (1915–1972); in 1924 they divorced, and from 1924 to 1931 she was married to the Austrian actor [[Paul Richter]] (1895–1961). Upon their marriage, Richter adopted her nine-year-old son [[Georg Richter]] who became  an actor and film producer. In 1940, she was married for the third time  with Dag Havrevold (1911–94).  Together they had a son Dag Havrevold, Jr. (1938-2011). Aud Egede-Nissen died in [[Oslo, Norway]] at the age of 81.

'''''Bakwa''''' is an online magazine of literary and cultural criticism based in [[Yaoundé]], [[Cameroon]], that covers international cultural issues and has a penchant for fiction and creative non-fiction by Cameroonian writers. Notable contributors include: [[Imbolo Mbue]], [[Ntone Edjabe]], [[Anna Jäger]], [[Kangsen Feka Wakai]], [[Jeremy Klemin]], [[Serubiri Moses]], [[Minna Salami]], [[Jack Little (editor)|Jack Little]], [[Emmanuel Iduma]], [[Bwesigye bwa Mwesigire]] and [[Johnnie MacViban]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bakwa official website|title=About|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://bakwamagazine.com/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Bwesigye bwa Mwesigire]]|title=Made in Africa III: The rise of African literary digital platforms|work=[[This Is Africa]]|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://thisisafrica.me/lifestyle/made-in-africa-iii-the-rise-of-african-literary-digital-platforms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bakwa'' has been described as "an eclectic, intelligent take on the dynamic cultural scenes often missed by mainstream, western media".&lt;ref&gt;Dele Maiji Fatunla, [http://whatsonafrica.org/three-african-and-african-diasporan-literary-magazines-that-everyone-should-know/ "Three African and African Diasporan Literary Magazines the Everyone Should Know"], What's On Africa, Royal African Society, 30 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded during the last quarter of 2011 (but operational as from 2012) by [[Dzekashu MacViban]], ''Bakwa'' rose out of the need to fill the lacuna created by the absence of literary and cultural magazines in Cameroon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Guardian Africa Network]]|title=Introducing the Guardian Africa network's new partners|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=2 July 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/introducing-guardian-africa-network-new-partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the defunct ''Pala Pala'' magazine, and it highlights a new dynamic Africa, often ignored by Western traditional media.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Over the years, ''Bakwa'' has been able to establish alliances with important publications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' (Guardian Africa Network),  ''[[Chimurenga magazine]]'', ''[[Kwani?]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lindsay|title=Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi Wins the Kwani?

== Notable projects==
For its third issue, in 2012, ''Bakwa'' collaborated with The Ofi Press, an online literary magazine based in Mexico and edited by [[Jack Little (editor)|Jack Little]]. The Ofi Press published a special West African edition, with content in English and Spanish, which focused on West Africa, while ''Bakwa'', in turn, published a special Mexican issue, focusing on Mexican art, culture and society, with most of the content in English and some Spanish translations. The project was lauded by several journals and outlets, especially the online website Heritage 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Heritage 1960]]|title=The Ofi Press: Inside "THE WEST AFRICA EDITION" (Issue #24)|date=2013|accessdate=5 July 2015|url=http://heritage1960.tumblr.com/post/38962666585/the-ofi-press-inside-the-west-africa-edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''Bakwa'' was part of #100DaysofAfricanReads, a social media project curated by [[Angela Wachuka]], Executive Director of ''[[Kwani?]]'', which entailed "a series of portraits on books, writers and readers, over a 100 day period ... highlighting the work of an African author in print and online".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Bookshy|title=African Reads: 100 Days of Appreciation|date=5 February 2015|accessdate=6 July 2015|url=http://bookshybooks.blogspot.com/2015/02/african-reads-100-days-of-appreciation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of an excerpt from [[Awes Osman]]’s novel, ''[[Skinless Goat in Somalia]]'', Bakwa’s contribution to the project was made up of excerpts and stories from female Cameroonian writers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In the same year, in response to ''[[The Simpsons]]''’ episode "[[The Princess Guide]]", ''Bakwa'' did a two-part series on The Simpsons, wherein, bloggers, writers, cultural thinkers and academics were asked to comment on "The Princess Guide" episode. Most of the reactions highlighted poor research, one-dimensional characters, the challenge of portraying believable Nigerians, and the episode’s relatable character, [[Princess Kemi]]. This project on ''The Simpsons'' was later chosen by [[Dead Homer Society]], for the "weekend reading" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Charlie Sweatpants|title=A Little Weekend Reading|work=Dead Homer Society|date=11 April 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015|url=http://deadhomersociety.com/2015/04/11/a-little-weekend-reading/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, thanks to a partnership with [[Goethe-Institut Kamerun]] and [[Phoneme Media]], Bakwa launched a one-off short story competition open to Cameroonians under 39 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Bakwa Magazine]]|title=Bakwa Magazine Short Story Competition |date=4 May 2016|accessdate=15 August 2016|url=https://bakwamagazine.com/2016/05/04/bakwa-magazine-short-story-competition}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a Literary Exchange Programme in 2017, between Cameroonain and Nigerian writers, in partnership with [[Saraba Magazine]] and the Goethe-Institut in Cameroon and Nigeria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Banhua''' (Chinese: [[wikt:版|版]][[wikt:画|画]]) is the Chinese umbrella term for any [[printmaking|printed]] art objects, and especially for those made by [[woodblock printing]], the term used for [[woodcut]]s from Asia.

==History==

The direct translation of 'Banhua' is 'printed picture', it is a general term for original prints or printmaking as an art form. 'Banhua' is composed of two characters: 'ban' (Chinese: 版) meaning 'block' and 'hua' (Chinese: 画)meaning 'picture'. Banhua's meaning does not limited in prints in Chinese style.

As [[printing]] first appeared in 3rd century China, artists started to use [[woodblock printing]] or other methods to spread their works. Buddhist classics, novel illustrations, and the [[banknote]] were among the first public works to be printed in China.

From the 17th century, prints of [[New Year picture]]s became popular.

'''Catharsis''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:κάθαρσις|κάθαρσις]]}} {{transl|el|''katharsis''}} meaning "purification" or "cleansing") is the purification and purgation of emotions—particularly pity and fear—through art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA217 |title=catharsis |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2XgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= | last = Berndtson | first = Arthur | title = Art, Expression, and Beauty | publisher = Krieger | year = 1975 | page = 235|isbn=9780882752174 | quote=The theory of catharsis has a disarming affinity with the expressional theory, since it emphasizes emotion, asserts a change in emotion as a result of aesthetic operations, and concludes on a note of freedom in relation to the emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvZYaJmH6LcC&amp;dq= | title=Looking for an Argument: Critical Encounters with the New Approaches to the Criticism of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries | first=Richard | last=Levin |year=2003 | page=42 | quote=Catharsis in Shakespearean tragedy involves ... some kind of restoration of order and a renewal or enhancement of our positive feelings for the hero.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a metaphor originally used by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]],'' comparing the effects of [[tragedy]] on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a [[cathartic]] on the body.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b 1449b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99492/catharsis |title=catharsis (criticism) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic uses==
Catharsis is a term in [[drama|dramatic art]] that describes the effect of tragedy (or [[comedy]] and quite possibly other artistic forms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Catharsis in Healing, Ritual, and Drama | first=Thomas J. | last = Scheff | authorlink=Thomas J. Scheff | isbn=0-595-15237-6|publisher=University of California Press | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally on the audience (although some have speculated on characters in the drama as well). Nowhere does [[Aristotle]] explain the meaning of "catharsis" as he is using that term in the definition of tragedy in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449b21-28). G.&amp;nbsp;F. Else argues that traditional, widely held interpretations of catharsis as "purification" or "purgation" have no basis in the text of the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', but are derived from the use of catharsis in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Catharsis | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | first = Leon | last = Golden | volume = 93 | pages = 51–60 | jstor = 283751 | doi = 10.2307/283751}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of this term have arisen. The term is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[anagnorisis]].

D.&amp;nbsp;W. Lucas, in an authoritative edition of the ''Poetics'', comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of the term in an Appendix devoted to "Pity, Fear, and Katharsis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle: Poetics|last=Lucas|first=D. W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0198140245|pages=276–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas recognizes the possibility of catharsis bearing some aspect of the meaning of "purification, purgation, and 'intellectual clarification'" although his discussion of these terms is not always, or perhaps often, in the precise form with which other influential scholars have treated them. Lucas himself does not accept any one of these interpretations as his own but adopts a rather different one based on "the Greek doctrine of Humours" which has not received wide subsequent acceptance. Purgation and purification, used in previous centuries, as the common interpretations of catharsis are still in wide use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catharsis in Psychotherapy | first1=Michael P. | last1=Nichols | first2=Melvin | last2=Zax |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, New York|year=1977|isbn=978-0470990643}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the twentieth century, the interpretation of catharsis as "intellectual clarification" has arisen as a rival to the older views in describing the effect of catharsis on members of the audience.

===Purgation and purification===
In his works prior to the ''Poetics,'' Aristotle had used the term ''catharsis'' purely in its medical sense (usually referring to the evacuation of the ''katamenia''—the [[menstrual]] fluid or other reproductive material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Belifiore | first = Elizabeth S. | title = Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion | page = 300 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, however, he employs it as a medical [[metaphor]].
[[F. L. Lucas]] maintains, therefore, that ''purification'' and ''cleansing'' are not proper translations for ''catharsis''; that it should rather be rendered as ''[[Purgatory|purgation]]''. "It is the human soul that is purged of its excessive passions."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald F. Else made the following argument against the "purgation" theory: "It presupposes that we come to the tragic drama (unconsciously, if you will) as patients to be cured, relieved, restored to psychic health. But there is not a word to support this in the "Poetics", not a hint that the end of drama is to cure or alleviate pathological states. On the contrary it is evident in every line of the work that Aristotle is presupposing 'normal' auditors, normal states of mind and feeling, normal emotional and aesthetic experience."&lt;ref&gt;Else, Gerald F. ''Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument'', p. 440. Cambridge, Massachusetts (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] sidesteps the medical attribution. He translates ''catharsis'' as a purification, an experience that brings pity and fear into their proper balance: "In real life", he explained, "men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;23. Hogarth, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
Tragedy is then a corrective; through watching tragedy, the audience learns how to feel these emotions at proper levels.

===Intellectual clarification===
In the twentieth century a paradigm shift took place in the interpretation of catharsis with a number of scholars contributing to the argument in support of the intellectual clarification concept.&lt;ref&gt;The following works can be usefully consulted in this regard: L. Golden, "Aristotle on Tragic and Comic Mimesis," Atlanta, 1992; S. Halliwell, "Aristotle's Poetics," London, 1986; D. Keesey, "On Some Recent Interpretations of Catharsis, "The Classical World", (1979) 72.4, 193–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The clarification theory of catharsis would be fully consistent, as other interpretations are not, with Aristotle's argument in chapter 4 of the ''Poetics'' (1448b4-17) that the essential pleasure of [[mimesis]] is the intellectual pleasure of "learning and inference".

It is generally understood that Aristotle's theory of mimesis and catharsis are responses to [[Plato]]'s negative view of artistic mimesis on an audience. Plato argued that the most common forms of artistic mimesis were designed to evoke from an audience powerful emotions such as pity, fear, and ridicule which override the rational control that defines the highest level of our humanity and lead us to wallow unacceptably in the overindulgence of emotion and passion. Aristotle's concept of catharsis, in all of the major senses attributed to it, contradicts Plato's view by providing a mechanism that generates the rational control of irrational emotions. All of the commonly held interpretations of catharsis, purgation, purification, and clarification are considered by most scholars to represent a homeopathic process in which pity and fear accomplish the catharsis of emotions like themselves. For an alternate view of catharsis as an [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] process in which pity and fear produce a catharsis of emotions unlike pity and fear, see E. Belfiore, ''Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion.'' Princeton, 1992, 260 ff.

===Literary analysis of catharsis===
The following analysis by [[E. R. Dodds]], directed at the character of [[Oedipus]] in the paradigmatic Aristotelian tragedy, ''[[Oedipus Rex]],'' incorporates all three of the aforementioned interpretations of catharsis: purgation, purification, intellectual clarification:{{quote|...what fascinates us is the spectacle of a man freely choosing, from the highest motives a series of actions which lead to his own ruin. Oedipus might have left the plague to take its course; but pity for the sufferings of his people compelled him to consult Delphi. When Apollo's word came back, he might still have left the murder of Laius uninvestigated; but piety and justice required him to act. He need not have forced the truth from the reluctant Theban herdsman; but because he cannot rest content with a lie, he must tear away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived so long. Teiresias, Jocasta, the herdsman, each in turn tries to stop him, but in vain; he must read the last riddle, the riddle of his own life. The immediate cause of Oedipus' ruin is not "fate or "the gods"—no oracle said that he must discover the truth—and still less does it lie in his own weakness; what causes his ruin is his own strength and courage, his loyalty to Thebes, and his loyalty to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=E. R. | last=Dodds | authorlink=E. R. Dodds | title=On Misunderstanding the 'Oedipus Rex' | journal=Greece and Rome |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1966 |pages=37–49 |jstor=642354 | doi=10.1017/s0017383500016144}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attempts to subvert catharsis===
There have been, for political or aesthetic reasons, deliberate attempts made to subvert the effect of catharsis in theatre.
For example, [[Bertolt Brecht]] viewed catharsis as a pap (pabulum) for the [[bourgeois]] theatre audience, and designed dramas which left significant emotions unresolved, intending to force social action upon the audience. Brecht then identified the concept of catharsis with the notion of identification of the spectator, meaning a complete adhesion of the viewer to the dramatic actions and characters. Brecht reasoned that the absence of a cathartic resolution would require the audience to take political action in the real world, in order to fill the emotional gap they had experienced vicariously. This technique can be seen as early as his [[agit-prop]] play ''[[The Measures Taken]],'' and is mostly the source of his invention of an ''epic theatre'', based on a [[distancing effect]] (Verfremdungseffekt) between the viewer and the representation or portrayal of characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertold]], "La dramaturgie non aristotélicienne", ''Théâtre épique, théâtre dialectique'', éd. Jean-Marie Valentin, Paris, Éditions de L'Arche, 1999, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=="Catharsis" before tragedy==
Catharsis before the sixth-century rise of tragedy is, for the [[Western World]], essentially a historical footnote to the Aristotelian conception. The practice of [[Ritual purification|purification]] had not yet appeared in [[Homer]], as later Greek commentators noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter | last = Burkert | authorlink = Walter Burkert | year = 1992 | title = The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age | page = 56 | publisher = Harvard University Press | ref=harv}} This sub-section depends largely on Burkert.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Aithiopis]]'', an [[epic (poetry)|epic]] set in the [[Epic Cycle|Trojan War cycle]], narrates the purification of [[Achilles]] after his murder of [[Thersites]]. Catharsis describes the result of measures taken to cleanse away blood-guilt—"blood is purified through blood",{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=56}} a process in the development of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture in which the [[Delphi|oracle of Delphi]] took a prominent role. The classic example—[[Orestes]]—belongs to tragedy, but the procedure given by [[Aeschylus]] is ancient: the blood of a sacrificed piglet is allowed to wash over the blood-polluted man, and running water washes away the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert notes parallels with a bilingual [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ritual text: "the knowledgeable specialist, the sacrificial piglet, slaughter, contact with blood, and the subsequent cleansing with water" {{harvtxt|Burkert|1992|page=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identical ritual is represented, Burkert informs us, on a ''[[krater]]'' found at Canicattini, wherein it is shown being employed to cure the daughters of [[Proetus]] from their madness, caused by some ritual transgression.{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}} To the question of whether the ritual obtains [[atonement (penal substitution view)|atonement]] for the subject, or just [[healing]], Burkert answers: "To raise the question is to see the irrelevance of this distinction".{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}}

==Therapeutic uses==&lt;!-- 'Cathartic method' redirects here --&gt;
In [[psychology]], the term was first employed by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s colleague [[Josef Breuer]] (1842–1925), who developed a '''cathartic method'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of treatment using [[hypnosis]] for persons suffering from intensive [[hysteria]]. While under hypnosis, Breuer's patients were able to recall [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] experiences, and through the process of expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten, they were relieved of their hysteric symptoms. Catharsis was also central to Freud's concept of [[psychoanalysis]], but he replaced hypnosis with [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Strickland | editor-first=Bonnie | editor-link=Bonnie Strickland | title=Catharsis | publisher=Gale | year=2001 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[cathexis|catharsis]]'' has also been adopted by modern [[psychotherapy]], particularly Freudian psychoanalysis, to describe the act of expressing, or more accurately, ''experiencing'' the deep emotions often associated with events in the individual's past which had originally been repressed or ignored, and had never been adequately addressed or experienced.

There has been much debate about the use of catharsis in the reduction of anger. Some scholars believe that "blowing off steam" may reduce physiological stress in the short term, but this reduction may act as a reward mechanism, reinforcing the behavior and promoting future outbursts.&lt;ref name="Bushman1999"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.367 | title = Catharsis, aggression, and persuasive influence: self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | date = March 1999 | first = B.

== Social catharsis ==
Emotional situations can elicit physiological, behavioral, cognitive, expressive, and subjective changes in individuals. Affected individuals often use social sharing as a cathartic release of emotions. Bernard Rimé studies the patterns of social sharing after emotional experiences. His works suggest that individuals seek social outlets in an attempt to modify the situation and restore personal homeostatic balance.

Rimé found that 80–95% of emotional episodes are shared. The affected individuals talk about the emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective of emotional valence, gender, education, and culture. His studies also found that social sharing of emotion increases as the intensity of the emotion increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotion Elicits the Social Sharing of Emotion: Theory and Empirical Review|journal = Emotion Review|year=2009|issn = 1754-0739|pages = 60–85|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1754073908097189|first = Bernard|last = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===
[[Émile Durkheim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology | last = Durkheim | first = Émile |url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | translator-first = Joseph Ward | translator-last = Swain | year = 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed emotional stages of social sharing:
# Directly after emotional effects, the emotions are shared. Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
# This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
# Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence.

=== Motives ===
Affect scientists have found differences in motives for social sharing of positive and negative emotions.

'''(1) Positive emotion'''

A study by Langston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capitalizing on and coping with daily-life events: Expressive responses to positive events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1112–1125|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1112|first = Christopher A.|last = Langston}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals share positive events to capitalize on the positive emotions they elicit. Reminiscing the positive experience augments positive affects like temporary mood and longer-term well-being. A study by Gable et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do You Do When Things Go Right? The Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Benefits of Sharing Positive Events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 228–245|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228|first = Shelly L.|last = Gable|first2 = Harry T.|last2 = Reis|first3 = Emily A.|last3 = Impett|first4 = Evan R.|last4 = Asher|pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Langston's "capitalization" theory by demonstrating that relationship quality is enhanced when partners are responsive to positive recollections. The responsiveness increased levels of intimacy and satisfaction within the relationship. In general, the motives behind social sharing of positive events are to recall the positive emotions, inform others, and gain attention from others. All three motives are representatives of capitalization.

'''(2) Negative emotion'''

Rimé studies suggest that the motives behind social sharing of negative emotions are to vent, understand, bond, and gain social support. Negatively affected individuals often seek life meaning and emotional support to combat feelings of loneliness after a tragic event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The grapevine effect ===
If emotions are shared socially and elicits emotion in the listener then the listener will likely share what they heard with other people. Rimé calls this process "secondary social sharing". If this repeats, it is then called "tertiary social sharing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collective catharsis ===
Collective emotional events share similar responses. When communities are affected by an emotional event, members repetitively share emotional experiences. After the 2001 New York and the 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, more than 80% of respondents shared their emotional experience with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social sharing of emotion, post-traumatic growth, and emotional climate: Follow-up of Spanish citizen's response to the collective trauma of March 11th terrorist attacks in Madrid| journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| year=2009|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 1029–1045|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.700|first = Bernard|last = Rimé|first2 = Darío|last2 = Páez|first3 = Nekane|last3 = Basabe|first4 = Francisco|last4 = Martínez}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rimé, every sharing round elicits emotional reactivation in the sender and the receiver. This then reactivates the need to share in both. Social sharing throughout the community leads to high amounts of emotional recollection and "emotional overheating".

Pennebaker and Harber&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Social Stage Model of Collective Coping: The Loma Prieta Earthquake and The Persian Gulf War|journal = Journal of Social Issues | year = 1993 |issn = 1540-4560|pages = 125–145|volume = 49|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01184.x|first = James W.|last = Pennebaker|first2 = Kent D.|last2 = Harber}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined three stages of collective responses to emotional events.

In the first stage, a state of "emergency" takes place in the first month after the emotional event. In this stage, there is an abundance of thoughts, talks, media coverage, and social integration based on the event.

In the second stage, the "plateau" occurs in the second month. Abundant thoughts remain, but the amount of talks, media coverage, and social integration decreases.

In the third stage, the "extinction" occurs after the second month. There is a return to normalcy.

=== Effect on emotional recovery ===
This cathartic release of emotions is often believed to be therapeutic for affected individuals. Many therapeutic mechanisms have been seen to aid in emotional recovery. One example is "interpersonal emotion regulation", in which listeners help to modify the affected individual's affective state by using certain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Regulation of Emotion: An Integrative, Cross-Disciplinary Model|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=20|issue=1|pages=47–63|year=2016|issn = 1879-307X|pmid = 26564248|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.09.003|first = Crystal|last = Reeck|first2 = Daniel R.|last2 = Ames|first3 = Kevin N.|last3 = Ochsner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive writing is another common mechanism for catharsis. Joanne Frattaroli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 823–865|volume = 132|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.823|first = Joanne|last = Frattaroli}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a meta-analysis suggesting that written disclosure of information, thoughts, and feelings enhances mental health.

However, other studies question the benefits of social catharsis. Finkenauer and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Flashbulb memories and the underlying mechanisms of their formation: Toward an emotional-integrative model|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1998|issn = 0090-502X|pages = 516–531|volume = 26|issue = 3|doi = 10.3758/BF03201160|first = Catrin|last = Finkenauer|first2 = Olivier|last2 = Luminet|first3 = Lydia|last3 = Gisle|first4 = Abdessadek|last4 = El-Ahmadi|first5 = Martial Van Der|last5 = Linden|first6 = Pierre|last6 = Philippot|pmid=9610122}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that non-shared memories were no more emotionally triggering than shared ones. Other studies have also failed to prove that social catharsis leads to any degree of emotional recovery. Zech and Rimé&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is talking about an emotional experience helpful? effects on emotional recovery and perceived benefits|journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|year = 2005|issn = 1099-0879|pages = 270–287|volume = 12|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/cpp.460|first = Emmanuelle|last = Zech|first2 = Bernard|last2 = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked participants to recall and share a negative experience with an experimenter. When compared with the control group that only discussed unemotional topics, there was no correlation between emotional sharing and emotional recovery.

Some studies even found adverse effects of social catharsis. Contrary to the Frattaroli study, Sbarra and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Expressive Writing Can Impede Emotional Recovery Following Marital Separation|url = http://cpx.sagepub.com/content/1/2/120|journal = Clinical Psychological Science|year = 2013|issn = 2167-7026|pmc = 4297672|pmid = 25606351|pages = 120–134|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/2167702612469801|first = David A.|last = Sbarra|first2 = Adriel|last2 = Boals|first3 = Ashley E.|last3 = Mason|first4 = Grace M.|last4 = Larson|first5 = Matthias R.|last5 = Mehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found expressive writing to greatly impede emotional recovery following a marital separation. Similar findings have been published regarding trauma recovery. A group intervention technique is often used on disaster victims to prevent trauma-related disorders. However, meta-analysis showed negative effects of this cathartic "therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single session debriefing after psychological trauma: a meta-analysis|journal = Lancet|year = 2002|issn = 0140-6736|pmid = 12241834|pages = 766–771|volume = 360|issue = 9335|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09897-5|first = Arnold A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3936">'''Civic Trust Awards''' is a [[Community Interest Company]] founded in June 2009 following the closure of the [[Civic Voice|Civic Trust]] charity earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civic Trust in administration|url=http://www.landscape.co.uk/news/601|work=Landscape Design Trust|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civic Trust Awards continued the annual awards scheme independently.

==History==
The Civic Trust Awards were originally established in 1959 by Michael Middleton CBE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civic Trust Awards|url=http://www.civictrustawards.org.uk/the-award/level-of-awards/|work=Civic Trust Awards|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Civic Trust to recognise outstanding architecture, urban design, landscape and public are which improve the quality of life for local communities.

After the Civic Trust went into Administration in April 2009, the Civic Trust Awards have continued as an independent scheme operating on a not-for-profit basis as a [[Community Interest Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Civic Trust Awards|url=http://www.civictrustawards.org.uk/about/|work=Civic Trust Awards|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Awards are given for buildings and schemes which were architecturally outstanding and made positive differences to their local community. Each entry is judged by a voluntary panel including an [[Architect]], Inclusive Design Advisor, a representative from the [[Local Planning Authority]] and a Local Community Representative.

==Awards==

'''Cork Street''' is a street in [[Mayfair]] in the [[West End of London]], England, with many [[contemporary art]] galleries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/cork_street_d0e.html | title=Cork Street |website=www.londontown.com|publisher= LondonTown.com | accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was previously associated with the tailoring industry. It is part of the [[Burlington Estate]], which was developed from the 18th century.

==Location==
The street runs approximately north-west from the junction of [[Burlington Arcade]] with [[Burlington Gardens]], and is close to [[Burlington House]], which houses the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. It is parallel to, and immediately to the east of, [[New Bond Street]]. The nearest [[tube station]] is [[Green Park tube station|Green Park]].

==History==
[[File:Burlington House 1698-99.jpg|thumbnail|[[Burlington House]] in the 1690s. The line of Cork Street runs away from the back of the house on the left hand side.]]

Cork Street is part of the [[Burlington Estate]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41493 Cork Street and Savile Row Area Burlington Estate Lease Tables], ''Survey of London'', volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2, pp. 546–65, 1963. ''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/ British History Online]'', [[English Heritage]].&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed from the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The first [[Earl of Burlington]] was [[Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Cork|Richard Boyle]] (1612–1698), 2nd Earl of [[Cork (city)|Cork]]; the street is named for that city.

The street in particular and the area in general was associated with tailors. In particular, the leading  [[Regency London]] tailors [[Schweitzer and Davidson]] were located in Cork Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Between a Gentleman and His Tailor | url=http://www.georgianindex.net/tailors/tailor.html | website=www.georgianindex.net| publisher= The Georgian Index| accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840), who introduced the flamboyant form of gentleman's fashion that became known as [[dandyism]], patronised Schweitzer and Davidson in Cork Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The life of George Brummell, esq., commonly called Beau Brummell | volume=
Volume 1 | first=William | last=Jesse | publisher=[[Saunders and Otley]] | year=1844 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fu4LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA64 | page=64  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Savile Row]], not far from Cork Street to the east, is now the street most associated with high-quality gentleman's tailors today.

In the early 20th century, the street became associated with the art world. Cork Street is today known in the art world for its many commercial [[art gallery|art galleries]].&lt;ref name="british-arts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britisharts.co.uk/gallerieslondon.htm | title=London Art Galleries | website=www.britisharts.co.uk | publisher=British Arts | location=UK | accessdate=9 November 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111030826/http://www.britisharts.co.uk/gallerieslondon.htm | archivedate=11 November 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/20/mayfair-art-galleries-under-threat | title=Mayfair's art galleries under threat from developers | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | first=David | last=Batty | date=20 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is close to the Royal Academy on [[Piccadilly]] to the south, when has an interest in the artistic nature of the street.&lt;ref name="ra"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://art-antiques-design.com/2012/11/03/simon-tarrant-the-royal-academy-of-arts-council-statement/ | website=art-antiques-design.com | publisher=Art, Antiques and Luxury Design Blog | title=Simon Tarrant – The Royal Academy of Arts Council Statement | accessdate=8 November 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119225706/http://art-antiques-design.com/2012/11/03/simon-tarrant-the-royal-academy-of-arts-council-statement/ | archivedate=19 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|2012}}, there are 22 galleries in the street.&lt;ref name="phaidon"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2012/september/24/a-third-of-cork-streets-galleries-to-close/ | publisher=[[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]] | title=A third of Cork Street's galleries to close | date=2012 | accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The street is considered to be one of the United Kingdom's "most important art hubs".&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The galleries of Cork Street have launched the careers of many major modern artists in Britain. For example, the Mayor Gallery was the venue for the first London exhibitions of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Joan Miró]]. [[Peggy Guggenheim]] opened her 'Guggenheim Jeune' art gallery at number 30 in 1938.

The art dealer [[Lillian Browse]] was nicknamed "The Duchess of Cork Street", and used that name as the title of her autobiography.&lt;ref name="browse"&gt;{{cite book| first=Lillian | last=Browse | url=https://www.amazon.com/Duchess-Cork-Street-Autobiography-Dealer/dp/1900357143 | title=Duchess of Cork Street: The Autobiography of an Art Dealer | publisher=[[Giles de la Mare]] | year=1999 | isbn=978-1900357142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack on Cork Street===
[[File:GO Police paint.JPG|thumb|Cork Street [[Robert Fraser (art dealer)|Robert Fraser]] art gallery attacked by [[Grey Organisation|Grey]] paint.]]

In 1985 the [[Grey Organisation]], a radical arts collective, launched an attack on Cork Street covering some of the galleries in grey paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/level2/dance.htm | title=Save the last dance for me? |website=/www.stewarthomesociety.org|publisher= Stewart Home | accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release, GO justified the attacks on Cork Street, describing the galleries established there as "boring and lifeless", stating they "intended to liven up their lives a bit!". The attack took place on Tuesday 21 May 1985, somewhere between midnight and 6am. Members of the Grey Organisation were later arrested, released on bail and banned from central London, but when prosecuted at Well Street Magistrates' court, pleaded 'Not Guilty' and were released without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title=[[Art Line Magazine]] | publisher=International Art News | volume=2 | issue=9 | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
In 2012 the Save Cork Street campaign was created to protect Cork Street as a contemporary arts district. With 13,000 supporters, including David Hockney and Sir Peter Blake, the Save Cork Street campaign attracted major press interest. Chaired by artist and arts promoter Simon Tarrant, the Save Cork Street committee petitioned Westminster Council to stipulate gallery usage for future Cork Street developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saving Cork Street: Is London’s Historic Art District Under Threat?|url=http://style.time.com/2013/02/12/saving-cork-street-is-londons-historic-art-district-under-threat/|website=Time|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cork Street goes pop|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d62d377e-13ae-11e2-9cc7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3GGVwrOo7|website=Financial Times|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cork Street art dealers oppose development plans|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19935691|website=BBC News|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae''''' ([[Latin]]: ''[[text corpus|Corpus]] of Byzantine history writers''), frequently referred to as the '''CSHB''' or '''Bonn Corpus''', is a monumental fifty-volume series of [[primary sources]] for the study of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] history (c. 330–1453), published in the German city of [[Bonn]] between 1828 and 1897. Each volume contains a [[text criticism|critical edition]] of a [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]] historical text, accompanied by a parallel Latin translation. The project, conceived by the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], sought to revise and expand the original twenty-four volume ''Corpus Byzantinae Historiae'' (sometimes called the ''Byzantine du Louvre''), &lt;ref name&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofbar00nieb ''The Life and Letters of Barthold George Niebuhr''], ed. K. J. Bunsen, with J. Brandis and J. W. Lorbell (New York: Harper, 1854) p. 483, and letter 364 (pp. 501-502), addressed to [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]], dated 29 April 1827: "You will have heard of the edition of the Byzantine historians, which I am superintending. It is a great delight to me to be able thus to infuse some life into our literary doings; to give employment to young philologists; to give extension, activity, and perfection to typography; to contribute my mite [''sic''] to the increase of general prosperity...."&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Paris]] between 1648 and 1711 under the initial direction of the [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Philippe Labbe]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Omont, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nyEMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=philippe+labbe+byzance+du+louvre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5siRwr5HuN&amp;sig=jisLllTg1AhrOZbx_tffsIENaNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W3CnVNKJF8_qgwTkt4HgCQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "La collection byzantine de Labbe et le projet de J. M. Suarès"], ''Revue des études grecques'' 17 (1904), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The series was first based at the [[University of Bonn]]; after Niebuhr's death in 1831, however, oversight of the project passed to his collaborator [[August Immanuel Bekker|Immanuel Bekker]] at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Reinsch [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-SrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA435&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The History of Editing Byzantine Historiographical Texts"], in ''The Byzantine World'', ed. P. Stephenson (New York: Routledge, 2010), p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first volume of the series was praised for its "minute care and attention" to textual details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QGYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA574&amp;lpg=PA574&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Niebuhr's Edition of the Byzantine Historians"] ''The Foreign Review'' 1 (1828), p. 575. However, the anonymous reviewer does criticize Niebuhr for standardizing of Byzantine orthography along Classical lines&lt;/ref&gt; later volumes produced under Bekker became infamous for their frequent misprints, careless execution, and general unreliability.&lt;ref&gt;Reinsch, ''op. cit.'', reports that [[August Heisenberg]], professor of Byzantine literature at Munich, once said of Bekker that he "must have revised the texts 'lying on the sofa with the cigar in his mouth.'" J. B. Bury was even harsher in his assessment, calling the CSHB "the most lamentably feeble production ever given to the world by German scholars of great reputation." See: ''idem'' [https://archive.org/details/historyofdecl01gibb "Introduction"], to [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', vol. 1, ed. J. B. Bury (London: Meuthen, 1897), p. xlix.&lt;/ref&gt; Given these shortcomings, the [[International Association of Byzantine Studies]] established in 1966 the ''[[Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae]]'' to re-edit many of the texts included in the Bonn edition of the CSHB.

The '''D'Oyly Carte Opera Company''' is a professional [[light opera]] company that staged [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy opera]]s nearly year-round in the UK and sometimes toured in Europe, North America and elsewhere, from the 1870s until 1982. The company was revived for short seasons and tours from 1988 to 2003, and with [[Scottish Opera]] it later co-produced two productions.

In 1875, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] asked the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] to collaborate on a short [[comic opera]] to round out an evening's entertainment.  When that work, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', became a success, Carte put together a syndicate to produce a full-length Gilbert and Sullivan work, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877), followed by ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878). After ''Pinafore'' became an international sensation, Carte jettisoned his difficult investors and formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan that became the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The company produced the succeeding ten Gilbert and Sullivan operas and many [[Savoy operas|other operas]] and companion pieces, mostly at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London, which Carte built in 1881 for that purpose. The company also mounted tours in Britain, New York and elsewhere, usually running several companies simultaneously. Carte's able assistant, [[Helen Lenoir]], became his wife in 1888 and, after his death in 1901, she ran the company until her own death in 1913.  By this time, it had become a year-round Gilbert and Sullivan touring repertory company.

Carte's son [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]] inherited the company.  Beginning in 1919, he mounted new seasons in London with new set and costume designs, while continuing the year-round tours in Britain and abroad. With the help of the director [[J. M. Gordon]] and the conductor [[Isidore Godfrey]], Carte ran the company for 35 years. He redesigned the Savoy Theatre in 1928 and sponsored a series of recordings over the years that helped to keep the operas popular.  After Rupert's death in 1948, his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]] inherited the company and hired [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager. The company continued to tour for 35 weeks each year, issue new recordings and play London seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan. In 1961, the last copyright on the Gilbert and Sullivan operas expired, and Bridget set up and endowed a charitable trust that presented the operas until mounting costs and a lack of public funding forced the closure of the company in 1982. It re-formed in 1988 with a legacy left by Bridget D'Oyly Carte, played short tours and London seasons, and issued some popular recordings. Denied significant funding from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|English Arts Council]], it suspended productions in 2003. With Scottish Opera, it co-produced ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' 2013 and ''[[The Mikado]]'' in 2016.

Some of the company's performers, over the decades, became stars of their day and often moved on to careers in [[musical theatre]] or [[grand opera]]. The company licensed the operas for performance in Australasia and to numerous amateur troupes in Britain and elsewhere, providing orchestra parts and prompt books for hire. The company kept the Savoy operas in the public eye for over a century and left an enduring legacy of production styles and stage business that continue to be emulated in new productions, as well as recordings.

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|right|thumb|[[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]]]
By 1874, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], a musician and ambitious young [[impresario]], had begun producing operettas in London.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Jacobs, Arthur.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for one of his productions that year: "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light opera."&lt;ref&gt;"Our Representative Man", ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 10 October 1874, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' reported, "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine [[opera bouffe]], and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;The Observer, 23 August 1874, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  He wanted to establish a body of tasteful English [[comic opera]] that would appeal to families, in contrast to the [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and adaptations of French operettas and opera bouffes that dominated the London musical stage at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 128–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1875, Carte was managing London's [[Royalty Theatre]].  Needing a short piece to round out an evening's entertainment featuring the popular [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] operetta ''[[La Périchole]]'' he brought [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]] together.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Sullivan's only previous collaboration, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' (1871), was a Christmas entertainment for a different management and made only a modest impact.&lt;/ref&gt;  On tour in 1871, Carte had conducted [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s one-act comic opera ''[[Cox and Box]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Public Amusements", ''Liverpool Mercury'', 2 September 1871, p. 6.  The composer's brother [[Fred Sullivan]] played Cox.&lt;/ref&gt; which received an 1874 London revival.  In 1873, [[W. S. Gilbert]] had offered a libretto to Carte about an English courtroom, but at the time Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte remembered Gilbert's libretto and suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan write the music for a one-act comic opera, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', which was quickly composed and added to the Royalty's bill in March 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, George. "Whose ''Zoo''; or, When Did the ''Trial'' Begin?", ''Nineteenth Century Theatre Research'', 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54&lt;/ref&gt;  The witty and "very English" little piece proved even more popular than ''La Périchole'' and became the first great success of Carte's scheme to found his school of English comic opera, playing for 300 performances from 1875 to 1877, as well as touring and enjoying many revivals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 29 March 1875, p. 10, quoted and discussed in Ainger, p. 109.  See also Stedman, pp. 129–30; Ainger, pp. 111 and 117; and Rollins and Witts, pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HelenD'OylyCarte.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Helen Lenoir]]]]
At the Theatre Royal, in [[Dublin]], Ireland in September 1875, while there managing the first tour of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte met a young Scottish actress, [[Helen Lenoir]].  She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English comic opera&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenoir was well-educated, and her grasp of detail and diplomacy, as well as her organisational ability and business acumen, surpassed even Carte's.  She became intensely involved in all of his business affairs and soon managed many of the company's responsibilities, especially concerning touring.  She later travelled to America numerous times over the years to arrange the details of the company's New York engagements and American tours.&lt;ref name=helenDNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of three English adaptations of French opera bouffe and two one-act English curtain raisers (''Happy Hampstead'' and ''Trial by Jury'').  Carte himself was the musical director of this travelling company, which disbanded after the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/whowaswho/C/CarteRichardD'Oyly.htm Biography of Carte] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903152000/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/C/CarteRichardD'Oyly.htm |date=3 September 2006 }} at the ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'' website, 27 August 2001, accessed 14 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 4 July 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, Carte found four [[Equity partner|financial backers]] and formed the Comedy Opera Company in 1876 to produce more works by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], along with the works of other British lyricist/composer teams.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ainger130&gt;Ainger, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 110, 119–20 and 130–31; Jacobs, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte leased the Opera Comique, a small theatre off [[Strand, London|The Strand]].&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt;  The first comic opera produced by the Comedy Opera Company was Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', about a tradesmanlike London sorcerer.  It opened in November 1877 together with ''[[Dora's Dream]]'', a curtain-raiser with music by Sullivan's assistant [[Alfred Cellier]] and words by [[Arthur Cecil]], a friend of both Gilbert and Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support.  They were therefore able to select their own cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre.  They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] style of performance than was commonly used at the time.  Carte's talent agency provided many of the artists to perform in the new work.  They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the cast members, including principal comedian [[George Grossmith]], [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] and [[Rutland Barrington]], stayed with the company for almost 15 years.  Two other longstanding members of the company were [[Rosina Brandram]], who started in D'Oyly Carte touring companies with ''The Sorcerer'', and [[Jessie Bond]] who joined the group for ''Pinafore'' at the Opera Comique in 1878.&lt;ref name=Ainger152&gt;Ainger, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;  As Grossmith wrote in 1888, "We are all a very happy family."&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing that Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of broadening the audience for British light opera by increasing its quality and respectability, Carte gave Gilbert wider authority as a director than was customary among Victorian producers, and Gilbert tightly controlled all aspects of production, including staging, design and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Vorder Bruegge, Andrew. [http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy".] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=3 May 2011 }} Professor Vorder Bruegge (Department Chair, Department of Theatre and Dance, Winthrop University) presented this paper at the Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western United States annual conference in October 2002, accessed 26 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert hired the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre's]] ballet-master [[John D'Auban]] to choreograph most of the Savoy operas.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience; as the critic [[Herman Klein]] wrote: "we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done.  For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings&amp;nbsp;.... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Sorcerer'' ran for 178 performances, a healthy run at the time, making a profit,&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;  and Carte sent out a touring company in March 1878.&lt;ref name=Ainger152/&gt;  Sheet music from the show sold well, and [[Organ grinder|street musicians]] played the melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of ''The Sorcerer'' showed Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan that there was a future in family-friendly English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 141–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pinafore'' to ''Patience''===
[[File:Pinafore1899.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene from 1886 [[Savoy Theatre]] [[souvenir programme]]]]
The next Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', opened in May 1878. The opera's initial slow business was generally ascribed to a heat wave that made the stuffy Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1996), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/bond2/004.html "The Life and Reminiscences of Jessie Bond", Chapter 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001080947/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond2/004.html |date=1 October 2009 }}, John Lane, 1930, accessed 10 March 2009. But see Ainger, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's partners in the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the show and posted closing notices.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After Carte made promotional efforts and Sullivan included some of the ''Pinafore'' music in several promenade concerts that he conducted at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], ''Pinafore'' became a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  The Opera Comique was required to close at Christmas 1878 for repairs to drainage and sewage under the Public Health Act of 1875.  Carte used the enforced closure of the theatre to invoke a contract clause reverting the rights of ''Pinafore'' and ''Sorcerer'' to Gilbert and Sullivan after the initial run of ''H.M.S. Pinafore''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 165–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte then took a six-month personal lease on the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.&lt;ref name=joseph18&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name "Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html "The Fracas at the Opera Comique"].

In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt;  ''Pirates'' was the only [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera to have its official premiere in America.  Carte and his partners hoped to forestall further "piracy" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.

As Jessie Bond described in her autobiography:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No lingering about was allowed, no gossiping with the other actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were on one side of the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases&amp;nbsp;– sheep rigorously separated from the goats!  Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ...  I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience.  Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie.

[[File:1881 Savoy Theatre.jpg|left|thumb|Original facade of the [[Savoy Theatre]], c. 1881]]
With profits from the success of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency (his talent roster included [[Adelina Patti]], [[Clara Schumann]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Charles Gounod]]),&lt;ref name=Ainger130/&gt; Carte bought property along the Strand with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;"100 Electrifying Years", ''The Savoyard'', Volume XX no. 2, D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, September 1981, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;  He chose the name in honour of the [[Savoy Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor.  It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, J. P. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/3206178 "The London West End Theatre in the 1890s"]. ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 29, No. 3 (October 1977), pp. 320–32, The Johns Hopkins University Press (online by subscription to JSTOR)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Patience'' was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881.  The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881.  At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology.&lt;ref name=bettany&gt;Bettany, unnumbered page (there are no page numbers in the book)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Times'' concluded that the theatre "is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with."&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 October 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte and his manager, [[George Edwardes]] (later famous as manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]), introduced several innovations at the theatre, including numbered seating, free programme booklets, the "queue" system for the pit and gallery (an American idea) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services.&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt;  Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dark and Grey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premièred at the Savoy.

During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, the company also produced [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|operas by other composer–librettist teams]], either as curtain-raisers to the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces, or as touring productions, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between Savoy operas, and Carte also toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas extensively.  For example, a souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of ''Patience'' in London and its 100th performance in New York shows that, aside from these two productions of ''Patience'', Carte was simultaneously producing two companies touring with ''Patience'', two companies touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a company touring with ''[[Olivette (opera)|Olivette]]'' (co-produced with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]) a company touring ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' in America, a production of ''Youth'' running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of ''Patience'', ''Pirates'', ''Claude Duval'' and ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in association with [[J. C. Williamson]] in Australia, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091001081006/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/museum/patience/250perf/pc250.html 250th Anniversary ''Patience'' programme, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing their popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 81 and 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley25&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 25, noting that royalties from British amateur companies were 10% of the box office take plus hire costs for the band parts and prompt books&lt;/ref&gt;  This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general.  Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals.  After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama.  They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to "the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas".&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in 1899.  It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"/&gt;  Carte insisted that amateur companies follow the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company staging, using its prompt books.&lt;ref name=Bradley25/&gt;  Even after the copyrights expired at the end of 1961, the company continued to, and still does, rent out band parts to companies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 30 and 68; see also [http://www.doylycarte.org.uk/services/services_index.htm the services page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417061020/http://doylycarte.org.uk/services/services_index.htm |date=17 April 2009 }} at the D'Oyly Carte Opera company website&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Iolanthe'' to ''The Gondoliers''===
After ''Patience'', the company produced ''[[Iolanthe]]'', which opened in 1882.  During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obligating them to create new operas for the company upon six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan had not intended immediately to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt;  But he soon felt trapped.&lt;ref name=Jacobs188&gt;Jacobs, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, regarding the agreement: "Effectively, it made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees&amp;nbsp;– a situation which created its own resentments."&lt;ref name=Crothcarpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew.

''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 28 June 1997, accessed 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership's next opera, ''[[Princess Ida]]'', opened in January 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 225–26&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte soon saw that ''Ida'' was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners for a new opera to be written.  Almost from the beginning of the partnership, the musical establishment put pressure on Sullivan to abandon comic opera,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6, favourably reviewing ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', nevertheless added, "we cannot suppress a word of regret that the composer on whom before all others the chances of a national school of music depend should confine himself ... to a class of production which, however attractive, is hardly worthy of the efforts of an accomplished and serious artist."&lt;/ref&gt; and he soon regretted having signed the five-year contract.&lt;ref name=Jacobs188/&gt;  In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."&lt;ref name=Crothcarpet/&gt;

[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph from ''The Mikado'']]
During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently had to smooth over the partners' differences with a mixture of friendship and business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26772?docPos=7 "Sullivan, Arthur Seymour"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, they coaxed eight comic operas out of Gilbert and Sullivan in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ''Pirates'' premiered on 31 December 1879, so technically it's seven, but Joseph counts it as eight. --&gt;  When ''Princess Ida'' closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready.  To make matters worse, Gilbert suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge&amp;nbsp;– a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected, and he now rejected the "lozenge plot" again.  Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 230–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The company produced the first revival of ''The Sorcerer'', together with ''Trial by Jury'', and matinees of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' played by a cast of children, while waiting for the new work to be completed.  This became the partnership's most successful opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', which opened in March 1885.&lt;ref name=Wilson13&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan.  At the same time, it took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic Far East using the "picturesque" scenery and costumes of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian.  "Japan in London 1885", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', issue 22, Winter 2007, pp. 686–96&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Mikado'' became the partnership's longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, the second longest run for any work of musical theatre up to that time,&lt;ref&gt;The longest-running piece of musical theatre was the [[operetta]] ''[[Les Cloches de Corneville]]'', which held that position until the record-breaking run of ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' in 1886.

The partnership's next opera was ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which opened in January 1887.  It satirised and used elements of Victorian stock [[melodrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Walmisley, Guy H. and Claude A. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/ruddigore/html/intro.html Excerpt about ''Ruddigore''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001162103/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas///ruddigore/html/intro.html |date=1 October 2009 }} from ''Tit-Willow; or Notes and Jottings on Gilbert and Sullivan Operas'' (London: 1964), reproduced at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 9 January 2005 accessed 12 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece, though profitable, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary success of ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''Ruddigore'' closed after a run of only nine months, the company mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas for almost a year.  After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a "lozenge plot", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which premiered in October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  The opera was a success, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions.  During the run, in March 1889, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a "dramatic work on a larger musical scale".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert declined, but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a grand opera (''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'') for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  The new comic opera was ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;  After Carte's first wife died in 1885, Carte married Helen Lenoir in 1888, who was, by this time, nearly as important in managing the company as Carte himself.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt;

[[File:Gondo1990.jpg|right|220px]]
During these years, the company's high production values, and the quality of the operas, created a national and international taste for them, and the company mounted touring productions throughout the provinces, in America (generally managed by Helen), Europe&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt;  [[Queen Victoria]] honoured the company by calling for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''The Gondoliers'' at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;  [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], writing in ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'' in October 1893, commented, "Those who are old enough to compare the Savoy performances with those of the dark ages, taking into account the pictorial treatment of the fabrics and colours on the stage, the cultivation and intelligence of the choristers, the quality of the orchestra, and the degree of artistic good breeding, so to speak, expected from the principals, best know how great an advance has been made by Mr. D'Oyly Carte."&lt;ref&gt;"Utopian Gilbert and Sullivan", ''The World'', 11 October 1893, reprinted in Laurence, pp. 975–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert confronted Carte, and Carte refused to reconsider the accounts: Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it.  Gilbert wrote in a letter to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".&lt;ref name=Crothcarpet/&gt;  Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert brought a lawsuit, but Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]], the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  Gilbert won the suit, but the partnership disbanded.&lt;ref name=vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

After ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti and vowed to write no more operas for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=vowed/&gt;  The D'Oyly Carte company turned to new writing teams for the Savoy, first producing ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', by [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], [[Frank Desprez]] and [[Edward Solomon]], which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92.  Next was a revival of Solomon and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', which played through the summer of 1892.

In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoyards on Tour", ''The Sketch'', 13 June 1894, pp. 373–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Sullivan and Carte, but the partnership had been so profitable that the Cartes eventually sought to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan.  The reconciliation finally came through the efforts of [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], who published the sheet music to the Savoy operas.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1893, the company produced the penultimate Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]''.  While ''Utopia'' was being prepared, the company produced ''[[Jane Annie]]'', by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with music by [[Ernest Ford]].  Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing in July 1893 after only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn.  "Jane Annie", in ''Sullivan Society Journal'', 1993 centenary issue on ''Utopia, Limited''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Utopia'' was the Savoy's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894, turning a very modest profit.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt;  The company then played first ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', composed by [[André Messager]], then ''[[The Chieftain]]'', by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and Sullivan.  These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''The Chieftain'' closed, the company toured the London suburbs, while Carte leased the Savoy Theatre to the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]].  The theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of ''[[The Mikado]]''.&lt;ref name=Wilson52&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', in 1896, which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure.  ''The Gondoliers'' turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after ''The Grand Duke'', the two men never collaborated again.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt;

In 1894, Carte had hired his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], as an assistant.  Rupert assisted Mrs. Carte and [[W. S. Gilbert]] with the first revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the Savoy in May 1897.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', 7 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the later 1890s, Carte's health was declining, and Mrs. Carte assumed more and more of the responsibilities of running the opera company.  She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt;  The Savoy's shows during this period received comparatively short runs, including ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897), ''[[The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897), ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;  Sullivan's ''The Beauty Stone'' ran for only 50 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899, the Savoy finally had a new success, with Sullivan and [[Basil Hood]]'s ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'', which ran for 213 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of Sullivan and Hood's ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901), for which [[Edward German]] completed the score.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 4 April 1901, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===
Carte left his theatre, opera company and hotels to his wife, who assumed full control of the family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;  Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy operas in Britain and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–27&lt;/ref&gt;  She leased the Savoy Theatre to [[William Greet]] in 1901 and oversaw his management of the company's revival of ''Iolanthe'' and the production of several new comic operas, including ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (with music by [[Edward German]], libretto by [[Basil Hood]]), which ran for four months in early 1903 and then toured.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''A Princess of Kensington'' closed at the Savoy, Mrs. Carte leased the theatre to other managements until 8 December 1906.  The company's fortunes declined for a time, and by 1904 there was only a single touring company wending its way through the British provinces, when it took a seven-month South African tour.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;

In 1906–07, Mrs. Carte staged a repertory season at the Savoy Theatre, with Gilbert returning to direct.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  The season, which included ''Yeomen'', ''The Gondoliers'', ''Patience'' and ''Iolanthe'', was a sensation&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt; and led to another in 1908–09 including ''The Mikado'', ''Pinafore'', ''Iolanthe'', ''Pirates'', ''The Gondoliers'' and ''Yeomen''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 83–87&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, however, Mrs. Carte's health prevented her from staging more London seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, ''A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan'', Vista Books, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  She retired and leased the theatre to [[C. H. Workman]], and the company did not perform in London again until 1919, although it continued to tour throughout Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 138 and 186&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rupert carte 1919.jpg|right|frame|[[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]]]]
After Gilbert's death in 1911, the company continued to produce productions of the operas in repertory until 1982.  In 1911, Helen Carte hired [[J. M. Gordon]] as stage manager. Gordon, who was promoted to stage director in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;''Rollins and Witts'', p. ii&lt;/ref&gt; had been a member of the company and a stage manager under Gilbert's direction, and he fiercely preserved the company's performing traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David (ed). [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonJM.htm J M Gordon] at ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', accessed 21 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Except for ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which underwent some cuts and received a new overture,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cox and Box]]'' was cut and arranged into a short curtain raiser&lt;/ref&gt; very few changes were made to the text and music of the operas as Gilbert and Sullivan had produced them, and the company stayed true to Gilbert's period settings. Even after Gordon's death, many of Gilbert's directorial concepts survived, both in the stage directions printed in the libretti and as preserved in company prompt books. Original choreography was also maintained.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, 1882 images of the Act II trio in ''Iolanthe'' in ''Mander and Michenson'', p. 65 and 1974 images of the same scene on the sleeve of D'Oyly Carte recording, Decca SKL 5188/9&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the company's staging became accepted as traditional by Gilbert and Sullivan fans, and many of these traditional stagings are still imitated today in productions by both amateur and professional companies.&lt;ref name=Bradley30/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley61&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article7035514.ece "Patricia Leonard: principal contralto of the D’Oyly Carte opera"]. ''[[The Times]]'', 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helen Carte]] died in 1913, and Carte's son [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] inherited the company.&lt;ref&gt;Carte's older son, Lucas, was a barrister and took no part in the family businesses.  He died of tuberculosis in 1907, aged 34.  See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War I, he was away serving in the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; According to H. M. Walbrook, "Through the years of the Great War [the company] continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere.  They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap16.html Walbrook, H. M. ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment'', Chapter XVI] (1920) London: F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also toured in North America several times, beginning with a Canadian tour in 1927.&lt;ref name=Joseph160/&gt;

Rupert D'Oyly Carte found the company's productions increasingly "dowdy", however, and on his return from the war, he determined to refresh them, bringing in new designers including W. Bridges-Adams for the sets, and, for the costumes, [[George Sheringham]] and [[Hugo Rumbold]]. He also commissioned new costumes from [[Percy Anderson]] who had worked with Gilbert and Richard D'Oyly Carte on the original productions of the later Savoy operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson90&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ricketts]] redesigned sets and costumes for ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1926) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1929). His costumes for ''The Mikado'' were retained by all subsequent designers until 1982.  In an interview in ''[[The Observer]]'' in August 1919, Carte set out his policy for staging the operas: "They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 August 1919, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, "the plays are all being restaged. ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them.  Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days."&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt;

[[File:1919-20season.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Souvenir program]]me cover, 1919–20 season]]
The main company made a triumphant return to London for the 1919–20 season at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]], playing most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas in repertory and showing off the new sets and costumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html Information about the 1919–20 D'Oyly Carte season] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this season led to additional London seasons in 1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, and 1926; the company toured the rest of the year.&lt;ref name=Joseph160&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 160 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte's first London season stimulated renewed interest in the operas, and by 1920 he had established a second, smaller company to tour smaller towns.  It was disbanded in 1927, although the company often ran multiple tours simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Wilson90/&gt;
For London seasons, Carte engaged guest conductors, first [[Geoffrey Toye]], then [[Malcolm Sargent]], who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions.  So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error.  In a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', he noted that "the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan."&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Rupert D'Oyly. ''The Times'', 22 September 1926, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also hired [[Harry Norris (conductor)|Harry Norris]], who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director.

In 1917, the company made the first complete recording of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', for the [[Gramophone Company]] (later known as [[His Master's Voice]]).  Rupert D'Oyly Carte supervised the company's recordings, including eight more acoustic recordings by 1924, and a series of complete electrical recordings in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  There were additional recordings, in high fidelity, for [[Decca Records]], in the late 1940s and early 1950s and stereo recordings in the late 1950s and early 1960s, all supervised after Rupert's death by his daughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/series.htm Links to detailed descriptions of the various series of D'Oyly Carte recordings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054314/http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/series.htm |date=4 March 2008 }}.

Rupert D'Oyly Carte also redesigned the Savoy Theatre.  On 3 June 1929 the Savoy closed, and it was completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with décor by [[Basil Ionides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/1929/index.html |title=Programme with photos of the new theatre and productions |access-date=8 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527065615/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/1929/index.html |archive-date=27 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The old house had three tiers; the new one had two.

John Witts. ''The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in Gilbert and Sullivan Operas'' (1961) London: Michael Joseph, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Savoy also hosted London seasons for the company in 1930–31, 1933, 1941, 1951, 1954, 1961, 1963–64, and 1975.  London seasons at other theatres, mostly [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]], included summer seasons from 1935 to 1939, 1942, 1947 to 1950, 1953, 1971, 1975, 1977 and 1980; and winter seasons in 1956–57, 1958–59, 1960–61, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1967–68, and then every winter between 1969–70 and 1981–82.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the Savoy and Sadler's Wells, London seasons were at the Prince's Theatre (1956–57, 1958–59, and 1960–61); the [[Saville Theatre]] (1963–64, 1965–66 and 1967–68); the [[Royal Festival Hall]] (1971 and 1975); and the [[Adelphi Theatre]], 1981–82).  See Rollins and Witts, pp. 180–86 and supplements.&lt;/ref&gt; The company continued to tour the British provinces and abroad when it was not in London, and these tours also often included London suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 154–82&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's musical director from 1929 (having been assistant musical director from 1925) was [[Isidore Godfrey]], who retained the position until 1968 and guest conducted the company in 1975, as part of the centenary season at the [[Savoy Theatre]].  Guest conductors during Godfrey's tenure were Sargent and [[Boyd Neel]].  [[Henry Lytton]] retired in 1934 after a quarter century as the principal comedian, and the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with its new principal comedian, [[Martyn Green]].  In 1938, many company members participated in the Technicolor film of ''The Mikado'' produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye.&lt;ref name=Wilson128&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres.  Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;  Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 September 1939, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; but it took some weeks to re-form the company. Some performers, including Martyn Green, were already committed elsewhere, and [[Grahame Clifford]] was engaged to play his roles.  The company resumed touring, in [[Edinburgh]], on Christmas Day 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  The company continued to perform throughout the war, both on tour and in London, but in 1940 German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its shows: ''Cox and Box'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[Princess Ida]]'' and ''Ruddigore''.  The old productions of ''Pinafore'' and ''Cox and Box'' were recreated shortly after the war, and ''Ruddigore'' received a new production, planned by Carte but not seen until after his death.  The other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory.&lt;ref&gt;''Pinafore'' re-entered the repertory in July 1947, ''Cox and Box'' in the 1947/48 season, ''Ruddigore'' in November 1948, and ''Princess Ida'' in September 1954 (see Rollins and Witts, pp. 171–79 and VII–VIII).  ''The Sorcerer'' was not revived until April 1971 (see ''The Times'', 2 April 1971, p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, for the first wartime season, [[Peter Goffin]], a protege of Carte's daughter, Bridget, had designed a new production of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' first seen in January 1940, and his new ''[[Ruddigore]]'' debuted in 1948.  A return to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful, and the company resumed frequent visits to America.&lt;ref name=Wilson128/&gt;

[[File:Mikado Ricketts.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles Ricketts|Ricketts]]'s 1926 Mikado design]]
Rupert died in 1948, leaving a strong company to his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt;  She soon hired [[Frederic Lloyd]] as general manager.  Bridget and Lloyd also took steps to keep the productions fresh, engaging designers to redesign the costumes and scenery.  Peter Goffin, who had redesigned ''Yeomen'' (1939) and ''Ruddigore'' (1948) for the company, created new settings and costumes for Bridget for half a dozen more productions: ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1952; settings only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961; ladies' costumes) and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  A new production of ''[[Princess Ida]]'' in 1954 was designed by James Wade.&lt;ref name=Wilson154&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eleanor Evans]], however, was an example of one of the company's stage directors (from 1949 to 1953) who was said to be reluctant to update and freshen stagings.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, John. [http://pinafore.www3.50megs.com/k-sandford-fav.html "The Ones that I Like"], Interview with Sandford, c. 1972, at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Goffin designed a unit set for the company to facilitate touring, reducing the number of vans required to carry the scenery from twenty to nine.&lt;ref name=Wilson154/&gt;  A 1957 review of ''Yeomen'' in ''The Times'' praised the production and marvelled at "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas", noting: "The opera remains enchanting; the singing seems, on the whole, better and more musical than that which one used to hear, say, 30 years since; and though the acting lacks some of the richly crusted performances of those days, it is perhaps none the worse for that".&lt;ref&gt;"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan", ''The Times'', 14 February 1957, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1949, the company began a new series of recordings with Decca, featuring Green, who had returned to the company after the war, and continued the series with his successor, [[Peter Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 151 and 154&lt;/ref&gt;  The company cooperated with the production of the 1953 film ''[[The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan]]'', which used some former members of the company in the cast.  In 1955, the company gave a seven-month tour to the U.S. to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its first American productions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, the company began the tradition of holding a zany "last night" on the last evening of each London season.&lt;ref name=Wilson154/&gt;

===Later years and closing===
With the approaching end of the D'Oyly Carte monopoly on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performances, when the copyright on Gilbert's words expired in 1961 (Sullivan’s music had already come out of copyright at the end of 1950), Bridget D'Oyly Carte contributed the company and all its assets to an independent charitable trust.  She endowed the trust with the company's scenery, costumes, band parts and other assets, together with a cash endowment, and supervised the production of operas on behalf of the trust until economic necessity forced the closure of the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  As it turned out, competing professional productions of Gilbert and Sullivan did not harm the company.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1960, the company re-recorded all of the operas with Pratt's successor, [[John Reed (actor)|John Reed]],&lt;ref&gt;supported by such strong singers as [[Kenneth Sandford]], [[Donald Adams]], [[Thomas Round]], [[Valerie Masterson]], [[Jean Hindmarsh]] and [[Gillian Knight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and also recorded a number of other Sullivan pieces.  It made a [[The Mikado (1967 film)|cinema film of ''The Mikado'']] in 1966, and recorded for television broadcast its productions of ''Patience'' (1965) and ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Mark.

''The Sorcerer'' had costume and set designs by [[Osbert Lancaster]]. See: "The Sorcerer to be revived", ''The Times'' , 5 March 1971, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and April 1975, after the regular London season at Sadler's Wells, the company moved to the Savoy Theatre for a fortnight's centennial performances, beginning on 25 March, the 100th anniversary of the first performance of ''Trial by Jury''.  All thirteen surviving Gilbert and Sullivan operas were performed in chronological order.  ''Trial by Jury'' was given four times, as a curtain raiser to ''The Sorcerer'', ''Pinafore'' and ''Pirates'' and as an afterpiece following ''The Grand Duke''.&lt;ref name=Wilson178/&gt;  Before the first of the four performances of ''Trial'', a specially written curtain raiser by [[William Douglas-Home]], called ''Dramatic Licence'', was played by Peter Pratt as [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], [[Kenneth Sandford]] as Gilbert and [[John Ayldon]] as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of ''Trial'' in 1875; afterwards, the prime minister, [[Harold Wilson]], and Bridget D'Oyly Carte each gave a short speech.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Elizabeth. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/kenneth-sandford-550525.html Kenneth Sandford obituary]. ''The Independent'', 23 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  A highlight of the season was a new staging of ''Utopia Limited'' (later given again at the [[Royal Festival Hall]]), its first revival by the company. ''The Grand Duke'' was given as a concert performance, with narration by the [[BBC]] presenter [[Richard Baker (broadcaster)|Richard Baker]]. [[Royston Nash]], who was at the company's musical helm from 1971 to 1979, conducted most of the performances, with [[Isidore Godfrey]] (''Pinafore'') and [[Charles Mackerras|Sir Charles Mackerras]] (''Pirates'' and ''Mikado'') as guest conductors.  Princes Philip and Andrew saw ''The Gondoliers''.  In the final performance of ''Trial by Jury'', the regular D'Oyly Carte chorus was augmented by fourteen former stars of the company: [[Sylvia Cecil]], [[Elsie Griffin]], [[Ivan Menzies]], [[John Dean (singer)|John Dean]], [[Radley Flynn]], Elizabeth Nickell-Lean, [[Ella Halman]], [[Leonard Osborn]], Cynthia Morey, [[Jeffrey Skitch]], Alan Barrett, Mary Sansom, [[Philip Potter]] and Gillian Humphreys.&lt;ref&gt;''The Savoyard'', Vol. 14, No. 2, September 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/index.htm Biographies of all of these performers] are at the ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, during [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s Jubilee Year, the company gave a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''Pinafore'' at [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  The company visited Denmark in 1970, Rome in 1974, and gave its last American tours in 1976 and 1978.  Its last tour, in  [[Australasia]], conducted by the company's new musical director, Fraser Goulding, was a success in 1979.&lt;ref name=Wilson178/&gt;  Throughout the 20th century, until 1982, the company toured, on average, for 35 weeks per year (in addition to its 13-week London seasons), fostering a "strong family atmosphere, reinforced by the number of marriages in the company and the fact that so many people stayed with it for so long."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Principal soprano [[Valerie Masterson]] married the company's principal flautist, Andrew March.  She explained, "people didn't have flats or houses ... touring was your life."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout its history, the company maintained strict moral standards, and it was sometimes referred to as the "Savoy boarding school", enforcing policies regarding behaviour on and off stage, and even a dress code.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 31–34&lt;/ref&gt;  Soprano Cynthia Morey ascribed the strong affection that artists had for the company to "the unique family atmosphere engendered by the company's direct descent from its creators, Gilbert, Sullivan ... Richard D'Oyly Carte, followed by his widow, Helen, his son Rupert, and finally his granddaughter Bridget."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The company also preserved, for over a century, what ''The Times'' called a "unique performance style, which may be summarised as a combination of good taste and good fun".&lt;ref name=Leonard/&gt;

After the 1979 tour, the rising costs of mounting year-round professional light opera without any government support, despite some generous private contributions, caused the company to accrue increasing losses.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1980, the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|English Arts Council]]'s Music Panel and Touring Committee recommended that the Arts Council make a grant to the company, but this idea was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's fans made an effort to raise private funds, but these were insufficient to make up the accelerating losses.  In 1981, producer George Walker proposed to film the company performing all of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas but backed out.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridget D'Oyly Carte was forced to close the company in 1982, after a final London season in which John Reed and [[Valerie Masterson]] returned as guest artists.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  It gave its last performance on 27 February 1982, at the [[Adelphi Theatre]].

==Revivals of the company==
Dame Bridget D’Oyly Carte died in 1985, leaving in her will a £1 million legacy to enable the company to be revived.  The company secured sponsorship from [[Michael Bishop (businessman)|Sir Michael Bishop]], who later became chairman of the board of trustees, the [[Birmingham]] City Council and [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] British Midland Airways (of which Bishop is chairman).  [[Richard Condon (impresario)|Richard Condon]] was appointed the revived company's first general manager, and [[Bramwell Tovey]] was its first musical director.&lt;ref name=Bradley53&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 53–54 and 63&lt;/ref&gt;  In succeeding seasons, the company's productions of ''The Mikado'' and ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' were nominated for [[Olivier Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisle, Nicola. "When the wheels came off the Carte", ''Classical Music'', 17 February 2007, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1988 to 2003, the company mounted productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on tour and in London, and it produced several operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], [[Franz Lehár|Lehár]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss]].  Unlike the original company, which had regularly performed up to a dozen operas each year, 48 weeks a year, the new company generally presented only one or two operas in shorter seasons.&lt;ref name=Bradley53/&gt; In the first season, in 1988, the operas played were ''Iolanthe'' and ''The Yeomen of the Guard'', both starring [[Gillian Knight]].  The company made its debut at the [[Sunderland Empire Theatre]] on 29 April 1988, and, after touring, opened in London at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in July.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Richard. "lolanthe", ''The Guardian'', 2 May 1988, p. 20; and Canning, Hugh. ''Cambridge Theatre&amp;nbsp;– Iolanthe",  ''The Guardian'', 14 July 1988, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The press notices were good, particularly about the musical aspects of the new company; opinion was divided about the staging. ''The Observer'' thought the productions "miles superior to the later work of the old D'Oyly Carte; better designed, better lit ... better played and better sung."&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliffe, Michael. "Through a glass darkly", ''The Observer'', 17 July 1988, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Guardian'' praised the musical standards, but added, "Gilbert and Sullivan is as much theatrical as musical entertainment and there remains a lot to be done on the visual side."&lt;ref&gt;Canning, Hugh. ''Cambridge Theatre&amp;nbsp;– Iolanthe",  ''The Guardian'', 14 July 1988, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pulsating pirate version", ''The Observer'', 16 April 1989, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990 the company presented campier versions of ''Pinafore'' and ''Trial'' (including a heavily pregnant Angelina) that were much criticised by the old company's fans, who complained that it was a betrayal of the legacy left by Bridget D'Oyly Carte.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  The next season departed further from earnest presentations in its production of ''The Gondoliers'', which included a deeply corrugated stage floor, "startling", "surreal, primary coloured, starkly angled sets", gimmicky distracting business and generally staging that was considered "way over the top".  It "was unveiled to storms of outraged booing".&lt;ref name=canning&gt;Canning, Hugh.

Another initiative was to stage a foreign operetta for the first time since Richard D'Oyly Carte's day, in what would be D'Oyly Carte's first co-production. The work chosen was  ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'', which [[Opera North]] presented in 1992 and D'Oyly Carte toured in 1993 as part of its 35-week tour celebrating the 150th anniversary of Sullivan's birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F91F07EE4EC7163&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=1026E0A26AB6F6FF  "Going down&amp;nbsp;– Arts Briefing"].

Unlike its predecessor, the new company was not a permanent ensemble with a recognisable style.&lt;ref name=Bradley61/&gt; Some performers appeared in several productions, but each production was cast anew, often with guest stars from British television in leading roles, with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Michael Billington (critic)|Billington, Michael]].

''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 July 2002, accessed 6 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The chorus and orchestra of the new company were much smaller than those of the old company: the chorus was reduced from 32 (or more) to 20, and the orchestra from 38 generally to 24.&lt;ref name=Bradley62/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See D'Oyly Carte programme booklets from Sadler's Wells 1977–78 season and the Savoy Theatre 2002 season.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a 1998 production of ''Pirates'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]], the orchestra was even smaller:  ''The Guardian'' wrote, "The goings-on in the pit are dispiriting. Budgetary constraints have forced the company to re-write the score for a band of nine instrumentalists. They play well enough, but every one of Sullivan's parodies loses its clout."&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Tim. "Tattered and tired Pirates", ''The Guardian,'' 30 December 1998, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The company received a modest Arts Council grant in 1997 to keep it afloat and turned to private funding from [[Raymond Gubbay]] for London seasons beginning in 1998.  Despite the lean forces, the company received generally favourable reviews over the next five years under the management of Ian Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), pp. 63–67&lt;/ref&gt; Although the new company's productions met with mixed reviews, some of its recordings have been well received.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Shepherd, Marc.

''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' (1999), in which the company's new release is described as "the most important ''Yeomen'' recording made to date"&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these recordings also restore music that had been cut by Gilbert and Sullivan or the company over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2005), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  Gubbay felt over-committed by 2003 and pulled out.

==Principal performers==
[[File:George Grossmith as Bunthorne, Patience, 1881.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[George Grossmith]] as Bunthorne in ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'']]Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados frequently use the names of the principal comedians of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to refer to time periods of the company's history.&lt;ref name=Wilsonpassim&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after the sudden death of Sullivan's brother Fred, who had created the role of the Learned Judge in ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' in 1875, the unknown [[George Grossmith]] was recruited in 1877.  Before Grossmith left the company in 1889, he created the principal comic roles in nine of the operas, and so the principal comedian parts in the operas are often referred to as the "Grossmith" roles.&lt;ref name=Wilsonpassim/&gt; Other performers who created a long series of roles in the original productions of the operas included [[baritone]] [[Rutland Barrington]], [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Jessie Bond]], [[soprano]] [[Leonora Braham]], [[contralto]] [[Rosina Brandram]], [[tenor]] [[Durward Lely]] and [[bass-baritone]] [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]].  In the original New York City productions and British touring productions, soprano [[Geraldine Ulmar]], baritone [[Signor Brocolini]], comic [[George Thorne (actor)|George Thorne]] and bass-baritone [[Fred Billington]] became particularly well known.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 19–46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passmore as Grand Duke Rudolph 1896.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Walter Passmore|Passmore]] as Rudolph in ''[[The Grand Duke]]'']]
After Grossmith left the company, the most notable players of his roles during the rest of Gilbert's lifetime were [[Walter Passmore]] (principal comedian from 1894 to 1903) and [[Charles H. Workman]], who played the roles on tour with the company from 1897 and took over as principal comedian at the Savoy between 1906 and 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 59–87&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these performers made recordings of songs from the [[Savoy operas]].  During the Passmore era, principal players of the company included Brandram and Barrington, as well as tenor [[Robert Evett]], soprano [[Isabel Jay]], sopranos [[Ruth Vincent]] and [[Florence St. John]], tenor [[Courtice Pounds]] and his sister, mezzo-soprano [[Louie Pounds]].  During Workman's tenure, principal players included contralto [[Louie René]], soprano [[Clara Dow]], [[Leo Sheffield]], and a young [[Henry Lytton]].  No complete recordings of the operas were made that included active members of the Company until the 1920s.  Workman and W. S. Gilbert quarrelled over their production of ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' in 1909, and Gilbert banned Workman from appearing in his works in Britain.  It is likely that, otherwise, Workman would have continued as principal comedian of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Roderick.  "A review of ''Lytton&amp;nbsp;– Gilbert and Sullivan's Jester'' by Brian Jones" in ''The Gaiety'' (Summer, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] wrote to Workman in 1919 asking him to return to the company as principal comedian, but Workman declined.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Paul. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/fallen_fairies/cast.html ''Fallen Fairies'' cast information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001175342/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/fallen_fairies/cast.html |date=1 October 2009 }} at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 19 March 2005, accessed 4 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1909 to 1934, the principal comedian was Henry Lytton, who had been playing a variety of roles with the company steadily since 1887.  He received a knighthood for his performances during his long tenure with the company.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Lytton's voice deteriorated during his later career, and when HMV embarked on a series of complete recordings of the operas after World War I, Lytton was not invited to record most of his roles.  Instead, the concert singer [[George Baker (record singer)|George Baker]] was brought in to substitute.  Other performers from this period include mezzo-soprano [[Nellie Briercliffe]], bass-baritone [[Darrell Fancourt]], who is estimated to have portrayed the Mikado of Japan more than 3,000 times, contralto [[Bertha Lewis]], tenor [[Derek Oldham]], soprano [[Elsie Griffin]] and baritones Leo Sheffield and [[Sydney Granville]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, pp. 90–112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Lytton In An Advertisement for The Emerald Isle in The Sketch April 24 1901.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry Lytton]], 1901]]
Lytton was succeeded in 1934 by [[Martyn Green]], who played the principal comic parts until 1951, except for a gap from the end of 1939 to 1946, when [[Grahame Clifford]] replaced him.  Green's time with the company is remembered for the early Decca recordings of the operas.  During Green's tenure, in addition to the long-serving Fancourt, principal players included baritone [[Richard Walker (singer)|Richard Walker]], soprano [[Helen Roberts]], mezzo-soprano [[Marjorie Eyre]], baritone [[Leslie Rands]] and contralto [[Ella Halman]].  Green was followed by [[Peter Pratt]].  He left the company in 1959, after more than eight years as principal comedian, still only 36 years old.  During Pratt's years, principals included bass-baritone [[Donald Adams]], tenor [[Leonard Osborn]] (who later directed the productions), contralto [[Ann Drummond-Grant]] and mezzo-soprano [[Joyce Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 176–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt's successor was [[John Reed (actor)|John Reed]], who served as principal comedian for two decades.&lt;ref name=Wilson178/&gt;  Other stars from this era were [[Thomas Round]], [[Donald Adams]], [[Gillian Knight]], [[Valerie Masterson]] and [[Kenneth Sandford]], all of whom, except the last, left the company for the wider operatic stage of [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]], [[English National Opera]], [[Aix-en-Provence Festival|Aix-en-Provence]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1994), pp. 311–43&lt;/ref&gt;  When Reed left the company in 1979, his understudy [[James Conroy-Ward]] took over until the closure of the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988, the revived company used guest artists for each production.  The most regularly seen principal comedians were Eric Roberts and Richard Suart, both of whom regularly perform the "Grossmith" roles for other opera companies.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Arthur.

In 1948, [[Flanders and Swann]] wrote a song called "In the D'Oyly Cart", a satire of the company and the rote "business" and gestures that it was accused of repeating.  The song was first performed in the revue ''Oranges and Lemons'' (1948) and revived in ''Penny Plain'' (1951).  It was broadcast in 1974 and included as the first track on the 1975 Flanders and Swann album, ''And Then We Wrote''.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

'''Daniel O. Nathan''' is an American philosopher and Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Texas Tech University]]. 
He is known for his expertise on [[aesthetics]], [[ethical theory]], and [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Clercq|first1=Rafael|title=The aesthetic creation theory of art|journal=[[Sztuka i Filozofia]]|date=2009|volume=35|url=https://philarchive.org/archive/DECTAC-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Hells Bells'''" is the first track of ''[[Back in Black]]'', the seventh studio album by Australian [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] and their comeback album after the death of lead singer [[Bon Scott]]. "Hells Bells" is the second single from ''Back in Black'', released on 31 October 1980. The song also appears on ''[[Who Made Who]]'', AC/DC's 1986 soundtrack to the [[Stephen King]] movie ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'' and on both versions of 1992's ''[[AC/DC Live]]''.

==Composition==
The song begins with a [[bell (instrument)|bell]] slowly tolling four times, after which [[Angus Young]] starts playing the song's main riff. [[Malcolm Young]] then joins in, followed by [[Phil Rudd]] on drums and [[Cliff Williams]] on bass. The bell tolls a total of 13 times during the song's introduction.

A {{convert|2,000|lb|adj=on}} cast bronze bell, made by [[John Taylor &amp; Co|John Taylor Bellfounders]] in [[Loughborough]], [[Leicestershire]], was used on the track. It is a replica of the Denison Bell in the Carillon Tower at the Loughborough War Museum. The band first attempted to record the actual Denison Bell, but that proved problematic due to disruptions by [[pigeon]]s nesting in the tower. The AC/DC logo and the words "Hell's Bell" are engraved on the replica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Loughborough Carillon &gt; Issue No. 13 |newspaper= Carillon Chimes |location= Leicestershire, England |date= November 2011 |url= https://sites.google.com/site/loughboroughcarillon/gui-information |accessdate= 19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu 'Ali Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn Muqla al-Shirazi''' ([[Baghdad]], 885/6 – Baghdad, 20 July 940) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] official of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] who rose to high state posts in the early 10th century. His career culminated in his own assumption of the [[vizier]]ate at Baghdad thrice, in 928–930, 932–933 and 934–936. Unable to successfully challenge the growing power of regional emirs, he lost his position to the first ''[[amir al-umara]]'', [[Ibn Ra'iq]], and died in prison. He was also a noted [[Islamic calligraphy|calligrapher]].

==Life==
Ibn Muqla was born in [[Baghdad]], the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], in [[Anno hegirae|AH]] 272 (885/886 CE).&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Sourdel (1971), pp. 886–887&lt;/ref&gt; His career in public service began in [[Fars Province|Fars]], where he served as tax collector. His rise to power in the central government came in 908, under the patronage of the powerful [[vizier]] [[Abu 'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat]], who appointed him in charge of official dispatches.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; It was at this time, under the ineffectual rule of Caliph [[al-Muqtadir]] (r. 908–932 CE) that the civil bureaucracy reached its apex of power in the Abbasid court, but where the achievements of previous reigns in restoring the Caliphate's fortunes collapsed due to chronic financial shortages. Throughout the period, the political scene in Baghdad was dominated by Ibn al-Furat and his faction (the [[Banu'l-Furat]]), his rival [[Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah]] and the faction gathered around him (the [[Banu'l-Jarrah]]), and the powerful chief of the military, [[Mu'nis al-Khadim]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 185–188&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his close ties to Ibn al-Furat, which were re-affirmed during the latter's second tenure in 917–918, Ibn Muqla eventually turned against him. His next promotion came during the ''de facto'' 918–928 vizierate of Ali ibn Isa, when he assumed the important department (''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'') of the public estates.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

By cultivating the friendship of the powerful chamberlain (''[[hadjib]]'') Nasr, Ibn Muqla managed to secure the post of vizier for himself after Ali's disgrace in 928.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; His vizierate however was marked by extreme internal instability, including a short-lived coup in 929, instigated by Mu'nis, which deposed al-Muqtadir in favour of his brother [[al-Qahir]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the coup's failure, Mu'nis and his close ally Ali ibn Isa now dominated the government, and led to Ibn Muqla's dismissal in 930.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

[[File:Iraq Ninth Century.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of Iraq in the 9th–10th centuries]]
Ibn Muqla was reappointed as vizier by al-Qahir when he succeeded al-Muqtadir after the latter's assassination in 932. The new caliph's attempts to assert his own authority met with opposition both from Ibn Muqla and from Mu'nis. Mu'nis started conspiring against al-Qahir, but he was arrested and killed before he could act, whereupon, after only six months in office, Ibn Muqla was dismissed.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Muqla then headed another conspiracy, and in 934 al-Qahir was captured, blinded and deposed by the Baghdad troops, with his brother [[al-Radi]] succeeding him.&lt;ref name="Kennedy194"&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Muqla was now appointed to his third term of office.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; By this time, the greatest threat faced by the Caliphate was the increasing independence of the regional governors, who had taken advantage of the internal quarrels in the Abbasid court to strengthen their own control over their provinces and withheld the taxes due to Baghdad, leaving the central government crippled.&lt;ref name="Kennedy194"/&gt; Ibn Muqla resolved to reassert his control over the neighbouring provinces by military force, and chose the [[Hamdanid]]-controlled [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] as his first target: in 935 he launched a campaign that took the Hamdanid capital, [[Mosul]], but he was forced to return to Baghdad. Another attempt in 936 to launch a campaign against the rebellious governor of [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]], [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], failed to even get started. Coupled with his failure to counter the mounting financial crisis, this last disaster led to Ibn Muqla's dismissal and arrest.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Muqla's dismissal marks also the final end of the independence of the Abbasid caliphs, for shortly after Ibn Ra'iq was appointed to the new post of ''[[amir al-umara]]'' ("commander of commanders"), a military-based office that became the ''de facto'' ruler of what remained of the Caliphate and deprived the Caliph from all real authority.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 195ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Ra'iq had the possessions of Ibn Muqla and his son confiscated, and Ibn Muqla in turn began to conspire against the ''amir al-umara''. Ibn Ra'iq however became aware of this, and had him imprisoned and his right hand cut off. Shortly after, even while the army of the Turkish general [[Bajkam]] was approaching Baghdad to depose Ibn Ra'iq, his tongue was cut. Despite Bajkam's success, Ibn Muqla remained in prison, where he died on 20 July 940.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

==Calligraphy==
Ibn Muqla was also famous as a [[Islamic calligraphy|calligrapher]], and he or his brothers have been considered the originators of the so-called ''[[al-khatt al-mansub]]'' ("proportioned script") style, perfected by the 11th-century Persian calligrapher [[Ibn al-Bawwab]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; "Khatt" refers to the "marking out" of lines, which suggests that calligraphy is a demarcation of space. In the al-khatt al-mansub system letter design is related to three measurements: the size of [[nuqta]]; the height of the alif; and the circle with a diameter equal to the height of the alif.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mediation of Ornament|last=Grabar|first=Oleg|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1992|series=The A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts|volume=XXXV|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborn|first=J.R.|year=2009|title=Narratives of Arabic Script: Calligraphic Design and Modern Spaces|journal=Design and Culture|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of Ibn Muqla's authentic work exists today, his work is only known through other sources like [[Ibn al-Nadim]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Wijdan  (1999).

'''John Orlando Parry''' (3 January 1810 – 20 February 1879) was an English actor, pianist, artist, comedian and singer.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Parry, the only son of Welsh musician [[John Parry (Bardd Alaw)|John Parry]] (known as ''Bardd Alaw''), was born in London and, at an early age, was taught by his father to sing and to play the harp and the piano. He also studied the harp under [[Robert Bochsa]]. As Master Parry, in May 1825, he appeared as a performer on the harp. As a [[baritone]] vocalist he made his début on 7 May 1830 at the [[Hanover Square Rooms]], in London, on the occasion of [[Franz Cramer (violinist)|Franz Cramer]]'s concert, when he sang [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''Arm, arm, ye brave!'' with much success.

[[Image:JOParry.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Humorous manual written and illustrated by Parry]]
Parry was also an illustrator and artist.&lt;ref name=Wales&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-PARR-JOH-1776.html Profile of Parry]&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving lessons from Sir [[George Thomas Smart|George Smart]] in sacred and classical music, he was in demand as a singer at the Antient and Philharmonic concerts, and also at musical festivals in town and country. For him [[Sigismund Neukomm]] composed ''Napoleon's Midnight Review'', and several other songs, but his best efforts were in simple ballads. In 1833 he visited Italy, and received instruction from [[Luigi Lablache]] at [[Naples]], where he resided some time. At Posilippo he gave a concert in a theatre belonging to impresario [[Domenico Barbaja]], the second part of which comprised a burlesque on ''[[Othello]]'', Lablache taking the part of Brabantio; Calvarola, the Liston of Naples, playing the Moor; and Parry as Desdemona, dressed à la [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]], and singing ''Cherry Ripe''. He also appeared before the [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|king and queen]] of the [[Two Sicilies]], and gave imitations of Lablache, Rubini, and Malibran in a mock Italian trio.

[[Image:Parryport1840.jpg|right|220px]]He returned to England in 1834, after perfecting his command of the Italian language.  He married, on 30 June 1835, Anne Combe, the daughter of Henry Combe, a surgeon.  They had a daughter, Maria.  In July 1836 he gave his first benefit concert at the Hanover Square Rooms, when Malibran sang for him, and he joined her in Mazzinghi's duet ''When a little farm we keep.'' Persuaded to try the stage, he came out at the [[St. James's Theatre]], just then built by his father's old friend, John Braham, on 29 September 1836, in a burletta called ''The Sham Prince,'' written and composed by his father. He was well received, and on 6 December in the same year he appeared in John Poole's ''Delicate Attentions'', and in a burletta, ''The Village Coquettes,'' written by [[Charles Dickens]], with music by [[John Hullah]]. Subsequently he was for a brief season at the [[Olympic Theatre]]. By 1839, Parry was becoming known as a comic singer, and in 1840 he composed a [[comic opera]] called ''Wanted, a Governess''.&lt;ref name=Wales/&gt;

===Concert room and German Reed entertainments===
In 1842 he forsook the stage for the concert-room, and was singing, with [[Anna Thillon]] and [[Josef Staudigl]], in pieces written expressly for him by [[Albert Richard Smith|Albert Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Athenæum, 10 June 1843, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; Parry afterwards accompanied [[Camillo Sivori]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Sigismund Thalberg]], and others in a concert tour through the United Kingdom, and his powers as a pianist and his originality as a buffo vocalist were widely recognised. In 1849 Albert Smith wrote an entertainment entitled ''Notes Vocal and Instrumental,'' which Parry produced on 25 June 1850 at the [[Store Street Music Hall]], Bedford Square, London, and illustrated with large water-colour paintings executed by himself. In it he indulged in monologue, sang in different voices, played the piano, and made rapid changes of his dress. The entertainment proved more acceptable to the audience than any single-handed performance since the time of Charles Mathews the elder. He was afterwards seen at Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate Street, at Willis's Rooms, King Street, St. James's, and in the provinces. On 17 August 1852 he brought out a new solo entertainment at Store Street, called ''The Portfolio for Children of all Ages'',&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times, 23 May 1852, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; which he continued with much success until August 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Athenæum, 13 August 1853, p. 970&lt;/ref&gt; The strain of this engagement, however, proved excessive, and for a time he suffered from mental derangement.  When somewhat recovered, he became organist at St. Jude's Church, [[Southsea]], and gave lessons in singing.&lt;ref name=Wales/&gt;

On 4 June 1860, he joined [[Thomas German Reed]] and [[Priscilla Horton|his wife]] at the [[Gallery of Illustration]], [[Regent Street]], London. Here he performed for nearly nine years, presenting a series of droll impersonations and musical monologues that inspired other comedians, including [[George Grossmith]].  He built comic sketches with musical illustrations around his own comic songs. He wrote these entertainments, composed his own music, and played his own accompaniments.

===Retirement===
On 15 July 1869 a complimentary benefit was given him by a distinguished party of amateurs at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], and on 7 February 1877 he took a farewell benefit at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], which realised £1,300. His later years were embittered by the loss in 1877, through the defalcations of his solicitor, of the greater part of his forty years' savings.

He died at the residence of his daughter, Pembroke Lodge, [[East Molesey]], Surrey, at the age of 69, and was buried in East Molesey cemetery. A miniature portrait of Parry by Maclise is in the possession of Horace N. Pym, Esq.

==Works==
[[Image:Parrywatercolour.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Parry watercolour, 1835]]Parry was the composer of numerous songs and ballads, all of which he sang in his own entertainments. The following were printed: ''Wanted, a Governess'' (1840), ''Fair Daphne'' (1840), ''Anticipations of Switzerland'' (1842), ''The Accomplished Young Lady'' (1843), ''My déjeuner à la Fourchette'' (1844), ''The Polka explained'' (1844), ''Fayre Rosamond'' (1844), ''Matrimony'' (1845), ''Young England'' (1845), ''Miss Harriet and her Governess'' (1847), ''The Flying Dutchman'' (1848), ''Coralie'' (1853), ''Charming Chloe Cole'' (1854), ''Oh, send me not away from home'' (1854), ''Little Mary of the Dee'' (1855), ''In lonely bow'r bemoans the turtle dove'' (1855), ''The Tyrolese Fortune-teller'' (1867), ''Bridal Bells'' (1868), ''Cupid's Flight'' (1868), ''Don't be too particular'' (1868), ''Take a bumper and try'' (1874), and ''The Musical Wife'' (1878).

Duets: ''Fond Memory'' (1855), ''A B C'' (1863), ''Tell me, gentle stranger'' (1863), ''We are two roving minstrels'' (1864), and ''Flow, gentle Deva'' (1872). He also wrote the [[Glee (music)|glees]], ''Come, fairies, trip it on the grass'' (prior to 1851) and ''Oh! it is that her lov'd one's away'' (1853), and ''Parables set to Music'', three numbers (1859), besides much music for the piano, including many polkas.

The Melodists' Club awarded to Parry prizes for the following songs: ''The Inchcape Bell'', ''The Flying Dutchman'', ''A Heart to let'', ''Sweet Mary mine'', ''The Gipsy's Tambourine Song'', ''Nant Gwynnant'', ''You know'', ''Constancy'', ''Fair Daphne'', and ''The Days of Yore''. Some of his songs were arranged as quadrilles by L. Negri in 1842, and L. G. Jullien's ''Buffa Quadrilles'' in 1844 were also composed from the tunes of his vocal melodies.

'''''La Sainte Courtisane''''' ({{IPA-fr|la sɛ̃t kuʁ.ti.zan|pron}}, [[French language|French]] for "The Holy [[Courtesan]]") is an [[unfinished work|unfinished play]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] written in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; The original draft was left in a taxi cab by the author, and was never completed. It was first published in 1908 by Wilde's literary executor, Robert Ross.&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. "
''La Sainte Courtisane'' by Oscar Wilde. Dramatic Oxymoron and Saintly Pursuits" in ''The Journal of Drama Studies'' January 2007, pp.57-71 (http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Library/Severi.htm Retrieved 2011-02-06)&lt;/ref&gt; It has never been performed, and has been little studied.

==Summary==

===''Dramatis Personae''===
*Myrrhina, a rich temptress and the "Courtisane" of the title
*Honorius, a hermit of the desert who will not look at women
*First and Second Man, who talk to Myrrhina, provide exposition about Honorius and talk of the gods they have seen.

===Synopsis===
The play is incomplete. The plot of the existing segment is as follows: Myrrhina is an Alexandrian noblewoman who travels to the mountains to tempt Honorius, a Christian hermit, away from goodness with her beauty and wealth. After they talk, he decides to return to sin in Alexandria while she discovers religion and chooses to remain in the desert.

[[Robbie Ross]] summarises the complete plot in his introduction to ''Miscellanies'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Honorius the hermit, so far as I recollect the story, falls in love with the courtesan who has come to tempt him, and he reveals to her the secret of the Love of God.  She immediately becomes a Christian, and is murdered by robbers; Honorius the hermit goes back to Alexandria to pursue a life of pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Robbie (ed.) in Wilde, Oscar ''Miscellanies''. 1908, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Oscar Wilde began work on the play in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; between writing ''[[Salome]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but did not complete it before his trial and imprisonment. The fragments were first published in 1908 in Methuen's ''Collected Works'', along with an introduction by Robbie Ross which explained its intervening history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At the time of Wilde’s trial the nearly completed drama was entrusted to Mrs. Leverson, who in 1897 went to Paris on purpose to restore it to the author.  Wilde immediately left the manuscript in a cab...All my attempts to recover the lost work failed.  The passages here reprinted are from some odd leaves of a first draft.  The play is of course not unlike Salome, though it was written in English.  It expanded Wilde’s favourite theory that when you convert some one to an idea, you lose your faith in it; the same motive runs through Mr. W. H."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Robbie (ed.) in Wilde, Oscar ''Miscellanies''. 1908, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wilde considered revisiting the play in 1897 after his release from prison,&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; but he lacked motivation for literary work in this period.

==Reception==
Wilde's own opinion of the play changed over time. During his imprisonment, it was much on his mind,&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. "
''La Sainte Courtisane'' by Oscar Wilde. Dramatic Oxymoron and Saintly Pursuits" in ''The Journal of Drama Studies'' January 2007, pp.57-71 (http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Library/Severi.htm Retrieved 2011-02-06)&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as one among his "beautiful coloured, musical things".&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde, edited by M. Holland and R. Hart-Davis, New York 2000, p. 759&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ross describes his changed mood after his release:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A few days later he laughingly informed me of the loss, and added that a cab was a very proper place for it.  I have explained elsewhere that he looked on his plays with disdain in his last years, though he was always full of schemes for writing others."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Robbie (ed.) in Wilde, Oscar ''Miscellanies''. 1908, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biographer [[Richard Ellmann]] identifies a similarity to [[Anatole France]]'s novel ''[[Thaïs]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, Richard. ''Oscar Wilde''. Penguin Books, 1987, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Rita Severi also suggests [[Saint Pelagia]], Saint Mary the Egyptian, [[Mary Magdalen]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]] as models for Myrrhina, and the Indian legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] as inspiration for the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. "

Severi has compared the exploration of the spiritual and sensual life to a similar thread running throughout ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', ''[[Salome]]'' and ''[[The Fisherman and his Soul]]'', identifying it as part of "Wilde’s Parisian, [[Symbolist]] phase":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"La Sainte Courtisane is neither a comedy nor a parody. It contains all the elements of  the Symbolist Mystery play: symbolic characters that embody ethical, philosophical, spiritual ideas; one main action (drama) that unfolds in three macro-sequences or tableaux and around which the whole play revolves, in some unidentified space (the desert) and time ( a timeless past); highly metaphoric, repetitive language that reverberates in the rhythmic dialogue like a music of words or, as Wilde had said of the language of Salomé, like the sound of a pearl that falls on a silver basin. Elaborate speech patterns that unfold a double meaning, an allegory."&lt;ref&gt;Severi, Rita. " ''La Sainte Courtisane'' by Oscar Wilde. Dramatic Oxymoron and Saintly Pursuits" in ''The Journal of Drama Studies'' January 2007, pp.57-71 (http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Library/Severi.htm Retrieved 2011-02-06)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christopher S. Nassaar described the play as "a minor ''jeux d’esprit''",&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Nassaar, Wilde’s La Sainte Courtisane, in “Explicator”, Fall 1997, pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and places it in context as a "bridge" between ''[[Salome]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.

[[Rudolf Wagner-Régeny]] set the fragments to music in 1930 for 4 speakers and chamber orchestra.

The '''Langlois Bridge at Arles''' is the subject of four oil paintings, one watercolor and four drawings by [[Vincent van Gogh]].  The works, made in 1888 when Van Gogh lived in [[Arles]], in [[southern France]],  represent a melding of formal and creative aspects.  Van Gogh leverages a [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] frame that he built and used in [[The Hague]] to create precise lines and angles when portraying perspective.

Van Gogh was influenced by [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut print]]s, as evidenced by his simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image.  Contrasting colors, such as blue and yellow, were used to bring a vibrancy to the works.  He painted with an [[impasto]], or thickly applied paint, using color to depict the reflection of light. The subject matter, a drawbridge on a canal, reminded him of his homeland in the [[Netherlands]]. He asked his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] to frame and send one of the paintings to an art dealer in the Netherlands. The reconstructed [[Langlois Bridge]] is now named ''[[Langlois Bridge|Pont Van-Gogh]]''.

==Background==

===Arles===
Van Gogh was 35 when he made the Langlois Bridge paintings and drawings.  Living in [[Arles]], in [[southern France]], he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work:&lt;ref name=Morton&gt;Morton, 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflowers]], [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|fields]], farmhouses and people of the Arles, [[Nîmes]] and [[Avignon]] areas.&lt;ref name=Arfin&gt;Arfin, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a prolific time for Van Gogh: in less than 15 months&lt;ref&gt;Shoham, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; he made about 100 drawings, produced more than 200 paintings and wrote more than 200 letters.&lt;ref name=NGAsun&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |page=131 (12 of pdf) |publisher=National Gallery of Art |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[canal]]s, [[drawbridge]]s, [[windmill]]s, [[Thatching|thatched cottages]] and expansive fields of the Arles countryside reminded Van Gogh of his life in the [[Netherlands]]. Arles brought him the solace and bright sun that he sought for himself and conditions to explore painting with more vivid colors, intense color contrasts and varied brushstrokes.  He also returned to the roots of his artistic training from the [[Netherlands]], most notably with the use of a [[reed pen]] for his drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 60—61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Langlois Bridge===
{{main|Langlois Bridge}}
[[File:Van gogh bruecke 1902.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The original drawbridge, 1902. It was replaced by a reinforced-concrete bridge in 1930. At Van Gogh's time, it was called ''Pont de Langlois'', Langlois' bridge, after its bridge keeper. The bridge has been relocated and renamed ''Pont Van-Gogh'']]
The Langlois Bridge was one of the crossings over the Arles to [[Port-de-Bouc|Bouc]] canal.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the first half of the 19th century to expand the network of canals to the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean Sea]].  [[Lock (water transport)|Locks]] and bridges were built, too, to manage water and road traffic. Just outside Arles, the first bridge was the officially titled "Pont de Réginel" but better known by the keeper's name as "Pont de Langlois".&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VGM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3761&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en |title=The Langlois Bridge |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-04-28 |postscript='  See 'Ropes' and 'Something Funny' sections of the page for more information.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the original drawbridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete structure which, in 1944, was blown up by the retreating Germans who destroyed all the other bridges along the canal except for the one at [[Fos-sur-Mer]], a port on the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean Sea]].  The Fos Bridge was dismantled in 1959 with a view to relocating it on the site of the Langlois Bridge but as a result of structural difficulties, it was finally reassembled at Montcalde Lock several kilometers away from the original site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/images/document/canal%20Arles%20Bouc%20Rimeur.pdf |author=Rimeur, L | title=Note sur le canal d'Arles à Bouc | pages=43–44 |date=December 1981 – March 1982 |  accessdate=2011-05-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929041232/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/images/document/canal%20Arles%20Bouc%20Rimeur.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-29|work=Bulletin des Amis du Vieil Arles|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projetbabel.org/fluvial/rica_arles-bouc-canal.htm |title=Canal d'Arles à Bouc | work=Projet Babel | accessdate=2011-05-14|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to letters to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], Van Gogh began a study of women washing clothes near the Langlois Bridge about mid-March 1888&lt;ref name=L469/&gt; and was working on another painting of the bridge about April 2.&lt;ref name=L473&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/473.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 2 April 1888 in Arles. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first of several versions he painted of the Langlois Bridge that crossed the Arles canal.&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;

Reflecting on Van Gogh's works of the Langlois Bridge [[Debora Silverman]], author of the book ''Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art'' comments, "Van Gogh's depictions of the bridge have been considered a quaint exercise in nostalgia mingled with [[Japonism|Japonist]] allusions." Van Gogh approached the making of the paintings and drawings about the bridge in a "serious and sustained manner" with attention to "the structure, function, and component parts of this craft mechanism in the landscape."&lt;ref name=Silverman69&gt;Silverman, 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perspective frame===
In Arles Van Gogh began using again a [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] frame he had built in [[The Hague]].  The device was used for outdoor sightings to compare the proportion of items that were near to those that were in the distance.  Some of the works of the Langlois Bridge were made with the aid of the frame. Its use "deepened his exploration of the drawbridge as a mechanism."&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 62, 63, 74, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese influence===
The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of [[Hiroshige]]'s print ''[[:File:Hiroshige Van Gogh 2.JPG|Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge]]''.&lt;ref name=Mancoff61&gt;Mancoff, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired by the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut print|wood block prints]], Van Gogh sought to integrate techniques from Japanese artwork into his own. In a letter to [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] about the Langlois Bridge, he wrote: "If the Japanese are not making any progress in their own country, still it cannot be doubted that their art is being continued in France."  With a Japanese aesthetic, Van Gogh's Langlois Bridge paintings reflect a simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image.  Outlines were used to suggest movement. He used fewer shades of colors, preferring multiple subtle color variations. The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of [[Hiroshige]]'s ''Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge'' inspiring him to use blocks of colors, like patterns of yellow against a blue sky, colors chosen to create a sense of vitality&lt;ref name=Mancoff61/&gt; of the Japanese prints and the vibrant quality of light in  southern France.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches created a more powerful impact and depicted the simpler, primitive quality of the country lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Maurer63&gt;Maurer, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three paintings with similar compositions==
''The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Women Washing'' is one of van Gogh's most iconic and best loved paintings, acknowledged as the first masterpiece of his Arles period.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1986), 308&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts common canal-side activities.  A little yellow cart crosses the bridge while a group of women in smocks and multicoloured caps wash linen on the shore.&lt;ref name=L469&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/469.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Arles, c. 14 March 1888 |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=L473/&gt;  Van Gogh skillfully uses his knowledge of [[color theory]] and the "law of simultaneous contrasts"&lt;ref&gt;Fell, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; in this work.  The grass is depicted with alternating brush strokes of red-orange and green.  Yellow and blue [[complementary color]]s are used in the bridge, sky and river.  Use of complementary colors intensifies the impact of each color creating a "vibrant and coloristically unified whole."&lt;ref name=Mauer64/&gt;

Naomi Mauer, author of ''The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin'' describes Van Gogh's technical and artistic execution of this painting. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Compositionally, the vertical and horizontal geometry of the bridge and its reflection in the water create a great central cross which imparts a classical symmetry and equilibrium to the canvas.  This central geometric framework, which is echoed and enclosed by the bands of sky above and the bank below, is relieved and enlivened by the great undulating sweep of the hill and shore, the round knot of washerwomen amid the circular ripples of the water, and the flexible, slightly curved grasses at the right.  Both formally and chromatically, the ''Bridge of Langlois'' demonstrates Vincent's abstraction of nature to its essential coloristic and formal elements, and his creation from these components of a harmoniously interwoven unity in which humanity and its works are perfectly integrated."&lt;ref name=Mauer64&gt;Maurer, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For ''The Langlois Bridge at Arles (watercolor)'' Van Gogh manages to create precise details of the bridge, such as the hardware, iron supports, braces and chain pulleys with watercolor.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two other paintings==

===''The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Road alongside the Canal''===
Van Gogh used varying techniques when he created the painting, depending upon the subject and what he wanted to convey.  The grass and the path in the foreground were painted rapidly.  The bridge, though, was painted in greater detail,&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 71-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/popup.jsp?page=3768 |title=Detail, The Langlois Bridge |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with clearly defined stone piers and wooden beams.  The detail in the ropes used to lift the roadway show that they are attached to the wooden lifting gear.  Van Gogh also pays close attention to the reflection of the bridge in the water.  In the distance is another drawbridge.&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;

Van Gogh claimed the painting as "something funny... I will not create every day."&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker, 308.&lt;/ref&gt; There was something about the setting for this painting that reminded him of his homeland.&lt;ref name=Arfin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  He asked his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands,&lt;ref name=VGM /&gt; named Tersteeg.&lt;ref name=L473 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh, Smith (2011), 578&lt;/ref&gt; Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague.  He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named [[Sien (Van Gogh series)|Sien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=7822&amp;lang=en |title=Van Gogh and Tersteeg|work=Permanent Collection |publisher= Van Gogh Museum | accessdate = 2011-04-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915004414/http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=7822&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Van Gogh Museum]] claims that the painting is the last in a series of three,&lt;ref name=VGM/&gt; yet Silverman has identified four oil paintings and a fifth watercolor, as outlined in this article.&lt;ref name= Silverman69 /&gt;

===''The Langlois Bridge at Arles''===
[[Wallraf-Richartz Museum|Wallraf-Richartz Museum's]] ''Langlois Bridge at Arles'' depicts a woman holding an umbrella as she crosses the [[Langlois Bridge]], following a horse and buggy that just crossed the bridge.  The water in the canal subtly reflects the bridge and the few clouds in the sky.  Van Gogh uses [[impasto]] paint and color to reflect light, much as we would see it in with our eye. Two tall cypress trees and a white house flank the drawbridge which has a moveable center section between stone abutments.&lt;ref&gt;Perkowitz, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is currently at the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/281/Langlois-Bridge-at-Arles,-The.html |title=Langlois Bridge at Arles, The |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Drawings==
Soon after arriving in Arles Van Gogh asked his brother to send him a copy of Armand Cassagne's ''Guide to the Alphabet of Drawing''.  His request was generated by an interest to return to foundational drawing practices, such as his use of a perspective frame for the drawings and paintings that he made of Langlois Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 61-64.&lt;/ref&gt; A letter dated March 18, 1888, to his friend Émile Bernard contains a sketch of the bridge (JH 1370 below) and the color scheme he is considering adopting, clearly showing his use of sketching and drawing as a preliminary to his painting. He spoke of how the town (Arles) "projects the strange silhouette of its drawbridge against a huge yellow sun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/11/langlois-bridge.html | title=Langlos Bridge, Letters of Note | accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in Other Media==
[[Arthur C. Clarke]] made reference to Van Gogh's ''Bridge at Arles'' in his novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. In it the character [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] notices the painting (along with [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s ''[[Christina's World]]'') when observing the living room of "an elegant, anonymous hotel suite" after travelling through the Stargate.

Argentine musician [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] referenced the painting in "Cantata de puentes amarillos" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "[[Cantata]] of yellow bridges"), one of his most celebrated songs. Spinetta came to Van Gogh's letters to Theo through his reading of the essay ''Van Gogh, The Man Suicided'' by [[Antonin Artaud]]. The track is the centerpiece of his 1973 record ''[[Artaud (album)|Artaud]]'', named after the poet, which is generally considered the greatest album in [[Argentine rock]] history.&lt;ref name="MDZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdzol.com/opinion/483838/|language=Spanish|title=Artaud, Spinetta y 40 años de belleza|date=2013-08-17|accessdate=2018-01-06|publisher=[[MDZ Online]]|last=Gazzo|first=Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting  is also featured on the 30th season of ''The Amazing Race'', where as part of the detour challenge, teams will find this painting, which in reality is a elaborate sliding puzzle, requiring them to slide elements of the painting in a specific sequence in order to unlock the [[easel]] and retrieve their clue inside.

The '''Language poets''' (or '''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'']] poets''', after the magazine of that name) are an ''[[avant garde]]'' group or tendency in [[United States poetry]] that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The poets included: [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Stephen Rodefer]], [[Bruce Andrews]], [[Charles Bernstein]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Susan Howe]], and [[Tina Darragh]].

Language poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It played down expression, seeing the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In developing their [[poetics]], members of the Language school took as their starting point the emphasis on method evident in the [[modernist poetry|modernist]] tradition, particularly as represented by [[Gertrude Stein]], [[William Carlos Williams]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]]. Language poetry is an example of poetic [[postmodernism]]. Its immediate postmodern precursors were the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], a term including the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], the [[Objectivist poets]], the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]], the [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets, and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].

Certain aspects of the writing of language poets became strongly associated with the members of this group: [[writing]] that challenged the "[[nature|natural]]" presence of a speaker behind the text; writing that emphasized [[disjunction]] and the [[Substance theory|materiality]] of the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]]; and [[prose poetry]], especially in longer [[poetic form|form]]s than had previously been favored by English-language writers, as well as other non-traditional and usually non-narrative forms.

Language poetry has been a [[controversy|controversial topic]] in American [[Literature|letters]] from the 1970s to the present. Even the name has been controversial: while a number of poets and critics have used the name of the journal to refer to the group, many others have chosen to use the term, when they used it at all, without the [[equals sign]]s. The terms "language writing" and "language-centered writing" are also commonly used, and are perhaps the most generic terms. None of the poets associated with the tendency has used the equal signs when referring to the writing collectively. Its use in some critical articles can be taken as an indicator of the author's outsider status.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Greer's article, "Ideology and Theory in Recent Experimental Writing or, the Naming of 'Language Poetry,'" ''boundary 2'', Vol. 16, No. 2/3 (Winter – Spring, 1989), pp. 335–355; and in [[Bob Perelman]], ''The Marginalization of Poetry;'' [[Lyn Hejinian]], ''The Language of Inquiry;'' [[Barrett Watten]], ''The Constructivist Moment;'' [[Ron Silliman]], ''The New Sentence''; and [[Charles Bernstein]], ''My Way: Speeches and Poems.''&lt;/ref&gt; There is also debate about whether or not a writer can be called a language poet without being part of that specific coterie; is it a style or is it a group of people?

Online writing samples of many language poets can be found on internet sites, including blogs and sites maintained by authors and through gateways such as the [[Electronic Poetry Center]], [[PennSound]], and [[UbuWeb]].

==History==

The movement has been highly decentralized. On the West Coast, an early seed of language poetry was the launch of ''[[This (magazine)|This]]'' magazine, edited by [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]] and Watten, in 1971. ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'', edited by [[Bruce Andrews]] and [[Charles Bernstein]], ran from 1978 to 1982, and was published in New York. It featured poetics, forums on writers in the movement, and themes such as "The Politics of Poetry" and "Reading Stein". [[Ron Silliman]]'s poetry newsletter ''Tottel's'' (1970–81),&lt;ref&gt;available on-line at the ''Eclipse'' archive, link here: [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ ''Tottel's Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Andrews]]'s selections in a special issue of ''Toopick'' (1973), as well as [[Lyn Hejinian]]'s editing of Tuumba Press, and James Sherry's editing of ROOF magazine also contributed to the development of ideas in language poetry. The first significant collection of language-centered poetics was the article, "The Politics of the Referent," edited by [[Steve McCaffery]] for the Toronto-based publication, ''Open Letter'' (1977).

In an essay from the first issue of ''This'', Grenier declared: "I HATE SPEECH". Grenier's ironic statement (itself a speech act), and a questioning attitude to the referentiality of language, became central to language poets. Ron Silliman, in the introduction to his anthology ''In the American Tree,'' appealed to a number of young U.S. poets who were dissatisfied with the work of the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] and [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets.

: "Thus capitalized, these words in an essay entitled "On Speech," the second of five short critical pieces by Robert Grenier in the first issue of ''This'', the magazine he cofounded with Barrett Watten in winter, 1971, announced a breach – and a new moment in American writing.

The range of poetry published that focused on "[[Philosophy of language|language]]" in ''This,'' ''Tottel's,'' ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', and also in several other key publications and essays of the time, established the field of discussion that would emerge as Language (or L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E) poetry.

During the 1970s, a number of magazines published poets who would become associated with the Language movement. These included ''A Hundred Posters'' (edited by [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]]), ''Big Deal,'' ''Dog City,'' ''Hills,'' ''Là Bas,'' ''MIAM,'' ''Oculist Witnesses,'' ''QU,'' and ''Roof.'' ''[[Poetics Journal]],'' which published writings in poetics and was edited by [[Lyn Hejinian]] and [[Barrett Watten]], appeared from 1982 to 1998. Significant early gatherings of Language writing included Bruce Andrews's selection in ''Toopick'' (1973); Silliman's selection "The Dwelling Place: 9 Poets" in ''Alcheringa,'' (1975), and Charles Bernstein's "A Language Sampler," in ''The Paris Review'' (1982).

Certain poetry reading series, especially in New York, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, were important venues for the performance of this new work, and for the development of dialogue and collaboration among poets. Most important were Ear Inn reading series in New York, founded in 1978 by Ted Greenwald and Charles Bernstein and later organized through James Sherry's Segue Foundation and curated by Mitch Highfill, Jeanne Lance, Andrew Levy, Rob Fitterman, Laynie Brown, Alan Davies, and [[The Poetry Society of New York]]; Folio Books in Washington, D.C., founded by Doug Lang; and the Grand Piano reading series in San Francisco, which was curated by [[Barrett Watten]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Carla Harryman]], and [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]] at various times.

Poets, some of whom have been mentioned above, who were associated with the first wave of Language poetry include: [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Stephen Rodefer]] (1940–2015), [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]], [[Abigail Child]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[P. Inman]], [[Lynne Dryer]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Michael Gottlieb (poet)|Michael Gottlieb]], [[Fanny Howe]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Jackson Mac Low]] (1922–2004), [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], [[Steve McCaffery]], [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Nick Piombino]], [[Peter Seaton]] (1942–2010), [[Joan Retallack]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[James Sherry (poet)|James Sherry]], [[Jean Day]], [[Kit Robinson]], [[Ted Greenwald]], [[Leslie Scalapino]] (1944–2010), [[Diane Ward]], [[Rosmarie Waldrop]], and [[Hannah Weiner]] (1928–1997). This list accurately reflects the high proportion of [[List of women poets|female poets]] across the spectrum of the Language writing movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ann Vickery|title=Leaving Lines of Gender: A Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[African-American literature|African-American poets]] associated with the movement include Hunt, [[Nathaniel Mackey]], and [[Harryette Mullen]].

==Poetics of language writing: theory and practice==
Language poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It developed in part in response to what poets considered the uncritical use of expressive lyric sentiment among earlier poetry movements. In the 1950s and 1960s, certain groups of poets had followed [[William Carlos Williams]] in his use of [[idiomatic]] American English rather than what they considered the 'heightened', or overtly poetic language favored by the [[New Criticism]] movement. [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets like [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Black Mountain poets|the Black Mountain group]] emphasized both speech and everyday language in their poetry and poetics.

In contrast, some of the Language poets emphasized [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]] and extreme instances of [[parataxis|paratactical]] structures in their compositions, which, even when employing everyday speech, created a far different texture. The result is often alien and difficult to understand at first glance, which is what Language poetry intends: for the reader to participate in creating the meaning of the poem.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]]'s ''RADI OS'' in  [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/LANGUAGEn1/pictures/007.shtml L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, volume 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Watten's &amp; Grenier's magazine '''[[This (magazine)|This]]''' (and '''[[This Press]]''' which  Watten edited), along with the magazine ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', published work by notable [[Black Mountain poets]] such as [[Robert Creeley]] and [[Larry Eigner]]. Silliman considers Language poetry to be a continuation (albeit incorporating a critique) of the earlier movements. Watten has emphasized the discontinuity between the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], whose writing, he argues, privileged self-expression, and the Language poets, who see the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In contrast, Bernstein has emphasized the expressive possibilities of working with constructed, and even found, language.

[[Gertrude Stein]], particularly in her writing after ''Tender Buttons,'' and [[Louis Zukofsky]], in his book-length poem ''A,'' are the modernist poets who most influenced the Language school. In the postwar period, [[John Cage]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], and poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] ([[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Ted Berrigan]]) and [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]] ([[Robert Creeley]], [[Charles Olson]], and [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]) are most recognizable as precursors to the Language poets. Many of these poets used procedural methods based on mathematical sequences and other logical organising devices to structure their poetry. This practice proved highly useful to the language group. The application of process, especially at the level of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], was to become the basic tenet of language [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. Stein's influence was related to her own frequent use of language divorced from reference in her own writings. The language poets also drew on the philosophical works of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially the concepts of [[language-game]]s, meaning as use, and [[family resemblance]] among different uses, as the solution to the [[Problem of universals]].

===Language poetry in the early 21st century===
In many ways, what Language poetry is &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;is still being determined. Most of the poets whose work falls within the bounds of the Language school are still alive and still active contributors. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Language poetry was widely received as a significant movement in innovative poetry in the U.S., a trend accentuated by the fact that some of its leading proponents took up academic posts in the [[Poetics]], [[Creative Writing]] and [[English Literature]] departments in prominent universities ([[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]], [[Wayne State University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of Maine]], the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]).

Language poetry also developed affiliations with literary scenes outside the States, notably England, Canada (through the [[Kootenay school of writing]] in Vancouver), [[French literature|France]], the [[USSR]], [[Brazil]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. It had a particularly interesting relation to the UK ''[[avant-garde]]'': in the 1970s and 1980s there were extensive contacts between American Language poets and veteran UK writers like [[Tom Raworth]] and [[Allen Fisher]], or younger figures such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], and [[Ken Edwards]] (whose magazine ''Reality Studios'' was instrumental in the transatlantic dialogue between American and UK ''avant-garde''s). Other writers, such as [[J.H. Prynne]] and those associated with the so-called [[British Poetry Revival#Cambridge|"Cambridge" poetry scene]] ([[Rod Mengham]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Peter Riley]]) were perhaps more skeptical about language poetry and its associated [[polemics]] and theoretical documents, though Geoff Ward wrote a book about the phenomena.

A second generation of poets influenced by the Language poets includes [[Eric Selland]] (also a noted translator of modern Japanese poetry), [[Lisa Robertson (poet)|Lisa Robertson]], [[Juliana Spahr]], the [[Kootenay School]] poets, [[conceptual writing]], [[Flarf]] collectives, and many others.

A significant number of women poets, and magazines and anthologies of innovative women's poetry, have been associated with language poetry on both sides of the Atlantic. They often represent a distinct set of concerns. Among the poets are [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Jean Day]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[Lynne Dreyer]], [[Harryette Mullen]], [[Beverly Dahlen]], [[Johanna Drucker]], [[Abigail Child]], and [[Karen Mac Cormack]]; among the magazines [[HOW/ever]], later the e-based journal [[HOW2]]; and among the anthologies ''[[Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America &amp; the UK]],'' edited by Maggie O'Sullivan for Reality Street Editions in London (1996) and Mary Margaret Sloan's ''[[Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women]]'' (Jersey City: Talisman Publishers, 1998).

Ten of the Language poets, each of whom at one time curated the reading series at the San Francisco coffee house of that name, collaborated to write [http://thegrandpiano.org The Grand Piano], "an experiment in collective autobiography" published in ten small volumes. Editing and communication for the collaboration was accomplished over email. Authors of The Grand Piano were [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Tom Mandel (poet) |Tom Mandel]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Steve Benson (poet) |Steve Benson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Ted Pearson]], and [[Kit Robinson]]. An eleventh member of the project, [[Alan Bernheimer]], served as an archivist and contributed one essay on the filmmaker [[Warren Sonbert]]. The authors of The Grand Piano sought to reconnect their writing practices and to "recall and contextualize events from the period of the late 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;for additional details, commentary, and links see Barrett Watten's piece [http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html How ''The Grand Piano'' Is Being Written {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630065810/http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html |date=2007-06-30 }} and James Sherry's commentaries in Jacket [http://jacketmagazine.com/32/sherry-piano.shtml The Ten-Tone Scale]&lt;/ref&gt; Each volume of ''The Grand Piano'' features essays by all ten authors in different sequence; often responding to prompts and problems arising from one another's essays in the series.

Some poets, such as [[Norman Finkelstein (poet)|Norman Finkelstein]], have stressed their own ambiguous relationship to "Language poetry", even after decades of fruitful engagement. Finkelstein, in a discussion with Mark Scroggins about ''The Grand Piano'', points to a "risk" when previously marginalized poets try to write their own literary histories, "not the least of which is a self-regard bordering on narcissism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kulturindustrie.blogspot.com/2007/04/toy-piano.html Mark Scroggin, "The Toy Piano"], ''Culture Industry'' blog, with commentary by Norman Finkelstein&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xilitla Las Pozas 0407 036.jpg|thumb|The surrealist sculpture park ''Las Pozas'', Xilitla]]

'''Las Pozas''' ("the Pools") is a surrealistic group of structures created by [[Edward James]], more than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} above sea level, in a subtropical rainforest in the mountains of [[Mexico]]. It includes more than {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of natural waterfalls and pools interlaced with towering surrealist sculptures in concrete.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2008/03/30/style/t/index.html#pageName=30laspozas "Dream Works: Can a Legendary Surrealist Garden in Mexico Bloom Again?"], ''New York Times Style Magazine'', 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Las Pozas is near the village of [[Xilitla, San Luis Potosí]], a seven-hour drive north of Mexico City. In the early 1940s, James went to [[Los Angeles, California]], and then decided that he "wanted a Garden of Eden set up . . . and I saw that Mexico was far more romantic" and had "far more room than there is in crowded Southern California".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hooks, [http://www.edwardjameslaspozas.com "Surreal Eden: Edward James &amp; Las Pozas"], Princeton Architectural Press, New York, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-56898-612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hollywood in 1941, his lifetime friend and cousin, [[Magic Realism|Magic Realist]] painter [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]], encouraged him to search for a surreal location in Mexico to express his diverse esoteric interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://BridgetBateTichenor.com/ Bridget Bate Tichenor Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuernavaca, Mexico|Cuernavaca]], he hired Plutarco Gastelum as a guide. They came to know Xilitla in November 1945.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"/&gt; Eventually, Plutarco got married and had four children. James was "Uncle Edward" to the children and frequently stayed with them in a house Plutarco had built, a mock-Gothic cement castle, now a hotel – La Posada El Castillo.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

Between 1949 and 1984, James built scores of surreal concrete structures which carry the names ''The House on Three Floors Which Will in Fact Have Five or Four or Six'', ''The House with a Roof like a Whale'', and ''The Staircase to Heaven''.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"&gt;Gini Alhadeff, [http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/concrete-jungle "Concrete Jungle"], ''Travel + Leisure", September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There were also plantings and beds full of tropical plants, including orchids — there were, apparently, 29,000 at Las Pozas at one time&lt;ref name="TG-6Nov07"&gt;Joanna Moorhead, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/architecture/story/0,,2206530,00.html "The Magic Kingdom (James' Las Pozas, Mexico)"], ''The Guardian'', 6 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; — and a variety of small homes, niches, and pens that held exotic birds and wild animals from the world over—James owned many exotic animals and once even took his pet boa constrictors to the Hotel Francis in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

Massive sculptures up to four stories tall punctuate the site. The many trails throughout the garden site are composed of steps, ramps, bridges and narrow, winding walkways that traverse the valley walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepsandfalls.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=28 "Los Pozas – steps and falls"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416080547/http://www.stepsandfalls.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=28 |date=2008-04-16 }}, virtual tour of the grounds of Las Pozas, DVD, published 2007; retrieved 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of Las Pozas cost more than $5 million. To pay for it, James sold his collection of surrealistic art at an auction.&lt;ref name="L&amp;T"/&gt;

In the summer of 2007, the Fundación Pedro y Elena Hernández, the company [[Cemex]], and the government of [[San Luis Potosí]] paid about $2.2 million for Las Pozas and created [http://www.xilitla.org Fondo Xilitla], a foundation that oversees the preservation and restoration of the site.&lt;ref name="NYT-30Mar08"/&gt;

The items are selected by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], a special body of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]], based on their "especially high historical or artistic value".&lt;ref name="bunkapamphlet"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; "Ancient documents" is one of thirteen categories of National Treasures recognized by the agency. The list presents 62 documents or sets of documents from classical to early modern Japan, from the [[Asuka period]] to the [[Meiji period]]. The actual number of items is more than 62 because groups of related objects have been combined into single entries. The list contains items of various type such as letters, diaries, records or catalogues, certificates, imperial decrees, testaments and maps. The documents record early Japanese government and Buddhism including early Japanese contact with China, the organization of the state and life at the Japanese imperial court. They are housed in 14 Japanese cities in [[Buddhist temple|temples]] (35), museums (13), libraries or archives (6), [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] (4), universities (2) and in private collections (2). Most entries (28) in the list are located in [[Kyoto]]. The documents in this list were made predominantly with a writing brush on paper and, in many cases, present important examples of [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"&gt;{{cite web

Writing was physically introduced to Japan from China in the form of inscribed artefacts at the beginning of the Christian era. Examples, some of which have been designated as [[List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)|archaeological National Treasures]], include coins of the reign of [[Wang Mang]] (AD 8–25), a 1st-century gold seal from Shikanoshima, a late 2nd century iron [[Tōdaijiyama Sword|sword from the Tōdaijiyama burial mound]], the [[Seven-Branched Sword]] with inscription from 369 and a large number of bronze mirrors—the oldest dating to the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="seeley-p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these artefacts originated on the continent, most likely in China. However, the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have been mistaken for decorations by the Japanese.&lt;ref name="seeley-p9"/&gt; When the Japanese later manufactured locally copies of original Chinese mirrors, they may have continued to believe the written inscriptions to be merely decorative.&lt;ref name="seeley-p12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of [[Baekje]] in the form of classical Chinese books likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls (''kansubon'').&lt;ref name="seeley-p9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"/&gt; This probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keally-historic"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend the scholar [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] introduced the Chinese writing system as well as [[Confucianism]] to Japan.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"/&gt; The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a clear understanding of the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal.&lt;ref name="seeley-p16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples include three archaeological National Treasures: [[Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror]] from about the 5th century, which is a poor copy of a Chinese original, the [[Inariyama Sword]] from 471 or 531 and the Eta Funayama burial mound sword from about the 5th century.&lt;ref name="seeley-p17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abrupt transition from an unfamiliarity with writing to reading and writing complicated works in a foreign language required the earliest Japanese texts be composed and read by people from the continent such as Wani.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"/&gt; The Inariyama Sword is also the oldest example of [[man'yōgana]] use, a [[writing system]] that employs [[Chinese character]]s to represent the [[Japanese language]].&lt;ref name="seeley-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the introduction of writing, scribes were appointed to the provinces to "record events and report conditions".&lt;ref name="seeley-p8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sakamoto-p3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sakamoto|1991|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing in Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, the number of documents written locally increased in the 7th century; though most of them have been lost.&lt;ref name="keally-historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to become an integral part of Japanese life.&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; There were two major factors for this development: starting with the [[Taika Reforms]] (645–649) and continuing with the [[Asuka Kiyomihara Code]] (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the ''Daigakuryo'' ("University") founded under [[Emperor Tenchi]].&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by [[Prince Shōtoku]] (574–622).&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; The [[Sangyō Gisho]] ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length.&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (''shakyōjo'') before 727.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Probably much before this date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]], from the early 8th century. While the [[man'yōgana|phonogram orthography]] enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern [[kana]], notably [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] were developed in the [[Heian period]].&lt;ref name="seeley-p55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40700">The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] (RSC) owns a number of significant artworks in its venue at [[Burlington House]] in London. The collection is composed of busts, paintings and other artefacts that were mainly acquired between the mid-19th and early 21st Centuries (the Chemical Society was founded in 1841 and merged with others to become the RSC in 1980). Most of the acquisitions were donations from past members and staff, although a few were purchased directly by the Society.

==Humphry Davy bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 14 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|Humphry Davy bust – Burlington House]]
Located along the corridor on the first floor of Burlington House, the bronze bust of Sir [[Humphry Davy]] was created by Ruby Levick and is a reproduction of an earlier sculpture by Miss Moore, donated to the Chemical Society by Rudolph Messell&lt;ref name=Messel&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudolph Messel|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/m2/rudolph_messel.html|website=Theodora}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudolph Messel|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/37/101037761/|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1900. At the Annual General Meeting of the Chemical Society of 29 March, Sir [[Thomas Edward Thorpe]] (President of the Society), reported on the gift of this work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual General Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions|date=1900|volume=77|page=561|doi=10.1039/ct9007700555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=David|title=The Historical Collection at the Chemistry Centre|date=2010|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=London|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We are indebted to several of our Fellows for additions to the artistic possessions of the Society. [[Heinrich Debus (chemist)|Dr. Debus]] has presented us with a striking bust of Sir Humphry Davy, a cast of one modelled during his lifetime by Miss Moore. In accordance with the donor’s wishes, this bust now appears in our Meeting Room. On the recommendation of [[Thomas Armstrong (painter)|Mr. Thomas Armstrong]], C.B., formerly the Art Director of the Science and Art Department, who was much impressed with the artistic quality of Miss Moore’s work, this bust has been copied by Miss Levick, with certain adaptations taken from Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]]’s well-known portrait in the possession of the [[Royal Society]], and has been reproduced in bronze. The reproduction, together with its pedestal, has been given by our colleague, Dr. Messel.}}

Sir Humphry Davy is best remembered today for his discoveries of several alkali and alkaline earth metals, as well as contributions to the discoveries of the elemental nature of chlorine and iodine.

[[Ruby Levick]] was a Welsh sculptor and medallist who had many of her works exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name=Mapping&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Ruby Levick|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1203032618|website=Mapping the Practise and Profession of Sculpture in Britain &amp; Ireland, 1851–1951|publisher=University of Glasgow, History of Art and HATII, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=T.

==John Dalton bust ==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 15 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|John Dalton bust – Burlington House]]
The bronze bust of [[John Dalton]], located along the corridor on the first floor, was also created by Ruby Levick and was donated to the [[Chemical Society]] in 1903 by its former President Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe,&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt; as also attested by the inscription engraved on the bust's base: "John Dalton presented by T.E. Thorpe CB. L.L.D. F.R.S. past President in commemoration of the centenary of the enunciation of the atomic theory".

A copy of his accompanying letter was printed in the ''[[Proceedings of the Chemical Society]]'' in 1903 and read out by President [[William A. Tilden]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the Chemical Society|journal=Proceedings of the Chemical Society|date=1903|volume=19|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The bronze is the work of Miss Levick, who is already favourably known to the Society by her reproduction of the bust of Davy in their possession. Of the artistic merits of her present work others must be the judge, but I may be permitted here to express my indebtedness to her for the skill and conscientious care with which she has striven to make a faithful and adequate presentment of the grand old philosopher.}}

John Dalton was an English chemist best known for his development of [[atomic theory]].

==William Henry Perkin bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 11 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|William Henry Perkin bust – Burlington House]]
The marble bust on the first floor of Burlington House representing Sir [[William Henry Perkin]] was presented to the Chemical Society in 1907 by the committee administering the fund subscribed in support of the international celebration for the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Coal Tar Colour Industry. At the Annual General Meeting of the Society, President [[Raphael Meldola]] reported on this gift:&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|31}}

{{quote|On the occasion of the International Celebration marking the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Foundation of the Coal Tar Colour Industry, an address of congratulation to Sir William Henry Perkin, F.R.S., was presented on behalf of the Society by the President. In accordance with the resolution of the public meeting at which the commemoration was inaugurated, a marble bust of Sir William Perkin, executed by Mr. F. W. Pomeroy, A.K.A., has been presented to the Society by the Committee administering the Fund subscribed in support of the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual General Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions|date=1907|volume=91|page=618|doi=10.1039/ct9079100615}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Perkin's fame is mainly related to his discovery of [[mauveine]].

The artist, [[Frederick William Pomeroy]], was a British sculptor mainly prolific in ideal work and portrait busts, but also creator of public monuments.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick William Pomeroy|url=http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=pomeroy_fw|website=Glasgow Sculpture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry Roscoe bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 12 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Roscoe bust – Burlington House]]
Next to Perkin bust stands the marble bust representing Sir [[Henry Enfield Roscoe]] by Alfred Drury, donated to the Chemical Society Library on 20 November 1913, on the occasion of Roscoe's eightieth birthday by his friends and pupils,&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|31}} as also attested by the inscription on its base: {{quote|Roscoe 1913 presented by his pupils}}.

In 1914 Professor [[William Henry Perkin, Jr.|William Perkin Jr.]], President of the Society, reported on the gift of this artefact: {{quote|It is with very great pleasure that the Council have to report that a bust of the Right Honourable Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe, by Mr. Alfred Drury, R.A., has been presented to the Society by the friends and former students of Sir Henry Roscoe. The presentation was made before a distinguished company in the Rooms of the Society on November 20th, and the bust now adorns the Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual General Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions|date=1914|volume=105|page=1168|doi=10.1039/ct9140501162}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

President of the Chemical Society between 1880–1882, Roscoe was student as well as friend of the German chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]: in their researches laid the foundation of comparative [[photochemistry]].

English architectural sculptor, [[Alfred Drury|Drury]] was elected Academician of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1913. He studied at the Oxford National Art Training School and in Paris.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

==Justus von Liebig bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 02 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|Justus von Liebig bust – Burlington House]]
On the ground floor of Burlington House, on the left hand side of the entrance hall, is the bronze bust representing Baron [[Justus von Liebig]], presented to the Chemical Society by Rudolph Messel&lt;ref name=Messel /&gt; in 1903:

{{quote|The bust of Liebig which was placed on the table is a gift which the Society owes to the generosity of our Fellow, Dr. Messel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the Chemical Society|journal=Proceedings of the Chemical Society|date=1903|volume=19|issue=267|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
as also confirmed by the inscription on the column supporting the bust: {{quote|Justus von Liebig presented to the Chemical Society by Rudolph Messel Phd May 1903.}}

Another inscription, placed between the back and the right side of the bust itself, provides information about its origin: {{quote|Munchen 1873. M. Wagmuller.}} The artefact was created in [[Munich]] in 1873 by [[Michael Wagmüller]], a German sculptor who completed a number of commissions in London and exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Michael Wagmuller|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib5_1227192993|website=Mapping the Practise and Profession of Sculpture in Britain &amp; Ireland 1851–1951|publisher=University of Glasgow, History of Art and HATII, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Liebig is considered to have greatly contributed to the fields of agricultural and biological chemistry. He developed a manufacturing process for beef extracts and founded a company which later became [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brock|first1=William|title=Justus von Liebig: the chemical gatekeeper|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited as the inventor of [[Marmite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boulton|first1=Christopher|title=Encyclopaedia of Brewing|date=2013|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Augustus Wilhelm von Hofmann bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 06 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustus Wilhelm von Hofmann bust – Burlington House]]
The marble bust representing the German chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] is located on the ground floor. It was introduced to the Chemical Society in 1876 by Mr James Duncan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anniversary Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|date=1876|volume=29|pages=629–630|doi=10.1039/js8762900617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In recording the gratitude of the Society to those Gentlemen, the name of another Fellow, Mr. James Duncan, must be included among the recipients of our thanks, for his gift of a very interesting and valuable bust of one of our most highly-esteemed Fellows and Past Presidents, Professor Hofmann, the presentation of which, so soon after the Society had the pleasure of welcoming Dr. Hofmann as Faraday Lecturer, has been peculiarly appropriate. It is to be hoped that this handsome gift of Mr. Duncan’s and the excellent photograph of the late Dr. Anderson, presented by his widow, will not long remain the only monumental records of this kind possessed by the Society, of eminent workers in chemical science, past and living.}}

The inscription at the back {{quote|Joh. Pfuhl fec. Berlin 1875}} certifies that this artwork was created by the German sculptor [[Johannes Pfuhl]] in Berlin in 1875.

Justus von Liebig's pupil and William Perkin's mentor, von Hofmann widely contributed to the development of the organic chemistry. He was a cofounder of the [[German Chemical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=August Wlhelm von Hofmann|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/August-Wilhelm-von-Hofmann|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the Chemical Society between 1861 and 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings at the Meetings of the Chemical Society|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society of London|date=1862|volume=14|page=353|doi=10.1039/qj8621400347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jean Baptiste André Dumas bust==
[[File:Royal Society of Chemistry artworks - 2015-04-29 - Andy Mabbett - 09 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean Baptiste André Dumas bust – Burlington House]]
In the waiting room, on the ground floor, is a bronze bust of [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas|Jean Baptiste André Dumas]], the French chemist best known for his works on organic analysis and synthesis, as well as the determination of [[atomic weights]] and [[molecular weights]] by measuring [[vapour]] densities.

The sculpture was presented to the Chemical Society in 1885 by [[Warren De la Rue]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual General Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions|date=1885|volume=47|page=302|doi=10.1039/ct8854700300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We have to thank one of our Past Presidents, Dr. De la Rue, who has always shown himself so ready to do anything that will add to the interest of the Society, for the bronze bust of the late Professor Dumas, which has now been placed in the library. It is contemplated placing this, and also that of Professor Hofmann, in more suitable positions than they now occupy.}}

An inscription on the right side of the bust provides us further information: {{quote|Eug Cvillavme 1883.}} The work was created in 1883 by [[Jean-Baptiste Claude Eugène Guillaume]], a French sculptor elected honorary member of the Royal Academy in 1869.

On the ground floor reception of Burlington House, on the left-hand side, can be found a bust of [[Robert Boyle]], who is often regarded today as the first modern chemist.
Acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2003 from the Chelminski Gallery, this veined white marble bust was originally commissioned in 1731 from the Italian sculptor [[Giovanni Battista Guelfi]] (1690–1736)&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=M.I.|title=Giovanni Battista Guelfi: an Italian Sculptor working in England|journal=The Burlington Magazine|date=1955|volume=97|issue=626}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], a relative of Boyle's, for Burlington House, which was then the earl's residence in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giometti|first1=Cristiano|title=Giovanni Battista Guelfi: New Discoveries|journal=The Sculpture Journal|date=1999|volume=3|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the main hall, this artefact was created in the 18th Century. Made of gunmetal raised on a cross-banded walnut and oak base (32&amp;nbsp;cm × 44&amp;nbsp;cm. × 25.5&amp;nbsp;cm), it bears a presentation plaque with the following inscription:

{{quote|This [[pump|airpump]] was made for [[Joseph Priestley|Dr Priestley]] by Mr Harrison the employer of Sir [[Josiah Mason]] when a young man. Presented by Josiah Martin Smith ESQ.}}

Samuel Harrison (1759–1833) was a split ring maker with a workshop in Lancaster Street, Birmingham.

Right next to the airpump stands, raised on an oak plinth, a plaster, full-length figure of Joseph Priestley holding in his hands mortar and pestle, signed and inscribed "Esher" and dated 1874. Another inscription confirms that the statue was presented in 1920 by Mrs Bedford McNeill, as stated in the ''Journal and Proceedings of the [[Institute of Chemists of Great Britain and Ireland]]'' of that year:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Journal and Proceedings|journal=Journal of the Proceedings of the Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1920|issue=44|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hope: The Chemist''==
This painting (oil on canvas, 127&amp;nbsp;cm × 158&amp;nbsp;cm), located in the waiting room of Burlington House, was bought from the Albemarle Gallery by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2008. It is part of [[Stuart Luke Gatherer]]'s ''Sins and Virtues'' collection, which illustrates the seven sins and seven virtues using modern-day professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stuart Luke Gatherer|url=http://artistaday.com/?p=14945|website=Artistaday}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is based on an earlier classic, ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], which was in turn inspired by Robert Boyle's experiment on the properties of air in the mid-17th Century:&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|32}} a bird is deprived of air before a diversified audience and the different reactions of the spectators prove that scientific curiosity overcomes the concern for the living creature.

For as in Schrodinger's experiment everything remains in limbo until an intelligent observer looks...}}

The original series consisted of nine paintings and two of them were shown in the exhibition 'Seeing Red' at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] from November 2001 to October 2002.

==Thomas Graham portrait==
The portrait of [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]], hanging from the Council Room's wall, was specially commissioned by the Chemical Society in 1931.&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|32}}
Incoming President Professor George Henderson acknowledged this at the Annual General Meeting that year:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Annual General Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|date=1931|page=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robert Boyle portrait==
[[File:Robert Boyle portrait shifted.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Boyle portrait – Burlington House]]

Another painting in the Council Room is the half-length portrait of Robert Boyle (oil on canvas 92&amp;nbsp;cm × 78.5&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=Gorringes /&gt; The ''[[Journal and Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland]]'' said about the work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hon. Robert Boyle|journal=Journal and Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1938|volume=62|issue=part I|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The portrait of the Honourable Robert Boyle, in the Library of the Institute, is attributed to [[Jonathan Richardson]], who left many portraits unsigned; this has been pronounced by several authorities as undoubtedly his work. The portrait bears the dates of Boyle’s birth and death (1626–1691) and was probably a posthumous portrait. Richardson was born in 1665; however, names and dates were often added to portraits long after they had been painted. The portrait resembles the engraving of a bust by Faber and bears a close likeness to Boyle’s sister, the Countess of Ranelagh, at whose house in London he lived and worked for many years. It has been objected that few of the nobility and gentlemen of the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]] were painted otherwise than in court dress. Portraits showing gentlemen in dressing gowns and velvet caps appeared more frequently about 1720, when Boyle had been dead nearly 30 years; but it may be suggested that Richardson preferred to represent him as a philosopher in his study. Towards the end of his life, Boyle lived very quietly in the country and did not frequent the court. The picture was purchased at a sale at [[Loudoun Castle]], Galston, Ayrshire, and acquired for the Institute, by private subscription, in 1931.}}

It was fitting that such a memorial should find a place in the Council Room, especially in view of the valuable services rendered to the Institute by Prof. Meldola in connection with the new building during the last few years of his life. After alluding to the extraordinary range and varied character of Prof. Meldola’s activities in teaching, in research and in public affairs, he paid a tribute to his personal qualities as a man, remarking on his strong character and influence, his appreciation of humour, his fine literary gift and powers of conversation. Having unveiled the portrait the President warmly praised the work. All would agree that the artist had achieved a remarkable success. He also expressed the hearty thanks of the Institute to those who had subscribed to the presentation, and to Prof. Poulton for having been the means whereby the Institute had become possessed of such a valuable memorial to its past President.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23688">This is a list of surviving [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[gold glass]] portraits of the finer painted sort.  The majority of surviving Roman gold glass pieces are the cut-off bottoms of drinking glasses made with unpainted [[gold leaf]]. These sometimes bear the names of individuals and were probably commemorative gifts on a special occasion such as a wedding anniversary or winning a contest.  Achieving a good likeness was probably not an aim, and certainly not an achievement of this class of object,{{cn|date=April 2018}} and they are not included here. The objects here belong to a smaller class of finely painted portrait miniatures, although a few seem also to have been originally placed in cups.

==Brescia medallion==
[[File:Galla Placidia (rechts) und ihre Kinder.jpg|thumb|right|Brescia medallion]]
The portrait medallion is a part of the ornamentation of the so-called Desiderius Cross, 9th-century [[processional cross|processional]] [[crux gemmata]] currently preserved in [[Museo di Santa Giulia]], [[Brescia]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=bresciamusei /&gt;

The medallion is often referred to as a portrait of [[Galla Placidia]] and her children, but the scholarly consensus is strongly against this 18th-century identification.&lt;ref name=jasper /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt;

Some 19th-century scholars, including [[Raffaele Garrucci]] and [[Hermann Vopel]], suspected the work to be a fake.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrucci 1858, p. 83; pl. XL, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vopel 1899, no. 507&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest mention of the medallion comes from a 17th-century inventory.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt; In 1762, [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] recalled that he saw it circa 1725.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt;

Several details indicate the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egyptian]], perhaps [[Alexandria]]n origin of the medallion. Both words of the inscription ({{lang|grc|ΒΟΥΝΝΕΡΙ ΚΕΡΑΜΙ}}) end in [[iota]], possibly indicating the [[Ancient Greek]] dialect of Egypt; {{lang|grc|ΚΕΡΑΜΙ}}, then, means "potter".&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt; Stylistically, the painting is closely related to the 3rd-century [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portraits]] found in the [[Faiyum Oasis]].&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt; The costumes are more consistent with the contemporary fashions in Egypt than in Rome itself. In particular, the mantle worn by the middle figure is not fastened by a [[fibula]], but instead knotted; one parallel for this is a 3rd-century [[Copts|Coptic]] [[tapestry]] medallion, now in the [[Hermitage Museum]], showing the goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gea]] with her mantle knotted in a similar way.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 354"&gt;Breck 1927, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; The peculiar hair style of the older woman is unknown in Roman portraiture, but can be found on some 3rd-century plaster mummy masks from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 354" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One example from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/mharrsch/599898584 link].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Daniel T. Howells (2015) summarizes the research into the Brescia medallion demonstrating its connection to contemporaneous Roman-Egyptian art (in particular the Fayum mummy portraits) as well as linguistic evidence proving the authenticity of the artefact versus the now dubious claim about it being a forgery.&lt;ref name="howells 2015 p7"&gt;Daniel Thomas Howells (2015). "[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Late_Antique_Gold_Glass_online.pdf A Catalogue of the Late Antique Gold Glass in the British Museum (PDF).]" London: the British Museum (Arts and Humanities Research Council). Accessed 2 October 2016, p. 7: "''Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‘Fonds de coupes’ in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq’s comprehensive Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel’s catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de Mély challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de Mély’s hypothesis was supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion’s authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci’s dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum’s assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De Mély noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.''"

"''Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de Mély himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue-backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‘brushed technique’ to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter’s precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Jás Elsner (2007) also contends that the Brescia medallion likely depicts a family from [[Alexandria]], since the inscription is in the Alexandrian dialect of Greek, and provides possible dates ranging from the early-3rd to mid-5th century AD, before it found its way to Italy where it adorned a 7th-century cross.&lt;ref&gt;Jás Elsner (2007).

Gold-glass forgeries are known to have been forged all through the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1759, French [[antiquarian]] [[Anne Claude de Caylus]] wrote that contemporary Roman dealers were selling gold-glass reproductions to tourists who thought them original.&lt;ref&gt;Caylus 1759, p. 195, quote: "Ce moyen a été retrouvé à Rome, il y a très-peu d'années; j'en ai jugé par quelques morceaux très- bien traités: on s'en est servi pour tromper les Etrangers; mais celui qui possédoit ce petit secret est mort sans le publier"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breck 1927, pp. 353–354&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] has what are thought to be two 18th-century fake group portraits,&lt;ref name=met.fake.1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=met.fake.2 /&gt; while the [[British Museum]] has two 19th-century ones.&lt;ref name=bm.fake.1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bm.fake.2 /&gt;

The '''Solomiya Krushelnytska Lviv State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet''' ({{lang-ua|Львівський Національний академічний театр опери та балету імені Соломії Крушельницької}}) or '''Lviv Opera''' ({{lang-ua|Львівська оперa}}, {{lang-pl|Opera Lwowska}}) is an [[opera house]] located in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] largest western city and one of its historic [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centers]]. Originally built on former [[marsh]]land of the submerged [[Poltva River]], the Lviv Opera now sits at the end of Freedom Avenue ({{lang-ua|Проспект Свободи}}), the tree-lined centerpiece of Lviv's [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic Old City]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] located in the city's [[Halytskyi District, Lviv|Halych district]].

According to the inscription in the [[Lobby (room)|theater lobby]], the building was constructed between 1897 and 1900, and has remained standing throughout several changes in history. Originally built when Lviv was the capital of the [[History of Galicia (Eastern Europe)#Galician autonomy|autonomous province of Galicia]] in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the Lviv Opera ({{lang-de|Lemberger Oper}}) first stood at the end of [[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria|Archduke Karl Ludwig]] Avenue, was later known as the Grand Theatre ({{lang-pl|Teatr Wielki}}) of the [[Second Polish Republic]], and during the time of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule]], entering patrons would pass by a towering statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. For four decades, the theater was known as the ''[[Ivan Franko]] Lviv State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet'', having been renamed in 1956 after the city's famous poet and political activist on the centenary of his birth. In 2000, the Lviv Opera celebrated its own [[centennial]] with another renaming, this time after one of the city's native daughters, [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], a renowned [[soprano]] of the early 20th century.

==History==
At the end of the 19th century, local leaders felt the need for a large city theatre to be situated in the capital of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] ({{lang-uk|Галичина}}, {{lang-pl|Galicja}}). In 1895, the city announced an [[architectural design competition]], which attracted a large number of submissions.&lt;ref name=Opera&gt;The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet official website. ''History: facts'' [http://www.lvivopera.org/contents/history/facts/index.en.html History of the building of the theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929062127/http://www.lvivopera.org/contents/history/facts/index.en.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the participants were the renowned Viennese architects [[Fellner &amp; Helmer]], whose entry was rejected as too international and eclectic.&lt;ref name="Ther"&gt;Philipp Ther. ''Center Stage: Operatic Culture and Nation Building in Nineteenth-Century Central Europe''. [[Purdue University Press]]. 2014. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;Victor Hugo Lane. ''State culture and national identity in a multi-ethnic context: Lemberg 1772-1914''. [[University of Michigan]]. 1999. p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

An independent jury chose the design by [[Zygmunt Gorgolewski]],&lt;ref name="Ther"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewinski"&gt;{{pl icon}} Jakub Lewiński. ''Między tradycją, a nowoczesnością; Architektura Lwowa lat 1893-1918''. Neriton. 2005. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markian Prokopovych. ''Habsburg Lemberg: architecture, public space, and politics in the Galician capital, 1772-1914''. Purdue University Press. 2009. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of the [[Berlin]] [[Bauakademie|Building Academy]] and the director of city's [[Engineering education|Engineering Academy]]. Gorgolewski pleasantly surprised the jury by planning to locate the building in the center of the city, despite the area having been already densely built-up. In order to solve the space problem, he boldly proposed to enclose the [[Poltva River]] underground, and instead of using a traditional [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], utilized a [[Shallow foundation|reinforced concrete base]] for the first time in Europe.&lt;ref name=Opera/&gt;

In June 1897, the [[cornerstone]] was placed. Gorgolewski oversaw [[construction]], [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] and design, employing the leading [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]] from the city and beyond. Local materials were used wherever possible, however [[marble]] elements were manufactured in [[Vienna]], special linen for painting in the foyer was imported from [[Belgium]]. The [[Austria]]n company [[Siemens]] was ran the electrical wiring and lights, while the hydraulic mechanization of the stage was built by the [[Poland|Polish]] railway workshop company in [[Sanok]].&lt;ref name=Opera/&gt;

Construction continued for three years. Funding came from the city, the surrounding communities, and from voluntary donations. The cost of the works totaled 6 million [[Austrian crown]]s.&lt;ref name="Papee"&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Fryderyk Papée]] | coauthors = | title =Historia miasta Lwowa w zarysie (Concise history of the city of Lwów) | year =1924 | editor = | pages = | chapter =Lwów nowoczesny - Okres samorządowy | chapterurl =http://www.lwow.com.pl/historia/papee3.html#24 | publisher =Książnica Polska | location =Lwów-Warsaw | id = | url =http://www.lwow.com.pl/historia/papee3.html | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories remain that despite the engineering innovations used by Gorgolewski to construct the foundation of the building, it began to slowly sink because of the Poltva river running underneath it in a tunnel. Learning of the flaw, the architect took it to heart and fell into depression, and hung himself. This is not borne out by facts, as the engineer actually died of heart disease.&lt;ref name="Gorgolewski-pl"&gt;''[http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/gorgolewski.html Zygmunt Gorgolewski, twórca gmachu Lwowskiego Teatru Wielkiego]'' ("Zygmunt Gorgolewski, the creator of the building of the Lwów Grand Theatre"), by Piotr Marek Stański. (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; After some initial settling, the building ceased 'sinking' and remains stable to this day, owing to the innovative design of Gorgolewski.

===Grand opening===

The Lviv Opera opened on October 4, 1900. The cultural elite&amp;mdash;painters, writers, and composers, as well as delegations from various European theatres&amp;mdash;attended the opening festivities. Among the guests attending the ceremony were writer [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], the painter [[Henryk Siemiradzki]],&lt;ref name="three"&gt;The three were considered the most renowned Polish artists{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} of the epoch&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chief magistrate]] of Lviv [[Godzimir Małachowski]], the [[Voivode|provincial governor]] [[Leon Piniński]] and head of the [[Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria|provincial assembly]] [[Stanisław Marcin Badeni|Count Stanisław Badeni]]. A delegation from the city of [[Prague]] was headed by mayor Vladimir Srb and former director of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], František Adolf Šubert. Due to recent deaths of both the [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Roman Catholic]] and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] [[archbishop]]s, the building was blessed by the [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] archbishop of Lviv, Izaak Mikołaj Isakowicz, alongside [[rabbi]] Ezechiel Caro and the Protestant pastor Garfel.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The grand opening gala that evening included excerpts from: 
* The [[ballet]] ''Baśń nocy świętojańskiej'' (''Tale of the [[Kupala|Midsummer Night]]'') by [[Jan Kasprowicz]] and [[Seweryn Berson]]
* The [[opera]], ''Janek'' by [[Władysław Żeleński (musician)|Władysław Żeleński]], about the life of [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] mountain-dwellers, with an [[aria]] sung by the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[tenor]], Oleksandr Myshuha, for whom it was specially written.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet is built in the classical tradition with using forms and details of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture]], also known as the Viennese [[neo-Renaissance]] style. The [[stucco]] mouldings and oil paintings on the walls and ceilings of the multi-tiered auditorium and foyer give it a richly festive appearance. The Opera's imposing facade is opulently decorated with numerous niches, [[Corinthian columns]], pilasters, balustrades, cornices, statues, reliefs and stucco garlands. Standing in niches on either side of the main entrance are allegorical figures representing Comedy and Tragedy sculpted by [[Antoni Popiel]] and [[Tadeusz Baroncz]]; figures of [[muse]]s embellish the top of the [[cornice]]. The building is crowned by large bronze statues, symbolizing Glory, Poetry and Music.&lt;ref&gt;The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet, ''Lviv Best Portal'' [http://www.lvivbest.com/en/theaters/lviv-opera-and-ballet-theatre The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet architectural description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre, beautifully decorated inside and outside, became a centrefold of the achievements in sculpture and painting of Western Europe at the end of the 19th century. The internal decoration was prepared by some of the most renowned Polish artists of the time. Among them were [[Stanisław Wójcik]] (allegorical sculptures of Poetry, Music, Fame, Fortune, Comedy and Tragedy), [[Julian Markowski]], [[Tadeusz Wiśniowiecki]], [[Tadeusz Barącz]], [[Piotr Wojtowicz]] (relief depicting the [[coat of arms of Lviv]]), [[Juliusz Bełtowski]] (bas-relief of Gorgolewski) and [[Antoni Popiel]] (sculptures of Muses decorating the façade).

Among the painters to decorate the interior were [[Tadeusz Popiel]] (staircases), [[Stanisław Rejchan]] (main hall), [[Stanisław Dębicki]], [[Stanisław Kaczor-Batowski]] and [[Marceli Harasimowicz]] ([[foyer]]). The team supervised by the abovementioned artists included further painters, among them [[Aleksander Augustynowicz]], [[Ludwik Kohler]], [[Walery Kryciński]], [[Henryk Kuhn]], [[Edward Pietsch]], [[Zygmunt Rozwadowski]], [[Tadeusz Rybkowski]] and [[Julian Zuber]]. The main [[curtain]] was decorated by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]].

In [[feminist theory]], the '''male gaze''' is the act of depicting women and the world, in the [[visual arts]] and [[literature]], from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for the pleasure of the male viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=E.W.|title=Feminist philosophy of art|journal= Philosophy Compass | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 873–893 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x | date = September 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-aesthetics/|title=Feminist Aesthetics|work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|quote=Assumes a standard point of view that is masculine and heterosexual.

The film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] coined the term ''male gaze'', which is contrasted with the concept of the [[female gaze]];&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobsson"&gt;{{Cite report |author= Jacobsson, Eva-Maria |date= 1999 |title= A Female Gaze? |url= http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |format= pdf |publisher= [[Royal Institute of Technology|Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan)]] |location= Stockholm, Sweden |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025557/http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |archivedate= 2011-10-04 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, the male gaze is comparable to [[scopophilia]], which is sexual pleasure derived from observing the passive female as object.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;{{rp|815}}

== Background ==
The concept of the '''male gaze''' was first developed by the feminist film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] in the essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975), in which she proposes that an asymmetry of [[Power (social and political)|power]] between the sexes is a controlling force in cinema; and that the male gaze is constructed for the pleasure of the male viewer, which is deeply rooted in the ideologies and discourses of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weeks|first=L.

The perspective of the male gaze occurs when the camera places the viewer in the perspective of a heterosexual man whose sight lingers on the curves of a woman's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Streeter | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Hintlian | first2 = Nicole | last3 = Chipetz | first3 = Samantha | last4 = Callender | first4 = Susanna | title = This is Not Sex: A Web Essay on the Male Gaze, Fashion Advertising, and the Pose | url = http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/powerpose/index.html | date = 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111106152945/http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/powerpose/index.html | archivedate = 2011-11-06 | df =  }} Web essay about the male gaze in advertising.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the male gaze displays the woman on two different levels: (i) as an erotic object for the characters in the film story, and (ii) as an erotic object for the male viewer of the film.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} By way of the male gaze, the man emerges as the dominant power within the film fantasy, in which the woman is a passive object for the active gaze of the male viewer. The passive-object and active-viewer pairing is basic to the patriarchal order, and is typical in the "illusionistic narrative film" of mainstream cinema, where the male gaze has precedence over the female gaze — the underlying asymmetry of social and political power, between the sexes.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sassatelli | first = Roberta | title = Interview with Laura Mulvey: Gender, Gaze and Technology in Film Culture | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 123–143 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0263276411398278 | date = September 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276411398278 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}

This inequality can be attributed to patriarchy which has been defined as a social ideology embedded in the belief systems of Western culture and in patriarchal societies. It is either masculine individuals or institutions created by these individuals that exert the power to determine what is considered "natural".&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pritchard | first1 = Annette | last2 = Morgan | first2 = Nigel J. | title = Privileging the male gaze: gendered tourism landscapes | journal = Annals of Tourism Research | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 884–905 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0160-7383(99)00113-9 | date = October 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-7383(99)00113-9 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of time, these constructed beliefs begin to seem "natural" or "normal" because they are prevalent and carry out unchallenged, thus arguing that Western culture has adopted a dyadic, hierarchical ideology which sets masculinity in binary opposition to femininity thus creating levels of inferiority.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"/&gt;

Mulvey describes its two central forms that are based in [[Freud]]'s concept of scopophilia, as: "pleasure that is linked to sexual attraction (voyeurism in extremis) and scopophilic pleasure that is linked to narcissistic identification (the introjection of ideal egos)",&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt; in order to demonstrate how women have historically been forced to view film through the "male gaze". It also suggests that the male gaze denies women their human identity, relegating them to the status of objects to be admired for physical appearance and male sexual desires and fantasies.

In "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema", Mulvey discusses several different types of spectatorship that may occur while viewing a film. They can involve unconsciously or, in some cases, consciously engaging in the typical, ascribed societal roles of men and women.

In relation to [[phallocentrism]], films may be viewed in "three different looks"; the first refers to the camera as it records the actual events of the film, the second describes the nearly voyeuristic act of the audience as one engages in watching the film itself, and the third refers to the characters that interact with one another throughout the film. The main idea that seems to bring these actions together is that "looking" is generally seen as an active male role, while the passive role of being looked at is immediately adopted as a female characteristic. It is under the construction of patriarchy that Mulvey argues that women in film are tied to desire and that female characters hold an "appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact". The female actor is never meant to represent a character that directly affects the outcome of a plot or keep the story line going, but is inserted into the film as a way of supporting the male role and "bearing the burden of sexual objectification" that he cannot.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;

In other words, the woman is passive to the active gaze from the man and can be linked to scopophilia (or scoptophilia), which can be described as pleasure derived from looking. As an expression of [[sexuality]], scopophilia refers to [[sexual pleasure]] derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, [[pornography]], naked bodies, etc. 
In sum, according to Mulvey, the categories of pleasurable viewing are twofold: voyeurism, which derives pleasure from viewing a distant other, and projecting one's fantasies, usually sexual, onto that person, and narcissism, a form of recognition of one's self in the image of another we are viewing. Mulvey also believes that in order to enjoy a film as a woman, or any gender other than male, we must learn to identify with the male protagonist.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt; [[Wendy Arons]] adds that [[sexualization|hypersexualization]] diminishes the symbolic threat posed by violent female characters in [[action film]]s, "The focus on the body—as a body in ostentatious display of breasts, legs, and buttocks—does mitigate the threat that women pose to 'the very fabric of... society' by reassuring the (male) viewer of his [[Male privilege|privilege]] as the possessor of the objectifying gaze."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Arons | first = Wendy | contribution = "If her stunning beauty doesn't bring you to your knees, her deadly drop kick will": violent women in Hong Kong Kung Fu film | editor-last1 = McCaughey | editor-first1 = Martha | editor-last2 = King | editor-first2 = Neal | editor-link1 = Martha McCaughey | title = Reel knockouts: violent women in the movies | page = 41 | location = Austin, Texas | publisher = University of Texas Press | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulvey's essay also states that the female gaze is the same as the male gaze. This means that women look at themselves through the eyes of men.&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"/&gt; The male gaze may be seen by a [[feminist]] either as a manifestation of unequal power between gazer and gazed, or as a conscious or subconscious attempt to develop that [[Gender inequality|inequality]]. From this perspective, a woman who welcomes an objectifying gaze may be simply [[conforming]] to norms established to benefit men, thereby reinforcing the power of the gaze to reduce a recipient to an object. Welcoming such objectification may be viewed as akin to [[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;

Mulvey argues that "the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification. Man is reluctant to gaze". Describing ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966), by [[Jean Rhys]], [[Nalini Paul]] indicates that the Antoinette character gazes at Rochester, placing a [[garland]] upon him, making him appear heroic: "Rochester does not feel comfortable with having this role enforced upon him; thus, he rejects it by removing the garland, and crushing the flowers."&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;

From the male perspective, a man possesses the gaze because he is a man, whereas a woman has the gaze only when she assumes the male gazer role—when she objectifies others by gazing at them like a man. [[Eva-Maria Jacobsson]] supports Paul's description of the "female gaze" as "a mere cross-identification with masculinity", yet evidence of women's objectification of men—the discrete existence of a ''female gaze''—can be found in the "boy toy" ads published in [[teen magazines]], for example, despite Mulvey's contention that ''the gaze'' is ''property'' of one gender. Whether or not this is an example of female gaze or rather an internalized male gaze is up for debate, along with the other ideas on this subject. In terms of power relationships, the gazer can direct a gaze upon members of the same gender for [[asexuality|asexual]] reasons, such as comparing the gazer's [[body image]] and clothing to those of the gazed-at individual.&lt;ref  name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;{{rp|127}}

With respect to her essay, Mulvey stressed in a 2011 interview with [[Roberta Sassatelli]]: "First, that the 1975 article "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" was written as a [[polemic]], and as [[Mandy Merck]] has described it, as a manifesto; so I had no interest in modifying the argument. Clearly I think, in retrospect from a more nuanced perspective, about the inescapability of the male gaze."&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;{{rp|128}}

== Criticizing the male gaze ==

===Matrixial gaze===
[[Bracha Ettinger]] criticizes this notion of the male gaze by her proposition of a ''[[Matrixial Gaze|matrixial gaze]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha | author-link = Bracha Ettinger | title = The matrixial gaze | publisher = Feminist Arts and Histories Network, Department of Fine Art, University of Leeds | location = Leeds, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780952489900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrixial gaze is not operative where a "male gaze" is placed opposite to a "female gaze" and where both positive entities constitute each other from a lack (such an umbrella concept of the gaze would precisely be what scholars such as [[Slavoj Žižek]] claim is the [[Lacan]]ian definition of "The Gaze"). Ettinger's proposal doesn't concern a subject and its object, existing or lacking. Rather, it concerns "trans-subjectivity" and shareability on a partial level, and it is based on her claim concerning a feminine-matrixial difference that escapes the phallic opposition of masculine/feminine and is produced in a process of co-emergence. Ettinger works from the very late Lacan, yet, from the angle she brings, it is the structure of the Lacanian subject itself that is deconstructed to a certain extent, and another kind of feminine dimension appears, with its hybrid and floating matrixial gaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha | author-link = Bracha Ettinger | contribution = The with-in-visible screen | editor-last = de Zegher | editor-first = M.

===''Ways of Seeing'': the Renaissance nude===
In the book ''[[Ways of Seeing]]'' (1972), John Berger addressed the subject of female [[sexual objectification]] in the arts, noting that "according to usage and conventions, which are at last being questioned, but have by no means been overcome — men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Berger | first = John | author-link = John Berger | contribution = Section 3 | editor-last = Berger | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Berger | title = Ways of seeing | pages = 45, 47 | publisher = [[BBC]] Penguin Books | location = London | year = 1973 | isbn = 9780563122449 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[mores|usages and conventions]] of observation relate the [[objectification|objectifying]] male gaze to Lacan's theory of the [[social alienation]] that results from the psychological split, between seeing one's self and seeing the ideal of one's self. In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], especially in the genre of the nude subject, that perceptual split arises from being both the viewer and the viewed, and from seeing one's self through the [[gaze]] of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Sturken | first1 = Marita | last2 = Cartwright | first2 = Lisa | contribution = Spectatorship, Power, and Knowledge | editor-last1 = Sturken | editor-first1 = Marita | editor-last2 = Cartwright | editor-first2 = Lisa | title = Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture | page = 81 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780198742715 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and the gaze===
[[Griselda Pollock]], in her article, "Modernity and the Spaces of Femininity" argues that the female gaze can often be visually negated.&lt;ref name="Pollock-pp50-90"&gt;{{citation | last = Pollock | first = Griselda | author-link = Griselda Pollock | contribution = Modernity and the spaces for femininity | editor-last = Pollock | editor-first = Griselda | editor-link = Griselda Pollock | title = Vision and difference: femininity, feminism, and histories of art | pages = 50–90 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780415007214 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

The spectator view of the picture is from inside the shop but the couple are looking in different places than the view of the spectator. The woman is commenting on an image to her husband, while the husband is being distracted by a nude female painting. The nude female painting is hung within view of the spectator. The woman is looking at another image, but it is out of view of the spectator. The man's gaze has found something more interesting and he has chosen to ignore the woman's comment. According to Pollock, "She is contrasted iconographically to the naked woman.  She is denied the picturing of her desire; what she looks at is blank for the spectator.  She is denied being the object of desire because she is represented as a woman who actively looks, rather than returning and confirming the gaze of the masculine spectator".&lt;ref name="Pollock-pp50-90" /&gt;

Lorraine Gamman has suggested that a female gaze can be distinguished from that of a male through its displacing of [[Scopophilia|scopophilic]] power, not simply the inversion of the male gaze, which creates the possibility of a multiplicity of viewing angles. In fact, for Gamman, "the female gaze cohabits the space occupied by men, rather than being entirely divorced from it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Gamman | first = Lorraine | contribution = Watching the detectives: the enigma of the female gaze | editor-last1 = Gamman | editor-first1 = Lorraine | editor-last2 = Marshment | editor-first2 = Margaret | title = The Female gaze: women as viewers of popular culture | page = 16 | publisher = Real Comet Press | location = Seattle | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780941104425 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Gamman, the role of the female gaze is not to appropriate the traditional male form of "voyeurism;" its purpose is to disrupt the [[Phallocentric]] power of the male gaze by providing for other modes of looking.

[[Jay David Bolter]] and [[Richard Grusin]] suggest that Mulvey's "male gaze" coincides with "the desire for visual immediacy", the erasure of the medium for uninhibited interaction with the object portrayed, which feminist film theorists treat as "a male desire that takes an overt sexual meaning when the object of representation, and therefore desire, is a woman".&lt;ref name="Remediation"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Bolter | first1 = Jay David | last2 = Grusin | first2 = Richard | contribution = Networks of remediation | editor-last1 = Bolter | editor-first1 = Jay David | editor-last2 = Grusin | editor-first2 = Richard | title = Remediation understanding new media | pages = 64–87 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780262024525 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} However, Bolter and Grusin consider their term "hypermediacy", the drawing of attention to the medium (or media) and the mediating processes present in a work, to be a manifestation of Gamman's female gaze because it "is multiple and deviant in its suggestion of multiplicity—a multiplicity of viewing positions and a multiplicity of relationships to the object in view, including sexual objects".&lt;ref name="Remediation" /&gt;{{rp|84}} According to Bolter and Grusin, then, hypermediacy, much like the female gaze, works to disrupt the myopic and monolithic male gaze by offering more angles of viewing.

At the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, [[Jill Soloway]], in her keynote address, tried to define the "female gaze" in film-making (available on YouTube).

The Indian photographer [[Farhat Basir Khan]] attributes the female gaze to anything that's been photographed by a woman which according to Khan is actually breaking the stereotypical view created by "male-constructed" photographs that have shown women in a certain light throughout the history of visual arts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From her perspective|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/From-her-perspective/article16988924.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=30 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602070404/http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/From-her-perspective/article16988924.ece|archivedate=2 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of female gaze was central to the exhibition curated by Khan titled 'Feminography' at the [[Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts]] in January 2017.

=== Oppositional gaze ===
[[bell hooks]], in her essay titled "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader.|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Black women are placed outside of the "pleasure in looking" as an imaginary subject to the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In reading [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]]'s essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hooks states,"...from a standpoint that acknowledges race, one sees clearly why black women spectators not duped by mainstream cinema would develop an oppositional gaze".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In relation [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s [[mirror stage]], during which a child develops self recognition and thus, the [[Ego ideal|ideal ego]], hooks takes up the oppositional gaze as a form of looking back, in search of the Black female body within the idealization of cinematic white womanhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The absence of racial relations in the context of feminist theory around the "totalizing category [of] women" engages in a process of denial which refutes the reality that many feminist film critics structure their discourse around white women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a working-class Black woman interviewed by hooks replied, "to see black women in the position white women have occupied in film forever...", is to see a 'transfer' without 'transformation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The oppositional gaze, therefore, encompasses resistance as well as an understanding and awareness of the politics of race and racism via cinematic whiteness inclusive of the male gaze.&lt;!-- any commentary on ''La Dame Indignee''? --&gt;

The '''Mariinsky Theatre''' ({{lang-ru|'''Мариинский театр'''}}, '''Mariinskiy Teatr''', also spelled '''Maryinsky''' or '''Mariyinsky''') is a historic theatre of [[opera]] and [[ballet]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Opened in 1860, it became the preeminent music theatre of late 19th-century Russia, where many of the stage masterpieces of [[Tchaikovsky]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] received their premieres. Through most of the Soviet era, it was known as the '''Kirov Theatre'''.  Today, the Mariinsky Theatre is home to the [[Mariinsky Ballet]], Mariinsky Opera and [[Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra|Mariinsky Orchestra]]. Since [[Yuri Temirkanov]]'s retirement in 1988, the conductor [[Valery Gergiev]] has served as the theatre's general director.

==Name==
The theatre is named after [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Empress Maria Alexandrovna]], wife of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]]. There is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance foyer. The theatre's name has changed throughout its history, reflecting the political climate of the time:

''Note: The acronym "GATOB" (Gosudarstvennïy Akademicheskiy Teatr Operï i Baleta) is often encountered in historical accounts.''

The theatre building is commonly called the ''Mariinsky Theatre''. The companies that operate within it have for brand recognition purposes retained the ''Kirov'' name, acquired during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era to commemorate the assassinated [[Leningrad]] [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] leader [[Sergey Kirov]] (1886–1934).

==Origins==
[[File:Mariinsky Curtain.JPG|thumb|right|Design for the Imperial-era curtain of the Mariinsky Theatre that existed prior to 1914]]
The Imperial drama, opera and [[ballet]] troupe in Saint Petersburg was established in 1783,&lt;ref name=mariinsky&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url=http://www.mariinsky.ru/en/about/history_theatre/mariinsky_theatre/ |title=Mariinsky Theatre: History of the Theatre |publisher=Mariinsky Theatre |year= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203094550/http://www.mariinsky.ru/en/about/history_theatre/mariinsky_theatre |archivedate=2011-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the behest of [[Catherine the Great]], although an Italian ballet troupe had performed at the Russian court since the early 18th century. Originally, the ballet and opera performances were given in the wooden [[Karl Knipper Theatre]] on Tsaritsa Meadow, near the present-day [[Tripartite Bridge]] (also known as the Little Theatre or the Maly Theatre). The [[Hermitage Theatre]], next door to the [[Winter Palace]], was used to host performances for an elite audience of aristocratic guests invited by the Empress.

A permanent theatre building for the new company of opera and ballet artists was designed by [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]] and opened in 1783.&lt;ref name=mariinsky/&gt; Known as the [[Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]] the structure was situated on Carousel Square, which was renamed Theatre Square in honour of the building.&lt;ref name=mariinsky/&gt; Both names{{snd}} "Kamenny" (Russian word for "stone") and "Bolshoi" (Russian word for "big"){{snd}} were coined to distinguish it from the wooden Little Theatre. In 1836, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was renovated to a design by [[Albert Cavos]] (son of [[Catterino Cavos]], an opera composer), and served as the principal theatre of the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] and opera.&lt;ref name=mariinsky/&gt;

On 29 January 1849, the Equestrian [[circus]] (Конный цирк) opened on Theatre Square.  This was also the work of the architect Cavos.  The building was designed to double as a theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url=http://szd.su/obj?notpl=1&amp;id=2051
|title=Istoricheskoe zdaniye Mariinskogo Teatra
|publisher=Severo-Zaladnaya direktsiya |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a wooden structure in the then-fashionable neo-Byzantine style. Ten years later, when this circus burnt down, [[Albert Cavos]] rebuilt it as an opera and ballet house with the largest stage in the world. With a seating capacity of 1,625 and a U-shaped Italian-style [[auditorium]], the theatre opened on 2 October 1860, with a performance of ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]''. The new theatre was named Mariinsky after its imperial patroness, Empress [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Maria Alexandrovna]].

==Leading role==
[[File:Mariinsky2.jpg|thumb|left|The stage of the Mariinsky Theatre with [[Alexander Golovin (artist)|Aleksandr Golovin's]] luxury curtain of 1914]]
The Imperial Mariinsky Theatre and its predecessor, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, hosted the premieres of many of the operas of [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. At the behest of the theatre director [[Ivan Vsevolozhsky]], both the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] (ballet arrived at the Mariinsky theater in 1870) and the [[Imperial Opera]] were relocated to the Mariinsky Theatre in 1886, as the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was considered unsafe. It was there that the renowned choreographer [[Marius Petipa]] presented many of his masterpieces, including such staples of the ballet repertory as ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in 1890, ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' in 1892, ''[[Raymonda]]'' in 1898, and the definitive revival of ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (with [[Lev Ivanov]]) in 1895.

When the theatre was designated as principal venue of the Imperial Ballet and Opera in 1886, the theatre was extensively renovated. A lavish inauguration celebration was given at the behest of [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]], in which the first original [[ballet]] to be produced at the Mariinsky was given{{snd}} Petipa's ''[[The Magic Pills (Petipa/Minkus)|Les Pilules magiques]]'', to the music of [[Ludwig Minkus]].

Other world premieres given at the house included [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in 1874, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s operas ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' in 1890 and ''[[Iolanta]]'' in 1892, the revised version of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' in 1940, and [[Aram Khachaturian|Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' in 1956. Other notable productions included [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s opera ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]'' in 1909 and Prokofiev's ballet ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]'' in 1946 (with [[Natalya Dudinskaya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|title=Natalya Dudinskaya, 90, A Leading Kirov Ballerina|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/01/arts/natalya-dudinskaya-90-a-leading-kirov-ballerina.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=1 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imperial and Soviet theater was the home of numerous great impresarios, conductors, and musicians.

'''Conductors''': [[Mikhail Zhukov (conductor)|Mikhail Zhukov]] (1932–35), Israel Chudnovsky and others.

'''Ballet''': The [[ballet]] school of the Mariinsky Theatre spawned the careers of artists [[Mathilde Kschessinskaya]], [[Olga Preobrajenskaya]], [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Tamara Karsavina]], [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], and [[George Balanchine]], students of the [[Imperial Ballet School]] and style, and, under and after the teachings of [[Agrippina Vaganova]], artists [[Marina Semyonova]], [[Galina Ulanova]], [[Rudolf Nureyev]], [[Natalia Makarova]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], [[Irina Kolpakova]], [[Galina Mezentseva]], [[Altynai Asylmuratova]], as well as more recent dancers of renown [[Ulyana Lopatkina]], [[Diana Vishneva]], and [[Svetlana Zakharova (dancer)|Svetlana Zakharova]], students of the school as now named, the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet]].

==The Mariinsky Theatre today==
[[File:Mariinsky Original Tsars Box.JPG|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;Although this box was not officially referred to as the "Tsar's Box", this box is where the Emperor and his family always sat when attending performances at the theatre.]]
Under [[Yuri Temirkanov]], Principal Conductor from 1976 to 1988, the Opera Company continued to stage innovative productions of both modern and classic Russian operas. Although functioning separately from the Theatre’s Ballet Company, since 1988 both companies have been under the artistic leadership of [[Valery Gergiev]] as Artistic Director of the entire Theatre.

The Opera Company has entered a new era of artistic excellence and creativity.  Since 1993, Gergiev’s impact on opera there has been enormous.  Firstly, he reorganized the company’s operations and established links with many of the world's great opera houses, including the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]], the [[Metropolitan Opera]], the [[Opéra Bastille]], [[La Scala]], [[La Fenice]], the [[Israeli Opera]], the [[Washington National Opera]] and the [[San Francisco Opera]]. Today, the Opera Company regularly tours to most of these cities.

Gergiev has also been innovative as far as Russian opera is concerned: in 1989, there was an all-[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]] festival featuring the composer’s entire operatic output. Similarly, many of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]’s operas were presented from the late 1990s.  Operas by non-Russian composers began to be performed in their original languages, which helped the Opera Company to incorporate world trends. The annual international "[[White Nights Festival|Stars of the White Nights Festival]]" in Saint Petersburg, started by Gergiev in 1993, has also put the Mariinsky on the world’s cultural map. That year, as a salute to the imperial origins of the Mariinsky, 
[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[La forza del destino]]'', which received its premiere in Saint Petersburg in 1862, was produced with its original sets, costumes and scenery. Since then, it has become a characteristic of the "White Nights Festival" to present the premieres from the company’s upcoming season during this magical period, when the hours of darkness practically disappear as the summer solstice approaches.

Presently, the Company lists on its roster 22 sopranos (of whom [[Anna Netrebko]] may be the best known); 13 mezzo-sopranos (with [[Olga Borodina]] familiar to US and European audiences);  23 tenors; eight baritones; and 14 basses. With Gergiev in charge overall, there is a Head of Stage Administration, a Stage Director, Stage Managers and Assistants, along with 14 accompanists.

===Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall===
The nearby Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall, designed by French architect, Xavier Fabre, opened in spring 2007.  It has room for 1,100 patrons.

==Mariinsky Theatre Second Stage==

[[File:Mariinsky Theatre Saint Petersburg Russia 04.jpg|thumb|The Second Stage]]

The Canadian firm [[Diamond and Schmitt Architects]], along with its local partner KB ViPS Architects, designed a new building, then to be named [[Mariinsky Theatre, Second stage|The Second Stage]], with 2,000 seats, which would complement the existing Mariinsky.  Construction began in 2003, following a different design by French architect Jean Nouvel that was halted at the sub-basement level. The new design team took over in 2009. The completion of Mariinsky II was predicted to result in Saint Petersburg's equivalent of [[New York City]]'s [[Lincoln Center]].

Construction was completed in May 2013, at a price of 500 million euros.&lt;ref name=euronews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22395056 Mariinsky Theatre unveils new ballet and opera house, (3 May 2013), BBC News] accessed 3 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Parker''' (born 1930) is notable for being the first woman to appear on [[Melbourne]] television.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.cam.org.au/News-and-Events/Features/General-Features/Article/14780/Portrait-of-an-artist-Paul-Fitzgerald#.VSb_W_CK8y0 "Constant in Faith"], Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne bulletin, Vol. 24, Issue 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://televisionau.com/classic-tv-guides/tv041156|title=Sunday 4 November 1956 – MELBOURNE|work=televisionau.com|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of three persons to host [[HSV (TV station)|HSV]] Channel 7's test broadcasts prior to their official opening night; the other two test broadscasters being [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Eric Pearce (later Sir Eric Pearce)]] and Danny Webb. On HSV-7's opening night, 4 November 1956, Parker presented the news with Pearce.&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Listener In-TV'', 1 November 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this she had worked in England, where she became a well-known stage, screen and television actress.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2440489/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|title=Mary Parker Biography|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everybody in England knew Mary Parker", said her husband, [[Paul Fitzgerald (painter)|Paul Fitzgerald]]. "In England she did several films with Sir Douglas Fairbanks Jr – I've seen her name in lights on Shaftsbury Avenue and then she worked on TV as an announcer. They also brought her out to Australia in 1956 to open the (television coverage of the) Olympic Games – she was the first woman on television in (Melbourne)."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Mary Parker was born on 31 October 1930 in [[Bitton, Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; She grew up in Melbourne and attended [[Genazzano FCJ College|Genazzano Convent school]], returning to England to pursue her career until invited back to Melbourne by HSV-7 to be their initial female television personality.

==Family==
She married noted portrait artist [[Paul Fitzgerald (painter)|Paul Fitzgerald]] in 1957. They have seven children: Fabian (born 1959), Marisa (born 1960), Patrick (born 1963; now  deceased), Emma (born 1964), Edward (born 1968), Maria (born 1970) and Frances (born 1973). She lives in [[Melbourne]].

==British film career==
* ''[[The Vise]]'' [TV series] (''Kill Me My Love'' 1957, ''The Deception'' 1955, ''Gabriel's Choice'' 1954) ... Irene / Dorothy / Marianne Anderson (opposite fellow Australian [[Ron Randell]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Honor Blackman]] and [[Patrick McGoohan]])
* ''[[The Hostage (1956 film)|The Hostage]]'' (1956) ... Rosa Gonzuelo (lead female role opposite [[Ron Randell]])
* ''[[Colonel March of Scotland Yard]]'' [TV series] (1956) (''Present Tense'' 1957 ... Emily [opposite [[Boris Karloff]]])
* ''[[You Lucky People]]'' (1955) ...  Pvt. Sally Briggs (lead female role, opposite [[Tommy Trinder]] and [[Dora Bryan]])
* ''[[Third Party Risk]]'' (1954) ... Nancy (opposite [[Lloyd Bridges]] and [[Finlay Currie]])
* ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents|Rheingold Theatre – Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents]]'' [TV series] (''The International Settlement'' 1954, ''The Trap'' 1954) ... Elizabeth / Peggy.

==Australian television career==
In the 1950s it was usual to have a host ''top and tail'' the various programs and Mary Parker had that role in the early days of HSV-7.

She also presented the following programs:
* ''[[Beauty is My Business]]'' 
* ''[[Eric and Mary]]'' (with [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Eric Pearce]])
* ''[[Guest of the Week]]''
* ''[[The Judy Jack Show]]'' (covered when the regular hostess was indisposed)

In an interview with Parker in May 2015, she explained that she was also one of the first pianists on HSV-7, playing as preludes to a couple of her regular series of interviews. She started an interview with Des Bradley (violinist) by accompanying him in a rendition of [[Saint Saëns]]'s The Swan. Another interview was with [[Freddy Cole]] and started with a piano duet between Cole and Parker; this must have looked interesting to viewers because of the black and white hands on the keyboard.

Parker shares the honour of being among the first women on Australian television with [[Babs McKinnon]] the first woman on Sydney television when [[Nine Network|TCN-9]] was opened on 16 September 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcnchannel9.com/197149937|title=THE EARLY DAYS - www.tcnchannel9.com|work=SimpleSite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne, on HSV-7's opening night, singer [[Toni Lamond]] appeared in a variety program.&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Meimoon Ghal'eh (Monkey Castle)''', also known as '''Meimoon Ghal'eh Castle''', or '''Mehman Ghal'eh Castle''', is one of several castle ruins scattered throughout the [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] area, in [[Iran]].

==Description==
It sits in the south of the city of [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]], where has been always crowded, hence heavily eroded, and is almost 5000 square meters in footage. The remains indicate the castle to have had a large dome in its central section. All ceilings no longer exist. The fortification has a subterranean network of 3 east-west tunnels under the structure connected by a north-south tunnel. The two levels were connected via a helical staircase. The main gates must have been on the northern side, it is believed. Eight towers made of brick surrounded the castle. All evidence indicates this structure to have been a military fortress of some sorts.

[[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] also spent some time here while residing with the Ismailis in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Nasr, Oliver Leaman. ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. VolI. {{ISBN|0-415-25934-7}}. 1993. p.530&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moira pottery works''', founded in 1922, was known for its utilitarian [[stoneware]] crocks for marmalade and inexpensive pitchers and other kitchen wares, sometimes applied with [[transfer-print]]ed advertising reproducing quaint turn-of-the-century woodcuts. The company's "Hillstonia" ware was intended for forcing bulbs and containing plants.

Moira pottery was often marked with an oval stamp on the unglazed undersides of its production. The pottery works was situated approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mi (8&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Burton-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], although the village of [[Moira, Leicestershire|Moira]] is just over the border in [[Leicestershire]].

The plant was closed by the [[National Coal Board]] and its buildings razed in 1972 under [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]], because the land it stood on was over a coal reserve. After the [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] coal seam was exhausted the land was reclaimed and is planted as part of the [[National Forest, England|National Forest]].

'''''Perfect Harmony''''' or '''''Perfect Accord''''' (French - ''L'Accord parfait'') is a 1719 painting by [[Antoine Watteau]], now in the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. It was the pendant to the same artist's ''[[The Surprise (painting)|The Surprise]]''.

It was initially owned by a friend of the artist, [[Nicolas d'Hénin de Cuvillers|Nicolas Hénin]], but it and ''Surprise'' were sold separately by his heir around 1756.

[[Iran]] (Persia) possesses an extraordinary treasure of royal [[jewelry]], including a copious amount of [[mother-of-pearl]] from the [[Persian Gulf]]. The Iranian crown jewels are among the largest, most dazzling and valuable jewel collection in the world. The jewels are displayed in the vaults of the [[Central Bank of Iran]] in Tehran, and are one of the most appealing tourist attractions in Iran. [[Akik]] is also exported from Iran to various countries including the Indian subcontinent.

A '''Phlyax play''' ({{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:φλύαξ|φλύαξ]]}}, also phlyakes), also known as a '''hilarotragedy''', was a [[burlesque]] dramatic form that developed in the [[Greek colony|Greek colonies]] of [[Magna Graecia]] in the 4th century BCE. Its name derives from the Phlyakes or “Gossip Players” in [[Doric Greek]]. From the surviving titles of the plays they appear to have been a form of [[Greek mythology|mythological]] burlesque, which mixed [[List of Greek mythological figures|figures from the Greek pantheon]] with the stock characters and situations of [[Ancient Greek comedy|Attic New Comedy]].

Only five authors of the genre are known by name: [[Rhinthon]] and Sciras of Taranto, Blaesus of Capri, Sopater of Paphos and Heraklides. The plays themselves survive only as titles and a few fragments.&lt;ref&gt;See Rudolf Kassel, Colin Austin Poetae Comici Graeci, vol. I, pp. 257–88. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial body of [[South Italian ancient Greek pottery|South Italian vases]] are thought to represent scenes of the phlyakes, giving rise to much speculation on Greek stagecraft and dramatic form.

==Characteristics of the genre==
[[Image:Theatre slave Louvre CA7249.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Phlyax actor as a slave from a Sicilian chalice-[[krater]] by a painter of the [[Lentini]]-[[Manfria]] [[Lentini-Manfria Group|Group]], c. 350–40 BCE ([[Louvre]])]]
[[Nossis]] of Locri provides the closest contemporary explanation of the genre in her [[epitaph]] for Rhinthon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pass by with a loud laugh and a kindly word&lt;br&gt;For me: Rhinthon of Syracuse am I,&lt;br&gt;The Muses’ little nightingale; and yet&lt;br&gt;For tragic farce I plucked an ivy wreath.&lt;ref&gt;Anthologia Palatina 7.414&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Textual and archaeological evidence give a partial picture of these burlesques of mythology and daily life. The absence of any surviving script has led to conjecture that they were largely [[improvisation|improvised]]. The vase paintings indicate that they were performed on a raised wooden stage with an upper gallery, and that the actors wore grotesque costumes and [[theatre mask|masks]] similar to those of Attic Old Comedy. Acrobatics and farcical scenes were major features of the phlyax.

The phlyakes seems to die out by the late 3rd century, but the [[Oscan]] inhabitants of [[Campania]] subsequently developed a tradition of farces, parodies, and satires influenced by late Greek models, which became popular in Rome during the 3rd century BC. This genre was known as [[Atellan farce]], [[Atella]] being the name of a Campanian town. Atellan farce introduced a set of [[stock character]]s such as Maccus and Bucco to Latin comedy; even in antiquity, these were thought to be the ancestors of the characters found in [[Plautus]],&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Horace]], Epistles II, 1, 170 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps distantly of those of [[commedia dell'arte]]. Although an older view held that Attic comedy was the only source of [[Roman comedy]], it has been argued that Rhinthon in particular influenced Plautus’s ''[[Amphitruo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Z Stewart , The ‘Amphitrue’ of Plautus and Euripides ‘Bacchae’ TAPhA 89, 1958, 348–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The vase paintings==
The so-called Phlyax vases are a principal source of information on the genre. By 1967, 185 of these vases had been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Trendall, Phlyax Vases, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Since depictions of theatre and especially comedy are rare in fabrics other than the South Italian, these have been thought to portray the distinctly local theatre tradition.&lt;ref&gt;This argument was first made by H Heydemann in ''Die Phlyakendarstellungen der bemalten Vasen'' of 1886. Scholarship of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, in particular the work of [[Oliver Taplin]], has cast doubt on this ascription of the vases to the phlyakes seeing them instead as depictions of Attic Old Comedy.&lt;/ref&gt; The vases first appeared at the end of the 5th century BCE, but most are 4th century. They represent grotesque characters, the masks of comedy, and the props of comic performance such as ladders, baskets, and open windows. About a quarter of them depict a low wooden temporary stage, but whether this was used in reality is a point of contention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margarete Bieber]], ''The History of Greek and Roman Theater'', 1961, takes a rather literal reading of this whereas W. Beare, ''The Roman Stage'', 1964, insists this is a matter of the painter’s interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars view the vases as depicting Attic Old Comedy rather than Phlyakes.&lt;ref&gt;Trendall and Webster, ''Illustrations of Greek Drama'', 1971, correlated Greek and Roman painted linen comic masks with their representation on the vases.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wurzburg Telephus Travestitus vase ([[Krater#Bell krater|bell krater]], H5697) was identified in 1980 as a phlyax vase,&lt;ref&gt;Kossatz-Deissmann, in Tainia: Festschrift für [[Roland Hampe]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; but Csapo&lt;ref&gt;E. Csapo, A Note on the Wurzburg Bell-Krater H5697, Phoenix 40, 1986, 379–92.&lt;/ref&gt; and Taplin&lt;ref&gt;O. Taplin, Classical Philology, Icongraphic Parody and Potted Aristophanes, Dioniso 57, 1987, 95–109, taking the vase as evidence that Attic Old Comedy was performed outside Athens after death of Aristophanes.&lt;/ref&gt; independently have argued that it  actually represents the ''[[Thesmophoriazousai]]'' of [[Aristophanes]].

'''''Orange Prince (1984)''''' is a painting by American artist [[Andy Warhol]], of [[Prince (musician)|Prince Rogers Nelson]] (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.

''Orange Prince'' ''(1984)'' is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Art historian and Warhol expert [[Thomas E. Crow]] believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

Prince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the [[The Factory|Factory]] entourage of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf |title=Expert analysis of Warhol's painting of Prince (1984) |author=Thomas E. Crow |date=May 2018 |website=www.pacermonitor.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-self-portrait-1966 |title=Self-Portrai |author=Andy Warhol |date=1966 |website=MoMALearning |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Composition ==
''Orange Prince'' uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/xx5frv/Prince-1981|title=Prince, 1981|website=www.morrisonhotelgallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

The composition of ''Orange Prince'' makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.

According to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of [[Michael Jackson]] which was commissioned and created a few months before ''Orange Prince.'' As Crow says: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject [[Luminescence|luminesce]], with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.

== Prince and Andy Warhol ==
Prince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.&lt;ref name="1928–1987" /&gt;

On a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|''Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine'']]. In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/remembering-prince|title=Remembering Prince - Interview Magazine|date=2016-04-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstire.com/2016/04/22/prince-1958-2016/|title=Prince (1958-2016) – Glasstire|website=glasstire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York as part of his ''[[Dirty Mind Tour]]''. The club was only half-full, but as music critic [[Nik Cohn]] reported, "Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-interview-quotes|title=Prince, the godfather of R&amp;B, had his fingerprints everywhere|last=Cohn|first=Nik|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1981 edition of Warhol's ''Interview'' magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/prince-showers-for-controversy|title=Flashback: Prince Showers for Controversy - Interview Magazine|date=2012-09-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 1984, Warhol created ''Orange Prince''. Prince had released the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album and movie that year and was well known internationally. 

On August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert "...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement."&lt;ref name="1928–1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |last=Warhol |first=Andy |editor-last=Hackett |editor-first=Pat |isbn=9781455561452 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York, NY |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards at the New York dance club, [[Palladium (New York City)|The Palladium]], Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club "...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.

The same party was also attended by [[Billy Idol]]; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that "Hollywood glamour girls" such as [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] had been supplanted by "glamour boys" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and "...so weird".&lt;ref name="1928–1987"/&gt;

That night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

== Technique ==
''Orange Prince'' was created using a complex tracing and [[Screen printing|silkscreening]] process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to [[Canvas print|canvas]]. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-and-his-process.html|title=Andy Warhol &amp; His Process|last=Sotheby's|first=|date=10 Nov 2013|website=sothebys.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”&lt;blockquote&gt;A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1815_300161087.pdf |title=Andy Warhol, a retrospective : [brochure] the Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 6 to May 2, 1989 |date=1989 |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Orange Marilyn, 1962, silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol.jpeg|thumb|''Orange Marilyn'', 1962, is a silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol from the Marilyn Flavors series.

== Warhol's orange paintings ==
A number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. ''Orange Prince'' shares a compositional style to ''Orange Marilyn'', 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world:

The effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the ''Death and Disaster'' series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is ''Twelve Electric Chairs'' from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including ''Orange Little Electric Chair,'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/306853/death-and-death-and-death-by-warhol/|title=Death and Death and Death by Warhol|date=2016-06-22|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0060.1.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEIj%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFbY044zFyY8bD2myiK3A68z6LvG76TbkfqGMpaaBS8m7uWWyVK5eCsEv%2FpI4Fnl7OjzcrzGEM21YaPitEAgKuEDBdDqovfp%2BV9TJ76lgbD%2FTNqp0POody5rediUNetECE2vNsLgWc2amy1ZOu3biDw4A%2FpXn1cbWZYUhTsUK3yKRcJ3RZ%2FTIpDrna9udqcgsYXSLdurozjAWQzsue5lxtWDVcBiaz9Ig4Xn3ytNO80slqq7DItFcrrxOv7Ywq6bdgx6hP0bptqayCko2tvQdUbAP2FXT6kjS8AFPpCFvmEDlv9hPDtshqNO2M%2BSHR%2F1EP3JwOoPmzaQxH%2Fg6zplJfq8jQYI8bS6hUOoftnD4ht5L1Ddg5WBajvIWXkHWLKuytWc4SC6jAOrsrBj%2FWoLyHGN6sOF1GcAMjr9axS6YqD%2Bk4shA2GTFBk1kJC%2F0CwursUeNaiJh1iyDGdKOEEe9CvwTuXAVvD6Ga7xs0FP%2Beca9hGlR%2BFuwoBqPIfkNzP98Ip%2BEshAtgoguAC%2Beh7EP99XLk4wXbGYL3HwNX%2B7Tp3jDwpJ50z%2FsW7tW3rAmh6KzBxyDdnlAlTuSSNjt%2FP4PVRcz88miwwo%2Fs2n3gU%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181019T145627Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHIX2MTBXV%2F20181019%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=03c5bd1110bde5df7cf53549731be259c6e59561b57eab01bbe6a38e78bda18d|title=Warhol expert, Laura Paulson, on Warhol's paintings of Prince|last=Laura|first=Paulson|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince's favorite color was orange ==
In 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was ''orange'', and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/08/prince-orange-favorite-color-purple/|title=Prince’s Sister Says His Favorite Color Was Actually Orange, Not Purple|date=2017-08-29|work=Spin|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day icon ==
Art historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a "modern-day icon" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Marilyn Diptych'', 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/warhol-marilyn-diptych|title=Warhol, Marilyn Diptych|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marilyn "Flavors" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-orange-marilyn-4806391-details.aspx|title=Essay by Trevor Fairbrother on the iconographic style of Warhol's portraits including the Marilyn single portrait series from 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=www.christies.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=George Frei |editor2=Neil Printz |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-Paintings-Sculptures-1961-1963/dp/0714840866/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519842007&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andy+warhol+catalogue+raisonne |title=Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, Paintings and Sculptures 1961–1963 |author=Andy Warhol Foundation |date=11 Mar 2002 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=9780714840864 |edition=Slp |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 ''Gold Marilyn'' in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laurel.lso.missouri.edu:2083/iii/encore/record/C__Rb13563936__Sjoe%20rosenblum__P0%2C17__Orightresult__X1;jsessionid=4912A4D75A4FD6B390E943219B91FEC2?lang=eng&amp;suite=mobum-sso |title=Robert Rosenblum selected writings on Andy Warhol and other artists|last=Rosenblum|first=R|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing. As a child Warhol attended a local Catholic church which featured an [[iconostasis]], a screen situated in front of the altar featuring large-scale depictions of the faces of the [[Saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andy-Warhol-Treasures-Geralyn-Huxley/dp/1847960049|title=Andy Warhol Treasures|last=Huxley|first=Geralyn|last2=Wrbican|first2=Matt|date=2009-05-14|publisher=Goodman Books|isbn=9781847960047|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book ''The Religious Art of Andy Warhol'', points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]] in Pittsburgh: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Art-Andy-Warhol/dp/082641334X |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane Daggett |date=2001-05-10 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=9780826413345 |location=New York; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:&lt;blockquote&gt;“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/arts/review-art-looking-back-at-warhol-stars-super-heroes-and-all.html|title=Review/Art; Looking Back at Warhol, Stars, Super-Heroes and All|last=Brenson|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Publications ==
''Orange Prince'' painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by [[Condé Nast]] just after Prince's death in 2016.

=== ''Vanity Fair'' ===
The portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled ''Purple Fame'', about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated [[1984]] album and movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]],'' the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist "...at the height of his powers"&lt;ref name="CondeNast"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=2016|title=The Genius of Prince|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Genius-of-Prince/dp/B01F27Q48M|magazine=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]]. ''Purple Rain'' is frequently regarded as Prince's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]; declaring that Prince had "...finally arrived", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.

=== ''The Genius of Prince'' ===
''Orange Prince (1984)'' was reproduced on the front cover of ''The Genius of Prince'', a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by [[Condé Nast]], in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name=CondeNast/&gt;

=== ''Andy Warhol Treasures'' ===
The portrait also features in ''Andy Warhol Treasures'', a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8791">'''''Printing out the Internet''''' is a work of art created by poet and uncreative writer'','' [[Kenneth Goldsmith]], with the help of LABOR and [[UbuWeb]].  In May 2013, Goldsmith asked for people to print out pages from the [[Internet]] and send it to an art gallery, LABOR in [[Mexico City]], over “Printing out the Internet” [[Tumblr]] for an exhibition from 26 July to 30 August 2013.  Goldsmith dedicated a 500 square meter space with a six meter tall ceiling to the exhibit, which was filled with ten tons of paper during the exhibit.  [[Aaron Swartz]], a programmer and Internet activist, inspired the project in his movement to liberate information, making academic files available in the public domain for free.  The exhibit was controversial due to the environmental impact entailed with printing out the Internet and the [[fair use|copyrighted materials]] included in the exhibit.

== History of the Project ==
In 2013, Kenneth Goldsmith called for people to send pages printed from the internet to the art gallery, LABOR, located in Mexico City.  Ten tons of paper submitted 20,000 contributors filled at 1,100 square meter room, and after the exhibition the paper was recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ‘Printing Out the Internet’ exhibit is crowdsourced work of art|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/print-this-web-page-mail-it-to-mexico-citys-labor-gallery-make-art/2013/07/26/534e2582-f320-11e2-ae43-b31dc363c3bf_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2013-07-26|access-date = 2015-10-18|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Dan|last = Zak}}&lt;/ref&gt;  250,000 pages of JSTOR articles were submitted in ''Printing'' ''out the Internet'' exhibit in honor of Aaron Swartz, an internet activist that pushed to have more information made public on the Internet, specifically information from the legal system.  These unpurchased materials were worth $353,229.00, which posed issues of the exhibit's legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kenneth Goldsmith Wants To Print The Entire Internet {{!}} HUH.|url = http://www.huhmagazine.co.uk/5211/kenneth-goldsmith-wants-to-print-the-entire-internet|website = www.huhmagazine.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Kenneth Goldsmith ==
Kenneth Goldsmith is an author, poet, and artist that teaches in the English Department at the [[University at Buffalo|State University of New York at Buffalo]].  Goldsmith was born in 1961 in [[Freeport, New York]].  He graduated from the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in 1984 with a BFA in Sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jacket 21 - Marjorie Perloff: A Conversation with Kenneth Goldsmith|url = http://www.jacketmagazine.com/21/perl-gold-iv.html|website = www.jacketmagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the founding editor of UbuWeb and has written a variety of books, including ''Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age'' and ''Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing''.  Kenneth Goldsmith engages in uncreative writing.  One example is his book, ''Traffic'', that composed of descriptions of traffic reports of the Brooklyn Bridge every ten minutes over the course of twenty-four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Electronic Poetry Center|url = http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/goldsmith/|website = epc.buffalo.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Aaron Swartz ==
[[Aaron Swartz]] was an Internet activist, entrepreneur, and programmer that inspired the project, ''Printing out the Internet''.  Swartz used the [[MIT]] network and downloaded millions of academic articles from the [[JSTOR]] database.  Earlier, Swartz had published court documents from [[PACER (law)|PACER]] that charge a fee for downloading the files.  Federal prosecutors mounted a case against Swartz, and he was arrested in January 2011 by the MIT police.  JSTOR asked for the case to be dropped in light of Swartz’s apology, but the prosecution refused.  In January 2013, Swartz declined a plea bargain for a six-month sentence in jail, opposed to the 35-month sentence and $1 million in fines, and he was found dead in his apartment on January 11, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/swartz-death-fuels-debate-over-computer-crime&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-21001452&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project Feasibility ==

A Dutch Web consultant, Maurice de Kunder, calculated that the Internet consists of roughly 4.7 billion pages of searchable Web.  Each webpage is approximately 6.5 printed pages.  To print the Internet it would take about 305.5 billion pages.  This paper equates to 74.6 million copies of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, 212.2 million copies of ''[[War and Peace]]'', 256.3 million copies of ''[[Women and Men]]'', 276.7 million copies of ''[[Infinite Jest]]'', or 280.8 million copies of ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.  20,000 contributors submitted ten tons of paper to the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/05/18/if-you-could-print-out-the-whole-internet-how-many-pages-would-it-be/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://printingtheinternet.tumblr.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007104113/http://printingtheinternet.tumblr.com/ |archivedate=2015-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivative Projects ==
Goldsmith's project, ''Printing out the Internet'', inspired other works of art and a marathon group reading of the entire Internet.  On 6 July 2013, Goldsmith held a marathon reading of the work submitted to his exhibit starting at 6 PM.  There was a sign-up for half hour time slots for people to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marathon Group Reading of the entire internet|url = http://printingtheinternet.tumblr.com/post/55422861617/marathon-group-reading-of-the-entire-internet|website = printingtheinternet.tumblr.com|accessdate = 2015-10-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120805/http://printingtheinternet.tumblr.com/post/55422861617/marathon-group-reading-of-the-entire-internet|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July,aA PhD piano composer at the [[University of York]] wrote Goldsmith in an email, asking to use text from the "Printing out the Internet" Tumblr in a music piece.  The composer wanted to use a combination of criticisms about ''Printing out the Internet'' and Goldsmith's responses in the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Piano work inspired by Printing Out the Internet|url = http://printingtheinternet.tumblr.com/post/56543763882/piano-work-inspired-by-printing-out-the-internet|website = printingtheinternet.tumblr.com|accessdate = 2015-10-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105800/http://printingtheinternet.tumblr.com/post/56543763882/piano-work-inspired-by-printing-out-the-internet|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Concerns ==
There were a number of controversies surrounding the project.  One controversy was the environmental issues associated with the resources used to print out the internet.  When Goldsmith announced his project, ''Printing out the Internet'', people expressed concern with the potential environmental impact that the project may have.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://rhizome.org/editorial/2014/may/1/printing-out-internet/&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldsmith announced that he plans to recycle the paper after the exhibit, but there are environmental impacts that the act of printing of the Internet would have.  Logging, manufacturing, and transportation of paper all require energy and produce carbon dioxide emissions.  Trees also help to sequester carbon dioxide, acting as carbon sinks, and cutting down trees increases carbon dioxide emissions and decreases the amount of carbon that can be sequestered from the atmosphere.  Printing itself uses energy, which also produces carbon emissions.  Environmentalists are concerned with the contribution of [[greenhouse gas]]es, such as [[carbon dioxide]], to [[global warming]].  Also, there is waste generated from non-paper products, such as plastic and ink waste from ink cartridges.

Justin Swanhart started a petition called, “Please don’t print out the Internet,” asking Goldsmith to not continue with his project in light of the environmental impact that printing out the internet would have.  Swanhart collected 475 signatures on the petition.  Goldsmith acknowledged the petition on the Tumblr account created for the project and chose to continue the project.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Rapid visualization''' (also known as '''rapid vis''') is a technique used by [[graphic artist]]s to create a [[Concept art|drawing of a concept]] in several stages. After the completion of [[thumbnail|thumbnail drawing]]s, a preferred drawing is selected and rendered in full size, usually in [[pencil]]. Then a sheet of paper (layout bond) is put over the drawing and it is redrawn/traced with corrections, additions, and alterations. This process is repeated several times, often with color added at some stage, until the image is perfected to the desire of the artist.

The purpose of rapid vis is to take an idea from concept to accurate rendering without having to start over from scratch each time an edit or alteration is desired. The completed drawing is usually still considered a rough layout or comprehensive for approval submission (as opposed to [[work of art|finished art]] for framing or [[camera-ready]] art for reproduction).

'''Shivta''' ({{lang-he|שבטה}}, {{lang-ar|شبطا}}) is an ancient city in the [[Negev Desert]] of [[Israel]] located 43 kilometers southwest of [[Beersheba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segal|first=Arthur|date=1985-01-01|title=Shivta-A Byzantine Town in the Negev Desert|jstor=990111|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=44|issue=4|pages=317–328|doi=10.2307/990111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shivta was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in June 2005.

==History==
Long considered a classic [[Nabataean]] town on the ancient spice route, archaeologists are now considering the possibility that Shivta was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] agricultural colony and a way station for [[pilgrims]] en route to the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]].

Roman ruins from the first century BCE have been unearthed in the southern part of the town, but most of the archaeological findings date to the Byzantine period. Shivta’s water supply was based on surface runoff collected in large reservoirs.&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;[http://www.parks.org.il/parks/ParksAndReserves/shivta/Pages/default.aspx Shivta National Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Street in Shivta ruins in the Negev.jpg|thumb|left|Shivta ruins]]

Three Byzantine churches (a main church and two smaller churches), 2 wine-presses, residential areas and administrative buildings have been excavated at Shivta. After the [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century CE, the population dwindled. It was finally abandoned in the 8th or 9th Century CE.

In 1933-34, American archaeologist Harris D. Colt conducted a dig at Shivta. The house he lived in bears an inscription in ancient Greek that reads: “With good luck. Colt built (this house) with his own money."&lt;ref name="parks"/&gt;

The wine presses at Shivta give an insight into the scale of wine production at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-08-16|title=Deep in the desert|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-208557525.html|journal=|volume=|access-date=29 September 2016|website=highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the calculations of archaeologists, the Nabatean/Byzantine village of Shivta  produced about two million liters of wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-190054243.html No sour grapes, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the site is a large farm that uses Nabatean agricultural techniques of irrigation, sowing and reaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Around-Israel/A-hop-skip-and-a-jump-into-the-past|title=A hop, skip and a jump into the past|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Hurds'''" or "'''Odds and Ends'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], who included it in their collection (''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'') as ''Die Schlickerlinge''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Household Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/grimms/156oddsandends.html "Odds and Ends"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grimms noted they collected the tale in the [[Mecklenburg]] region. It is [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]] type 1451, a suitor chooses the thrifty girl.&lt;ref&gt;[[D.L. Ashliman]], "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimmtales.html The Grimm Brothers' Children's and Household Tales (Grimms' Fairy Tales)]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A lazy girl tore out handfuls of flax when she found a knot while spinning.  Her industrious servant gathered them and made a gown.  The lazy girl was to marry, but when the servant was gaily dancing in her gown at a party on the eve of the wedding, the bride told her bridegroom carelessly about the origin of that gown: it was made of "hurds" or "odds and ends" she threw away – and the bridegroom married the servant instead.

'''''The New Radical''''' is a 2017 documentary film that premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in the US Documentary Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6333062/|title=The New Radical|date=1 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, uncompromising millennial radicals from the United States and the United Kingdom attack the system through dangerous technological means, which evolves into a high-stakes game with world authorities in the midst of a dramatically changing political landscape. The film contains an interview with [[Julian Assange]] at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London.

== Critical response ==
Owen Gleiberman writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "The great strength of ''The New Radical'' is that it's not on its subjects' side (or totally against them either). It's the rare documentary that lets you decide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/the-new-radical-review-1201967572/|title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The New Radical’|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|date=24 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Katie Walsh in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film's objectivity "irresponsible" and "problematic," chastising the filmmakers for not taking a side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-new-radical-review-20171130-story.html|title=Documentary 'The New Radical' perilously withholds judgment|first=Katie|last=Walsh|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Unnamed Zone''''' ({{lang-es|La Zona}}) is a 2006 [[Spain|Spanish]] documentary film by director [[Carlos Rodríguez (film director)|Carlos Rodríguez]] about the lives of three young [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] children directly affected by the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]].

== Synopsis ==
The Spanish film crew led by Carlos Rodriguez is following the life stories of three children - Lidia Pidvalna, Anastasia Pavlenko, and Andriy Kovalchuk - whose lives were drastically changed after an explosion at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]] on April 26, 1986. Through the documentary, the children and their families "living perilously close to [[Zone of alienation|the exclusion zone around the destroyed station]] recount their fears, dreams, fantasies, and hopes for the future."&lt;ref name=ufc&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ufc/library_u.html#funn The Unnamed Zone]. ''Ukrainian Film Club of Columbia University''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each child holds a "Chernobyl certificate" which bestows access to government grants and aid and is a gruesome reminder of their existential reality.

In the words of Nathan Southern, "through his film, Rodriguez paints a melancholic, enduring portrait of three young lives, forever damaged by falling into the path of a cataclysmic disaster that both preceded them and overtook them."&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Nathan.  [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=381051 La Zona aka The Zone].  From ''Allmovie'' in ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodriguez own take on the synopsis for his documentary is revealing:  "after our experiences in... Ukraine, we believe that a nuclear disaster has consequences that are far more terrible and complex than its purely medical effects, as they pervade every single aspect of life in the area for several generations.&lt;ref name=ufc/&gt;

'''Venezuelan literature''' can be traced to [[Pre-Columbian|pre-Hispanic]] times with the myths and [[oral literature]] that formed the cosmogonic view of the world that indigenous people had. Some of these stories are still known in Venezuela. Like many [[Latin America]]n countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the greatest effect on both the culture and the literature. The first written documents by the Spanish colonizers are considered to be the origin of Venezuela's written literature.  This has included chronicles, letters, acts, etc. 

Venezuela's first major writer was [[Andrés Bello]]. Venezuelan literature developed in the 19th century with the formation of Venezuela as a nation state and the political conflicts of the time between conservatives and liberals. Notable works include ''[[Venezuela Heroica]]'' (1881), by [[Eduardo Blanco (writer)|Eduardo Blanco]], on the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]].

In the 20th century, with the modernization and urbanization of Venezuela thanks to the economic boom provided by the [[petroleum]], some of its finest writers were: [[Teresa de la Parra]], [[Rómulo Gallegos]], [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]], [[Salvador Garmendia]]. Gallegos' ''[[Doña Bárbara]]'' (1929) was described in 1974 as "possibly the most widely known Latin American novel".&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;Shaw, Donald, "Gallegos' Revision of Doña Bárbara 1929-30, ''Hispanic Review'' 42(3), Summer 1974, p265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Prize for Literature (Venezuela)|National Prize for Literature]], awarded annually, was established in 1948, with Uslar Pietri the only writer to win twice in the first five decades.

[[Rafael Cadenas]] and [[Eugenio Montejo]] are among the best known poets of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.

The site is located approximately 35&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the urban centre and about the same distance from the [[Yangguan|Yangguan Pass]]; the area served as a staging post for travellers on the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:敦煌西千佛洞石窟 |trans-title=Dunhuang Western Thousand Buddha Caves |language=Chinese, English, Japanese |editor=Zhang Xuerong |publisher=甘肃人民美术出版社 |year=1998 |isbn=9787805882314 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the western counterpart of the [[Mogao Caves]], also known as the "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" after the founding monk Yuezun's vision in 366 of "golden radiance in the form of a thousand Buddhas".&lt;ref name="Whitfield"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cave Temples of Mogao: Art and History on the Silk Road |author=Whitfield, Roderick (''et al.'') |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |year=2000 |isbn=0892365854 |pages=5, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caves were excavated from the cliff that runs along the north bank of the Dang River. A number have been lost to floods and collapse; some forty are still extant. Twenty-two decorated caves house 34 [[polychrome]] statues and 800 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of wall paintings, dating from the [[Northern Wei]] to the late-[[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and early-[[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Dynasties (sixth to fourteenth centuries).&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The site was included within the 1961 designation of the [[Mogao Caves]] as a [[Major Site Protected for Its Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level|Major National Historical and Cultural Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/96/InfoID/16/frtid/134/Default.aspx |title=国务院关于公布第一批全国重点文物保护单位名单的通知 (1st Designations) |date=3 April 1961 |publisher=[[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A manuscript from the [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Library Cave]], dating to the [[Five Dynasties]] and now at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]] in Paris, documents the early history of the site ([[Paul Pelliot|P]] 5034): according to the ''Domain Record of Shazhou Dudu Prefecture – Shouchang County'', "60 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' east of the county is a very old inscription that says '[[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Han Dynasty]]… made a small Buddha niche; the common people gradually built more'".&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_fr.a4d |title=French Collections |publisher=[[International Dunhuang Project]] |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8307389s |title=Pelliot Manuscript 5034 |publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Shouchang County, modern Nanhu&lt;!--Not easy to disambiguate, it seems to be adandoned http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/photograph/dunhuang/0195.html.en --&gt; Village, is the location of the [[Yangguan|Yangguan Pass]] along the [[Hexi Corridor]], it is understood that this is a reference to the origins of the Western Thousand Buddha Caves.&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt;

The decorated caves are in three main sections: Caves 1–19 at the west end of the cliff, approximately one kilometre from the modern reservoir; Cave 20 in the middle of the site, near the second [[floodgate]]; and Caves 21 and 22 at the eastern end of the cliff.&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; Most of the sculptures were restored in a different style during the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The caves at the western end of the site have had aluminium doors and glass partitions installed more recently with the intention of mitigating the [[Preventive conservation#Definition|environmental causes of deterioration]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; Some of the paintings at the far east end of the site, distant from the custodians' lodgings, have been [[Detachment of wall paintings|detached and remounted]] in a cave at [[Mogao Caves|Mogao]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The ruined state of the main Buddha image in [[Northern Wei]] Cave 7 enables the construction techniques to be seen: layers of earthen [[Plaster|render]] over an [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] of branches and reeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dha.ac.cn/0403/section.htm |script-title=zh:西千佛洞第7窟 |trans-title=Western Thousand Buddha Caves – Cave 7 |language=Chinese |publisher=[[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Academy]] |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of upper paint layers also reveals the linear grid used to set out the design of the Thousand Buddhas on the cave walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qwdo8vWeQr8C&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Performing the Visual: The Practice of Buddhist Wall Painting in China and Central Asia |author=Fraser, Sarah Elizabeth |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=9780804745338 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;
