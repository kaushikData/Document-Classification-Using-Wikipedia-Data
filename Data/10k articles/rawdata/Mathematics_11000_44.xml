It is the oldest text on mathematics in a Scandinavian language and survives in the early fourteenth-century manuscript [[Hauksbók]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4621">'''Algorithmic choreography''' is the technique of using algorithms to create dance. It is commonly described as using computers for choreographing dances, creating computer animations, studying or teaching aspects of human movement, illustrating dance movements, or assistance in notating dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lansdown|first1=John|title=Computer-Generated Choreography Revisited|url=http://www.4d-dynamics.net/4DD/guest-jl.html|publisher=Proceedings of 4D Dynamics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be applied in terms of choreographic software for stimulation, enabling real-time choreography and generative dance, or simulation with virtual dancers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gough|first1=Matthew|title=Towards Computer Generated Choreography|url=http://binarybutoh.blogspot.com/2005/09/towards-computer-generated.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of [[Dance technology]]. Historically, computers and dance can be traced back to the 1960s, for example, Michael Noll wrote an article about his work, titled "Choreography and Computers", published in Dance Magazine in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noll|first1=Michael|title=Choreography and Computers|url=http://noll.uscannenberg.org/Art%20Papers/Choreography.pdf|publisher=Dance Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple projects have worked with computers and choreography to create movement materials, choreographic scores, and other digital outcomes, for example:
* [[Merce Cunningham]] used the software Lifeforms by Credo Interactive (later Danceforms) to create dance works, starting in the 1990s with Thecla Schiphorst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schiphorst|first1=Thecla|title=A CASE STUDY OF MERCE CUNNINGHAM’S USE OF THE LIFEFORMS COMPUTER CHOREOGRAPHIC SYSTEM IN THE MAKING OF TRACKERS|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~tschipho/publications/Schiphorst_M.A.Thesis.pdf|publisher=Simon Fraser University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ChoreoGraph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChoreoGraph/Duplex|url=http://www.sdela.dds.nl/sfd/frankfin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a software tool from 1998 by choreographer [[Michael Klien]] and programmer Nick Rothwell. It was used to generate the score for the work DUPLEX in 2002.
* Improvisation Technologies was a CD-Rom by [[William Forsythe (choreographer)|William Forsythe]] and Christian Ziegler, Produced at ZKM Karlsruhe in 1999&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|last1=Forsythe|first1=William|title=Publications|url=http://www.williamforsythe.de/publications.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImprovisationTechnologies|url=http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/werke/ImprovisationTechnologiesAToolfortheAnalyticalDanceEye}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting as a way to document his processes for Ballet Frankfort, Forsythe developed this digital tool for analyzing movement.
* Software for Dancers was a UK-based project lead by Scott deLahunta in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=deLahunta|first1=Scott|title=Software for Dancers|url=http://www.sdela.dds.nl/sfd/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manifesting as a think tank, the project organized several workshops and symposia that explored rehearsal tools in the form of digital dance sketchbooks, performance tools, and documentation of dance.
* Synchronous Objects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synchronous Objects|url=http://synchronousobjects.osu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the score of the Forsythe work One Flat Thing, reproduced (2000), to create data and transform the dance into choreographic objects. These objects include digital components such as the Counterpoint Tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palazzi|first1=Maria|title=The Objects|url=http://synchronousobjects.osu.edu/content.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wayne McGregor]] has worked with the Choreographic Language Agent, an AI agent used to augment his process since 2004. The most recent iteration of this was Becoming a tool developed with Marc Downie and Nick Rothwell. The aim is to provoke new movement creation in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choreographic Language Agent|url=http://waynemcgregor.com/research/choreographic-language-agent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choreographic Coding Lab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choreographic Coding Lab|url=http://choreographiccoding.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a touring laboratory looking to explore connections of the data generated during dance and choreography with coding.
* Kate Sicchio joins the fields of algorithmic choreography and [[Live coding]], through her projects Hacking Choreography (2012) and Hacking Choreography 2.0 (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sicchio|first1=Kate|title=Hacking Choreography|url=http://blog.sicchio.com/works/hacking-choreography/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogues to Algorithmic Choregraphy can be seen in traditional dance such as the [[Maypole]] dancing.

In algebraic topology, the '''Bousfield class''' of, say, a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] ''X'' is the set of all (say) spectra ''Y'' whose [[smash product]] with ''X'' is zero: &lt;math&gt;X \otimes Y = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Two objects are '''Bousfield equivalent''' if their Bousfield classes are the same.

The notion applies to [[module spectrum|module spectra]] and in that case one usually qualifies a ring spectrum over which the smash product is taken.

In [[colorimetry]], '''CIECAM02''' is the [[color appearance model]] published in 2002 by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) Technical Committee 8-01 (''Color Appearance Modelling for Color Management Systems'') and the successor of [[Color appearance model#CIECAM97s|CIECAM97s]].&lt;ref name=cam97s&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Color Research &amp; Applications|title=A Revision of CIECAM97s for Practical Applications|first3=R.

It includes forward and reverse modes. Some problems in using this model were found in recent field trials. This article suggests revision to the model in two respects: (a) to make the lightness (J) zero when the Y tristimulus value is zero, under all surround conditions; (b) to modify the chromatic induction factor (Nc) from 1.10 to 0.95 for the dim surround condition. To avoid confusion, it is suggested that the revised version of the model be designated CAM97s2. The article also describes an alternative mode to achieve a more nearly exact reversibility between the forward and reverse modes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major parts of the model are its [[chromatic adaptation]] transform, '''CIECAT02''', and its equations for calculating mathematical correlates for the six technically defined dimensions of color appearance: [[brightness]] ([[luminance]]), [[Lightness (color)|lightness]], [[colorfulness]], [[colorfulness|chroma]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]], and [[hue]].

[[Brightness]] is the subjective appearance of how bright an object appears given its surroundings and how it is illuminated. [[Lightness (color)|Lightness]] is the subjective appearance of how light a color appears to be. [[Colorfulness]] is the degree of difference between a color and grey. [[colorfulness|Chroma]] is the colorfulness relative to the brightness of another color that appears white under similar viewing conditions. This allows for the fact that a surface of a given chroma displays increasing colorfulness as the level of illumination increases. [[Saturation (color theory)|Saturation]] is the colorfulness of a color relative to its own brightness. [[Hue]] is the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, green, blue, and yellow, the so-called [[unique hues]]. The colors that make up an object’s appearance are best described in terms of lightness and chroma when talking about the colors that make up the object’s surface, and it in terms of brightness, saturation and colorfulness when talking about the light that is emitted by or reflected off the object.

CIECAM02 takes for its input the [[tristimulus value]]s of the stimulus, the tristimulus values of an adapting [[white point]], adapting background, and surround luminance information, and whether or not observers are discounting the [[illuminant]] ([[color constancy]] is in effect). The model can be used to predict these appearance attributes or, with forward and reverse implementations for distinct viewing conditions, to compute corresponding colors.

CIECAM02 is used in [[Windows Vista]]'s [[Windows Color System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/color/WCS.mspx “Windows Color System: The Next Generation Color Management System”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727174500/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/color/WCS.mspx# |date=2010-07-27 }}. Microsoft white paper. September 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewing conditions==
The inner circle is the ''stimulus'', from which the tristimulus values should be measured in CIE XYZ using the [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|2° standard observer]]. The intermediate circle is the ''proximal field'', extending out another 2°. The outer circle is the ''background'', reaching out to 10°, from which the relative luminance (Y&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) need be measured. If the proximal field is the same color as the background, the background is considered to be adjacent to the stimulus. Beyond the circles which comprise the ''display field'' (''display area'', ''viewing area'') is the ''surround field'' (or ''peripheral area''), which can be considered to be the entire room. The totality of the proximal field, background, and surround is called the ''adapting field'' (the field of view that supports adaptation—extends to the limit of vision).&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|chapter=The Future of Colorimetry in the CIE: Color Appearance|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|first=János|last=Schanda|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|page=359|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to the literature, it is also useful to be aware of the difference between the terms ''adopted white point'' (the computational [[white point]]) and the ''adapted white point'' (the observer white point).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgeuoz_muCIC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=%22adapting+field%22+background+environment |title=Computational Colour Science Using MATLAB|first=Stephen|last=Westland|author2=Ripamonti, Caterina|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=0-470-84562-7|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction may be important in mixed mode illumination, where psychophysical phenomena come into play. This is a subject of research.

==Parameter decision table==
CIECAM02 defines three surround(ing)s – average, dim, and dark – with associated parameters defined here for reference in the rest of this article:&lt;ref name=meetcam02&gt;{{cite conference|title=The CIECAM02 Color Appearance Model|booktitle=IS&amp;T/SID Tenth Color Imaging Conference|last=Moroney|first=Nathan|author2=Fairchild, Mark D.|author3=Hunt, Robert W.G.|author4=Li, Changjun|author5=Luo, M.

The 0.2 coefficient derives from the "gray world" assumption (~18%–20% reflectivity). It tests whether the surround luminance is darker or brighter than medium gray.
* ''F'': factor determining degree of adaptation
* ''c'': impact of surrounding
* ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;: chromatic induction factor

For intermediate conditions, these values can be linearly interpolated.&lt;ref name=meetcam02/&gt;

The absolute luminance of the adapting field, which is a quantity that will be needed later, should be measured with a [[photometer]]. If one is not available, it can be calculated using a reference white:

:&lt;math&gt;
  L_A = \frac{E_w}{\pi} \frac{Y_b}{Y_w} = \frac{L_W Y_b}{Y_w}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; is the relative luminance of background, the {{nobr|1=''E''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''πL''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the illuminance of the reference white in lux, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; is the absolute luminance of the reference white in cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; is the relative luminance of the reference white in the adapting field. If unknown, the adapting field can be assumed to have average reflectance ("gray world" assumption): {{nobr|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; / 5}}.

''Note'': Care should be taken not to confuse ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt;, the absolute [[luminance]] of the reference white in cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; the red cone response in the [[LMS color space]].

==Chromatic adaptation==

=== Summary ===
# Convert to the "spectrally sharpened" CAT02 LMS space to prepare for adaptation. ''Spectral sharpening'' is the transformation of the tristimulus values into new values that would have resulted from a sharper, more concentrated set of spectral sensitivities. It is argued that this aids color constancy, especially in the blue region.(Compare Finlayson et al. 94, Spectral Sharpening:Sensor Transformations for Improved Colour Constancy)
# Perform chromatic adaptation using CAT02 (also known as the "modified CMCCAT2000 transform").
# Convert to an LMS space closer to the cone fundamentals. It is argued that predicting perceptual attribute correlates is best done in such spaces.&lt;ref name=meetcam02/&gt;
# Perform post-adaptation cone response compression.

=== CAT02 ===
Given a set of [[tristimulus value]]s in [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ]], the corresponding [[LMS color space|LMS]] values can be determined by the '''M'''&lt;sub&gt;''CAT02''&lt;/sub&gt; [[transformation matrix]] (calculated using the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 2° standard colorimetric observer]]).&lt;ref name=cam97s/&gt; The sample color in the ''test'' illuminant is:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    L\\
    M\\
    S
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \mathbf{M}_\mathit{CAT02}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    X\\
    Y\\
    Z
  \end{bmatrix},\quad
  \mathbf{M}_\mathit{CAT02}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
     \;\;\,0.7328 &amp; 0.4296 &amp; -0.1624\\
    -0.7036 &amp; 1.6975 &amp;  \;\;\,0.0061\\
     \;\;\,0.0030 &amp; 0.0136 &amp;  \;\;\,0.9834
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Once in LMS, the white point can be adapted to the desired degree by choosing the parameter ''D''.&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt; For the general CAT02, the ''corresponding'' color in the reference illuminant is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  L_c &amp;= \Big(\frac{Y_w L_{wr}}{Y_{wr} L_w} D + 1-D\Big)L\\
  M_c &amp;=\Big(\frac{Y_w M_{wr}}{Y_{wr} M_w} D + 1-D\Big)M\\
  S_c &amp;= \Big(\frac{Y_w S_{wr}}{Y_{wr} S_w} D + 1-D\Big)S\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ciecam02 degree of adaptation.svg|400px|right]]

where the {{nobr|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''wr''&lt;/sub&gt;}} factor accounts for the two illuminants having the same chromaticity but different reference whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chromatic Adaptation Transforms|first=Robert W. G.|last=Hunt|author2=Changjun Li |author3=M. Ronnier Luo |publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|doi=10.1002/col.20085|journal=Color Research &amp; Applications|date=February 2005|volume=30|quote=Chromatic adaptation transforms (CATs) have appeared in different forms. The reasons for these forms, and the relationships between them, are described. The factors governing which type of CAT should be used in different applications are explained|page=69|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subscripts indicate the cone response for white under the test (''w'') and reference illuminant (''wr''). The degree of adaptation (discounting) ''D'' can be set to zero for no adaptation (stimulus is considered self-luminous) and unity for complete adaptation ([[color constancy]]). In practice, it ranges from 0.65 to 1.0, as can be seen from the diagram. Intermediate values can be calculated by:&lt;ref name=meetcam02/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  D = F \left( 1 - \textstyle{\frac{1}{3.6}} e^{-(L_A + 42) / 92} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where surround ''F'' is as defined above and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''adapting field luminance'' in cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=cam97s/&gt;

[[File:ciecam02 luminance level adaptation factor.svg|400px|right|thumb|log-log plot of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; vs. ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; (''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; ranges from 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; ranges from 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10). The cube root approximation of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is {{nobr|1=0.1715''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}]]

In CIECAM02, the reference illuminant has equal energy {{nobr|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''wr''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''wr''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''wr''&lt;/sub&gt; = 100}}) and the reference white is the ''perfect reflecting diffuser'' (i.e., unity reflectance, and {{nobr|1=''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''wr''&lt;/sub&gt; = 100}}) hence:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  L_c &amp;= \Big(\frac{Y_w}{L_w} D + 1-D\Big)L\\
  M_c &amp;=\Big(\frac{Y_w}{M_w} D + 1-D\Big)M\\
  S_c &amp;= \Big(\frac{Y_w}{S_w} D + 1-D\Big)S\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, if the reference white in both illuminants have the ''Y'' tristimulus value ({{nobr|1=''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''wr''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}}) then:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  L_c &amp;= \Big(\frac{L_{wr}}{L_w} D + 1-D\Big)L\\
  M_c &amp;=\Big(\frac{M_{wr}}{M_w} D + 1-D\Big)M\\
  S_c &amp;= \Big(\frac{S_{wr}}{S_w} D + 1-D\Big)S\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Post-adaptation ===
After adaptation, the cone responses are converted to the Hunt–Pointer–Estévez space by [[LMS color space#XYZ to LMS|going to XYZ and back]]:&lt;ref name=meetcam02/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    L' \\
    M' \\
    S'
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \mathbf{M}_H
  \begin{bmatrix}
    X_c \\
    Y_c \\
    Z_c
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \mathbf{M}_H
  \mathbf{M}_{CAT02}^{-1}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    L_c \\
    M_c \\
    S_c
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{M}_H
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
     \;\;\,0.38971 &amp; 0.68898 &amp; -0.07868 \\
    -0.22981 &amp; 1.18340 &amp;  \;\;\,0.04641 \\
     \;\;\,0.00000 &amp; 0.00000 &amp;  \;\;\,1.00000
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ciecat02 response compression.svg|400px|right|thumb|log ''L''′&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; vs. log ''L''′ for {{nobr|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = 200}} ({{nobr|1=''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}})]]

Finally, the response is compressed based on the generalized Michaelis–Menten equation (as depicted aside):&lt;ref name=meetcam02/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  k = \frac{1}{5 L_A + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  F_L = \textstyle{\frac{1}{5}} k^4 \left( 5 L_A \right) + \textstyle{\frac{1}{10}} {(1 - k^4)}^2 {\left( 5 L_A \right)}^{1/3}
&lt;/math&gt;

''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is the luminance level adaptation factor.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  L'_a &amp;= \frac{400 {\left(F_L L'/100\right)}^{0.42}}{27.13 + {\left(F_L L'/100\right)}^{0.42}} + 0.1 \\
  M'_a &amp;= \frac{400 {\left(F_L M'/100\right)}^{0.42}}{27.13 + {\left(F_L M'/100\right)}^{0.42}} + 0.1 \\
  S'_a &amp;= \frac{400 {\left(F_L S'/100\right)}^{0.42}}{27.13 + {\left(F_L S'/100\right)}^{0.42}} + 0.1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As previously mentioned, if the luminance level of the background is unknown, it can be estimated from the absolute luminance of the white point as {{nobr|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; / 5}} using the "medium gray" assumption. (The expression for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is given in terms of 5''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; for convenience.) In [[photopic]] conditions, the luminance level adaptation factor (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) is proportional to the cube root of the luminance of the adapting field (''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;). In [[scotopic]] conditions, it is proportional to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; (meaning no luminance level adaptation). The photopic threshold is roughly {{nobr|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}} (see ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;–''L''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; graph above).

==Appearance correlates==
CIECAM02 defines correlates for yellow-blue, red-green, brightness, and colorfulness. Let us make some preliminary definitions.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  C_1 &amp;= L^\prime_a - M^\prime_a \\
  C_2 &amp;= M^\prime_a - S^\prime_a \\
  C_3 &amp;= S^\prime_a - L^\prime_a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''correlate for red–green''' (''a'') is the magnitude of the departure of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from the criterion for unique yellow ({{nobr|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / 11}}), and the '''correlate for yellow–blue''' (''b'') is based on the mean of the magnitude of the departures of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from unique red ({{nobr|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and unique green ({{nobr|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a &amp;= C_1 - \textstyle{\frac{1}{11}}C_2
    &amp;= L^\prime_a - \textstyle{\frac{12}{11}} M^\prime_a + \textstyle{\frac{1}{11}} S^\prime_a \\
  b &amp;= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}} \left( C_2 - C_1 + C_1 - C_3 \right) / 4.5
    &amp;= \textstyle{\frac{1}{9}} \left( L^\prime_a + M^\prime_a - 2S^\prime_a \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The 4.5 factor accounts for the fact that there are fewer [[cone cell|cones]] at shorter wavelengths (the eye is less sensitive to blue). The order of the terms is such that b is positive for yellowish colors (rather than blueish).

The '''hue angle''' (''h'') can be found by converting the rectangular coordinate (''a'', ''b'') into polar coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;
  h = \angle (a, b),\ (0 &lt; h &lt; 360^\circ)
&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the eccentricity (''e''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;) and hue composition (''H''), determine which quadrant the hue is in with the aid of the following table. Choose ''i'' such that {{nobr|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''h''′ &lt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{nobr|1=''h''′ = ''h''}} if {{nobr|1=''h'' &gt; ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nobr|1=''h''′ = ''h'' + 360°}} otherwise.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  H &amp;= H_i + \frac{100 (h^\prime - h_i) / e_i}{(h^\prime - h_i) / e_i + (h_{i+1} - h^\prime) / e_{i+1}} \\
  e_t &amp;= \textstyle{\frac{1}{4}} \left[ \cos\left( \textstyle{\frac{\pi}{180}}h + 2\right) + 3.8 \right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(This is not exactly the same as the eccentricity factor given in the table.)

Calculate the achromatic response ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;
  A = (2 L^\prime_a + M^\prime_a + \textstyle{\frac{1}{20}} S^\prime_a - 0.305) N_{bb}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp;N_{bb} = N_{cb} = 0.725 n^{-0.2} \\
  &amp;n = Y_b / Y_w
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The correlate of '''lightness''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
  J = 100 \left( A / A_w \right)^{c z}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the impact of surround (see above), and

:&lt;math&gt;
  z = 1.48 + \sqrt{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

The correlate of '''brightness''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
  Q = \left(4 / c \right) \sqrt{\textstyle{\frac{1}{100}} J} \left(A_w + 4\right) F_L^{1/4}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then calculate a temporary quantity ''t'',

:&lt;math&gt;
  t = \frac{ \textstyle{\frac{50\,000}{13}} N_c N_{cb} e_t \sqrt{a^2+b^2} }
           { L_a^\prime + M_a^\prime + \textstyle{\frac{21}{20}} S_a^\prime }
&lt;/math&gt;

The correlate of '''chroma''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
  C = t^{0.9} \sqrt {\textstyle{\frac{1}{100}} J} (1.64 - 0.29^n)^{0.73}
&lt;/math&gt;

The correlate of '''colorfulness''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
  M = C \cdot F_L^{1/4}
&lt;/math&gt;

The correlate of '''saturation''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
  s = 100 \sqrt {M / Q}
&lt;/math&gt;

==CIECAM02 as a model of human visual processing==

Like many color models, CIECAM02 aims to model the human perception of color. The CIECAM02 model has been shown to be a plausible model of neural activity in the [[Visual cortex|primary visual cortex]], compared to the earlier [[CIELAB]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thwaites|first=Andrew|last2=Wingfield|first2=Cai|last3=Wieser|first3=Eric|last4=Soltan|first4=Andrew|last5=Marslen-Wilson|first5=William D.|last6=Nimmo-Smith|first6=Ian|title=Entrainment to the CIECAM02 and CIELAB colour appearance models in the human cortex|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2018.01.011|journal=Vision Research|volume=145|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2018.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''collapse''' reduces a [[simplicial complex]] (or more generally, a [[CW complex]]) to a [[Homotopy#Homotopy_equivalence|homotopy-equivalent]] subcomplex. Collapses, like CW complexes themselves, were invented by [[J. H. C. Whitehead]].&lt;ref name="Whitehead"&gt;[[J. H. C. Whitehead|Whitehead, J.H.C.]] (1938) ''Simplicial spaces, nuclei and m-groups'', [[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]] 45, pp 243&amp;ndash;327&lt;/ref&gt; Collapses find applications in [[Computational topology#Computational homology|computational homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55897585|title=Computational homology|first=Tomasz|last=Kaczynski|date=2004|publisher=Springer|others=Mischaikow, Konstantin Michael, Mrozek, Marian,|isbn=9780387215976|location=New York|oclc=55897585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be an  [[abstract simplicial complex]].

Suppose that &lt;math&gt; \tau, \sigma \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that the following two conditions are satisfied: 

# &lt;math&gt; \tau \subset  \sigma&lt;/math&gt;, in particular &lt;math&gt; \dim \tau &lt;\dim  \sigma&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;  \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal face of K and no other maximal face of K contains &lt;math&gt; \tau  &lt;/math&gt;,

then &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''free face'''. 

A simplicial '''collapse''' of K is the removal of all simplices &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt; \tau \subseteq\gamma \subseteq  \sigma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a free face. If additionally we have dim τ = dim σ-1, then this is called an '''elementary collapse'''. 

A simplicial complex that has a sequence of collapses leading to a point is called '''collapsible'''. Every collapsible complex is [[Contractible space|contractible]], but the converse is not true.

This definition can be extended to [[CW-complex]]es and is the basis for the concept of [[simple-homotopy equivalence]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Marshall M. (1973) ''A Course in Simple-Homotopy Theory'', Springer-Verlag New York&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples==
* Complexes that do not have a free face cannot be collapsible.  Two such interesting examples are [[R. H. Bing]]'s [[house with two rooms]] and [[Christopher Zeeman]]'s [[Dunce hat (topology)|dunce hat]]; they are [[contractible]] (homotopy equivalent to a point), but not collapsible.
* Any ''n''-dimensional [[PL manifold]] that is collapsible is in fact piecewise-linearly isomorphic to an ''n''-ball.&lt;ref name="Whitehead" /&gt;

{{Automata theory}}

In [[digital circuit]] theory, '''combinational logic''' (sometimes also referred to as '''time-independent logic'''&lt;ref&gt;
C.J. Savant, Jr.; Martin Roden; Gordon Carpenter.
"Electronic Design: Circuits and Systems".
1991.
{{ISBN|0-8053-0285-9}}
p. 682
&lt;/ref&gt;
) is a type of [[digital logic]] which is implemented by [[Boolean circuit]]s, where the output is a [[pure function]] of the present input only. This is in contrast to [[sequential logic]], in which the output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the input. In other words, sequential logic has ''[[computer storage|memory]]'' while combinational logic does not.

Combinational logic is used in [[computer]] circuits to perform [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] on input signals and on stored data. Practical computer circuits normally contain a mixture of combinational and sequential logic. For example, the part of an [[arithmetic logic unit]], or ALU, that does mathematical calculations is constructed using combinational logic. Other circuits used in computers, such as [[half adder]]s, [[full adder]]s, [[half subtractor]]s, [[Half subtractor|full subtractors]], [[multiplexer]]s, [[Multiplexer|demultiplexers]], [[encoder]]s and [[Binary decoder|decoders]] are also made by using combinational logic.

An alternate term is '''combinatorial logic''',&lt;ref&gt;Clive Maxfield. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kQuOKBSOz5QC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22combinatorial+logic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vBSdULe_LMPHqQGploDoCg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22combinatorial%20logic%22&amp;f=false "FPGAs: World Class Designs"]. p. 70. 2009. {{ISBN|1856176215}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this usage may be considered controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Cummings. [http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/Technical_Text_Mistakes.pdf "Common Mistakes In Technical Texts"]. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
Combinational logic is used to build circuits that produce specified outputs from certain inputs. The construction of combinational logic is generally done using one of two methods: a sum of products, or a product of sums. Consider the following truth table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! {{nobold|{{mvar|A}}}} || {{nobold|{{mvar|B}}}} || {{nobold|{{mvar|C}}}} || Result || [[logical equivalence|Logical equivalent]]
|-
| {{no|F}} || {{no|F}} || {{no|F}} || {{no|F}} || &lt;math&gt;\neg A \cdot \neg B \cdot \neg C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| {{no|F}} || {{no|F}} || {{yes|T}} || {{no|F}} || &lt;math&gt;\neg A \cdot \neg B \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| {{no|F}} || {{yes|T}} || {{no|F}} || {{no|F}} || &lt;math&gt;\neg A \cdot B \cdot \neg C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| {{no|F}} || {{yes|T}} || {{yes|T}} || {{no|F}} || &lt;math&gt;\neg A \cdot B \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| {{yes|T}} || {{no|F}} || {{no|F}} || {{yes|T}} || &lt;math&gt;A \cdot \neg B \cdot \neg C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| {{yes|T}} || {{no|F}} || {{yes|T}} || {{no|F}} || &lt;math&gt;A \cdot \neg B \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| {{yes|T}} || {{yes|T}} || {{no|F}} || {{no|F}} || &lt;math&gt;A \cdot B \cdot \neg C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| {{yes|T}} || {{yes|T}} || {{yes|T}} || {{yes|T}} || &lt;math&gt;A \cdot B \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Using sum of products, all logical statements which yield true results are summed, giving the result:

: &lt;math&gt;A \cdot \neg B \cdot \neg C + A \cdot B \cdot C \,&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], the result simplifies to the following equivalent of the truth table:

: &lt;math&gt;A \cdot (\neg B \cdot \neg C + B \cdot C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Logic formula minimization==
Minimization (simplification) of combinational logic formulas is done using the following rules based on the [[Boolean algebra#Laws|laws of Boolean algebra]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(A + B) \cdot (A + C) &amp;= A + (B \cdot C) \\
(A \cdot B) + (A \cdot C) &amp;= A \cdot (B + C)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A + (A \cdot B) &amp;= A \\
A \cdot (A + B) &amp;= A

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

A + (\lnot A \cdot B) &amp;= A + B \\
A \cdot(\lnot A + B) &amp;= A \cdot B

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

(A + B)\cdot(\lnot A + B)&amp;=B \\
(A \cdot B) + (\lnot A \cdot B)&amp;=B

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

(A \cdot B) + (\lnot A \cdot C) + (B \cdot C) &amp;= (A \cdot B) + (\lnot A \cdot C) \\
(A + B) \cdot (\lnot A + C) \cdot (B + C) &amp;= (A + B) \cdot (\lnot A + C)

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the use of minimization (sometimes called [[logic optimization]]), a simplified logical function or circuit may be arrived upon, and the logic [[combinational circuit]] becomes smaller, and easier to analyse, use, or build.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1316">'''Computable model theory''' is a branch of [[model theory]] which deals with questions of [[computability]] as they apply to model-theoretical structures. 
==History==
It was developed almost simultaneously by mathematicians in the West, primarily located in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Russia]] during the middle of the 20th century.  Because of the [[Cold War]] there was little communication between these two groups and so a number of important results were discovered independently.

==Introduction==
Computable model theory introduces the ideas of computable and decidable models and theories and one of the basic problems is discovering whether or not computable or decidable models fulfilling certain model-theoretic conditions can be shown to exist.

'''Computer-based mathematics education''' ('''CBME''') is an approach to [[teaching mathematics]] that emphasizes the use of computers.  

== Computers in math education ==
Computers are used in education in a number of ways, such as interactive [[tutorials]], [[hypermedia]], [[simulation]]s and [[educational games]].&lt;ref name="MfL"&gt;{{citation|title = Multimedia for Learning|author = Stephen M. Alessi, Stanley R. Trollip|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Multimedia_for_learning.html?id=mmruAAAAMAAJ|isbn = 978-0-205-27691-2|year = 2001|publisher = Allyn and Bacon|format = }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Tutorials are types of software that present information, check learning by question/answer method, judge responses, and provide feedback.&lt;ref name=MfL/&gt;  

Educational games are more like simulations and are used from the elementary to college level.&lt;ref name=MfL/&gt; [[The Incredible Machines]] is a good example of this type.

[[E learning]] systems can deliver math lessons and exercises and manage homework assignments.

'''''Concepts of Modern Mathematics''''' is a 1975 book by mathematician and science popularizer [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] about recent developments in [[mathematics]].&lt;ref name="heuer"&gt;Review of the 1995 Dover reprint of the 1981 edition, by G. A. Heuer (1996), {{mr|1319145}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book arose out of an extramural class that Ian Stewart taught at the [[University of Warwick]] about "Modern mathematics".&lt;ref name="heuer"/&gt; In the 1995 [[Dover Publications|Dover]] edition Stewart wrote that the aim of the class was:

:''to explain why the underlying abstract point of view had gained currency among research mathematicians, and to examine how it opened up entirely new realms of mathematical thought''.

The book is aimed at non-mathematicians. However, there are frequent equations and diagrams and the level of presentation is more technical than some of Stewart's other popular books such as ''[[Flatterland]]''. Topics covered include [[analytic geometry]], [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]], [[group theory]], [[topology]], and [[probability]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1362">In [[mathematics]], specifically [[set theory]], a '''continuous function''' is a sequence of [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s such that the values assumed at limit stages are the limits ([[Limit superior and limit inferior|limit suprema and limit infima]]) of all values at previous stages. More formally, let γ be an ordinal, and &lt;math&gt;s := \langle s_{\alpha}| \alpha &lt; \gamma\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a γ-sequence of ordinals.  Then ''s'' is continuous if at every limit ordinal β &lt; γ,
:&lt;math&gt;s_{\beta} = \limsup\{s_{\alpha}: \alpha &lt; \beta\} = \inf \{ \sup\{s_{\alpha}: \delta \leq \alpha &lt; \beta\} : \delta &lt; \beta\} &lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;s_{\beta} = \liminf\{s_{\alpha}: \alpha &lt; \beta\} = \sup \{ \inf\{s_{\alpha}: \delta \leq \alpha &lt; \beta\} : \delta &lt; \beta\} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, ''s'' is continuous if ''s'': γ → range(s) is a [[continuous (topology)|continuous function]] when the sets are each equipped with the [[order topology]]. These continuous functions are often used in [[cofinality|cofinalities]] and [[cardinal numbers]]. 

A [[normal function]] is a function that is both continuous and [[monotonic function|increasing]].

In [[differential geometry]], the '''equivalent latitude''' is a [[Lagrangian coordinates|Lagrangian coordinate]] .
It is often used in [[atmospheric science]],
particularly in the study of [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] dynamics.
Each isoline in a map of equivalent latitude follows the [[flow velocity]] and encloses the same area as the latitude line of equivalent value, hence "equivalent latitude."  
Equivalent latitude is calculated from [[potential vorticity]],  from passive tracer simulations  and from actual measurements of atmospheric tracers such as [[ozone]].

==Calculation of equivalent latitude==

The calculation of equivalent latitude involves creating a [[monotonic function|
monotonic mapping]] between the values of equivalent latitude and
the tracer it is based upon: higher values of the tracer map to higher
values of equivalent latitude.
A precise method is to assign a
representative area to each of the tracer measurements, filling the entire globe.
Thus, for a tracer field regularly gridded in longitude and latitude, 
grid points closer to the pole will take up a smaller area,
in proportion to the cosine of the latitude.
Now, [[sorting|rank]] all the tracer values then form the cumulative sum.
The equivalent latitude from the area is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \sin^{-1} \left ( \frac{A}{2 \pi R^2} -1 \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area enclosed to the South (''A'' = 0 corresponds to the equivalent South Pole) and ''R'' is the radius of the Earth.
This method generates a mapping that is as continuous as the data allows
as opposed to binning which produces a coarse-grained mapping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1474">In [[algebraic number theory]], an '''equivariant Artin L-function''' is a function associated to a finite [[Galois extension]] of [[global field]]s created by packaging together the various [[Artin L-function]]s associated with the extension.  Each extension has many traditional Artin L-functions associated with it, corresponding to the [[group character|character]]s of [[Representation (mathematics)|representations]] of the Galois group. By contrast, each extension has a unique corresponding equivariant L-function.

Equivariant L-functions have become increasingly important as a wide range of conjectures and theorems in number theory have been developed around them.  Among these are the [[Brumer&amp;ndash;Stark conjecture]], the [[Coates-Sinnott conjecture]], and a recently developed [[equivariant Iwasawa conjecture|equivariant version]] of the [[Iwasawa main conjecture|main conjecture]] in [[Iwasawa theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4926">In [[set theory]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], a collection ''F'' of [[subset]]s of a given [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called a '''family of subsets''' of ''S'', or a '''family of sets''' over ''S''. More generally, a collection of any sets whatsoever is called a '''family of sets'''.

The term "collection" is used here because, in some contexts, a family of sets may be allowed to contain repeated copies of any given member,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pg. 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pg. 692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biggs|1985|loc=pg. 89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other contexts it may form a [[Class (set theory)|proper class]] rather than a set.

== Examples ==
* The [[power set]] '''P'''(''S'') is a family of sets over ''S''.
* The [[finite set|''k''-subsets]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; of a set ''S'' form a family of sets. 
* Let ''S'' = {a,b,c,1,2}, an example of a family of sets over ''S'' (in the [[multiset]] sense) is given by ''F'' = {A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} where A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {a,b,c}, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {1,2}, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {1,2} and A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = {a,b,1}.
* The class Ord of all [[ordinal number]]s is a ''large'' family of sets; that is, it is not itself a set but instead a [[Class (set theory)|proper class]].

==Special types of set family==
* A [[Sperner family]] is a family of sets in which none of the sets contains any of the others. [[Sperner's theorem]] bounds the maximum size of a Sperner family.
* A [[Helly family]] is a family of sets such that any minimal subfamily with empty intersection has bounded size. [[Helly's theorem]] states that convex sets in Euclidean spaces of bounded dimension form Helly families.

== Properties ==
* Any family of subsets of ''S'' is itself a subset of the power set '''P'''(''S'') if it has no repeated members.
* Any family of sets without repetitions is a [[subclass (sets)|subclass]] of the proper class '''V''' of all sets (the [[universe (math)|universe]]).
* [[Hall's marriage theorem]], due to [[Philip Hall]] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite family of non-empty sets (repetitions allowed) to have a [[transversal (combinatorics)|system of distinct representatives]].

== Related concepts ==
Certain types of objects from other areas of mathematics are equivalent to families of sets, in that they can be described purely as a collection of sets of objects of some type:
* A [[hypergraph]], also called a set system, is formed by a set of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] together with another set of ''[[hyperedges]]'', each of which may be an arbitrary set. The hyperedges of a hypergraph form a family of sets, and any family of sets can be interpreted as a hypergraph that has the union of the sets as its vertices.
* An [[abstract simplicial complex]] is a combinatorial abstraction of the notion of a [[simplicial complex]], a shape formed by unions of line segments, triangles, tetrahedra, and higher-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]], joined face to face. In an abstract simplicial complex, each simplex is represented simply as the set of its vertices. Any family of finite sets without repetitions in which the subsets of any set in the family also belong to the family forms an abstract simplicial complex.
* An [[incidence structure]] consists of a set of ''points'', a set of ''lines'', and an (arbitrary) [[binary relation]], called the ''incidence relation'', specifying which points belong to which lines. An incidence structure can be specified by a family of sets (even if two distinct lines contain the same set of points), the sets of points belonging to each line, and any family of sets can be interpreted as an incidence structure in this way.
* A binary [[block code]] consists of a set of codewords, each of which is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of 0s and 1s, all the same length. When each pair of codewords has large [[Hamming distance]], it can be used as an [[error-correcting code]]. A block code can also be described as a family of sets, by describing each codeword as the set of positions at which it contains a&amp;nbsp;1.

The algorithm is often used as a subroutine in a search for a [[maximum likelihood]] estimate for an evolutionary tree.  Further, it can be used in a hypothesis test for whether evolutionary rates are constant (by using [[likelihood ratio test]]s).  It can also be used to provide error estimates for the parameters describing an evolutionary tree.

In [[optics]], '''Fermat's principle''' or the '''principle of least time''', named after French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]], is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schuster]], ''An Introduction to the Theory of Optics'', London: Edward Arnold, 1904 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03146755&amp;id=X0AcBd-bcCwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=fermat%27s-principle online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] off mirrors, [[refraction|refracted]] through different media, or undergoing [[total internal reflection]]. It follows mathematically from [[Huygens' principle]] (at the limit of small [[wavelength]]). Fermat's text ''Analyse des réfractions'' exploits the technique of [[adequality]] to derive [[Snell's law]] of [[refraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of reflection]].

Fermat's principle has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] and it is the basis of [[Hamiltonian optics]].

==Modern version==
The time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points '''A''' and '''B''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \frac{c}{v} \frac{ds}{dt}\, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''ds'' an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, ''v'' = ''ds''/''dt'' the speed of light in a medium and ''n'' = ''c''/''v'' the [[refractive index]] of that medium, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting time (the wave front is in '''A'''), &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time at '''B'''. The optical path length of a ray from a point '''A''' to a point '''B''' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

and it is related to the travel time by ''S'' = ''cT''. The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An [[extremum]] in the light travel time between two points '''A''' and '''B''' is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that {{quote|the optical length of the path followed by light between two fixed points, '''A''' and '''B''', is an extremum. The optical length is defined as the physical length multiplied by the refractive index of the material."&lt;ref&gt;R. Marques, F. Martin, and M. Sorolla. Metamaterials with Negative Parameters. Wiley, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of [[calculus of variations]] this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n \, ds =0 &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the refractive index is a [[scalar field]] of position in space, that is, &lt;math&gt;n=n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[euclidean space]]. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as &lt;math&gt;s=\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;nds=n \frac{\sqrt{dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2}}{dx_3}dx_3=n \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2} \ dx_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_k=dx_k/dx_3&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of Fermat can now be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right) \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2}\, dx_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} L\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_1\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)\, dx_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] but in which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; takes the role of time in [[classical mechanics]]. Function &lt;math&gt;L\left(x_1,x_2,\dot{x}_1,\dot{x}_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the optical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Classically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of [[Huygens' principle]]. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will have optical paths differing from AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lipson, Stephen G. Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-49345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermat's principle is the main principle of [[quantum electrodynamics]] which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nautil.us/blog/to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do | title=To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself "What Would Light Do?" | author=Aatish Bhatia | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=Nautilus | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-ants-fermat-principle.html | title=Ants follow Fermat's principle of least time | author=Lisa Zyga | date=1 April 2013 | publisher=Phys.org | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classic mechanics]] of [[wave]]s, Fermat's principle follows from the [[extremum principle of mechanics]] (see [[variational principle]]).

==History==
[[Euclid]], c. 320 BCE in his [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics%201/EuclidCatoptrics.1.html Catoptrics] (on [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.19/Catoptrics.19.html mirrors], including [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.30/Catoptrics.30.html spherical mirrors]) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by [[Ptolemy]], and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.&lt;ref&gt;History of Geometric Optics/Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlos Mihas (2005). [http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf Use of History in Developing ideas of refraction, lenses and rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032208/http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Demokritus University, Thrace, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierre de Fermat2.png|thumb|140px|Pierre de Fermat]]
The generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to [[Cureau de la Chambre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sean Mahoney]], ''The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665'', 2nd edition (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with objections by [[Claude Clerselier]] in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one.  It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as [[Huygens' principle]].

Historically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see [[Principle of least action]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36160">In [[mathematics]], '''Floer [[homology (mathematics)|homology]]''' is a tool for studying [[symplectic geometry]] and low-dimensional [[topology]].  Floer homology is a novel [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] that arises as an infinite-dimensional analog of finite-dimensional [[Morse homology]].  [[Andreas Floer]] introduced the first version of Floer homology, now called Hamiltonian Floer homology, in his proof of the [[Arnold conjecture]] in symplectic geometry.  Floer also developed a closely related theory for [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s of a symplectic [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]]. A third construction, also due to Floer, associates homology groups to closed three-dimensional manifolds using the Yang–Mills functional.  These constructions and their descendants play a fundamental role in current investigations into the topology of symplectic and contact manifolds as well as (smooth) three- and four-dimensional manifolds.

Floer homology is typically defined by associating to the object of interest an infinite-dimensional manifold and a real valued function on it.  In the symplectic version, this is the free [[loop space]] of a [[symplectic manifold]] with the symplectic action functional. For the ([[instanton]]) version for three-manifolds, it is the space of SU(2)-[[connection (mathematics)|connections]] on a three-dimensional manifold with the [[Chern–Simons]] functional.  Loosely speaking, Floer homology is the Morse homology of the function on the infinite-dimensional manifold.   A Floer [[chain complex]] is formed from the [[abelian group]] spanned by the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]] of the function (or possibly certain collections of critical points).  The [[differential form|differential]] of the chain complex is defined by counting the function's [[gradient]] [[flow lines]] connecting certain pairs of critical points (or collections thereof).  Floer homology is the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of this chain complex.

The gradient flow line equation, in a situation where Floer's ideas can be successfully applied, is typically a  geometrically meaningful and analytically tractable equation.  For symplectic Floer homology, the gradient flow equation for a path in the loopspace is (a perturbed version of) the [[Cauchy–Riemann equation]] for a map of a cylinder (the total space of the path of loops) to the symplectic manifold of interest; solutions are known as [[pseudoholomorphic curves]].  The [[Gromov's compactness theorem (topology)|Gromov compactness theorem]] is then used to show that the differential is well-defined and squares to zero, so that the Floer homology is defined.  For instanton Floer homology, the gradient flow equations is exactly the Yang-Mills equation on the three-manifold crossed with the real line.

==Symplectic Floer homology==

Symplectic Floer Homology (SFH) is a homology theory associated to a [[symplectic manifold]] and a nondegenerate [[symplectomorphism]] of it.  If the symplectomorphism is [[Hamiltonian symplectomorphism|Hamiltonian]], the homology arises from studying the [[symplectic action]] functional on the ([[universal cover]] of the) [[free loop space]] of a symplectic manifold.  SFH is invariant under [[Hamiltonian isotopy]] of the symplectomorphism.

Here, nondegeneracy means that 1 is not an eigenvalue of the derivative of the symplectomorphism at any of its fixed points.  This condition implies that the fixed points are isolated.  SFH is the homology of the [[chain complex]] generated by the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of such a symplectomorphism, where the differential counts certain [[pseudoholomorphic curve]]s in the product of the real line and the [[mapping torus]] of the symplectomorphism.  This  itself is a symplectic manifold of dimension two greater than the original manifold.  For an appropriate choice of [[almost complex structure]], punctured [[holomorphic curve]]s (of finite energy) in it have cylindrical ends asymptotic to the loops in the [[mapping torus]] corresponding to fixed points of the symplectomorphism.  A relative index may be defined between pairs of fixed points, and the differential counts the number of holomorphic cylinders with relative index&amp;nbsp;1.

The symplectic Floer homology of a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism of a compact manifold is isomorphic to the singular homology of the underlying manifold.  Thus, the sum of the [[Betti number]]s of that manifold yields the lower bound predicted by one version of the [[Arnold conjecture]] for the number of fixed points for a nondegenerate symplectomorphism.  The SFH of a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism also has a [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pair of pants]] product that is a deformed [[cup product]] equivalent to [[quantum cohomology]].  A version of the product also exists for non-exact symplectomorphisms.

For the [[cotangent bundle]] of a manifold M, the Floer homology depends on the choice of Hamiltonian due to its noncompactness.  For Hamiltonians that are quadratic at infinity, the Floer homology is the [[singular homology]] of the free loop space of M (proofs of various versions of this statement are due to Viterbo, Salamon–Weber, Abbondandolo–Schwarz, and Cohen). There are more complicated  operations on the Floer homology of a cotangent bundle that correspond to the [[string topology]] operations on the homology of the loop space of the underlying manifold.

The symplectic version of Floer homology figures in a crucial way in the formulation of the [[homological mirror symmetry]] conjecture.

===PSS isomorphism===
In 1996 S. Piunikhin, D. Salamon and M. Schwarz summarized the results about the relation between Floer homology and [[quantum cohomology ring|quantum cohomology]] and formulated as the following.{{harvtxt|Piunikhin|Salamon|Schwarz|1996}}

:*The Floer cohomology groups of the loop space of a ''semi-positive'' symplectic manifold (''M'',ω) are naturally isomorphic to the ordinary [[cohomology]] of ''M'', tensored by a suitable [[Novikov ring]] associated the group of [[deck transformation|covering transformations]].
:*This isomorphism intertwines the [[quantum cup product]] structure on the cohomology of M with the pair-of-pants product on Floer homology.

The above condition of semi-positive and the compactness of symplectic manifold ''M'' is required for us to obtain [[quantum cohomology#Novikov ring|Novikov ring]] and for the definition of both Floer homology and quantum cohomology. The semi-positive condition means that one of the following holds (note that the three cases are not disjoint):

:*&lt;math&gt;\langle [\omega],A\rangle=\lambda\langle c_1,A\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for every ''A'' in π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') where λ≥0 (''M'' is ''monotone'').
:*&lt;math&gt;\langle c_1,A\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; for every ''A'' in {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'').
:*The ''minimal Chern Number'' ''N''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 defined by &lt;math&gt;\langle c_1,\pi_2(M)\rangle=N\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or equal to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2.

The quantum cohomology group of symplectic manifold ''M'' can be defined as the tensor products of the ordinary cohomology with Novikov ring Λ, i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;QH_*(M)=H_*(M)\otimes\Lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

This construction of Floer homology explains the independence on the choice of the [[almost complex structure]] on ''M'' and the isomorphism to Floer homology provided from the ideas of [[Morse theory]] and [[pseudoholomorphic curves]], where we must recognize the [[Poincaré duality]] between homology and cohomology as the background.

==Floer homology of three-manifolds==
There are several  equivalent Floer homologies associated to [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[three-manifolds]].  Each yields three types of homology groups, which fit into an [[exact triangle]].  A knot in a three-manifold induces a filtration on the chain complex of each theory, whose chain homotopy type is a knot invariant.  (Their homologies satisfy similar formal properties to the combinatorially-defined [[Khovanov homology]].)

These homologies are closely related to the Donaldson and Seiberg invariants of 4-manifolds, as well as to  Taubes's Gromov invariant of symplectic 4-manifolds; the differentials of the corresponding three-manifold homologies to these theories are studied by considering solutions to the relevant differential equations ([[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills]], [[Seiberg–Witten gauge theory|Seiberg–Witten]], and [[Cauchy–Riemann equations|Cauchy–Riemann]], respectively) on the 3-manifold cross&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.  The 3-manifold Floer homologies should also be the targets of relative invariants for four-manifolds with boundary, related by gluing constructions to the invariants of a closed 4-manifold obtained by gluing together bounded 3-manifolds along their boundaries.  (This is closely related to the notion of a [[topological quantum field theory]].)  For Heegaard Floer homology, the 3-manifold homology was defined first, and an invariant for closed 4-manifolds was later defined in terms of it.

There are also extensions of the 3-manifold homologies to 3-manifolds with boundary: sutured Floer homology {{harv|Juhász|2008}} and bordered Floer homology {{harv|Lipshitz|Ozsváth|Thurston|2008}}.  These are related to the invariants for closed 3-manifolds by gluing formulas for the Floer homology of a 3-manifold described as the union along the boundary of two 3-manifolds with boundary.

The [[three-manifold]] Floer homologies also come equipped with a distinguished element of the homology if the [[three-manifold]] is equipped with a [[contact structure]]. Kronheimer and Mrowka first introduced the contact element in the Seiberg–Witten.  Ozsvath and Szabo used constructed it for Heegaard Floer homology using Giroux's relation between contact manifolds and open book decompositions, and it comes for free, as the homology class of the empty set, in embedded contact homology. (Which, unlike the other three, requires a contact homology for its definition. For embedded contact homology see {{harvtxt|Hutchings|2009}}.

These theories all come equipped with a priori relative gradings; these have been lifted to absolute gradings (by homotopy classes of oriented 2-plane fields) by Kronheimer and Mrowka (for SWF), Gripp and Huang (for HF), and Hutchings (for ECH).  Cristofaro-Gardiner has shown that Taubes' isomorphism between ECH and Seiberg-Witten Floer cohomology preserves these absolute gradings.

===Instanton Floer homology===
This is a three-manifold invariant connected to [[Donaldson theory]] introduced by Floer himself.  It is obtained using the [[Chern–Simons theory|Chern–Simons]] functional on the space of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]] on a [[principal bundle|principal]] [[SU(2)]]-bundle over the three-manifold.  Its critical points are [[flat connection]]s and its flow lines are [[instanton]]s, i.e. anti-self-dual connections on the three-manifold crossed with the real line.  Instanton Floer homology may be viewed as a generalization of the [[Casson invariant]] because the [[Euler characteristic]] of Floer homology agrees with the Casson invariant.

Soon after Floer's introduction of Floer homology, Donaldson realized that cobordisms induce maps.  This was the first instance of the structure that came to be known as a Topological Quantum Field Theory.

===Seiberg–Witten Floer homology===
'''Seiberg–Witten Floer homology''' or '''monopole Floer homology''' is a homology theory of smooth [[3-manifold]]s (equipped with a [[spin-c structure|spin&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; structure]]).  It may be viewed as the Morse homology of the Chern-Simons-Dirac functional on U(1) connections on the three-manifold.  The associated gradient flow equation corresponds to the Seiberg-Witten equations on the 3-manifold crossed with the real line.  Equivalently, the generators of the chain complex are translation-invariant solutions to Seiberg–Witten equations (known as monopoles) on the product of a 3-manifold and the real line, and the differential counts solutions to the Seiberg–Witten equations on the product of a three-manifold and the real line, which are asymptotic to invariant solutions at infinity and negative infinity.

One version of Seiberg-Witten-Floer homology was constructed rigorously in the monograph [[Monopoles and Three-manifolds]] by [[Peter Kronheimer]] and [[Tomasz Mrowka]], where it is known as monopole Floer homology.  Taubes has shown that it is isomorphic to embedded contact homology.   Alternate constructions of SWF for rational homology 3-spheres have been given by {{harvtxt|Manolescu|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Frøyshov|2010}}; they are presumed but not known to agree with monopole Floer homology.

===Heegaard Floer homology===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Knot invariant]] --&gt;
'''Heegaard Floer homology''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-heegaard.ogg|}} is an invariant due to [[Peter Ozsváth]] and [[Zoltán Szabó (mathematician)|Zoltán Szabó]] of a closed 3-manifold equipped with a spin&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; structure.  It is computed using a [[Heegaard splitting|Heegaard diagram]] of the space via a construction analogous to Lagrangian Floer homology. {{harvtxt|Kutluhan|Lee|Taubes|2010}} announced a proof that Heegaard Floer homology is isomorphic to Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, and {{harvtxt|Colin|Ghiggini|Honda|2011}} announced a proof that the plus-version of Heegaard Floer homology (with reverse orientation) is isomorphic to embedded contact homology.

A knot in a three-manifold induces a filtration on the Heegaard Floer homology groups, and the filtered homotopy type is a powerful [[knot invariant]], called knot Floer homology. It [[categorification|categorifies]] the [[Alexander polynomial]]. Knot Floer homology was defined by {{Harvtxt|Ozsváth|Szabó|2003}} and independently by {{harvtxt|Rasmussen|2003}}.  It is known to detect knot genus. Using [[grid diagrams]] for the Heegaard splittings, knot Floer homology was given a combinatorial construction by {{harvtxt|Manolescu|Ozsváth|Sarkar|2009}}.

The Heegaard Floer homology of the [[Double cover (topology)|double cover]] of S^3 branched over a knot is related by a spectral sequence to [[Khovanov homology]] {{harv|Ozsváth|Szabó|2005}}.

The "hat" version of Heegaard Floer homology was described combinatorially by {{harvtxt|Sarkar|Wang|2010}}. The "plus" and "minus" versions of Heegaard Floer homology, and the related Ozsváth-Szabó four-manifold invariants, can be described combinatorially as well {{harv|Manolescu|Ozsváth|Thurston|2009}}.

===Embedded contact homology===
'''Embedded contact homology''', due to [[Michael Hutchings (mathematician)|Michael Hutchings]], is an invariant of 3-manifolds (with a distinguished second homology class, corresponding to the choice of a spin&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; structure in Seiberg–Witten Floer homology) isomorphic (by work of [[Clifford Taubes]]) to Seiberg–Witten Floer cohomology and consequently (by work announced by {{harvnb|Kutluhan|Lee|Taubes|2010}} and {{harvnb|Colin|Ghiggini|Honda|2011}}) to the plus-version of Heegaard Floer homology (with reverse orientation).  It may be seen as an extension of [[Taubes's Gromov invariant]], known to be equivalent to the [[Seiberg–Witten invariant]], from closed symplectic [[4-manifold]]s to certain non-compact symplectic 4-manifolds (namely, a contact three-manifold cross R).  Its construction is analogous to symplectic field theory, in that it is generated by certain collections of closed [[Reeb orbits]] and its differential counts certain holomorphic curves with ends at certain collections of Reeb orbits. It differs from SFT in technical conditions on the collections of Reeb orbits that generate it—and in not counting all holomorphic curves with [[Fredholm index]] 1 with given ends, but only those that also satisfy a topological condition given by the ''ECH index'', which in particular implies that the curves considered are (mainly) embedded.

The [[Weinstein conjecture]] that a contact 3-manifold has a closed Reeb orbit for any contact form holds on any manifold whose ECH is nontrivial, and was proved by Taubes using techniques closely related to ECH; extensions of this work yielded the isomorphism between ECH and SWF.  Many constructions in ECH (including its well-definedness) rely upon this isomorphism {{harv|Taubes|2007}}.

The contact element of ECH has a particularly nice form: it is the cycle associated to the empty collection of Reeb orbits.

An analog of embedded contact homology may be defined for mapping tori of symplectomorphisms of a surface (possibly with boundary) and is known as periodic Floer homology, generalizing the symplectic Floer homology of surface symplectomorphisms.  More generally, it may be defined with respect to any [[stable Hamiltonian structure]] on the 3-manifold; like contact structures, stable Hamiltonian structures define a nonvanishing vector field (the Reeb vector field), and Hutchings and Taubes have proven an analogue of the Weinstein conjecture for them, namely that they always have closed orbits (unless they are mapping tori of a 2-torus).

==Lagrangian intersection Floer homology==
The Lagrangian Floer homology of two transversely intersecting [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s of a symplectic manifold is the homology of a chain complex generated by the intersection points of the two submanifolds and whose differential counts [[pseudoholomorphic]] [[Whitney discs]].

Given three Lagrangian submanifolds ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a symplectic manifold, there is a product structure on the Lagrangian Floer homology:

:&lt;math&gt;HF(L_0, L_1) \otimes HF(L_1,L_2) \rightarrow HF(L_0,L_2), &lt;/math&gt;

which is defined by counting holomorphic triangles (that is, holomorphic maps of a triangle whose vertices and edges map to the appropriate intersection points and Lagrangian submanifolds).

Papers on this subject are due to Fukaya, Oh, Ono, and Ohta; the recent work on "[[cluster homology]]" of Lalonde and Cornea offer a different approach to it.  The Floer homology of a pair of Lagrangian submanifolds may not always exist; when it does, it provides an obstruction to isotoping one Lagrangian away from the other using a [[Hamiltonian isotopy]].

Several kinds of Floer homology are special cases of Lagrangian Floer homology.  The symplectic Floer homology of a symplectomorphism of M can be thought of as a case of Lagrangian Floer homology in which the ambient manifold is M crossed with M and the Lagrangian submanifolds are the diagonal and the graph of the symplectomorphism.  The construction of Heegaard Floer homology is based on a variant of Lagrangian Floer homology for totally real submanifolds defined using a Heegaard splitting of a three-manifold.  Seidel-Smith and Manolescu constructed a link invariant as a certain case of Lagrangian Floer homology, which conjecturally agrees with [[Khovanov homology]], a combinatorially-defined link invariant.

===Atiyah–Floer conjecture===
The '''Atiyah–Floer conjecture''' connects the instanton Floer homology with the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology:  Consider a 3-manifold Y with a [[Heegaard splitting]] along a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Then the space of [[flat connection]]s on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; modulo [[gauge equivalence]] is a symplectic manifold of dimension 6''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6, where ''g'' is the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. In the Heegaard splitting, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; bounds two different 3-manifolds; the space of flat connections modulo gauge equivalence on each 3-manifold with boundary (equivalently, the space of connections on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; that extend over each three manifold) is a Lagrangian submanifold of the space of connections on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.  We may thus consider their Lagrangian intersection Floer homology.  Alternately, we can consider the Instanton Floer homology of the 3-manifold Y. The Atiyah–Floer conjecture asserts that these two invariants are isomorphic. {{harvtxt|Salamon|Wehrheim|2008}} are working on a program to prove this conjecture.

===Relations to mirror symmetry===
The [[homological mirror symmetry]] conjecture of [[Maxim Kontsevich]] predicts an equality between the Lagrangian Floer homology of Lagrangians in a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Ext group]]s of [[coherent sheaves]] on the mirror Calabi–Yau manifold. In this situation, one should not focus on the Floer homology groups but on the Floer chain groups. Similar to the pair-of-pants product, one can construct multi-compositions using pseudo-holomorphic ''n''-gons. These compositions satisfy the &lt;math&gt;A_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-relations making the category of all (unobstructed) Lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic manifold into an &lt;math&gt;A_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-category, called the [[Fukaya category]].

To be more precise, one must add additional data to the Lagrangian – a grading and a [[spin structure]]. A Lagrangian with a choice of these structures is often called a [[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]] in homage to the underlying physics. The Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture states there is a type of derived [[Morita equivalence]] between the Fukaya category of the Calabi–Yau &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a [[dg category]] underlying the bounded [[derived category]] of coherent sheaves of the mirror, and vice versa.

==Symplectic field theory (SFT)==
This is an invariant of [[contact manifold]]s and symplectic [[cobordism]]s between them, originally due to [[Yakov Eliashberg]], [[Alexander Givental]] and [[Helmut Hofer]].  The symplectic field theory as well as its subcomplexes, rational symplectic field theory and contact homology, are defined as homologies of differential algebras, which are generated by closed orbits of the [[Reeb vector field]] of a chosen contact form. The differential counts certain holomorphic curves in the cylinder over the contact manifold, where the trivial examples are the branched coverings of (trivial) cylinders over closed Reeb orbits.  It further includes a linear homology theory, called cylindrical or linearized contact homology (sometimes, by abuse of notation, just contact homology), whose chain groups are vector spaces generated by closed orbits and whose differentials count only holomorphic cylinders. However, cylindrical contact homology is not always defined due to the presence of holomorphic discs and a lack of regularity and transversality results.  In situations where cylindrical contact homology makes sense, it may be seen as the (slightly modified) ''Morse homology'' of the action functional on the free loop space, which sends a loop to the integral of the contact form alpha over the loop.  Reeb orbits are the critical points of this functional.

SFT also associates a relative invariant of a [[Legendrian submanifold]] of a contact manifold known as [[relative contact homology]].  Its generators are Reeb chords, which are trajectories of the Reeb vector field beginning and ending on a Lagrangian, and its differential counts certain holomorphic strips in the [[symplectization]] of the contact manifold whose ends are asymptotic to given Reeb chords.

In SFT the contact manifolds can be replaced by [[mapping torus|mapping tori]] of symplectic manifolds with symplectomorphisms. While the cylindrical contact homology is well-defined and given by the symplectic Floer homologies of powers of the symplectomorphism, (rational) symplectic field theory and contact homology can be considered as generalized symplectic Floer homologies. In the important case when the symplectomorphism is the time-one map of a time-dependent Hamiltonian, it was however shown that these higher invariants do not contain any further information.

==Floer homotopy==
One conceivable way to construct a Floer homology theory of some object would be to construct a related [[Spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectrum]] whose ordinary homology is the desired Floer homology.  Applying other [[homology theories]] to such a spectrum could yield other interesting invariants.  This strategy was proposed by Ralph Cohen, John Jones, and [[Graeme Segal]], and carried out in certain cases for Seiberg–Witten–Floer homology by {{harvtxt|Manolescu|2003}} and for the symplectic Floer homology of cotangent bundles by Cohen.  This approach was the basis of Manolescu's 2013 construction of Pin (2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, with which he disproved the Triangulation Conjecture for manifolds of dimension 5 and higher.

==Analytic foundations==
Many of these Floer homologies have not been completely and rigorously constructed, and many conjectural equivalences have not been proved. Technical difficulties come up in the analysis involved, especially in constructing [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]] [[moduli space]]s of pseudoholomorphic curves.  Hofer, in collaboration with Kris Wysocki and Eduard Zehnder, has developed new analytic foundations via their theory of [[polyfold]]s and a "general Fredholm theory". While the polyfold project is not yet fully completed, in some important cases transversality was shown using simpler methods.

==Computation==
Floer homologies are generally difficult to compute explicitly. For instance, the symplectic Floer homology for all surface symplectomorphisms was completed only in 2007. The Heegaard Floer homology has been a success story in this regard: researchers have exploited its algebraic structure to compute it for various classes of 3-manifolds and have found combinatorial algorithms for computation
of much of the theory.  It is also connected to existing invariants and structures and many insights into 3-manifold topology have resulted.

The '''fundamental theorem of calculus''' is a [[theorem]] that links the concept of [[derivative|differentiating]] a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with the concept of [[integral|integrating]] a function. 

The first part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''first fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that one of the [[antiderivative]]s (also called ''indefinite integral''), say ''F'', of some function ''f'' may be obtained as the integral of ''f'' with a variable bound of integration. This implies the existence of [[antiderivative]]s for [[continuous function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spivak|first=Michael|year=1980|title=Calculus|edition=2nd|publication-place=Houston, Texas|publisher=Publish or Perish Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the second part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''second fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that the integral of a function ''f'' over some interval can be computed by using any one, say ''F'', of its infinitely many [[antiderivative]]s. This part of the theorem has key practical applications, because explicitly finding the antiderivative of a function by [[symbolic integration]] avoids [[numerical integration]] to compute integrals. This provides generally a better numerical accuracy.

==History==
{{See also|History of calculus}}

The fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another. Before the discovery of this theorem, it was not recognized that these two operations were related. Ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematicians]] knew how to compute area via [[infinitesimals]], an operation that we would now call [[Integral|integration]]. The origins of [[Derivative|differentiation]] likewise predate the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by hundreds of years;  for example, in the fourteenth century the notions of ''continuity'' of functions and ''motion'' were studied by the [[Oxford Calculators]] and other scholars. The historical relevance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations, but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations (calculation of geometric areas, and calculation of velocities) are actually closely related.

The first published statement and proof of a rudimentary form of the fundamental theorem, strongly geometric in character,&lt;ref name=GregoryGeometry&gt;{{cite journal| last=Malet|first=Antoni|title=James Gregorie on tangents and the "Taylor" rule for series expansions| publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year=1993|journal=[[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]|doi=10.1007/BF00375656|quote=Gregorie's thought, on the other hand, belongs to a conceptual framework strongly geometrical in character. (page 137)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was by [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638–1675).&lt;ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today.

==Geometric meaning==
[[File:FTC_geometric.svg|500px|thumb|right|The area shaded in red stripes is close to ''h'' times ''f''(''x''). Alternatively, if the function ''A''(''x'') were known, this area would be exactly {{nowrap|''A''(''x'' + ''h'') − ''A''(''x'').}} These two values are approximately equal, particularly for small ''h''.]]
For a continuous function {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} whose graph is plotted as a curve, each value of ''x'' has a corresponding area function ''A''(''x''), representing the area beneath the curve between 0 and ''x''. The function ''A''(''x'') may not be known, but it is given that it represents the area under the curve.

The area under the curve between ''x'' and {{nowrap|''x'' + ''h''}} could be computed by finding the area between 0 and {{nowrap|''x'' + ''h'',}} then subtracting the area between 0 and ''x''. In other words, the area of this “strip” would be {{nowrap|''A''(''x'' + ''h'') − ''A''(''x'')}}.

There is another way to ''estimate'' the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, ''h'' is multiplied by ''f''(''x'') to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So:

:&lt;math&gt;A(x+h)-A(x) \approx f(x) \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red portion of the "excess" area shown in the diagram. So:

:&lt;math&gt;A(x+h)-A(x)=f(x)\cdot h+(\text{Red Excess})&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging terms:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h} - \frac{\text{Red Excess}}{h}&lt;/math&gt;.

As ''h'' approaches 0 in the [[limit of a function|limit]], the last fraction can be shown to go to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lipman Bers|Bers, Lipman]]. ''Calculus'', pp.&amp;nbsp;180–181 (Holt, Rinehart and Winston (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This is true because the area of the red portion of excess region is less than or equal to the area of the tiny black-bordered rectangle.  More precisely,
:&lt;math&gt;\left|f(x) - \frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h}\right| = \frac{|\text{Red Excess}|}{h} \le \frac{h(f(x+h_1) - f(x+h_2))}{h} = f(x+h_1) - f(x+h_2)|,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x+h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+h_2&lt;/math&gt; are points where {{mvar|f}} reaches its maximum and its minimum, respectively, in  the interval {{math|[''x'', ''x'' + ''h'']}}.
By the continuity of {{math|''f''}}, the latter expression tends to zero as {{math|''h''}} does.  Therefore, the left-hand side tends to zero as {{math|''h''}} does, which implies
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''A''′(''x'')}}. That is, the derivative of the area function ''A''(''x'') exists and is the original function ''f''(''x''); so, the area function is simply an [[antiderivative]] of the original function.  Computing the derivative of a function and “finding the area” under its curve are "opposite" operations. This is the crux of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

==Physical intuition==
Intuitively, the theorem simply states that the sum of [[infinitesimal]] changes in a quantity over time (or over some other variable) adds up to the net change in the quantity.

Imagine for example using a stopwatch to mark-off tiny increments of time as a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car. To understand the power of this theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed to look out the window of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.

For any tiny interval of time in the car, you could calculate how far the car has traveled in that interval by multiplying the current speed of the car times the length of that tiny interval of time. (This is because ''distance'' = ''speed'' &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ''time''.)

Now imagine doing this instant after instant, so that for every tiny interval of time you know how far the car has traveled. In principle, you could then calculate the ''total'' distance traveled in the car (even though you've never looked out the window) by simply summing-up all those tiny distances.

:distance traveled = &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; the velocity at any instant &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; a tiny interval of time

In other words,

:distance traveled = &lt;math&gt;\sum v(t) \times \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;

On the right hand side of this equation, as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; becomes infinitesimally small, the operation of "summing up" corresponds to [[Integral|integration]]. So what we've shown is that the integral of the velocity function can be used to compute how far the car has traveled.

Now remember that the velocity function is simply the derivative of the position function. So what we have really shown is that integrating the velocity simply recovers the original position function. This is the basic idea of the theorem: that ''integration'' and ''differentiation'' are closely related operations, each essentially being the inverse of the other.

In other words, in terms of one's physical intuition, the theorem simply states that the sum of the changes in a quantity over time (such as ''position'', as calculated by multiplying ''velocity'' times ''time'') adds up to the total net change in the quantity. Or to put this more generally:
* Given a quantity &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that changes over some variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and
* Given the velocity &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; with which that quantity changes over that variable
then the idea that "distance equals speed times time" corresponds to the statement
:&lt;math&gt;dx = v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that one can recover the original function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; by integrating its derivative, the velocity &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt;, over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal statements==
There are two parts to the theorem. The first part deals with the derivative of an [[antiderivative]], while the second part deals with the relationship between antiderivatives and [[definite integral]]s.

===First part===
This part is sometimes referred to as the ''first fundamental theorem of calculus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=§5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''f'' be a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] [''a'', ''b'']. Let ''F'' be the function defined, for all ''x'' in [''a'', ''b''], by
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x\!f(t)\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, ''F'' is uniformly continuous on [''a'', ''b''], differentiable on the open interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b''),}} and

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in (''a'', ''b'').

===Corollary===
[[File:Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_(animation_).gif|thumb|Fundamental theorem of calculus (animation)]]

The fundamental theorem is often employed to compute the definite integral of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for which an antiderivative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is known.  Specifically, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued continuous function on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(t)\, dt = F(b)-F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

The corollary assumes [[Continuous function|continuity]] on the whole interval. This result is strengthened slightly in the following part of the theorem.

===Second part===
This part is sometimes referred to as the second fundamental theorem of calculus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=§5.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Newton–Leibniz axiom'''.

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued function on a [[closed interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Riemann integrable]] on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

The second part is somewhat stronger than the corollary because it does not assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

When an antiderivative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists, then there are infinitely many antiderivatives for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, obtained by adding  an arbitrary constant to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Also, by the first part of the theorem, antiderivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; always exist when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

==Proof of the first part==
For a given ''f''(''t''), define the function ''F''(''x'') as
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

For any two numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ''x'' in [''a'', ''b''], we have
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1) = \int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the two equalities gives
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt - \int_a^{x_1} f(t) \,dt. \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt + \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;
:(The sum of the areas of two adjacent regions is equal to the area of both regions combined.)
Manipulating this equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt - \int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt = \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into (1) results in
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[mean value theorem]] for integration, there exists a real number &lt;math&gt;c \in [x_1, x_1 + \Delta x]&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt = f(c)\cdot \Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

To keep the notation simple, we write just &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, but one should keep in mind that, for a given function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and on &lt;math&gt;\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; but is always confined to the interval  &lt;math&gt; [x_1, x_1 + \Delta x]&lt;/math&gt;.
Substituting the above into (2) we get
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = f(c)\cdot \Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1)}{\Delta x} = f(c).&lt;/math&gt;
:The expression on the left side of the equation is Newton's [[difference quotient]] for ''F'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Take the limit as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; → 0 on both sides of the equation.
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1)}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(c). &lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the left side of the equation is the definition of the derivative of ''F'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(c). \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;

To find the other limit, we use the [[squeeze theorem]]. The number ''c'' is in the interval [''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ''x''], so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''c'' ≤ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ''x''.

Also, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x_1 + \Delta x = x_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, according to the squeeze theorem,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} c = x_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into (3), we get
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = \lim_{c \to x_1} f(c).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f'' is continuous at ''c'', so the limit can be taken inside the function. Therefore, we get
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = f(x_1).&lt;/math&gt;
which completes the proof.

&lt;small&gt;(Leithold ''et al.'', 1996)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt; (a rigorous proof can be found http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=438)&lt;/small&gt;

==Proof of the corollary==
Suppose ''F'' is an antiderivative of ''f'', with ''f'' continuous on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}} Let

: &lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;.

By the ''first part'' of the theorem, we know ''G'' is also an antiderivative of ''f''. Since ''F' - G' = 0'' the mean value theorem implies that ''F - G'' is a constant function, i. e. there is a number ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''F''(''x'') + ''c''}}, for all ''x'' in {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  Letting {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;F(a) + c = G(a) = \int_a^a f(t)\, dt = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which means {{nowrap|''c'' {{=}} − ''F''(''a'').}} In other words, {{nowrap|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''F''(''x'') − ''F''(''a'')}}, and so

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = G(b) = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of the second part==
This is a limit proof by [[Riemann integral|Riemann sums]].
Let ''f'' be (Riemann) integrable on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''],}} and let ''f'' admit an antiderivative ''F'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  Begin with the quantity {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}}.  Let there be numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
such that

:&lt;math&gt;a = x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{n-1} &lt; x_n = b. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = F(x_n) - F(x_0). &lt;/math&gt;

Now, we add each ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) along with its additive inverse, so that the resulting quantity is equal:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F(b) - F(a)
&amp;= F(x_n) + [-F(x_{n-1}) + F(x_{n-1})] + \cdots + [-F(x_1) + F(x_1)] - F(x_0) \\
&amp;= [F(x_n) - F(x_{n-1})] + [F(x_{n-1}) - F(x_{n-2})] + \cdots + [F(x_2) - F(x_1)] + [F(x_1) - F(x_0)].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above quantity can be written as the following sum:

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1})]. \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Next, we employ the [[mean value theorem]].  Stated briefly,

Let ''F'' be continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on the open interval (''a'', ''b''). Then there exists some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;F'(c) = \frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b - a}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;F'(c)(b - a) = F(b) - F(a). &lt;/math&gt;

The function ''F'' is differentiable on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''];}} therefore, it is also differentiable and continuous on each interval {{nowrap|[''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}.  According to the mean value theorem (above),

:&lt;math&gt;F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1}) = F'(c_i)(x_i - x_{i-1}). &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into (1), we get

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[F'(c_i)(x_i - x_{i-1})].&lt;/math&gt;

The assumption implies &lt;math&gt;F'(c_i) = f(c_i).&lt;/math&gt;  Also, &lt;math&gt;x_i - x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; of partition &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)]. \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Riemann integral irregular.gif|frame|right|A converging sequence of Riemann sums. The number in the upper left is the total area of the blue rectangles. They converge to the definite integral of the function.]]

We are describing the area of a rectangle, with the width times the height, and we are adding the areas together.  Each rectangle, by virtue of the [[mean value theorem]], describes an approximation of the curve section it is drawn over. Also &lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i&lt;/math&gt; need not be the same for all values of ''i'', or in other words that the width of the rectangles can differ.  What we have to do is approximate the curve with ''n'' rectangles.  Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and ''n'' increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get closer and closer to the actual area of the curve.

By taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the [[Riemann integral]]. We know that this limit exists because ''f'' was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.

So, we take the limit on both sides of (2). This gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} F(b) - F(a) = \lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)].&lt;/math&gt;

Neither ''F''(''b'') nor ''F''(''a'') is dependent on &lt;math&gt;\|\Delta x_i\|&lt;/math&gt;, so the limit on the left side remains {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'').}}

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)].&lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the right side of the equation defines the integral over ''f'' from ''a'' to ''b''. Therefore, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;

which completes the proof.

It almost looks like the first part of the theorem follows directly from the second. That is, suppose ''G'' is an antiderivative of ''f''. Then by the second theorem, &lt;math&gt;G(x) - G(a) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;. Now, suppose &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt\ = G(x) - G(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''F'' has the same derivative as ''G'', and therefore {{nowrap|''F''′ {{=}} ''f''}}. This argument only works, however, if we already know that ''f'' has an antiderivative, and the only way we know that all continuous functions have antiderivatives is by the first part of the Fundamental Theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spivak|first=Michael|year=1980|title=Calculus|edition=2nd|publication-place=Houston, Texas|publisher=Publish or Perish Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, if {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} e&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,}} then ''f'' has an antiderivative, namely

:&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

and there is no simpler expression for this function.  It is therefore important not to interpret the second part of the theorem as the definition of the integral.  Indeed, there are many functions that are integrable but lack elementary antiderivatives, and discontinuous functions can be integrable but lack any antiderivatives at all.  Conversely, many functions that have antiderivatives are not Riemann integrable (see [[Volterra's function]]).

==Examples==
As an example, suppose the following is to be calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_2^5 x^2\, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2 &lt;/math&gt; and we can use &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} &lt;/math&gt; as the antiderivative. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_2^5 x^2\, dx = F(5) - F(2) =  \frac{5^3}{3} - \frac{2^3}{3} = \frac{125}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{117}{3} = 39.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, more generally, suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt &lt;/math&gt;
is to be calculated. Here, &lt;math&gt;f(t) = t^3 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(t) = \frac{t^4}{4} &lt;/math&gt; can be used as the antiderivative. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt = \frac{d}{dx} F(x) - \frac{d}{dx} F(0) = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{x^4}{4} = x^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt = f(x) \frac{dx}{dx} - f(0) \frac{d0}{dx} = x^3.&lt;/math&gt;

As a theoretical example, the theorem can be used to prove that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx=\int_a^c f(x) dx+\int_c^b f(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt; 

Since, 
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x) dx &amp;= F(b)-F(a), \\
\int_a^c f(x) dx &amp;=F(c)-F(a), \text{ and } \\
\int_c^b f(x) dx &amp;=F(b)-F(c), 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

the result follows from, 
:&lt;math&gt;F(b)-F(a)=F(c)-F(a)+F(b)-F(c).&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
We don't need to assume continuity of ''f'' on the whole interval.  Part I of the theorem then says: if ''f'' is any [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrable]] function on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a number in {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} such that ''f'' is continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

is differentiable for {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{nowrap|''F''′(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).}} We can relax the conditions on ''f'' still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable.  In that case, we can conclude that the function ''F'' is differentiable [[almost everywhere]] and {{nowrap|''F''′(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} almost everywhere. On the [[real line]] this statement is equivalent to [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem|Lebesgue's differentiation theorem]].  These results remain true for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions {{harv|Bartle|2001|loc=Thm. 4.11}}.

In higher dimensions Lebesgue's differentiation theorem generalizes the Fundamental theorem of calculus by stating that for almost every ''x'', the average value of a function ''f'' over a ball of radius ''r'' centered at ''x'' tends to ''f''(''x'') as ''r'' tends to 0.

Part II of the theorem is true for any Lebesgue integrable function ''f'', which has an antiderivative ''F'' (not all integrable functions do, though).  In other words, if a real function ''F'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} admits a derivative ''f''(''x'') at ''every'' point ''x'' of {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} and if this derivative ''f'' is Lebesgue integrable on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''],}} then

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(t) \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1987|loc=th. 7.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result may fail for continuous functions ''F'' that admit a derivative ''f''(''x'') at almost every point ''x'', as the example of the [[Cantor function]] shows. However, if ''F'' is [[Absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]], it admits a derivative ''F′''(''x'') at almost every point ''x'', and moreover ''F′'' is integrable, with {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}} equal to the integral of ''F′'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}} Conversely, if ''f'' is any integrable function, then ''F'' as given in the first formula will be absolutely continuous with ''F′'' = ''f'' a.e.

The conditions of this theorem may again be relaxed by considering the integrals involved as [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]]s.  Specifically, if a continuous function ''F''(''x'') admits a derivative ''f''(''x'') at all but countably many points, then ''f''(''x'') is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable and {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}} is equal to the integral of ''f'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  The difference here is that the integrability of ''f'' does not need to be assumed. {{harv|Bartle|2001|loc=Thm. 4.7}}

The version of [[Taylor's theorem]], which expresses the error term as an integral, can be seen as a generalization of the fundamental theorem.

There is a version of the theorem for [[complex number|complex]] functions: suppose ''U'' is an open set in '''C''' and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''U'' → '''C'''}} is a function that has a [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] antiderivative ''F'' on ''U''. Then for every curve {{nowrap|γ : [''a'', ''b''] → ''U'',}} the [[curve integral]] can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma f(z) \,dz = F(\gamma(b)) - F(\gamma(a)).&lt;/math&gt;

The fundamental theorem can be generalized to curve and surface integrals in higher dimensions and on [[manifold]]s. One such generalization offered by the [[calculus of moving surfaces]] is the [[time evolution of integrals]]. The most familiar extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions are the [[divergence theorem]] and the [[gradient theorem]].

One of the most powerful generalizations in this direction is [[Stokes' theorem]] (sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_on_Manifolds_(book)|title=Calculus on Manifolds|last=Spivak|first=M.|publisher=W. A. Benjamin|year=1965|isbn=978-0-8053-9021-6|location=New York|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''M'' be an oriented [[piecewise]] [[Infinitely differentiable|smooth]] [[manifold]] of [[dimension]] ''n'' and let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth [[compactly supported]] [[differential form|(''n''–1)-form]] on ''M''. If ∂''M'' denotes the [[manifold|boundary]] of ''M'' given its induced [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only.

The theorem is often used in situations where ''M'' is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold (e.g. '''R'''''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'') on which the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

The '''fundamental theorem of poker''' is a principle first articulated by [[David Sklansky]] that he believes expresses the essential nature of [[poker]] as a [[game]] of [[decision-making]] in the face of [[incomplete information]]. 

{{Cquote|Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it if you could see all your opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play your hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently from the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they could see all your cards, you lose.}}

The fundamental theorem is stated in common language, but its formulation is based on mathematical reasoning. Each decision that is made in poker can be analyzed in terms of the [[expected value]] of the payoff of a decision. The correct decision to make in a given situation is the decision that has the largest expected value. If a player could see all of their opponents' cards, they would always be able to calculate the correct decision with mathematical certainty, and the less they deviate from these correct decisions, the better their expected long-term results. This is certainly true [[poker jargon#H|heads-up]], but [[Morton's theorem]], in which an opponent's correct decision can benefit a player, may apply in multi-way pots. 

In probabilistic terms, this is an application of the [[law of total expectation]].

==An example==
Suppose Bob is playing limit [[Texas hold 'em]] and is dealt '''9♣ 9♠''' [[poker jargon#under_the_gun|under the gun]] before the [[flop (poker)|flop]]. He [[Call (poker)|calls]], and everyone else [[Fold (poker)|folds]] to Carol in the [[big blind]] who [[Check (poker)|checks]]. The flop comes '''A♣ &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;K♦ 10♦&lt;/span&gt;''', and Carol bets.

Bob now has a decision to make based upon incomplete information. In this particular circumstance, the correct decision is almost certainly to fold. There are too many [[Turn cards|turn]] and [[river cards]] that could kill his hand. Even if Carol does not have an '''A''' or a '''K''', there are 3 cards to a [[Straight (poker)|straight]] and 2 cards to a [[Flush (poker)|flush]] on the flop, and she could easily be on a straight or flush [[Draw (poker)|draw]]. Bob is essentially drawing to 2 [[Out (poker)|outs]] (another '''9'''), and even if he catches one of these outs, his set may not hold up.

However, suppose Bob knew (with 100% certainty) that Carol held '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♦ 7♦&lt;/span&gt;'''. In this case, it would be correct to [[Raise (poker)|''raise'']]. Even though Carol would still be getting the correct [[pot odds]] to call, the best decision for Bob is to raise. Therefore, by folding (or even calling), Bob has played his hand differently from the way he would have played it if he could see his opponent's cards, and so by the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, his opponent has gained. Bob has made a "mistake", in the sense that he has played differently from the way he would have played if he knew Carol held '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♦ 7♦&lt;/span&gt;''', even though this "mistake" is almost certainly the best decision given the incomplete information available to him.

This example also illustrates that one of the most important goals in poker is to induce the opponents to make mistakes. In this particular hand, Carol has practiced deception by employing a [[semi-bluff]] &amp;mdash; she has bet a hand, hoping Bob will fold, but she still has outs even if he calls or raises. Carol has induced Bob to make a mistake.

==Multi-way pots and implicit collusion==
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker applies to all [[poker jargon#H|heads-up]] decisions, but it does not apply to all multi-way decisions. This is because each opponent of a player can make an incorrect decision, but the "collective decision" of all the opponents works against the player.

This type of situation occurs mostly in games with multi-way pots, when a player has a strong hand, but several opponents are chasing with [[Draw (poker)|draws]] or other weaker hands. Also, a good example is a player with a deep stack making a play that favors a [[Poker glossary#short stack|short-stacked]] opponent because he can extract more [[expected value]] from the other deep-stacked opponents. Such a situation is sometimes referred to as [[Morton's theorem|implicit collusion]]. 

The Fundamental Theorem of Poker is simply expressed and appears axiomatic, yet its proper application to the countless varieties of circumstances that a poker player may face requires a great deal of knowledge, skill, and experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">In [[finance]], '''indifference pricing''' is a method of pricing [[financial securities]] with regard to a [[utility function]].  The ''' indifference price''' is also known as the '''[[reservation price]]''' or '''private valuation'''.  In particular, the indifference price is the price at which an agent would have the same [[expected utility]] level by exercising a [[financial transaction]] as by not doing so (with optimal trading otherwise).  Typically the indifference price is a pricing range (a [[bid-ask spread]]) for a specific agent; this price range is an example of [[good-deal bounds]].&lt;ref name="FE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Engineering|author=John R. Birge|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|pages=521–524|isbn=978-0-444-51781-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
Given a utility function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and a claim &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; with known payoffs at some terminal time &lt;math&gt;T,&lt;/math&gt; let the function &lt;math&gt;V: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be defined by
: &lt;math&gt;V(x,k) = \sup_{X_T \in \mathcal{A}(x)} \mathbb{E}\left[u\left(X_T + k C_T\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the initial endowment, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[self-financing portfolio]]s at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; starting with endowment &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the number of the claim to be purchased (or sold).  Then the indifference bid price &lt;math&gt;v^b(k)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; units of &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(k),k) = V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt; and the indifference ask price &lt;math&gt;v^a(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of &lt;math&gt;V(x + v^a(k),-k) = V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.  The indifference price bound is the range &lt;math&gt;\left[v^b(k),v^a(k)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=C09&gt;{{cite book|first=Rene|last=Carmona|title=Indifference Pricing: Theory and Applications|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-691-13883-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider a market with a risk free asset &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;B_0 = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_T = 110&lt;/math&gt;, and a risky asset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S_0 = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_T \in \{90, 110, 130\}&lt;/math&gt; each with probability &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;.  Let your utility function be given by &lt;math&gt;u(x) = 1 - \exp(-x/10)&lt;/math&gt;.  To find either the bid or ask indifference price for a single European call option with strike 110, first calculate &lt;math&gt;V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = \max_{\alpha B_0 + \beta S_0 = x} \mathbb{E}[1 - \exp(-.1 \times (\alpha B_T + \beta S_T))]&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \max_{\beta} \left[1 - \frac{1}{3} \left[\exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x - 20 \beta}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x + 20 \beta}{10}\right)\right]\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
Which is maximized when &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x}{10}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now to find the indifference bid price solve for &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1) = \max_{\alpha B_0 + \beta S_0 = x - v^b(1)} \mathbb{E}[1 - \exp(-.1 \times (\alpha B_T + \beta S_T + C_T))]&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \max_{\beta} \left[1 - \frac{1}{3}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1)) - 20 \beta}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1))}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1)) + 20 \beta + 20}{10}\right)\right]\right]&lt;/math&gt;
Which is maximized when &lt;math&gt;\beta = -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3} \exp(-1.10 x/10) \exp(1.10 v^b(1)/10)\left[1 + 2 \exp(-1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = V(x - v^b(1),1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;v^b(1) = \frac{10}{1.1} \log\left(\frac{3}{1+2 \exp(-1)}\right) \approx 4.97&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly solve for &lt;math&gt;v^a(1)&lt;/math&gt; to find the indifference ask price.

==Notes==
* If &lt;math&gt;\left[v^b(k),v^a(k)\right]&lt;/math&gt; are the indifference price bounds for a claim then by definition &lt;math&gt;v^b(k) = -v^a(-k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=C09 /&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;v(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the indifference bid price for a claim and &lt;math&gt;v^{sup}(k),v^{sub}(k)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[superhedging price]] and subhedging prices respectively then &lt;math&gt;v^{sub}(k) \leq v(k) \leq v^{sup}(k)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, in a [[complete market]] the indifference price is always equal to the price to hedge the claim.

'''The Kane quantum computer''' is a proposal for a scalable [[quantum computer]] proposed by [[Bruce Kane]] in 1998,&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;Kane, B.E. (1998)"[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6681/abs/393133a0.html A silicon-based nuclear spin quantum computer ]", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', '''393''', p133&lt;/ref&gt; who was then at the [[University of New South Wales]]. Often thought of as a hybrid between [[quantum dot]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) quantum computers, the Kane computer is based on an array of individual [[phosphorus]] [[donor atom]]s embedded in a pure [[silicon]] lattice. Both the nuclear [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the donors and the spins of the donor [[electron]]s participate in the computation.

Unlike many quantum computation schemes, the Kane quantum computer is in principle scalable to an arbitrary number of qubits. This is possible because qubits may be individually addressed by electrical means.

==Description==
[[Image:Kane QC.png|right]]
The original proposal calls for phosphorus donors to be placed in an array with a spacing of 20&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]], approximately 20&amp;nbsp;nm below the surface. An insulating oxide layer is grown on top of the silicon. Metal '''A gates''' are deposited on the oxide above each donor, and '''J gates''' between adjacent donors.

The phosphorus donors are isotopically pure &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P, which have a nuclear [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1/2. The silicon substrate is isotopically pure &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si which has nuclear spin 0. Using the nuclear spin of the P donors as a method to encode [[qubit]]s has two major advantages. Firstly, the state has an extremely long [[decoherence]] time, perhaps on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; seconds at [[millikelvin]] temperatures. Secondly, the qubits may be manipulated by applying an [[oscillating]] [[magnetic field]], as in typical NMR proposals. By altering the voltage on the A gates, it should be possible to alter the [[Larmor frequency]] of individual donors. This allows them to be [[addressing|addressed]] individually, by bringing specific donors into [[resonance]] with the applied oscillating magnetic field.

Nuclear spins alone will not interact significantly with other nuclear spins 20&amp;nbsp;nm away. Nuclear spin is useful to perform single-qubit operations, but to make a quantum computer, two-qubit operations are also required. This is the role of electron spin in this design. Under A-gate control, the spin is transferred from the nucleus to the donor electron. Then, a potential is applied to the J gate, drawing adjacent donor electrons into a common region, greatly enhancing the interaction between the neighbouring spins. By controlling the J gate voltage, two-qubit operations are possible.

Kane's proposal for readout was to apply an electric field to encourage spin-dependent [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] of an electron to transform two neutral donors to a D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;ndash;D&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt; state, that is, one where two electrons orbit the same donor. The charge excess is then detected using a [[single-electron transistor]]. This method has two major difficulties. Firstly, the D&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt; state has strong coupling with the environment and hence a short decoherence time. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, it's not clear that the D&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt; state has a sufficiently long lifetime to allow for readout&amp;mdash;the electron tunnels into the [[conduction band]].

==Development==
Since Kane's proposal, under the guidance of [[Robert Clark (physicist)|Robert Clark]] and now [[Michelle Simmons]], pursuing realisation of the Kane quantum computer has become the primary quantum computing effort in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqc2t.org/ Centre for Quantum Computation &amp; Communication Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists have put forward a number of proposals for improved readout. Experimentally, atomic-precision deposition of phosphorus atoms has been demonstrated, using a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) technique. Detection of the movement of single electrons between small, dense clusters of phosphorus donors has also been achieved. The group remains optimistic that a practical large-scale quantum computer can be built. Other groups believe that the idea needs to be modified.&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, J. A silicon-based surface code quantum computer. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5149.pdf 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10412">The '''Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma''' is a basic result in mathematical [[fixed-point theorem|fixed-point theory]] published in 1929 by [[Bronisław Knaster|Knaster]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]] and [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz|Mazurkiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=B.|last1=Knaster|author1-link=Bronisław Knaster|first2=C.|last2=Kuratowski|author2-link=Kazimierz Kuratowski|first3=S.|last3=Mazurkiewicz|author3-link=Stefan Mazurkiewicz|title=Ein Beweis des Fixpunktsatzes für ''n''-dimensionale Simplexe|journal=[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]]|volume=14|issue=1|year=1929|pages=132–137|language=German|url=https://eudml.org/doc/212127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The KKM lemma can be proved from [[Sperner's lemma]] and can be used to prove the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]].

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[simplex]] with ''n'' [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] labeled as &lt;math&gt;1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;. 

A '''KKM covering''' is defined as a set &lt;math&gt;C_1,\ldots,C_n&lt;/math&gt; of [[closed sets]] such that for any &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[convex hull]] of the vertices corresponding to &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is [[Cover_(topology)|covered]] by &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I}C_i&lt;/math&gt;. 

The KKM lemma says that '''a KKM covering has a non-empty intersection''', i.e:
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}C_i \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
The case &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt; may serve as an illustration.  In this case the simplex &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2&lt;/math&gt; is a triangle, whose vertices we can label 1, 2 and 3.  We are given three closed sets &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2,C_3&lt;/math&gt; such that:
* &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; covers vertex 1, &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; covers vertex 2, &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt; covers vertex 3.
* The edge 12 (from vertex 1 to vertex 2) is covered by the sets &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, the edge 23 is covered by the sets &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt;, the edge 31 is covered by the sets &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;.
* The union of all three sets covers the entire triangle
The KKM lemma states that the sets &lt;math&gt;C_1, C_2, C_3&lt;/math&gt; have at least one point in common.

[[File:KKM example.png|thumb]]
The lemma is illustrated by the picture on the right, in which set #1 is blue, set #2 is red and set #3 is green. The KKM requirements are satisfied, since:
* Each vertex is covered by a unique color.
* Each edge is covered by the two colors of its two vertices.
* The triangle is covered by all three colors.
The KKM lemma states that there is a point covered by all three colors simultaneously; such a point is clearly visible in the picture.

[[David Gale]] proved the following generalization of the KKM lemma.&lt;ref name="g84"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01769865|title=Equilibrium in a discrete exchange economy with money|journal=International Journal of Game Theory|volume=13|pages=61|year=1984|last1=Gale|first1=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Suppose that, instead of one KKM covering, we have ''n'' different KKM coverings: &lt;math&gt;C^1_1,\ldots,C^1_n,\ldots,C^n_1,\ldots,C^n_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there exists a permutation &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; of the coverings with a non-empty intersection, i.e:
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}C^{\pi(i)}_i \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

Gale wrote about his lemma: "A colloquial statement of this result is the red, white and blue lemma which asserts that if  each of three people paint a triangle red, white and blue according to the KKM rules, then there will be a point which is in the red set of one person, the white set of another, the blue of the third".&lt;ref name="g84"/&gt;

[[Ravindra Bapat]] provided an alternative proof of this generalization, based on the [[Sperner's lemma#Permutations|permutation variant of Sperner's lemma]].&lt;ref name="b87"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01587081|title=A constructive proof of a permutation-based generalization of Sperner's lemma|journal=Mathematical Programming|volume=44|pages=113|year=1989|last1=Bapat|first1=R. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: the original KKM lemma follows from the permutation lemma by simply picking ''n'' identical coverings.

===Connecting-sets===
A '''connecting set''' of a simplex is a [[connected set]] that touches all ''n'' faces of the simplex. 

[[File:KKM generalized example.png|thumb]]
A '''generalized KKM covering''' is a covering &lt;math&gt;C_1,\ldots,C_n&lt;/math&gt; in which no &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; contains a connecting set. 

Any KKM-covering is a generalized-KKM-covering, since in a KKM covering, no &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; even touches all ''n'' faces. However, there are generalized-KKM-coverings that are not KKM-coverings. An example is illustrated at the right. There, the red set touches all three faces, but it does not contain any connecting-set, since no connected component of it touches all three faces.

A theorem of [[Ravindra Bapat]], generalizing [[Sperner's lemma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bapat|first1=Ravindra|title=Modeling, Computation and Optimization|date=2009-04-03|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814467896|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yN7FCgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|chapter 16, pp. 257-261}}
implies that the KKM lemma is true for generalized KKM coverings (he proved his theorem for &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;).

The connecting-set variant also has a permutation variant, so that both these generalizations can be used simultaneously.

=== &lt;span id='KKMS'&gt;The KKMS theorem&lt;/span&gt; ===
The '''KKMS theorem''' is a generalization of the KKM lemma by [[Lloyd Shapley]]. It is useful in [[economics]], especially in [[cooperative game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01210576|title=On Kakutani's fixed point theorem, the K-K-M-S theorem and the core of a balanced game|journal=Economic Theory|volume=1|pages=108|year=1991|last1=Shapley|first1=Lloyd|last2=Vohra|first2=Rajiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a KKM covering contains ''n'' sets, a '''KKMS covering''' contains &lt;math&gt;2^n-1&lt;/math&gt; sets - indexed by the nonempty subsets of &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[convex hull]] of the vertices corresponding to &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; should be [[Cover_(topology)|covered]] by &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{J \subseteq I}C_J&lt;/math&gt;. 

The KKMS theorem says that for any KKMS covering, there is a ''balanced collection'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, such that the intersection of sets indexed by &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty:&lt;ref name=i81&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-247X(81)90063-9|title=On the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz-Shapley theorem|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|volume=81|issue=2|pages=297|year=1981|last1=Ichiishi|first1=Tatsuro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{J\in B} C_J \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;

It remains to explain what a "balanced collection" is. A collection &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''balanced'' if, for each subset &lt;math&gt;J\in B&lt;/math&gt;, we can select a weight &lt;math&gt;w_J\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, such that, for each element &lt;math&gt;x\in \{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the sum of weights of all subsets that contain &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is exactly 1. For example, suppose &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;. Then:
* The collection {{1}, {2}, {3}} is balanced: choose all weights to be 1. The same is true for any collection in which each element appears exactly once, such as the collection {{1,2},{3}} or the collection { {1,2,3} }.
* The collection {{1,2}, {2,3}, {3,1}} is balanced: choose all weights to be 1/2. The same is true for any collection in which each element appears exactly twice.
* The collection {{1,2}, {2,3}} is not balanced, since for any choice of positive weights, the sum for element 2 will be larger than the sum for element 1 or 3, so it is not possible that all sums equal 1.
* The collection {{1,2}, {2,3}, {1}} is balanced: choose &lt;math&gt;w_{1,2}=0,w_{2,3}=1,w_{1}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The KKMS theorem implies the KKM lemma.&lt;ref name=i81/&gt; Suppose we have a KKM covering &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;. Construct a KKMS covering &lt;math&gt;C'_J&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;C'_J = C_i&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;J=\{i\}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a singleton that contains only element &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;C'_J = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.
The KKM condition on the original covering &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; implies the KKMS condition on the new covering &lt;math&gt;C'_J&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there exists a balanced collection such that the corresponding sets in the new covering have nonempty intersection. But the only possible balanced collection is the collection of all singletons; hence, the original covering has nonempty intersection.

The KKMS theorem has various proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01215384|title=An elementary proof of the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz-Shapley Theorem|journal=Economic Theory|volume=4|issue=3|pages=467|year=1994|last1=Krasa|first1=Stefan|last2=Yannelis|first2=Nicholas C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01215383|title=A simple proof of K-K-M-S theorem|journal=Economic Theory|volume=4|issue=3|pages=463|year=1994|last1=Komiya|first1=Hidetoshi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s001990050161|title=An extremely simple proof of the K-K-M-S Theorem|journal=Economic Theory|volume=10|issue=2|pages=361|year=1997|last1=Herings|first1=P. Jean-Jacques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reny and Holtz proved that the balanced set can also be chosen to be ''partnered''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0304-4068(97)00004-9|title=An extension of the KKMS theorem|journal=Journal of Mathematical Economics|volume=29|issue=2|pages=125|year=1998|last1=Reny|first1=Philip J.|last2=Holtz Wooders|first2=Myrna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boundary conditions ===
Oleg R. Musin proved several generalizations of the KKM lemma and KKMS theorem, with boundary conditions on the coverings. The boundary conditions are related to [[homotopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1512.04612|last1= Musin|first1= Oleg R.|title= KKM type theorems with boundary conditions|class= math.AT|year= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1505.07629|last1= Musin|first1= Oleg R.|title= Homotopy invariants of covers and KKM type lemmas|journal= Algebraic &amp; Geometric Topology|volume= 16|issue= 3|pages= 1799–1812|year= 2015|doi= 10.2140/agt.2016.16.1799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MDL ''Chime'' ''' is a free [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] used by [[web browsers]] to display the [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] structures of [[molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Liz | last1=Dorland | title=News from Online: What's New with Chime? | journal=[[J. Chem. Educ.]] | volume=79 | issue=7 | page=778 | doi=10.1021/ed079p778| bibcode=2002JChEd..79..778D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the ISIS product line acquired by [[Symyx Technologies]] from scientific publisher [[Elsevier]] in October 2007. It is based on the [[RasMol]] code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=John | last1=Hodgson | title=GlaxoWellcome and MDL become entangled in the Web | journal = [[Nature Biotechnology]] | volume=14 | page=690 | year=1996 | doi=10.1038/nbt0696-690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chime is used by a wide range of [[biochemistry]] web sites for the visualization of [[macromolecules]]. Many of these sites are linked to the ''World Index of Molecular Visualization Resources'' [http://molvisindex.org MolVisIndex.Org]. Chime was also used until 2006 at the [[Protein data bank|Protein Data Bank]] to examine structures stored there.

Although available in 1996 in both [[Windows 95]] and [[classic Mac OS]] versions for both [[Netscape]] and [[Internet Explorer]] browsers, development of Chime did not follow the move to [[Mac OS X]] for the Mac and support for Windows-based browsers other than Internet Explorer was limited (although it works well in [[Mozilla Firefox]]). One significant feature added in 1997 was the ability to display spectroscopic data in the form of the IUPAC JCAMP-DX protocols. Apart from this, most updates since then were for the installation package to follow the development of Windows and Internet Explorer.

Chime largely has been superseded by '''[[Jmol]]''', a non-proprietary [[open-source software|open-source]] Java molecular visualization application/applet that has maintained most Chime command compatibility while adding features.

A feature of Chime which is not yet reproduced with Jmol is the calculation of electrostatic or hydrophobic potential for use in coloring molecular surfaces. Instead, Jmol relies on this data being provided by other calculation packages. Chime involves some level of
calculation of these properties.

Now Chime is owned by Accelrys, and has been merged to [[Discovery Studio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16404">{{Financial risk types}}
In [[finance]], '''model risk''' is the risk of loss resulting from using insufficiently accurate models to make decisions, originally and frequently in the context of valuing [[financial securities]].&lt;ref name="derman-model-risk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emanuelderman.com/media/gs-model_risk.pdf |title=Model Risk |year=1996 |accessdate=September 10, 2013 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, model risk is more and more prevalent in activities other than financial securities valuation, such as assigning consumer [[credit score]]s, real-time probability prediction of fraudulent credit card transactions, and computing the probability of air flight passenger being a terrorist.  Rebonato in 2002 defines model risk as "the risk of occurrence of a significant difference between the mark-to-model value of a complex and/or illiquid instrument, and the price at which the same instrument is revealed to have traded in the market".

==Types==
Burke regards failure to use a model (instead over-relying on expert judgment) as a type of model risk.&lt;ref name="Burke-risk-professional-interest-forum"&gt;http://www.siiglobal.org/SII/WEB5/sii_files/Membership/PIFs/Risk/Model%20Risk%2024%2011%2009%20Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Derman describes various types of model risk that arise from using a model:&lt;ref name="derman-model-risk" /&gt;

===Wrong model===
* Inapplicability of model.
* Incorrect model specification.

===Model implementation===
* Programming errors.
* Technical errors.
* Use of inaccurate numerical approximations.

===Model usage===
* Implementation risk.
* Data issues.
* Calibration errors.

==Sources==

===Uncertainty on volatility===
Volatility is the most important input in risk management models and pricing models. Uncertainty on volatility leads to model risk. Derman believes that products whose value depends on a [[volatility smile]] are most likely to suffer from model risk. He writes "I would think it's safe to say that there is no area where model risk is more of an issue than in the modeling of the volatility smile."&lt;ref name="derman-euronext-smile"&gt;{{cite web |first=Emanuel |last=Derman |title=Laughter in the Dark: The Problem of the Volatility Smile |date=May 26, 2003 |url=http://www.emanuelderman.com/media/euronext-volatility_smile.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Avellaneda &amp; Paras (1995) proposed a systematic way of studying and mitigating  model risk resulting from  volatility uncertainty.&lt;ref name="AvellanedaParas"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/13504869500000005| title = Pricing and hedging derivative securities in markets with uncertain volatilities| journal = Applied Mathematical Finance| volume = 2| issue = 2| pages = 73–88| year = 1995| last1 = Avellaneda | first1 = M.| last2 = Levy | first2 = A.| last3 = Parás | first3 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time inconsistency===
Buraschi and Corielli  formalise the concept of 'time inconsistency' with regards to [[arbitrage|no-arbitrage]] models that allow for a perfect fit of the term structure of the interest rates. In these models the current [[yield curve]] is an input so that new observations on the [[yield curve]] can be used to update the model at regular frequencies. They explore the issue of time-consistent and self-financing strategies in this class of models. Model risk affects all the three main steps of [[Financial risk management|risk management]]: specification, estimation and implementation.&lt;ref name="Buraschi2"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2005.02.002| title = Risk management implications of time-inconsistency: Model updating and recalibration of no-arbitrage models| journal = Journal of Banking &amp; Finance| volume = 29| issue = 11| pages = 2883| year = 2005| last1 = Buraschi | first1 = A. | last2 = Corielli | first2 = F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correlation uncertainty===
Uncertainty on correlation parameters is another important source of model risk. Cont and Deguest propose a method for computing model risk exposures in multi-asset equity derivatives and show that options which depend on the worst or best performances in a  basket (so called [[rainbow option]]) are more exposed to model uncertainty than index options.&lt;ref name="ContDeguest2012"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Equity Correlations Implied by Index Options: Estimation and Model Uncertainty Analysis |last=Cont|first=Rama|author2=Romain Deguest |journal=Mathematical Finance|year=2013 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=496–530 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9965.2011.00503.x |ssrn=1592531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gennheimer investigates the model risk present in pricing basket default derivatives. He prices these derivatives with various copulas and concludes that "... unless one is very sure about the dependence structure governing the credit basket, any investors willing to trade basket default products should imperatively compute prices under alternative copula specifications and verify the estimation errors of their simulation to know at least the model risks they run".&lt;ref name="Gennheimer-copula"&gt;{{cite web |first=Heinrich |last=Gennheimer |title=Model Risk in Copula Based Default Pricing Models |year=2002 |citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===
Complexity of a model or a financial contract may be a source of model risk, leading to incorrect identification of its risk factors. This factor was cited as a major source of model risk for mortgage backed securities portfolios during the 2007 crisis.

===Illiquidity and model risk===
Model risk does not only exist for complex financial contracts. Frey (2000) presents a study of how market illiquidity is a source of model risk. He writes "Understanding the robustness of models used for hedging and risk-management purposes with respect to the assumption of perfectly liquid markets is therefore an important issue in the analysis of model risk in general."&lt;ref name="Frey"&gt;{{cite web |last=Frey |first=Rüdiger |year=2000 |title=Market Illiquidity as a Source of Model Risk in Dynamic Hedging |citeseerx=10.1.1.29.6703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Convertible bond]]s, [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], and [[high-yield bond]]s can often be illiquid and difficult to value. Hedge funds that trade these securities can be exposed to model risk when calculating monthly NAV for its investors.&lt;ref name="Keith H Black"&gt;{{cite book |title=Managing a Hedge Fund |first=Keith H. |last=Black |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-07-143481-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative approaches==

===Model averaging vs worst-case approach===
Rantala (2006) mentions that "In the face of model risk, rather than to base decisions on a single selected 'best' model, the modeller can base his inference on an entire set of models by using model averaging."&lt;ref name="Rantala"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rantala |first=J. |year=2006 |chapter=On joint and separate history of probability, statistics and actuarial science |editor-last=Liksi |title=Festschrift for Tarmo Pukkila on his 60th Birthday |pages=261–284 |publisher=University of Tampere, Finland |isbn=951-44-6620-9 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to model risk is the worst-case, or minmax approach, advocated in decision theory by Gilboa and Schmeidler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0304-4068(89)90018-9| title = Maxmin expected utility with non-unique prior| journal = Journal of Mathematical Economics| volume = 18| issue = 2| pages = 141| year = 1989| last1 = Gilboa | first1 = I. | last2 = Schmeidler | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this approach one considers a range of models and minimizes the loss encountered in the worst-case scenario. This approach to model risk has been developed by Cont (2006).&lt;ref name="Cont2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Model uncertainty and its impact on the pricing of derivative instruments|last=Cont|first=Rama|journal=Mathematical Finance|year=2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=519–547|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9965.2006.00281.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantifying model risk exposure===
To measure the risk induced by a model, it has to be compared to an alternative model, or a set of alternative benchmark models. The problem is how to choose these benchmark models.&lt;ref name="ModelRiskTalanxAG"&gt;{{cite paper |title=Measuring Model Risk |last=Sibbertsen |last2=Stahl |last3=Luedtke |work=Leibnitz University Discussion Paper No. 409 |url=http://www3.wiwi.uni-hannover.de/Forschung/Diskussionspapiere/dp-409.pdf |date=November 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of derivative pricing Cont (2006) proposes a quantitative approach to measurement of model risk exposures in derivatives portfolios: first, a set of benchmark models is specified and calibrated to market prices of liquid instruments, then the target portfolio is priced under all benchmark models. A measure of exposure to model risk is then given by the difference between the current portfolio valuation and the worst-case valuation under the benchmark models. Such a measure may be used as a way of determining a reserve for model risk for derivatives portfolios.&lt;ref name="Cont2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Model uncertainty and its impact on the pricing of derivative instruments|last=Cont|first=Rama|journal=Mathematical Finance|year=2006|volume=16|issue=3|pages=519–547|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9965.2006.00281.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position limits and valuation reserves===
Kato and Yoshiba discuss qualitative and quantitative ways of controlling model risk. They write "From a quantitative perspective, in the case of pricing models, we can set up a reserve to allow for the difference in estimations using alternative models. In the case of risk measurement models, scenario analysis can be undertaken for various fluctuation patterns of risk factors, or position limits can be established based on information obtained from scenario analysis."&lt;ref name="Kato-and-Yoshiba-2000"&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/english/publication/mes/2000/me18-2-5.pdf |title=Model Risk and Its Control |first=Toshiyasu |last=Kato |first2=Toshinao |last2=Yoshiba |work=Monetary and Economic Studies |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cont (2006) advocates the use of model risk exposure for computing such reserves.

==Mitigation==

===Theoretical basis===
* Considering key assumptions.
* Considering simple cases and their solutions (model boundaries).
* [[Occam's razor|Parsimony]].

===Implementation===
* Pride of ownership.
* Disseminating the model outwards in an orderly manner.

===Testing===
* [[Stress testing (software)|Stress testing]] and [[backtesting]].
* Avoid letting small issues snowball into large issues later on.
* Independent validation
* Ongoing monitoring and against market

==Examples of model risk mitigation==

===Parsimony===
Taleb wrote when describing why most new models that attempted to correct the inadequacies of the [[Black–Scholes]] model failed to become accepted:

"Traders are not fooled by the Black–Scholes–Merton model. The existence of a 'volatility surface' is one such adaptation. But they find it preferable to fudge one parameter, namely volatility, and make it a function of time to expiry and strike price, rather than have to precisely estimate another."&lt;ref name="Taleb-Dynamic-Hedging"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamic Hedging: Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |first=Nassim |last=Taleb |isbn=978-0-471-35347-8 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Cherubini and Della Lunga describe the disadavantages of parsimony in the context of volatility and correlation modelling. Using an excessive number of parameters may induce [[overfitting]] while choosing a severely specified model may easily induce model misspecification and a systematic failure to represent the future distribution.&lt;ref name="Structured_Finance"&gt;{{cite book |title=Structured Finance |location=Hoboken |publisher=Wiley |first=Umberto |last=Cherubini |first2=Giovanni Della |last2=Lunga |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-02638-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model risk premium===
Fender and Kiff (2004) note that holding complex financial instruments, such as [[Collateralized debt obligation|CDOs]], "translates into heightened dependence on these assumptions and, thus, higher model risk. As this risk should be expected to be priced by the market, part of the yield pick-up obtained relative to equally rated single obligor instruments is likely to be a direct reflection of model risk."&lt;ref name="BIS_No163"&gt;{{cite paper |url= |first=Ingo |last=Fender |first2=John |last2=Kiff |title=CDO rating methodology: Some thoughts on model and its implications |year=2004 |work=BIS Working Papers No. 163 |ssrn=844225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[game theory]], the '''Nash equilibrium''', named after the late mathematician [[John Forbes Nash Jr.]], is a proposed [[solution concept|solution]] of a [[non-cooperative game]] involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy.&lt;ref name="Osborne"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Course in Game Theory |last=Osborne |first=Martin J. |last2=Rubinstein |first2=Ariel |date=12 Jul 1994 |publisher=MIT |isbn=9780262150415 |location=Cambridge, MA |page=14 |author-link2=Ariel Rubinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In terms of game theory, if each player has chosen a strategy, and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and their corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

Stated simply, [[Alice and Bob]] are in Nash equilibrium if Alice is making the best decision she can, taking into account Bob's decision while Bob's decision remains unchanged, and Bob is making the best decision he can, taking into account Alice's decision while Alice's decision remains unchanged. Likewise, a group of players are in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision possible, taking into account the decisions of the others in the game as long as the other parties' decisions remain unchanged.

Nash showed that there is a Nash equilibrium for every finite game: see further the article on [[Strategy (game theory) | strategy]].

==Applications==
Game theorists use the Nash equilibrium concept to analyze the outcome of the [[strategy|strategic interaction]] of several [[decision making|decision makers]]. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome for each of them depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, ''taking into account'' the decision-making of the others.

Nash equilibrium has been used to analyze hostile situations like [[war]] and [[arms race]]s&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&amp;dq=thomas+schelling+strategy+of+conflict&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xuSjSbK-I4-O_gai_ticBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPP13,M1 The Strategy of Conflict]'', copyright 1960, 1980, Harvard University Press, {{isbn|0-674-84031-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[prisoner's dilemma]]), and also how conflict may be mitigated by repeated interaction (see [[tit-for-tat]]). It has also been used to study to what extent people with different preferences can cooperate (see [[Battle of the sexes (game theory)|battle of the sexes]]), and whether they will take risks to achieve a cooperative outcome (see [[stag hunt]]). It has been used to study the adoption of [[technical standard]]s,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and also the occurrence of [[bank run]]s and [[Currency crisis|currency crises]] (see [[coordination game]]). Other applications include traffic flow (see [[Wardrop's principle]]), how to organize auctions (see [[auction theory]]), the outcome of efforts exerted by multiple parties in the education process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1162/REST_a_00013| title = Must Try Harder: Evaluating the Role of Effort in Educational Attainment| journal = Review of Economics and Statistics| volume = 92| issue = 3| pages = 577| year = 2010| last1 = De Fraja | first1 = G. | last2 = Oliveira | first2 = T. | last3 = Zanchi | first3 = L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; regulatory legislation such as environmental regulations (see [[tragedy of the Commons]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb00338.x| title = Game Theory and the Politics of Global Warming: The State of Play and Beyond| journal = Political Studies| volume = 44| issue = 5| pages = 850| year = 1996| last1 = Ward | first1 = H. }},&lt;/ref&gt; natural resource management,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/icesjms/fsx062| title = Risks and benefits of catching pretty good yield in multispecies mixed fisheries |

==History==
The Nash equilibrium was named after American mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Forbes Nash, Jr]]. A version of the Nash equilibrium concept was first known to be used in 1838 by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in his theory of [[oligopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;Cournot A. (1838) Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth&lt;/ref&gt; In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A [[Cournot equilibrium]] occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a [[pure strategy|pure-strategy]] Nash equilibrium. Cournot also introduced the concept of [[best response]] dynamics in his analysis of the stability of equilibrium. However, Nash's definition of equilibrium is broader than Cournot's. It is also broader than the definition of a Pareto-efficient equilibrium, since the Nash definition makes no judgements about the optimality of the equilibrium being generated.

The modern game-theoretic concept of Nash equilibrium is instead defined in terms of [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]], where players choose a probability distribution over possible actions. The concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium was introduced by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in their 1944 book ''The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior''. However, their analysis was restricted to the special case of [[zero-sum]] games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Von Neumann, O. Morgenstern, ''[https://archive.org/stream/theoryofgamesand030098mbp#page/n5/mode/2up Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]'', copyright 1944, 1953, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution of Nash in his 1951 article "Non-Cooperative Games" was to define a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium must exist in such a game. The key to Nash's ability to prove existence far more generally than von Neumann lay in his definition of equilibrium. According to Nash, "an equilibrium point is an n-tuple such that each player's mixed strategy maximizes his payoff if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player's strategy is optimal against those of the others." Just putting the problem in this framework allowed Nash to employ the [[Kakutani fixed-point theorem]] in his 1950 paper, and a variant upon it in his 1951 paper used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] to prove that there had to exist at least one mixed strategy profile that mapped back into itself for finite-player (not necessarily zero-sum) games, namely, a strategy profile that did not call for a shift in strategies that could improve payoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Carmona |first=Guilherme |first2=Konrad |last2=Podczeck |year=2009|title=On the Existence of Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria in Large Games |ssrn=882466 |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=144 |issue=3 |pages=1300–1319 |doi=10.1016/j.jet.2008.11.009 |url=http://fesrvsd.fe.unl.pt/WPFEUNL/WP2008/wp531.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the development of the Nash equilibrium concept, game theorists have discovered that it makes misleading predictions (or fails to make a unique prediction) in certain circumstances. They have proposed many related [[solution concept]]s (also called 'refinements' of Nash equilibria) designed to overcome perceived flaws in the Nash concept. One particularly important issue is that some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not '[[credibility|credible]]'. In 1965 [[Reinhard Selten]] proposed [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on [[non-credible threats]]. Other extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept have addressed what happens if a game is [[Repeated game|repeated]], or what happens if a game is played in the [[Global game|absence of complete information]]. However, subsequent refinements and extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept share the main insight on which Nash's concept rests: all equilibrium concepts analyze what choices will be made when each player takes into account the decision-making of others.

==Definitions==

===Informal definition===
Informally, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing his or her strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks themselves: "Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?"

If any player could answer "Yes", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a [[best response]] to all other strategies in that equilibrium.&lt;ref name="preliminaries"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto optimal]].

The Nash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in sequential games because players may "threaten" each other with non-rational moves. For such games the [[subgame perfect Nash equilibrium]] may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis.

=== Formal definition ===
Let &lt;math&gt;(S, f)&lt;/math&gt; be a game with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; players, where &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is the strategy set for player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S=S_1 \times S_2 \times \dotsb \times S_n&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[Strategy (game theory)|strategy profiles]] and &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(f_1(x), \dotsc, f_n(x))&lt;/math&gt; is its payoff function evaluated at &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; be a strategy profile of player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{-i}&lt;/math&gt; be a strategy profile of all players except for player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. When each player &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1, \dotsc, n\}&lt;/math&gt; chooses strategy &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; resulting in strategy profile &lt;math&gt;x = (x_1, \dotsc, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; then player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; obtains payoff &lt;math&gt;f_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the payoff depends on the strategy profile chosen, i.e., on the strategy chosen by player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; as well as the strategies chosen by all the other players. A strategy profile &lt;math&gt;x^* \in S&lt;/math&gt; is a Nash equilibrium (NE) if no unilateral deviation in strategy by any single player is profitable for that player, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\forall i,x_i\in S_i :  f_i(x^*_{i}, x^*_{-i}) \geq f_i(x_{i},x^*_{-i}).&lt;/math&gt;

When the inequality above holds strictly (with &amp;gt; instead of &amp;ge;) for all players and all feasible alternative strategies, then the equilibrium is classified as a ''strict Nash equilibrium''. If instead, for some player, there is exact equality between &lt;math&gt;x^*_i&lt;/math&gt; and some other strategy in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then the equilibrium is classified as a ''weak Nash equilibrium''.

A game can have a [[Pure strategy|pure-strategy]] or a [[Mixed strategy|mixed-strategy]] Nash equilibrium. (In the latter a pure strategy is chosen [[stochastic]]ally with a fixed [[probability]]).

===Nash's Existence Theorem===
Nash proves that if we allow [[strategy (game theory)#Pure and mixed strategies|mixed strategies]], then every game with a finite number of players in which each player can choose from finitely many pure strategies has at least one Nash equilibrium.

Nash equilibrium need not exist if the set of choices is infinite and noncompact.  An example is when two players simultaneously name a natural number with the player naming the larger number wins.  However, Nash equilibrium exists if the set of choices is [[compact space|compact]] with continuous payoff.&lt;ref&gt;MIT OpenCourseWare. 6.254: Game Theory with Engineering Applications, Spring 2010. [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-254-game-theory-with-engineering-applications-spring-2010/lecture-notes/MIT6_254S10_lec06.pdf Lecture 6: Continuous and Discontinuous Games].&lt;/ref&gt;  An example (with the equilibrium being a mixture of continuously many pure strategies) is if two players simultaneously pick a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) with player one winnings (paid by the second player) equaling square root of the distance between the two numbers.

== Examples ==

=== Coordination game ===
{{Main article|Coordination game}}

The ''coordination game'' is a classic ([[symmetric game|symmetric]]) two player, two [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]] game, with an example [[payoff matrix]] shown to the right. The players should thus coordinate, both adopting strategy A, to receive the highest payoff; i.e., 4. If both players chose strategy B though, there is still a Nash equilibrium. Although each player is awarded less than optimal payoff, neither player has incentive to change strategy due to a reduction in the immediate payoff (from 2 to 1).

A famous example of this type of game was called the [[stag hunt]]; in the game two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the former providing more meat (4 utility units) than the latter (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to hunt the stag, while the other hunts the rabbit, he will fail in hunting (0 utility units), whereas if they both hunt it they will split the payload (2, 2). The game hence exhibits two equilibria at (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit) and hence the players' optimal strategy depend on their expectation on what the other player may do. If one hunter trusts that the other will hunt the stag, they should hunt the stag; however if they suspect that the other will hunt the rabbit, they should hunt the rabbit. This game was used as an analogy for social cooperation, since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.

Another example of a coordination game is the setting where two technologies are available to two firms with comparable products, and they have to elect a strategy to become the market standard. If both firms agree on the chosen technology, high sales are expected for both firms. If the firms do not agree on the standard technology, few sales result. Both strategies are Nash equilibria of the game.

Driving on a road against an oncoming car, and having to choose either to swerve on the left or to swerve on the right of the road, is also a coordination game. For example, with payoffs 10 meaning no crash and 0 meaning a crash, the coordination game can be defined with the following payoff matrix:

{| align=left border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%" class="wikitable"

|{{diagonal split header|0| 0|transparent}}
|-
!Drive on the Right
|{{diagonal split header|0| 0|transparent}}
|{{diagonal split header|10| 10|transparent}}
|-
|}

In this case there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]] (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%,100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player are (50%, 50%).

|}
Imagine two prisoners held in separate cells, interrogated simultaneously, and offered deals (lighter jail sentences) for betraying their fellow criminal. They can "cooperate" (with the other prisoner) by not snitching, or "defect" by betraying the other. However, there is a catch; if both players defect, then they both serve a longer sentence than if neither said anything. Lower jail sentences are interpreted as higher payoffs (shown in the table).

The prisoner's dilemma has a similar matrix as depicted for the coordination game, but the maximum reward for each player (in this case, a minimum loss of 0) is obtained only when the players' decisions are different. Each player improves their own situation by switching from "cooperating" to "defecting", given knowledge that the other player's best decision is to "defect". The prisoner's dilemma thus has a single Nash equilibrium: both players choosing to defect.

What has long made this an interesting case to study is the fact that this scenario is globally inferior to "both cooperating". That is, both players would be better off if they both chose to "cooperate" instead of both choosing to defect. However, each player could improve their own situation by breaking the mutual cooperation, no matter how the other player possibly (or certainly) changes their decision.

=== Network traffic ===
{{See also|Braess's paradox}}
[[File:Nash graph equilibrium.png|thumb|250px|Sample network graph. Values on edges are the travel time experienced by a 'car' traveling down that edge. {{mvar|x}} is the number of cars traveling via that edge.]]
An application of Nash equilibria is in determining the expected flow of traffic in a network. Consider the graph on the right. If we assume that there are {{mvar|x}} "cars" traveling from A to D, what is the expected distribution of traffic in the network?

This situation can be modeled as a "game" where every traveler has a choice of 3 strategies, where each strategy is a route from A to D (either {{math|ABD}}, {{math|ABCD}}, or {{math|ACD}}). The "payoff" of each strategy is the travel time of each route. In the graph on the right, a car travelling via {{math|ABD}} experiences travel time of {{math|(1+''x''/100)+2}}, where {{mvar|x}} is the number of cars traveling on edge {{math|AB}}. Thus, payoffs for any given strategy depend on the choices of the other players, as is usual. However, the goal, in this case, is to minimize travel time, not maximize it. Equilibrium will occur when the time on all paths is exactly the same. When that happens, no single driver has any incentive to switch routes, since it can only add to their travel time. For the graph on the right, if, for example, 100 cars are travelling from A to D, then equilibrium will occur when 25 drivers travel via {{math|ABD}}, 50 via {{math|ABCD}}, and 25 via {{math|ACD}}. Every driver now has a total travel time of 3.75 (to see this, note that a total of 75 cars take the {{math|AB}} edge, and likewise, 75 cars take the {{math|CD}} edge).&lt;!-- 25 drivers travel via ABD and 50 via ABCD, so 75 cars travel on edge AB. Similarly, 75 cars travel on edge CD. It takes (1 + 75/100) + 2 = 3.75 to travel via ABD. The travel time of the other routes is the same. --&gt;

Notice that this distribution is not, actually, socially optimal. If the 100 cars agreed that 50 travel via {{math|ABD}} and the other 50 through {{math|ACD}}, then travel time for any single car would actually be 3.5, which is less than 3.75. This is also the Nash equilibrium if the path between B and C is removed, which means that adding another possible route can decrease the efficiency of the system, a phenomenon known as [[Braess's paradox]].

This can be illustrated by a two-player game in which both players simultaneously choose an integer from 0 to 3 and they both win the smaller of the two numbers in points. In addition, if one player chooses a larger number than the other, then they have to give up two points to the other.

This game has a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium: both players choosing 0 (highlighted in light red). Any other strategy can be improved by a player switching their number to one less than that of the other player. In the adjacent table, if the game begins at the green square, it is in player 1's interest to move to the purple square and it is in player 2's interest to move to the blue square. Although it would not fit the definition of a competition game, if the game is modified so that the two players win the named amount if they both choose the same number, and otherwise win nothing, then there are 4 Nash equilibria: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3).

=== Nash equilibria in a payoff matrix ===
There is an easy numerical way to identify Nash equilibria on a payoff matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule does not apply to the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest. '''The rule goes as follows: if the first payoff number, in the payoff pair of the cell, is the maximum of the column of the cell and if the second number is the maximum of the row of the cell - then the cell represents a Nash equilibrium.'''

We can apply this rule to a 3×3 matrix:

Using the rule, we can very quickly (much faster than with formal analysis) see that the Nash equilibria cells are (B,A), (A,B), and (C,C). Indeed, for cell (B,A) 40 is the maximum of the first column and 25 is the maximum of the second row. For (A,B) 25 is the maximum of the second column and 40 is the maximum of the first row. Same for cell (C,C). For other cells, either one or both of the duplet members are not the maximum of the corresponding rows and columns.

This said, the actual mechanics of finding equilibrium cells is obvious: find the maximum of a column and check if the second member of the pair is the maximum of the row. If these conditions are met, the cell represents a Nash equilibrium. Check all columns this way to find all NE cells. An N×N matrix may have between 0 and N×N [[pure strategy|pure-strategy]] Nash equilibria.

== Stability ==
The concept of [[Stability theory|stability]], useful in the analysis of many kinds of equilibria, can also be applied to Nash equilibria.

A Nash equilibrium for a mixed-strategy game is stable if a small change (specifically, an infinitesimal change) in probabilities for one player leads to a situation where two conditions hold:

# the player who did not change has no better strategy in the new circumstance
# the player who did change is now playing with a strictly worse strategy.

If these cases are both met, then a player with the small change in their mixed strategy will return immediately to the Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium is said to be stable. If condition one does not hold then the equilibrium is unstable. If only condition one holds then there are likely to be an infinite number of optimal strategies for the player who changed.

In the "driving game" example above there are both stable and unstable equilibria. The equilibria involving mixed strategies with 100% probabilities are stable. If either player changes their probabilities slightly, they will be both at a disadvantage, and their opponent will have no reason to change their strategy in turn. The (50%,50%) equilibrium is unstable. If either player changes their probabilities, then the other player immediately has a better strategy at either (0%, 100%) or (100%, 0%).

Stability is crucial in practical applications of Nash equilibria, since the mixed strategy of each player is not perfectly known, but has to be inferred from statistical distribution of their actions in the game. In this case unstable equilibria are very unlikely to arise in practice, since any minute change in the proportions of each strategy seen will lead to a change in strategy and the breakdown of the equilibrium.

The Nash equilibrium defines stability only in terms of unilateral deviations. In cooperative games such a concept is not convincing enough. [[Strong Nash equilibrium]] allows for deviations by every conceivable coalition.&lt;ref name="CoalitionProof"&gt;{{Citation|doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(87)90099-8|title = Coalition-Proof Equilibria I. Concepts|author1=B. D. Bernheim |author2=B. Peleg |author3=M. D. Whinston |journal = Journal of Economic Theory |volume = 42 |year =1987|issue = 1| pages = 1&amp;ndash;12|postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, a strong Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which no coalition, taking the actions of its complements as given, can cooperatively deviate in a way that benefits all of its members.&lt;ref name="SNE"&gt;{{Cite book |first=R. |last=Aumann |chapter = Acceptable points in general cooperative n-person games |title=Contributions to the Theory of Games |volume=IV | publisher = Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=1959 |isbn=1-4008-8216-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the strong Nash concept is sometimes perceived as too "strong" in that the environment allows for unlimited private communication. In fact, strong Nash equilibrium has to be [[Pareto efficient]]. As a result of these requirements, strong Nash is too rare to be useful in many branches of game theory. However, in games such as elections with many more players than possible outcomes, it can be more common than a stable equilibrium.

A refined Nash equilibrium known as [[coalition-proof Nash equilibrium]] (CPNE)&lt;ref name="CoalitionProof"/&gt; occurs when players cannot do better even if they are allowed to communicate and make "self-enforcing" agreement to deviate. Every correlated strategy supported by [[Dominance (game theory)|iterated strict dominance]] and on the [[Pareto frontier]] is a CPNE.&lt;ref name="CPNE"&gt;{{Citation|title = Coalition-Proof Equilibrium|author1=D. Moreno |author2=J. Wooders |journal = Games and Economic Behavior|volume = 17|issue = 1|year =1996| pages = 80&amp;ndash;112 | doi = 10.1006/game.1996.0095|postscript = .|url =http://e-archivo.uc3m.es/bitstream/10016/4408/1/Coalition_GEB_1996_ps.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, it is possible for a game to have a Nash equilibrium that is resilient against coalitions less than a specified size, k. CPNE is related to the [[Core (economics)|theory of the core]].

Finally in the eighties, building with great depth on such ideas [[Mertens-stable equilibria]] were introduced as a [[solution concept]]. Mertens stable equilibria satisfy both [[forward induction]] and [[backward induction]]. In a [[game theory]] context [[stable equilibria]] now usually refer to Mertens stable equilibria.

== Occurrence ==
If a game has a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] Nash equilibrium and is played among players under certain conditions, then the NE strategy set will be adopted. Sufficient conditions to guarantee that the Nash equilibrium is played are:
# The players all will do their utmost to maximize their expected payoff as described by the game.
# The players are flawless in execution.
# The players have sufficient intelligence to deduce the solution.
# The players know the planned equilibrium strategy of all of the other players.
# The players believe that a deviation in their own strategy will not cause deviations by any other players.
# There is [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must know that they all know that they meet them, and know that they know that they know that they meet them, and so on.

=== Where the conditions are not met ===
Examples of [[game theory]] problems in which these conditions are not met:
# The first condition is not met if the game does not correctly describe the quantities a player wishes to maximize. In this case there is no particular reason for that player to adopt an equilibrium strategy. For instance, the prisoner’s dilemma is not a dilemma if either player is happy to be jailed indefinitely.
# Intentional or accidental imperfection in execution. For example, a computer capable of flawless logical play facing a second flawless computer will result in equilibrium. Introduction of imperfection will lead to its disruption either through loss to the player who makes the mistake, or through negation of the [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] criterion leading to possible victory for the player. (An example would be a player suddenly putting the car into reverse in the [[game of chicken]], ensuring a no-loss no-win scenario).
# In many cases, the third condition is not met because, even though the equilibrium must exist, it is unknown due to the complexity of the game, for instance in [[Chinese chess]].&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Turocy, B. Von Stengel, ''[http://www.cdam.lse.ac.uk/Reports/Files/cdam-2001-09.pdf Game Theory]'', copyright 2001, Texas A&amp;M University,  London School of Economics, pages 141-144. {{Citation needed span|text=Nash proved that a perfect NE exists for this type of finite [[extensive form game]]|date=April 2010}} – it can be represented as a strategy complying with his original conditions for a game with a NE. Such games may not have unique NE, but at least one of the many equilibrium strategies would be played by hypothetical players having perfect knowledge of all {{Citation needed span|text=10&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt; [[game-tree complexity|game trees]]|date=April 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Or, if known, it may not be known to all players, as when playing [[tic-tac-toe]] with a small child who desperately wants to win (meeting the other criteria).
# The criterion of common knowledge may not be met even if all players do, in fact, meet all the other criteria. Players wrongly distrusting each other's rationality may adopt counter-strategies to expected irrational play on their opponents’ behalf. This is a major consideration in "[[Game of chicken|chicken]]" or an [[arms race]], for example.

=== Where the conditions are met ===
In his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash proposed two interpretations of his equilibrium concept, with the objective of showing how equilibrium points 

{{quote|(...) can be connected with observable phenomenon. ''One interpretation is rationalistic: if we assume that players are rational, know the full structure of'' the game, the game is played just once, and there is just one Nash equilibrium, then players will play according to that equilibrium. This idea was formalized by Aumann, R. and A. Brandenburger, 1995, ''Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium'', Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly know, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players. In this case, the conjectures need only be mutually known).}}

A second interpretation, that Nash referred to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players: 

{{quote|[i]t is unnecessary to assume that the participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. ''What is assumed is that there is a population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the ''average member'' of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.''}}

For a formal result along these lines, see Kuhn, H. and et al., 1996, "The Work of John Nash in Game Theory," ''Journal of Economic Theory'', 69, 153-185.

Due to the limited conditions in which NE can actually be observed, they are rarely treated as a guide to day-to-day behaviour, or observed in practice in human negotiations. However, as a theoretical concept in [[economics]] and [[evolutionary biology]], the NE has explanatory power. The payoff in economics is utility (or sometimes money), and in evolutionary biology is gene transmission; both are the fundamental bottom line of survival. Researchers who apply games theory in these fields claim that strategies failing to maximize these for whatever reason will be competed out of the market or environment, which are ascribed the ability to test all strategies. This conclusion is drawn from the "[[Nash equilibrium#Stability|stability]]" theory above. In these situations the assumption that the strategy observed is actually a NE has often been borne out by research.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Cox, M. Walker, ''[http://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/learnplay.pdf Learning to Play Cournot Duoploy Strategies]'', copyright 1997, Texas A&amp;M University,  University of Arizona, pages 141-144&lt;/ref&gt;

== NE and non-credible threats ==
[[File:SGPNEandPlainNE explainingexample.svg|300px|thumb|Extensive and Normal form illustrations that show the difference between SPNE and other NE. The blue equilibrium is not subgame perfect because player two makes a non-credible threat at 2(2) to be unkind (U).]]
The Nash equilibrium is a superset of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The subgame perfect equilibrium in addition to the Nash equilibrium requires that the strategy also is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of that game. This eliminates all [[non-credible threats]], that is, strategies that contain non-rational moves in order to make the counter-player change their strategy.

The image to the right shows a simple sequential game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto be kind to him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be a more meaningful solution concept when such [[dynamic inconsistency|dynamic inconsistencies]] arise.

==Proof of existence==

=== Proof using the Kakutani fixed-point theorem ===
Nash's original proof (in his thesis) used Brouwer's fixed-point theorem (e.g., see below for a variant). We give a simpler proof via the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, following Nash's 1950 paper (he credits [[David Gale]] with the observation that such a simplification is possible).

To prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, let &lt;math&gt;r_i(\sigma_{-i})&lt;/math&gt; be the best response of player i to the strategies of all other players.
:&lt;math&gt; r_i(\sigma_{-i}) = \arg\max_{\sigma_i} u_i (\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i}) &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \Sigma_i \times \Sigma_{-i}&lt;/math&gt;, is a mixed-strategy profile in the set of all mixed strategies and &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; is the payoff function for player i. Define a [[Multivalued function|set-valued function]] &lt;math&gt;r\colon \Sigma \rightarrow 2^\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;r = (r_i(\sigma_{-i}),r_{-i}(\sigma_{i})) &lt;/math&gt;. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; having a fixed point.

Kakutani's fixed point theorem guarantees the existence of a fixed point if the following four conditions are satisfied.
# &lt;math&gt; \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is compact, convex, and nonempty.
# &lt;math&gt;r(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty.
# &lt;math&gt;r(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]]
# &lt;math&gt;r(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is convex.

Condition 1. is satisfied from the fact that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a simplex and thus compact. Convexity follows from players' ability to mix strategies.   &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty as long as players have strategies.

Condition 2. and 3. are satisfied by way of Berge's [[maximum theorem]]. Because &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; is continuous and compact, &lt;math&gt; r(\sigma_i) &lt;/math&gt; is non-empty and [[Hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]].

Condition 4. is satisfied as a result of mixed strategies. Suppose  &lt;math&gt; \sigma_i, \sigma'_i \in r(\sigma_{-i}) &lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt; \lambda \sigma_i + (1-\lambda) \sigma'_i \in r(\sigma_{-i}) &lt;/math&gt;. i.e. if two strategies maximize payoffs, then a mix between the two strategies will yield the same payoff.

Therefore, there exists a fixed point in  &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; and a Nash equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fudenburg |first=Drew |first2=Jean |last2=Tirole |title=Game Theory |location= |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-262-06141-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nash made this point to [[John von Neumann]] in 1949, von Neumann famously dismissed it with the words, "That's trivial, you know. That's just a [[fixed-point theorem]]." (See Nasar, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;94.)

=== Alternate proof using the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] ===

We have a game &lt;math&gt;G=(N,A,u)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of players and &lt;math&gt;A = A_1 \times \cdots \times A_N&lt;/math&gt; is the action set for the players. All of the action sets &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are finite. Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \Delta_1 \times \cdots \times \Delta_N&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of mixed strategies for the players. The finiteness of the &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;s ensures the compactness of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;.

We can now define the gain functions. For a mixed strategy &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \Delta&lt;/math&gt;, we let the gain for player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; on action &lt;math&gt;a \in A_i&lt;/math&gt; be

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Gain}_i(\sigma,a) = \max \{0, u_i(a, \sigma_{-i}) - u_i(\sigma_{i}, \sigma_{-i})\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The gain function represents the benefit a player gets by unilaterally changing their strategy. We now define &lt;math&gt;g = (g_1,\dotsc,g_N)&lt;/math&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;g_i(\sigma)(a) = \sigma_i(a) + \text{Gain}_i(\sigma,a)&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \Delta, a \in A_i&lt;/math&gt;. We see that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a \in A_i} g_i(\sigma)(a) = \sum_{a \in A_i} \sigma_i(a) + \text{Gain}_i(\sigma,a) = 1 + \sum_{a \in A_i} \text{Gain}_i(\sigma,a) &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Next we define:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} f = (f_1, \cdots, f_N)  : \Delta \to \Delta \\ f_i(\sigma)(a) = \frac{g_i(\sigma)(a)}{\sum_{b \in A_i} g_i(\sigma)(b)} &amp; a \in A_i \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that each &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is a valid mixed strategy in &lt;math&gt;\Delta_i&lt;/math&gt;. It is also easy to check that each &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and hence &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function. As the cross product of a finite number of compact convex sets, &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is also compact and convex. Applying the Brouwer fixed point theorem to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; we conclude that So &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a fixed point in &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, call it &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. We claim that &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is a Nash equilibrium in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. For this purpose, it suffices to show that

:&lt;math&gt; \forall i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}, \forall a \in A_i: \quad \text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*,a) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This simply states that each player gains no benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, which is exactly the necessary condition for a Nash equilibrium.

Now assume that the gains are not all zero. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\exists i \in \{1, \cdots, N\},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \in A_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*, a) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Note then that

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{a \in A_i} g_i(\sigma^*, a) = 1 + \sum_{a \in A_i} \text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*,a) &gt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So let

:&lt;math&gt;C = \sum_{a \in A_i} g_i(\sigma^*, a).&lt;/math&gt;

Also we shall denote &lt;math&gt;\text{Gain}(i,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; as the gain vector indexed by actions in &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is the fixed point we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sigma^* = f(\sigma^*)  &amp;\Rightarrow  \sigma^*_i =  f_i(\sigma^*) \\
&amp;\Rightarrow \sigma^*_i = \frac{g_i(\sigma^*)}{\sum_{a \in A_i} g_i(\sigma^*)(a)} \\ [6pt]
&amp;\Rightarrow \sigma^*_i = \frac{1}{C} \left (\sigma^*_i + \text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*,\cdot) \right ) \\ [6pt]
&amp;\Rightarrow C\sigma^*_i = \sigma^*_i + \text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*,\cdot) \\
&amp;\Rightarrow \left(C-1\right)\sigma^*_i = \text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*,\cdot) \\
&amp;\Rightarrow \sigma^*_i = \left(\frac{1}{C-1}\right)\text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*,\cdot).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;C &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*_i&lt;/math&gt; is some positive scaling of the vector &lt;math&gt;\text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. Now we claim that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A_i: \quad  \sigma^*_i(a)(u_i(a_i, \sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\sigma^*_i, \sigma^*_{-i})) = \sigma^*_i(a)\text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*, a) &lt;/math&gt;

To see this, we first note that if &lt;math&gt;\text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*, a) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; then this is true by definition of the gain function.  Now assume that &lt;math&gt;\text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*, a) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. By our previous statements we have that

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^*_i(a) = \left(\frac{1}{C-1}\right)\text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*, a) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and so the left term is zero, giving us that the entire expression is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as needed.

So we finally have that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0 &amp;= u_i(\sigma^*_i, \sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\sigma^*_i, \sigma^*_{-i}) \\
  &amp;=  \left(\sum_{a \in A_i} \sigma^*_i(a)u_i(a_i, \sigma^*_{-i})\right) - u_i(\sigma^*_i, \sigma^*_{-i}) \\
 &amp; =  \sum_{a \in A_i} \sigma^*_i(a) (u_i(a_i, \sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\sigma^*_i, \sigma^*_{-i})) \\ 
 &amp; = \sum_{a \in A_i} \sigma^*_i(a) \text{Gain}_i(\sigma^*, a) &amp;&amp; \text{ by the previous statements } \\
  &amp;= \sum_{a \in A_i} \left( C -1 \right) \sigma^*_i(a)^2 &gt; 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last inequality follows since &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*_i&lt;/math&gt; is a non-zero vector. But this is a clear contradiction, so all the gains must indeed be zero. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is a Nash equilibrium for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as needed.

== Computing Nash equilibria ==
If a player A has a [[dominant strategy]] &lt;math&gt;s_A&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays &lt;math&gt;s_A&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of two players A and B, there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays &lt;math&gt;s_A&lt;/math&gt; and B plays a best response to &lt;math&gt;s_A&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;s_A&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly dominant strategy, A plays &lt;math&gt;s_A&lt;/math&gt; in all Nash equilibria. If both A and B have strictly dominant strategies, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in which each plays their strictly dominant strategy.

In games with mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, the probability of a player choosing any particular strategy can be computed by assigning a variable to each strategy that represents a fixed probability for choosing that strategy. In order for a player to be willing to randomize, their expected payoff for each strategy should be the same. In addition, the sum of the probabilities for each strategy of a particular player should be 1. This creates a system of equations from which the probabilities of choosing each strategy can be derived.&lt;ref name="preliminaries" /&gt;

=== Examples ===
{| border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;" class="wikitable floatright"

In the matching pennies game, player A loses a point to B if A and B play the same strategy and wins a point from B if they play different strategies. To compute the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, assign A the probability ''p'' of playing H and (1−''p'') of playing T, and assign B the probability ''q'' of playing H and (1−''q'') of playing T.

:E[payoff for A playing H] = (−1)''q'' + (+1)(1−''q'') = 1−2''q''
:E[payoff for A playing T] = (+1)''q'' + (−1)(1−''q'') = 2''q''−1
:E[payoff for A playing H] = E[payoff for A playing T] ⇒ 1−2''q'' = 2''q''−1 ⇒ ''q'' = 1/2

:E[payoff for B playing H] = (+1)''p'' + (−1)(1−''p'') = 2''p''−1
:E[payoff for B playing T] = (−1)''p'' + (+1)(1−''p'') = 1−2''p''
:E[payoff for B playing H] = E[payoff for B playing T] ⇒ 2''p''−1 = 1−2''p'' ⇒ ''p'' = 1/2

Thus a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, in this game, is for each player to randomly choose H or T with p = 1/2 and q = 1/2.

[[File:Neighborhood illust1.svg|thumb|A set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is a neighbourhood of a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; if a small disc around &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''neighbourhood''' (or '''neighborhood''') is one of the basic concepts in a [[topological space]]. It is closely related to the concepts of [[open set]] and [[interior (topology)|interior]]. Intuitively speaking, a neighbourhood of a point is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points containing that point where one can move some amount in any direction away from that point without leaving the set.

== Definitions ==

===Neighbourhood of a point===

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological space]] and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a point in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a '''neighbourhood''' of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that includes an [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;p \in U \subseteq V.&lt;/math&gt;

This is also equivalent to &lt;math&gt;p\in X&lt;/math&gt; being in the [[Interior (topology)#Interior point|interior]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; need not be an open set itself. If &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is open it is called an '''{{vanchor|open neighbourhood|open neighborhood}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dixmier |first=Jacques |others=Translated by Sterling K. Berberian |year=1984 |title=General Topology |series=Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-90972-9 |page=6 |quote=According to this definition, an ''open neighborhood of x'' is nothing more than an open subset of E that contains ''x''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[mathematician]]s require that neighbourhoods be open, so it is important to note conventions.

[[File:Neighborhood illust2.svg|right|thumb|A rectangle is not a neighbourhood of any of its corners (or points on the boundary).]]
A set that is a neighbourhood of each of its points is open since it can be expressed as the union of open sets containing each of its points. A rectangle, as illustrated in the figure, is not a neighbourhood of all its points; points on the edges or corners of the rectangle are not contained in any open set that is contained within the rectangle.

The collection of all neighbourhoods of a point is called the [[neighbourhood system]] at the point.

===Neighbourhood of a set===

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then a '''neighbourhood''' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; that includes an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  It follows that a set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is a neighbourhood of all the points in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, it follows that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; [[iff]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The neighbourhood of a point is just a special case of this definition.

== In a metric space ==
[[File:Neighborhood illust3.svg|right|thumb|A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in the plane and a uniform neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[File:Epsilon Umgebung.svg|right|thumb|The epsilon neighbourhood of a number ''a'' on the real number line.]]
In a [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;M = (X, d)&lt;/math&gt;, a set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a '''neighbourhood''' of a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; if there exists an [[open ball]] with centre &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;B_r(p) = B(p;r) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,p) &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt;
is contained in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is called '''uniform neighbourhood''' of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a positive number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that for all elements &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;B_r(p) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,p) &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt;
is contained in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; the '''&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhood''' &lt;math&gt;S_r&lt;/math&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are at distance less than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the union of all the open balls of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; that are centred at a point in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt;S_r = \bigcup\limits_{p\in{}S}B_r(p).&lt;/math&gt;

It directly follows that an &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhood is a uniform neighbourhood, and that a set is a uniform neighbourhood if and only if it contains an &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhood for some value of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
[[File:Set of real numbers with epsilon-neighbourhood.svg|thumb|The set M is a neighbourhood of the number a, because there is an ε-neighbourhood of a which is a subset of M.]]
Given the set of [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual [[Euclidean metric]] and a subset &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; defined as
:&lt;math&gt;V:=\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} B\left(n\,;\,1/n \right),&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a neighbourhood for the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[natural number]]s, but is ''not'' a uniform neighbourhood of this set.

== Topology from neighbourhoods ==

The above definition is useful if the notion of [[open set]] is already defined. There is an alternative way to define a topology, by first defining the [[neighbourhood system]], and then open sets as those sets containing a neighbourhood of each of their points.

A neighbourhood system on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the assignment of a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] &lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt; (on the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) to each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, such that
# the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an element of each &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# each &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt; contains some &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that for each &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;N(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

One can show that both definitions are compatible, i.e. the topology obtained from the neighbourhood system defined using open sets is the original one, and vice versa when starting out from a neighbourhood system.

== Uniform neighbourhoods ==

In a [[uniform space]] &lt;math&gt;S = (X, \delta)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''uniform neighbourhood''' of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not [[closeness (mathematics)|close]] to &lt;math&gt;X \setminus V&lt;/math&gt;, that is there exists no [[entourage (topology)|entourage]] containing &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X \setminus V&lt;/math&gt;.

==Deleted neighbourhood==

A '''deleted neighbourhood''' of a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called a '''punctured neighbourhood''') is a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, without &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;(-1, 1) = \{y : -1 &lt; y &lt; 1\}&lt;/math&gt; is a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;p = 0&lt;/math&gt; in the [[real line]], so the set &lt;math&gt;(-1, 0) \cup (0, 1) = (-1, 1) \setminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a deleted neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Note that a deleted neighbourhood of a given point is not in fact a neighbourhood of the point. The concept of deleted neighbourhood occurs in the [[Limit of a function#Functions on topological spaces|definition of the limit of a function]].

An '''overlapping circles grid''' is a geometric pattern of [[tessellation|repeating]], overlapping [[circle]]s of equal [[radius|radii]] in [[two-dimensional space]]. Commonly, designs are based on circles centered on [[triangular lattice|triangles]] (with the simple, two circle form named ''[[vesica piscis]]'') or on the [[square lattice]] pattern of points.

Patterns of seven overlapping circles appear in historical artefacts from the 7th century BC onwards; they become a frequently used ornament in the [[Roman Empire]] period, and survive into medieval artistic traditions both in [[Islamic art]] ([[girih]] decorations) and in [[Gothic art]]. The name "Flower of Life" is given to the overlapping circles pattern in [[New Age]] publications. 

Of special interest is the [[six petal rosette]] derived from the "seven overlapping circles" pattern, also known as "Sun of the Alps" from its frequent use in alpine [[folk art]] in the 17th and 18th century.

|}

The [[triangular lattice]] form, with circle radii equal to their separation is called a '''seven overlapping circles grid'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/learn/for-educators/publications-for-educators/islamic-art-and-geometric-design Islamic Art and Geometric Design: Activities for Learning ]&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 6 circles intersecting at a point, with a 7th circle centered on that intersection.

Overlapping circles with similar geometrical constructions have been used infrequently in various of the [[decorative arts]] since ancient times. The pattern has found a wide range of usage in popular culture, in [[fashion]], [[jewelry]], [[tattoo]]s and decorative products.

===Cultural significance===
====Near East====
The oldest known occurrence of the "overlapping circles" pattern is dated to the 7th or 6th century BCE, 
found on the threshold of the palace of Assyrian king [[Aššur-bāni-apli]] in [[Dur Šarrukin]] (now in the [[Louvre]]).&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Inv.-Nr. [http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=24382 AO 19915].
Georges Perrot, Charles Chipiez, ''A History of Art in Chaldæa and Assyria'', vol. 1, London 1884, S. 240, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28072/28072-h/28072-h.htm (gutenberg.org)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The design becomes more widespread in the early centuries of the Common Era.
One early example are five patterns of 19 overlapping circles drawn on the granite columns at the [[Abydos, Egypt#Temples built|Temple of Osiris]] in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|FlowerofLife|Flower of life}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further five on column opposite the building. They are drawn in red [[ochre]] and some are very faint and difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref name="furlong2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Malcolm | last=Stewart|title=The "Flower of Life" and the Osirion – Facts are more interesting than Fantasy|url=http://www.davidfurlong.co.uk/egypttour_stewart.html |work=Egyptian Tour (David Furlong)|date=2008|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The patterns are [[graffiti]], and not found in natively Egyptian ornaments. They are mostly dated to the early centuries of the Christian Era&lt;ref name="furlong1"&gt;{{cite web |first=David | last=Furlong|title=The Osirion and the Flower of Life|url=http://www.davidfurlong.co.uk/egypttour_osirion.html|accessdate=November 8, 2015}} Furlong states that these engravings can date no earlier than 535 BCE and probably date to the 2nd and 4th century CE. His research is based on photographic evidence of Greek text, yet to be fully deciphered.  The text is seen alongside the designs and the position close to the top of columns, which are greater than 4 meters in height. 
Furlong suggests the Osirion was half filled with sand prior to the circles being drawn and therefore likely to have been well after the end of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
although medieval or even modern (early 20th century) origin cannot be ruled out with certainty, as the drawings are not mentioned in the extensive listings of graffiti at the temple compiled by [[Margaret Murray]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;{{cite book | first=Margaret Alice |last=Murray | title=The Osireion at Abydos London | date=1904 | page=35 | url=http://www.etana.org/node/666 | accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar patterns were sometimes used in England as [[apotropaic mark]]s to keep witches from entering buildings.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |title=Witches' marks: public asked to seek ancient scratchings in buildings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/31/witches-marks-historic-england-evil-spirits |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=October 31, 2016 |date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consecration crosses]] indicating points in churches anointed with holy water during a churches dedication also take the form of overlapping circles. 

{{Double image|right|Girih compass straightedge example.svg|150|Window Apartments of the Crown Prince.JPG|100|A [[girih]] pattern that can be drawn with [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straight edge]]|Window cage at [[Topkapı Palace]], using pattern}}
{{further|Girih}}
In [[Islamic art]], the pattern is one of several arrangements of circles (others being used for fourfold or fivefold designs) used to construct grids for [[Islamic geometric patterns]]. It is used to design patterns with 6- and 12-pointed stars as well as hexagons in the style called [[girih]]. The resulting patterns however characteristically conceal the construction grid, presenting instead a [[Islamic interlace patterns|design of interlaced strapwork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=22–23 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Patterns of seven overlapping circles are found on a Cypro-Archaic I cup of the 8th-7th century BC in Cyprus{{cn|date=March 2018}} and Roman mosaics, for example at [[Herod's Palace (Herodium)|Herod's palace]] in the 1st century BC. 
They are also found  in the Hindu temple at [[Prambanan]] in [[Java]].
The design is  found on one of the silver plaques of the Late Roman hoard of [[Kaiseraugst]] (discovered 1961).&lt;ref&gt;Hans Ulrich Instinsky: ''Der spätrömische Silberschatzfund von Kaiseraugst.'' Mainz 1971, plaque 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is later found as an ornament in [[Gothic architecture]], and still later in European [[folk art]] of the early modern period. 

High medieval examples include the [[Cosmati]] pavements in  [[Westminster Abbey]] (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pleiade.org/col_geal/aux_armes-symbolism-notes.html#note_5 ''The Cosmati Pavements in Westminster Abbey.''] Abgerufen am 14.&amp;nbsp;September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Leonardo da Vinci]] explicitly discussed the mathematical proportions of the design.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', foll. 307r–309v, 459r (dated between  1478 and 1519).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern usage ====
[[File:Flower of Life pendant (2).jpg|160px|thumb|[[#Progressions|19-circle with arcs]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Pendant]], silver, ⌀ 27&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;br /&gt;(commercial product, 2013)]]
The name "Flower of Life" is modern, associated with the [[New Age]] movement, and commonly attributed specifically to Drunvalo Melchizedek in his book ''The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life'' (1999).&lt;ref name="HTCSGM"&gt;{{cite book | title=How to Create Sacred Geometry Mandalas | first=Martha | last=Bartfeld | location=Santa Fe, NM  | publisher=Mandalart Creations | date=2005 | isbn=9780966228526 | oclc=70293628 | page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A New Kind of Science |author= Wolfram, Stephen |publisher= [[Wolfram Research|Wolfram Media, Inc.]] |publication-date= May 14, 2002|isbn=1-57955-008-8| pages=43 and 873–874 |url=https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-872d-text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=1079 |title= CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics, Second Edition |author= Weisstein, Eric W. |publisher= [[CRC Press]] |publication-date=2002 |isbn=1420035223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_XKBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern and modern name have propagated into wide range of usage in popular culture, in fashion, jewelry, tattoos and decorative products.
The pattern in [[quilting]] has been called '''diamond wedding ring''' or ''triangle wedding ring'' to contrast it from the [[#Square_grid_of_overlapping_circles|square pattern]].
Besides an occasional use in fashion,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite news |url=http://hauteliving.com/2013/05/zaeem-jamal-launches-new-collection-on-board-a-private-yacht-in-dubai-marina/358184/ |title=Zaeem Jamal Launches New Collection on Board a Private Yacht in Dubai Marina |last=Zaman |first=Sana |publisher=[[Haute Living]] |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also used in the decorative arts. For example, the album ''[[Sempiternal (album)|Sempiternal]]'' (2013) by [[Bring Me the Horizon]] uses the [[#Progressions|61 overlapping circles grid]] as the main feature of its album cover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/02/22/bring-me-the-horizon-this-album-needs-to-be-the-one-that-lasts-forever/ |title=Bring Me The Horizon: This album needs to be the one that lasts forever |last=Cooper |first=Ed |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=February 25, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023041236/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/02/22/bring-me-the-horizon-this-album-needs-to-be-the-one-that-lasts-forever/ |archivedate=October 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the album ''[[A Head Full of Dreams]]'' (2015) by [[Coldplay]] features the 19 overlapping circles grid as the central part of its album cover. Teaser posters illustrating the cover art to ''A Head Full of Dreams'' were widely displayed on the [[London Underground]] in the last week of October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/coldplay-new-album-beyonce-and-noel-gallagher-to-feature-on-a-head-full-of-dreams-a6723696.html |title=Coldplay new album: Beyonce and Noel Gallagher to feature on A Head Full of Dreams |last=Denham  |first=Jess |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=November 6, 2015 |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Sun of the Alps" ([[Italian language|Italian]] ''Sole delle Alpi'') symbol has been used as the emblem of  [[Padanian nationalism]] in northern Italy since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Lega Nord |title=Il significato del simbolo del Sole delle Alpi |url=http://www.prov-varese.leganord.org/doc/solealpi.htm |access-date=December 1, 2014 |language=it |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112135050/http://www.prov-varese.leganord.org/doc/solealpi.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It resembles a pattern often found in that area on buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ivano Dorboló|title=The church of S.Egidio and the Sun of the Alps symbol|date=June 6, 2010|url=http://www.matajur.it/Sito%20English/21-S.Egidio/S.Egidio.htm|website=Storia di Confine – Valli di Natisone|access-date=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===
Martha Bartfeld, author of geometric art tutorial books, described her independent discovery of the design in 1968. Her original definition said, "This design consists of circles having a 1-[inch] radius, with each point of intersection serving as a new center. The design can be expanded ''ad infinitum'' depending upon the number of times the odd-numbered points are marked off."  

The pattern figure can be drawn by [[pen]] and [[compass (drafting)|compass]], by creating multiple series of interlinking circles of the same diameter touching the previous circle's center. The second circle is centered at any point on the first circle. All following circles are centered on the intersection of two other circles.

==== Progressions====
The pattern can be extended outwards in concentric hexagonal rings of circles, as shown. The first row shows rings of circles. The second row shows a three-dimensional interpretation of a set of ''n''×''n''×''n'' cube of spheres viewed from a diagonal axis. The third row shows the pattern completed with partial circle arcs within a set of completed circles.

Expanding sets have 1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, etc. circles, and continuing ever larger hexagonal rings of circles. The number of circles is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-(''n''-1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 3''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-3''n''+1 = 3''n''(''n''-1)+1.

These overlapping circles can also be seen as a projection of an ''n''-unit [[cube]] of spheres in 3-dimensional space, viewed on the diagonal axis. There are more spheres than circles because some are overlapping in 2 dimensions.

=== Other variations===
Another [[triangular lattice]] form is common, with circle separation as the [[square root]] of 3 times their radii. Richard Kershner showed in 1939 that no [[Disk covering problem|arrangement of circles can cover the plane]] more efficiently than this hexagonal lattice arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;''Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups'', John Conway, Neil J. A. Sloane, Chapter 2, section 1.1, Covering space with overlapping circle. pp. 31-32. Figure 2.1 Covering the plane with circles (b) The more efficient or thinner covering in a hexagonal lattice. [https://books.google.com/books?id=upYwZ6cQumoC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=overlapping+circles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP8N_0_OLKAhWK4iYKHeK4DeoQ6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=overlapping%20circles&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two offset copies of this circle pattern makes a [[rhombic tiling]] pattern, while three copies make the original triangular pattern.

The center [[lens (geometry)|lens]] of the 2-circle figure is called a [[Vesica piscis]], from [[Euclid]]. Two circles are also called [[Villarceau circles]] as a plane intersection of a torus. The areas inside one circle and outside the other circle is called a [[Lune (mathematics)#Plane geometry|lune]].

The 3-circle figure resembles a depiction of [[Borromean rings#History|borromean rings]] and is used in [[Intersection (set theory)|3-set]] theory [[Venn diagram]]s. Its interior makes a [[unicursal curve|unicursal]] path called a [[triquetra]]. The center of the 3-circle figure is called a [[reuleaux triangle]].

The [[square lattice]] form can be seen with circles that line up horizontally and vertically, while intersecting on their diagonals. The pattern appears slightly different when rotated on its diagonal, also called a ''centered square lattice'' form because it can be seen as two square lattices with each centered on the gaps of the other.

'''Pi in the Sky''' was an experimental, aerial art display where airplanes spelled out [[pi]] to decimal 1,000 places in the sky over the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  The display took place on September 12, 2012. It was then displayed again in [[Austin]] on March 13, 2014, during the [[SXSW]] festival, at which time it was said to be the largest art piece ever displayed in the state of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2014/03/14/behold-actual-pi-in-the-sky-on-pi-day/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57512588-1/planes-write-out-pi-over-the-skies-of-san-francisco-bay-area/ Planes write out pi over the skies of San Francisco Bay Area | Crave - CNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berkeleyside1"&gt;[http://www.berkeleyside.com/tag/ishky/ ISHKY | Berkeleyside&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/74161d7a-f7b7-11e1-8c9d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz27pHHCrus Barometer: innovation - FT.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zero1biennial1"&gt;[http://www.zero1biennial.org/ishky ISHKY | 2012 ZERO1 Biennial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1256096--pi-in-the-sky-skywriters-draw-first-1-000-digits-of-pi Pi in the Sky: Skywriters draw first 1,000 digits of pi - thestar.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/pi-in-the-sky-mathematical-skywriting-of-the-first-thousand-digits-of-pi/ Pi in the Sky: Skywriting of the first thousand digits of Pi in SF | Digital Trends&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft used were 1979 [[Grumman American AA-5|Grumman AA-5B Tigers]], small, single-engined planes provided by the company AirSign Aerial Advertising, based in Williston, FL. The numbers were produced by spraying natural, burnt-off canola oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solon |first=Olivia |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/13/pi-in-the-sky |title=First 1,000 digits of pi written in the sky over San Francisco (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dissipated, causing no environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfstation.com/pi-in-the-sky-e1708242 |title=Pi In The Sky |publisher=SF Station |date=2012-09-16 |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202033811/http://www.sfstation.com/pi-in-the-sky-e1708242 |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition began in the skies over [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], then continued over [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], San Francisco, [[San Bruno, California|San Bruno]], [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], and [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]]. The planes deliberately flew over the headquarters of [[NASA Ames]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[Stanford University]], [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MacManus, Christopher |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57512588-1/planes-write-out-pi-over-the-skies-of-san-francisco-bay-area/ |title=Planes write out pi over the skies of San Francisco Bay Area &amp;#124; Crave - CNET |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 display was part of the 2012 ZERO1 Biennial, was conceived by artist ISHKY, and involved a company called [[Stamen Design]].&lt;ref name="laughingsquid1"/&gt; ZERO1 is an art-technology network based in San Jose.

The 2014 display was part of an ongoing project, directed by artist ISHKY (Ben Davis), and again involved AirSign Aerial Advertising. The 2014 display quickly gained publicity making it the number 2 top trending hashtag on Twitter during the display and within 24 hours it was shared and viewed a little over six million times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/pi-day-celebrations-kick-off-with-a-pi-in-the-sky/ Pi Day celebrations kick off with a 'pi in the sky' - CNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airsign.com/pi-in-the-sky/ Pi In The Sky - Skywriting by AirSign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/44102-pi-day-skyriting-over-austin.html Pi in the Sky: Long String of Digits Written Over Austin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/austin-skies-to-be-stuffed-with-pi-this-evening/nfCK3/ Austin skies to be stuffed with pi this evening | www.statesman.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kxan.com/2014/03/13/pi-in-the-sky-display-had-people-running-for-their-camera/ ‘Pi in the sky’ display had people running for their camera | KXAN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7496">'''Quantum economics''' is an emerging research field which applies methods and ideas from [[quantum physics]] to the field of [[economics]]. It is motivated by the belief that economic processes such as financial transactions have much in common with quantum processes. It draws on techniques from the related areas of [[quantum finance]] and [[quantum cognition]], and can be viewed as a sub-field of what [[Alexander Wendt]] and others have called "quantum social science".&lt;ref name="wendtbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wendt |first= Alexander |date= 2015 |title= Quantum Mind and Social Science: Unifying Physical and Social Ontology |publisher= Cambridge University Press | isbn= 978-1107082540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
An early proponent of this approach was the Pakistani mathematician [[Asghar Qadir]]. In his 1978 paper ''Quantum Economics'', he argued that the formalism of [[quantum mechanics]] is the best mathematical framework for modeling situations where "consumer behavior depends on infinitely many factors and that the consumer is not aware of any preference until the matter is brought up."&lt;ref name="qadirpaper"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Qadir | first= Asghar |date=1978 |title= Quantum Economics |journal= Pakistan Economic and Social Review |volume=16 | issue=3/4 |pages=117–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that, like particles in quantum mechanics, "the individual as an entity ... can be thought of as a point in a [[Hilbert space]]."

Qadir's paper received little attention. However, during the 1990s, workers in the field of [[quantum cognition]] indeed showed that many aspects of human decision-making, including those involved in economic decisions, seemed to follow a kind of quantum logic.&lt;ref name="aertspaper"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aerts | first= D. | last2=Aerts | first2= S. | date=1994 |title= Applications of quantum statistics in psychological studies of decision processes |journal= Foundations of Science |volume=1 |pages=85–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, researchers such as economist [[Martin Shubik]], physicist Martin Schaden and social scientist Emmanuel Haven were beginning to use the quantum formalism to model the uncertainty of stock markets.&lt;ref name="shubikpaper"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shubik | first= M. | date=1999 |title= Quantum economics, uncertainty and the optimal grid size |journal= Economics Letters |volume=64 | issue=3 | pages=277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schaden, Martin | title=Quantum Finance | publisher=Physica A|year= 2002 | volume=316 |journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications |pages=511–538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03784371/2002/00000304/00000003/art00568|author=Haven, Emmanuel |title=A discussion on embedding the Black–Scholes option pricing model in a quantum physics setting |publisher=Physica A|year= 2002 |volume=304 |journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications |pages=507–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2007 book ''Quantum Finance: Path Integrals and Hamiltonians for Options and Interest Rates'', Belal E. Baaquie showed how methods from quantum physics could be applied to things like the pricing of [[Option (finance)|financial options]]. However he wrote that the ‘’larger question of applying the formalism and insights of (quantum) physics to economics, and which forms a part of the larger subject of econophysics, is left for future research.’’&lt;ref name="baaquiebook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Baaquie |first= Belal E. |date= 2007 | title= Quantum Finance: Path Integrals and Hamiltonians for Options and Interest Rates |publisher= Cambridge University Press | isbn= 978-0521714785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2013 book ''Quantum Social Science'', Emmanuel Haven and Andrei Khrennikov extended Baaquie’s work in finance, and showed how quantum techniques could be used to model a number of issues in economics more broadly, such as [[arbitrage]] and the [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] theory of [[George Soros]].&lt;ref name="havenbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Haven |first= Emmanuel E. | last2= Khrennikov | first2= Andrei | date= 2013 | title= Quantum Social Science |publisher= Cambridge University Press | isbn= 978-1107012820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 paper&lt;ref name="orrellpaper"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Orrell | first= David | date=2016 |title= A Quantum Theory of Money and Value |journal= Economic Thought |volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=19–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and book&lt;ref name=orrellbook&gt;{{cite book |last= Orrell |first= David | last2= Chlupatý |first2= Roman | date= 2016|title= The Evolution of Money |publisher= Columbia University Press | pages = 171–175 | isbn= 978-0231173728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teesearticle"&gt;{{cite news | last= Teese |first= Colin |date=11 February 2017 |title=Money and quantum physics |magazine=[[News Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the latter co-authored with journalist Roman Chlupatý), the mathematician [[David Orrell]] proposed a quantum theory of money and value, which states that money has dualistic, quantum properties because of the way that it merges the exact concept of number with the fuzzy concept of value. His 2018 book ''Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money'' described a quantum economics which combined this view of money with the insights of quantum finance and quantum social science.&lt;ref name=orrellbook2&gt;{{cite book |last= Orrell |first= David | date= 2018|title=  Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money |publisher= Icon Books | isbn= 978-1785783999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cleggreview"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://popsciencebooks.blogspot.com/2018/07/quantum-economics-david-orrell.html | last= Clegg |first= Brian |date= 5 July 2018 |title=Quantum Economics - David Orrell | access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Just as [[quantum physics]] differs in fundamental ways from [[classical physics]], quantum economics differs from [[neoclassical economics]] in a number of key respects.

Neoclassical economics is based on [[expected utility theory]], which combines [[utility theory]] to model people’s [[Preference (economics)|preferences]], and [[probability theory]] to model expectations under uncertainty. However the field of [[quantum cognition]] calls these assumptions into question, since people don’t necessarily have fixed preferences, or base their decisions on probability theory. Many of the findings of [[behavioral economics]] are inconsistent with [[classical logic]], but agree with quantum decision theory of the sort assumed in quantum economics.&lt;ref name=wendtbook /&gt;

In financial applications, neoclassical economics is associated with the [[efficient market theory]]. As Haven and Khrennikov show, this condition has come under increasing question since the financial crisis, but can easily be relaxed using a quantum formalism.&lt;ref name=havenbook /&gt;

Neoclassical economics assumes that people act independently while making economic decisions. Quantum economics notes that financial actors are part of an entangled system, as in [[quantum game theory]].

Quantum economics also stresses the importance of financial transactions and in particular the role of money as an active force in the economy, for example in the way that it binds debtors and creditors.&lt;ref name=orrellbook /&gt; Quantum economics can therefore be viewed as an alternative to neoclassical economics which begins from a different set of assumptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10023">'''Quantum illumination''' is a paradigm that uses [[quantum entanglement]] beneficially even if the original entanglement is completely destroyed by a lossy and noisy environment.&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Communications: Broken quantum links still work'', [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] '''499''', 129 (2013) ([http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v499/n7457/full/499129a.html])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fragility of entanglement no bar to quantum secrets'', [[New Scientist]] July 17, 2013([https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23882-fragility-of-entanglement-no-bar-to-quantum-secrets.html#.Uo15S5GzweY])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Many [[quantum information]] applications, such as [[quantum teleportation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|C. H. Bennett]], [[Gilles Brassard|G. Brassard]], [[Claude Crépeau|C. Crépeau]], [[Richard Jozsa|R. Jozsa]], [[Asher Peres|A. Peres]], [[William Wootters|W. K. Wootters]], ''Teleporting an Unknown Quantum State via Dual Classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Channels'', [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''70''', 1895-1899 (1993) ([http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.46.9405 online])&lt;/ref&gt; [[quantum error correction]], and [[superdense coding]], rely on entanglement. However, entanglement is a fragile quantum property between particles and can be easily destroyed by loss and noise arising from interaction with the environment, leading to  [[quantum decoherence]]. Entanglement is therefore considered very hard to use in lossy and noisy environment.

Lloyd, Shapiro and collaborators showed that even though entanglement itself may not survive, the residual correlation between the two initially entangled systems remains much higher than any initial classical states can provide. This implies that the use of entanglement should not be dismissed in entanglement-breaking scenarios.

Quantum illumination takes advantage of this stronger-than-classical residual correlations between two systems to achieve a performance enhancement over all schemes based on transmitting classical states with comparable power levels. Quantum illumination is particularly useful in extremely lossy and noisy situations.

== History ==

=== Theory ===
The concept of quantum illumination was first introduced by [[Seth Lloyd]] and collaborators at [[MIT]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Lloyd, ''Enhanced Sensitivity of Photodetection via Quantum Illumination'', [[Science (journal)|Science]] '''321''', 1463-1465 (2008) ([http://www.sciencemag.org/content/321/5895/1463.short])]); Si-Hui Tan, Baris I. Erkmen, Vittorio Giovannetti, Saikat Guha, [[Seth Lloyd]], Lorenzo Maccone, Stefano Pirandola, and [[Jeffrey Shapiro|Jeffrey H. Shapiro]], ''Quantum Illumination with Gaussian States'', [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''101''', 253601 (2008)([https://archive.is/20131121033909/http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v101/i25/e253601])&lt;/ref&gt; An experimentally feasible scheme for quantum illumination can be realized using Gaussian states&lt;ref&gt;Christian Weedbrook, Stefano Pirandola, Raul Garcia-Patron, Nicolas J. Cerf, Timothy C. Ralph, Jeffrey H. Shapiro, and Seth Lloyd, ''Gaussian Quantum Information'', [[Rev. Mod. Phys.]] '''84''', 621 (2012) ([http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.84.621])&lt;/ref&gt; as demonstrated by [[Jeffrey Shapiro]] and collaborators&lt;ref name=GaussQI&gt;Si-Hui Tan, Baris I. Erkmen, Vittorio Giovannetti, Saikat Guha, [[Seth Lloyd]], Lorenzo Maccone, Stefano Pirandola, and [[Jeffrey Shapiro|Jeffrey H. Shapiro]], ''Quantum Illumination with Gaussian States'', [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''101''', 253601 (2008)([https://archive.is/20131121033909/http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v101/i25/e253601])&lt;/ref&gt; from the same institute. 

The basic setup of quantum illumination is target detection. Here the sender prepares two entangled systems, called signal and idler. The idler is retained while the signal is sent to probe the presence of a low-reflectivity object in a region with bright background noise. The reflection from the object is then combined with the retained idler system in a joint quantum measurement providing two possible outcomes: object present or object absent. More precisely, the probing process is repeated many times so that many pairs of signal-idler systems are collected at the receiver for the joint quantum detection.
The advantage of the scheme is evident at low energies where the mean number of photons in each signal system is very low (of the order of one photon or less). In this case, at fixed low energy, the probability of success in detecting a target has a remarkable improvement with respect to classical detection schemes, where entanglement is not used and signal systems are prepared in coherent states (technically, there is a 6dB improvement in the error exponent &lt;ref name=GaussQI/&gt;). A key feature of quantum illumination is that the entanglement between the idler system and the reflected signal system is completely lost in the process. However, the residual quantum correlations between these two systems (idler-reflected signal) remain so strong that they could only be created by the presence of entanglement in the initial systems (idler-signal). Because the reflected signal is quantum-correlated with the retained idler system, it can be distinguished among all the uncorrelated background thermal photons that are also received by the detector. Because of this quantum labeling of the systems, the detection of quantum illumination is very efficient. 


In 2009, a secure communication scheme based on quantum illumination&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Shapiro, ''Defeating passive eavesdropping using quantum illumination'', [[Phys. Rev. A]] '''80''', 022320 (2009) ([https://archive.is/20131122200650/http://pra.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v80/i2/e022320])&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed. This scheme is a variant of the quantum cryptographic protocols based on continuous variables and two-way quantum communication introduced by Stefano Pirandola, [[Seth Lloyd]] and collaborators&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Pirandola, Stefano Mancini, [[Samuel L. Braunstein]], and Seth Lloyd, ''Continuous-variable quantum cryptography using two-way quantum communication'', [[Nat. Phys.]] '''4''', 726-730 (2008)([http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v4/n9/full/nphys1018.html])&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008. In 2015, an international collaboration coordinated by Stefano Pirandola &lt;ref&gt;Shabir Barzanjeh, Saikat Guha, Christian Weedbrook, David Vitali, Jeffrey H. Shapiro, and Stefano Pirandola, ''Microwave Quantum Illumination'', [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''114''', 080503 (2015)([http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.080503])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Mechanics Could Improve Radar'', Physics '''8''', 18 (2015)([http://physics.aps.org/articles/v8/18])&lt;/ref&gt; extended the protocol of quantum illumination to the microwave frequencies, thus providing the first theoretical prototype of [[quantum radar]]. In 2017, the optimum receiver design was proposed by Quntao Zhuang, Zheshen Zhang, and [[Jeffrey Shapiro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhuang|first=Quntao|last2=Zhang|first2=Zheshen|last3=Shapiro|first3=Jeffrey H.|date=2017-01-27|title=Optimum Mixed-State Discrimination for Noisy Entanglement-Enhanced Sensing|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.040801|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=118|issue=4|pages=040801|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.040801|arxiv=1609.01968|bibcode=2017PhRvL.118d0801Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Quantum illumination has also been extended to the scenario of [[Rayleigh fading|target fading]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhuang|first=Quntao|last2=Zhang|first2=Zheshen|last3=Shapiro|first3=Jeffrey H.|date=2017-08-15|title=Quantum illumination for enhanced detection of Rayleigh-fading targets|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.020302|journal=Physical Review A|volume=96|issue=2|pages=020302|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.96.020302|arxiv=1706.05561|bibcode=2017PhRvA..96b0302Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Experiment ===
In 2013, Lopaeva ''et al.'' exploited photon number correlations, instead of entanglement, in a sub-optimal target detection experiment.&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Lopaeva, I. Ruo Berchera, I. P. Degiovanni, S. Olivares, G. Brida, and M. Genovese, ''Experimental Realization of Quantum Illumination'', [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''110''', 153603 (2013)([https://archive.is/20131121033837/http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v110/i15/e153603])&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate the benefit of [[quantum entanglement]], in 2013 Zhang ''et al.'' reported a secure communication experiment based on quantum illumination and demonstrated for the first time that entanglement can enable a substantial performance advantage in the presence of [[quantum decoherence]].&lt;ref&gt;Zheshen Zhang, Maria Tengner, Tian Zhong, Franco N.C. Wong, and Jeffrey H. Shapiro, ''Entanglement's benefit survives an entanglement-breaking channel'', [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''111''', 010501 (2013) ([http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.010501])&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Zhang ''et al.'' applied quantum illumination in sensing and showed that employing entanglement can yield a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]] than the optimal classical scheme can provide, even though the highly lossy and noisy environment completely destroys the initial entanglement.&lt;ref&gt;Zheshen Zhang, Sara Mouradian, Franco N.C. Wong, and Jeffrey H. Shapiro, ''Entanglement-enhanced sensing in a lossy and noisy environment'', [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''114''', 110506 (2015) ([https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.110506])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum sensor's advantages survive entanglement breakdown'', MIT News, 9 March (2015), ([http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/quantum-sensor-survives-entanglement-breakdown-0309])&lt;/ref&gt; This sensing experiment thus proved the original theoretical proposals of quantum illumination.

== Applications ==
Potential applications of quantum illumination include target detection in high background noise environments, but also ultra-sensitive [[biological imaging]] and [[sensor|sensing]], and [[secure communication]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1241">In mathematics, in particular in [[functional analysis]], the '''Rademacher system''', named after [[Hans Rademacher]], is an [[Complete orthogonal system # Incomplete orthogonal sets|incomplete orthogonal system]] of functions on the [[unit interval]] of the following form:

: &lt;math&gt;\{ t \mapsto r_{n}(t)=\sgn ( \sin 2^{n+1} \pi t ) ; t \in [0,1], n \in \N \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Rademacher system is stochastically independent, and is closely related to the [[Walsh transform|Walsh]] system. Specifically, the [[Walsh transform|Walsh system]] can be constructed as a product of Rademacher functions.

In [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], a field of [[computer science]], '''random-access Turing machines''' are an extension of [[Turing machine]]s used to speak about small complexity classes, especially for classes using logarithmic time, like [[DLOGTIME]] and the [[LH (complexity)|Logarithmic Hierarchy]].

== Definition ==

On a random-access Turing machine, there is a special ''pointer'' tape of logarithmic space accepting a binary vocabulary. The Turing machine has a special state such that when the binary number on the ''pointer'' tape is 'p', the Turing machine will write on the working tape the  ''p''th symbol of the input.

This lets the Turing machine read any letter of the input without taking time to move over the entire input.  This is mandatory for complexity classes using less than linear time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5124">{{distinguish|Ring (mathematics)}}
In [[mathematics]], there are two different notions of a '''ring of sets''', both referring to certain families of sets.

In [[order theory]], a nonempty [[family of sets]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ring (of sets) if it is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]].&lt;ref name="b37"&gt;{{citation

 | mr = 1546000
 | pages = 443–454
 | title = Rings of sets
 | volume = 3
 | year = 1937}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the following two statements are true for all sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;,
#&lt;math&gt;A,B\in\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \cup B \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; and
#&lt;math&gt;A,B\in\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \cap B \in \mathcal{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[measure theory]], a nonempty family of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ring (of sets) if it is closed under union and [[relative complement]] (set-theoretic difference).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Measure Theory and Integration|first=Gar|last=De Barra|publisher=Horwood Publishing|year= 2003|isbn=9781904275046|page=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the following two statements are true for all sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;,
#&lt;math&gt;A,B\in\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \cup B \in \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; and
#&lt;math&gt;A,B\in\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B \in \mathcal{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies that a ring in the measure-theoretic sense always contains the [[empty set]]. Furthermore, for all sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;A\cap B=A\setminus(A\setminus B),&lt;/math&gt;
which shows that a family of sets closed under relative complement is also closed under intersection, so that a ring in the measure-theoretic sense is also a ring in the order-theoretic sense.

==Examples==
If ''X'' is any set, then the [[power set]] of ''X'' (the family of all subsets of ''X'') forms a ring of sets in either sense.

If (''X'',≤) is a [[partially ordered set]], then its [[upper set]]s (the subsets of ''X'' with the additional property that if ''x'' belongs to an upper set ''U'' and ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'', then ''y'' must also belong to ''U'') are closed under both intersections and unions. However, in general it will not be closed under differences of sets.

The [[open set]]s and [[closed set]]s of any [[topological space]] are closed under both unions and intersections.&lt;ref name="b37"/&gt;

On the real line '''R''', the family of sets consisting of the empty set and all finite unions of intervals of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;(&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a'', ''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''a'',''b'' in '''R''' is a ring in the measure-theoretic sense. 

If ''T'' is any transformation defined on a space, then the sets that are mapped into themselves by ''T'' are closed under both unions and intersections.&lt;ref name="b37"/&gt;

If two rings of sets are both defined on the same elements, then the sets that belong to both rings themselves form a ring of sets.&lt;ref name="b37"/&gt;

==Related structures==
A ring of sets in the order-theoretic sense forms a [[distributive lattice]] in which the intersection and union operations correspond to the lattice's [[meet and join]] operations, respectively. Conversely, every distributive lattice is isomorphic to a ring of sets; in the case of [[finite set|finite]] distributive lattices, this is [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] and the sets may be taken as the lower sets of a partially ordered set.&lt;ref name="b37"/&gt; 

A family of sets closed under union and relative complement is also closed under [[symmetric difference]] and intersection. Conversely, every family of sets closed under both symmetric difference and intersection is also closed under union and relative complement. This is due to the identities
#&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = (A\, \triangle\, B)\, \triangle\, (A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt; and
#&lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A\, \triangle\, (A \cap B).&lt;/math&gt;
Symmetric difference and intersection together give a ring in the measure-theoretic sense the structure of a [[boolean ring]].

A [[field of sets|field]] of subsets of ''X'' is a ring that contains ''X'' and is closed under relative complement. Every field, and so also every [[σ-algebra]], is a ring of sets in the measure theory sense.

A [[semiring|semi-ring]] (of sets) is a family of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; with the properties
#&lt;math&gt;\emptyset \in \mathcal{S},&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A, B \in \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \cap B \in \mathcal{S},&lt;/math&gt; and
#&lt;math&gt;A, B \in \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = \bigcup_{i=1}^nC_i&lt;/math&gt; for some disjoint &lt;math&gt; C_1,\dots,C_n \in \mathcal{S}.&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly, every ring (in the measure theory sense) is a semi-ring.
 
A semi-field of subsets of ''X'' is a semi-ring that contains ''X''.

==Model==

The Sethi advertising model or simply the Sethi model provides a sales-advertising dynamics in the form of the following [[stochastic differential equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt; dX_t =\left(rU_t\sqrt{1-X_t} - \delta X_t\right)\,dt+\sigma(X_t)\,dz_t, \qquad X_0=x&lt;/math&gt;.

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;X_t&lt;/math&gt; is the market share at  time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;U_t&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of advertising at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of the effectiveness of advertising
*  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the decay constant
*  &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X_t)&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion coefficient
*  &lt;math&gt;z_t&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wiener process]] (Standard [[Brownian motion]]); &lt;math&gt;dz_t&lt;/math&gt; is known as [[White noise]].

===Explanation===

The rate of change in sales depend on three effects: response to advertising that acts positively on the unsold portion of the market via &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the loss due to forgetting or possibly due to competitive factors that act negatively on the sold portion of the market via &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and a random effect using a diffusion or White noise term that can go either way.

*  The coefficient &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of the effectiveness of advertising innovation.
*  The coefficient &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the decay constant.
*  The square-root term brings in the so-called word-of-mouth effect at least at low sales levels.&lt;ref name="sethi83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorger89" /&gt;
*  The diffusion term &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X_t)dz_t&lt;/math&gt; brings in the random effect.

===Example of an optimal advertising problem===

Subject to the Sethi model above with the initial market share &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, consider the following objective function:

: &lt;math&gt;V(x) = \max_{U_t \geq 0} \;E\left[ \int_0^\infty e^{-\rho t}(\pi X_t-U_t^2)\,dt\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; denotes the sales revenue corresponding to the total market, i.e., when &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the discount rate.

The function &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the value function for this problem, and it is shown to be&lt;ref name="Sethi00"&gt;Sethi, S.P., Thompson, G.L. (2000). ''Optimal Control Theory: Applications to Management Science and Economics''. Second Edition. Springer. {{isbn|0-387-28092-8}} and {{isbn|0-7923-8608-6}}, pp. 352-355. Slides are available at http://www.utdallas.edu/~sethi/OPRE7320presentation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
V(x)=\bar\lambda x+ \frac{\bar\lambda^2 r^2}{4
\rho},
&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar\lambda=\frac{\sqrt{(\rho+\delta)^2+r^2
\pi}-(\rho+\delta)}{r^2/2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[optimal control]] for this problem is&lt;ref name="Sethi00" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; U^*_t = u^*(X_t)=\frac{r\bar\lambda \sqrt{1-\ X_t}}{2} = \begin{cases}
{} &gt; \bar{u} &amp; \text{if } X_t &lt; \bar{x}, \\
{} = \bar{u} &amp; \text{if } X_t = \bar{x}, \\
{} &lt; \bar{u} &amp; \text{if } X_t &gt; \bar{x},
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar x= \frac{r^2 \bar\lambda /2}{r^2 \bar\lambda /2+\delta}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar u=\frac{r\bar\lambda \sqrt{1-\bar x}}{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">[[File:ClaudeShannon MFO3807.jpg|thumb|200px|Claude Shannon]]
The '''Shannon number''', named after [[Claude Shannon]], is a conservative lower bound (not an estimate) of the [[Game complexity|game-tree complexity]] of [[chess]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;, based on an average of about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; possibilities for a pair of moves consisting of a move for White followed by one for Black, and a typical game lasting about 40 such pairs of moves. 

== Shannon's calculation ==

Shannon showed a calculation for the lower bound of the game-tree complexity of chess, resulting in about 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; possible games, to demonstrate the impracticality of [[solving chess]] by [[brute force search|brute force]], in his 1950 paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Claude Shannon]] | title = Programming a Computer for Playing Chess | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 41 | issue = 314 | year = 1950 | url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This influential paper introduced the field of [[computer chess]].)

Shannon also estimated the number of possible positions, "of the general order of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{64!}{32!{8!}^2{2!}^6}&lt;/math&gt;, or roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;".  This includes some illegal positions (e.g., pawns on the first rank, both kings in check) and excludes legal positions following captures and promotions.  Taking these into account, [[Victor Allis]] calculated an upper bound of 5×10&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; for the number of positions, and estimated the true number to be about 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Victor Allis]] | year = 1994 | title = Searching for Solutions in Games and Artificial Intelligence | publisher = Ph.D. Thesis, University of Limburg, Maastricht, The Netherlands | isbn = 90-900748-8-0 | url = http://fragrieu.free.fr/SearchingForSolutions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = John's Chess Playground | author = John Tromp | year = 2010 | url = https://tromp.github.io/chess/chess.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve that estimate, by proving an upper bound of only 2&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;, which is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;46.7&lt;/sup&gt; and showing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = S. Steinerberger | year = 2014 | title =  International Journal of Game Theory | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00182-014-0453-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; an upper bound 2×10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; in the absence of promotions.

Allis also estimated the game-tree complexity to be at least 10&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;, "based on an average branching factor of 35 and an average game length of 80". As a comparison, the [[Observable universe#Matter content|number of atoms in the observable universe]], to which it is often compared, is roughly estimated to be 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;.

After each player has moved 5 times there are 69,352,859,712,417 possible games that could have been played.

== Number of sensible chess games ==
As a comparison to the Shannon number, if chess is analyzed for the number of "sensible" games that can be played (not counting ridiculous or obvious game-losing moves such as moving a queen to be immediately captured by a pawn without compensation), then the result is closer to around 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; games. This is based on having a choice of about thirty sensible moves at each ply (half a move), and a game length of 80 ply (40 moves).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km024eldY1A "How many chess games are possible?"] Dr. James Grime talking about the Shannon Number and other chess stuff (films by Brady Haran).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16970">'''Stochastic computing''' is a collection of techniques that represent continuous values by streams of random bits. Complex computations can then be computed by simple bit-wise operations on the streams. Stochastic computing is distinct from the study of [[randomized algorithm]]s.

== Motivation and a simple example ==

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;p,q \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is given, and we wish to compute &lt;math&gt;p \times q&lt;/math&gt;. Stochastic computing performs this operation using probability instead of arithmetic.

Specifically, suppose that there are two random, independent bit streams called ''stochastic number''s (i.e. [[Bernoulli process]]es), where the probability of a one in the first stream is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and the probability in the second stream is &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. We can take the [[Logical and#Applications in computer programming|logical AND]] of the two streams.

The probability of a one in the output stream is &lt;math&gt;pq&lt;/math&gt;.  By observing enough output bits and measuring the frequency of ones, it is possible to estimate &lt;math&gt;pq&lt;/math&gt; to arbitrary accuracy.

The operation above converts a fairly complicated computation (multiplication of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;) into a series of very simple operations (evaluation of &lt;math&gt;a_i \land b_i&lt;/math&gt;) on random bits.

More generally speaking, stochastic computing represents numbers as streams of random bits and reconstructs numbers by calculating frequencies.  The computations are performed on the streams and translate complicated operations on &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; into simple operations on their stream representations.  (Because of the method of reconstruction, devices that perform these operations are sometimes called stochastic averaging processors.)  In modern terms, stochastic computing can be viewed as an interpretation of calculations in probabilistic terms, which are then evaluated with a [[Gibbs sampling|Gibbs sampler]]. It can also be interpreted as a hybrid [[Analog computer|analog]]/[[Computer|digital]] computer.

took place in 1978; active research in the area dwindled over the next
few years.

Although stochastic computing declined as a general method of
computing, it has shown promise in several applications.  Research has
traditionally focused on certain tasks in machine learning and
control.&lt;ref&gt;

== Strengths and weaknesses ==

Although stochastic computing was a historical failure, it may still remain relevant for
solving certain problems.  To understand when it remains relevant, it is useful to
compare stochastic computing with more traditional methods of digital computing.

=== Strengths ===
Suppose we wish to multiply
two numbers each with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bits of precision.
Using the typical [[Multiplication_algorithm#Long_multiplication|long
multiplication]] method, we need to perform
&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; operations.  With stochastic computing, we can
AND together any number of bits and the expected value will always
be correct.  (However, with a small number of samples the variance will
render the actual result highly inaccurate).

Moreover, the underlying operations in a digital multiplier are
[[Adder (electronics)#Full adder|full adders]], whereas a stochastic
computer only requires an [[And gate|AND gate]].  Additionally,
a digital multiplier would naively require &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; input wires,
whereas a stochastic multiplier would only require 2 input wires{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.
(If the digital multiplier serialized its output, however, it would also
require only 2 input wires.)

Additionally, stochastic computing is robust against noise; if a few
bits in a stream are flipped, those errors will have no significant impact
on the solution.

Furthermore, stochastic computing elements can tolerate skew in the arrival time of the inputs.
Circuits work properly even when the inputs are misaligned temporally. As a result, stochastic
systems can be designed to work with inexpensive locally generated clocks instead of using a global clock and 
an expensive clock distribution network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Najafi | first1 = M. H. | last2 = Lilja | first2 = D. J. | last3 = Riedel| first3 = M. D. | last4 = Bazargan | first4 = K. | doi = 10.1109/ASPDAC.2016.7428060 | title = Polysynchronous stochastic circuits | journal = 2016 21st Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC) | year = 2016 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, stochastic computing provides an estimate of the solution
that grows more accurate as we extend the bit stream.  In particular,
it provides a rough estimate very rapidly.  This property is usually 
referred to as ''progressive precision'', which suggests that the precision
of stochastic numbers (bit streams) increases as computation proceeds.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alaghi | first1 = A. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = J. P. | doi = 10.1145/2465787.2465794 | title = Survey of Stochastic Computing | journal = ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems | volume = 12 | issue = 2s | pages = 1 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is as if the [[most significant bit]]s of the number
arrive before its [[least significant bit]]s; unlike the
conventional [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic circuits]] where the most
significant bits usually arrive last. In some
iterative systems the partial solutions obtained through progressive precision can provide faster feedback
than through traditional computing methods, leading to faster
convergence.

=== Weaknesses ===

Stochastic computing is, by its very nature, random.  When we examine
a random bit stream and try to reconstruct the underlying value, the effective precision
can be measured by the variance of our sample.  In the example above, the digital multiplier
computes a number to &lt;math&gt; 2n &lt;/math&gt; bits of accuracy, so the
precision is &lt;math&gt; 2^{-2n}&lt;/math&gt;.  If we are using a random bit
stream to estimate a number and want the standard deviation of our
estimate of the solution to be at least &lt;math&gt; 2^{-2n}&lt;/math&gt;, we
would need &lt;math&gt; O(2^{4n}) &lt;/math&gt; samples.  This represents an
exponential increase in work. In certain applications, however, the
progressive precision property of stochastic computing can be exploited
to compensate this exponential loss.

Second, stochastic computing requires a method of generating random
biased bit streams.  In practice, these streams are generated with
[[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-random number generators]].  Unfortunately, generating
(pseudo-)random bits is fairly costly (compared to the expense of,
e.g., a full adder).  Therefore, the gate-level advantage of
stochastic computing is typically lost.

Third, the analysis of stochastic computing assumes that the bit
streams are independent (uncorrelated).  If this assumption does not
hold, stochastic computing can fail dramatically.  For instance, if we
try to compute &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; by multiplying a bit stream for
&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by itself, the process fails: since &lt;math&gt;a_i \land
a_i=a_i&lt;/math&gt;, the stochastic computation would yield &lt;math&gt; p \times p
= p &lt;/math&gt;, which is not generally true (unless &lt;math&gt;p=&lt;/math&gt;0 or 1).
In systems with feedback, the problem of decorrelation can manifest in
more complicated ways.  Systems of stochastic processors are prone to
''latching'', where feedback between different components can achieve
a deadlocked state.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| last1=Winstead
| first1=C.
| last2=Rapley
| first2=A.
| last3=Gaudet
| first3=V.
| last4=Schlegel
| first4=C.
| title=Stochastic iterative decoders
| journal=IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory
| location=Adelaide Australia
|date=September 2005
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A great deal of effort must be spent decorrelating the system to
attempt to remediate latching.

Fourth, although some digital functions have very simple stochastic
counterparts (such as the translation between multiplication and the
AND gate), many do not.  Trying to express these functions stochastically
may cause various pathologies.  For instance, stochastic decoding requires
the computation of the function &lt;math&gt;f(p,q)\rightarrow pq/(pq + (1-p)(1-q))&lt;/math&gt;.
There is no single bit operation that can compute this function; the usual solution
involves producing correlated output bits, which, as we have seen above, can cause
a host of problems.

Other functions (such as the averaging operator &lt;math&gt;f(p,q)\rightarrow (p+q)/2&lt;/math&gt;) require 
either stream decimation or inflation.  Tradeoffs between precision and memory
can be challenging.

== Stochastic decoding ==

Although stochastic computing has a number of defects when considered
as a method of general computation, there are certain applications
that highlight its strengths.  One notable case occurs in the
decoding of certain error correcting codes.

In developments unrelated to stochastic computing, highly effective
methods of decoding [[Low-density parity-check code|LDPC codes]] using
the [[belief propagation]] algorithm were
developed.  Belief propagation in this context involves iteratively
reestimating certain parameters using two basic operations
(essentially, a probabilistic XOR operation and an averaging
operation).

In 2003, researchers realized that these two operations could be
modeled very simply with stochastic computing.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| title=Iterative decoding  using stochastic computation
| last1=Gaudet
| first1=Vincent
| last2=Rapley
| first2=Anthony
| journal=Electronics Letters
| volume=39
| number=3
| pages=299–301
|date=February 2003
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, since the
belief propagation algorithm is iterative, stochastic computing provides partial
solutions that may lead to faster convergence.
Hardware implementations of stochastic decoders have been built on [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGAs]].
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference
| title=Stochastic implementation of LDPC decoders
| last1=Gross
| first1=W.
| last2=Gaudet
| first2=V.
| last3=Milner
| first3=A.
| booktitle=Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers
| year=2006
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The proponents of these methods argue that the performance of stochastic decoding is
competitive with digital alternatives.

== Variants of stochastic computing ==

There are a number of variants of the basic stochastic computing
paradigm.  Further information can be found in the referenced book by
Mars and Poppelbaum.

''Bundle Processing'' involves sending a fixed number of
bits instead of a stream.  One of the advantages of this approach is
that the precision is improved.  To see why, suppose we transmit
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; bits.  In regular stochastic computing, we can
represent a precision of roughly &lt;math&gt;O(1/\sqrt{s})&lt;/math&gt; different
values, because of the variance of the estimate.  In bundle
processing, we can represent a precision of &lt;math&gt;1/s&lt;/math&gt;.
However, bundle processing retains the same robustness to error of
regular stochastic processing.

''Ergodic Processing'' involves sending a stream of bundles, which
captures the benefits of regular stochastic and bundle processing.

''Burst Processing'' encodes a number by a higher base increasing
stream.  For instance, we would encode 4.3 with ten decimal digits as
::: 4444444555
since the average value of the preceding stream is 4.3.  This
representation offers various advantages: there is no randomization
since the numbers appear in increasing order,
so the PRNG issues are avoided, but many of the advantages of
stochastic computing are retained (such as partial estimates of the
solution).  Additionally, it retains the linear precision of bundle
and ergodic processing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12153">In [[computer algebra]], a '''triangular decomposition''' of a polynomial system {{mvar|S}} is a set of simpler polynomial systems {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''S&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that a point is a solution of {{mvar|S}} if and only if it is a solution of one of the systems {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''S&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

When the purpose is to describe the solution set of {{mvar|S}} in the [[algebraic closure]] of its coefficient [[Field (mathematics)|field]], those simpler systems are [[regular chain]]s. If the coefficients of the polynomial systems {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''S&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are real numbers, then the real solutions of  {{mvar|S}} can be obtained by a triangular decomposition into [[regular semi-algebraic system]]s. In both cases, each of these simpler systems has a triangular shape and remarkable properties, which justifies the terminology.

== History ==
The '''Characteristic Set Method''' is the first factorization-free algorithm, which was proposed for decomposing an algebraic variety into equidimensional components.  Moreover, the Author, [[Wu Wenjun|Wen-Tsun Wu]], realized an implementation of this method and reported experimental data in his 1987 pioneer article titled "A zero structure theorem for polynomial equations solving".&lt;ref&gt;Wu, W. T. (1987). A zero structure theorem for polynomial equations solving. MM Research Preprints, 1, 2–12&lt;/ref&gt; To put this work into context, let us recall what was the common idea of an algebraic set decomposition at the time this article was written.

Let {{math|'''K'''}} be an [[algebraically closed field]] and {{math|'''k'''}} be a subfield of {{math|'''K'''}}. A subset {{math|''V'' ⊂ '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an (affine) [[algebraic variety]] over {{math|'''k'''}} if there exists a polynomial set {{math|''F'' ⊂ '''k'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} such that the zero set {{math|''V''(''F'') ⊂ '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{mvar|F}} equals {{mvar|V}}.

Recall that {{mvar|V}} is said '''irreducible''' if for all  algebraic varieties {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} the relation {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} implies either {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. A first algebraic variety decomposition result is the famous [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] which implies the following.

:'''Theorem (Lasker - Noether).''' For each algebraic variety {{math|''V'' ⊂ '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} there exist finitely many irreducible algebraic varieties {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊂ '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} such that we have
::&lt;math&gt;  V = V_1 \cup \cdots \cup V_e. &lt;/math&gt;
:Moreover, if  {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊈ ''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} holds for {{math|1 ≤ ''i'' &lt; ''j'' ≤ ''e''}} then the set {{math|{''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} }}is unique and forms the '''irreducible decomposition''' of {{mvar|V}}.

The varieties {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in the above Theorem are called the '''irreducible components''' of {{mvar|V}} and can be regarded as a natural output for a decomposition algorithm, or, in other words, for an algorithm solving a system of equations in {{math|'''k'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}}.

In order to lead to a computer program, this algorithm specification  should prescribe how irreducible components are represented.  Such an encoding is introduced  by [[Joseph Ritt]]&lt;ref&gt;Ritt, J. (1966). Differential Algebra. New York, Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt;  through the following result.

:'''Theorem (Ritt).''' If {{math|''V'' ⊂ '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a non-empty and irreducible variety then one can compute a reduced triangular set {{mvar|C}} contained in the ideal &lt;math&gt;\langle F \rangle&lt;/math&gt; generated by {{mvar|F}} in {{math|'''k'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} and such that all polynomials {{mvar|g}} in &lt;math&gt;\langle F \rangle&lt;/math&gt; reduces to zero by pseudo-division w.r.t {{mvar|C}}.

We call the set {{mvar|C}} in Ritt's Theorem a '''Ritt characteristic set''' of the ideal &lt;math&gt;\langle F \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Please refer to [[regular chain]] for the notion of a triangular set.

[[Joseph Ritt]] described  a method for solving polynomial systems  based on polynomial factorization over field extensions and computation of characteristic sets of prime ideals.

Deriving a practical implementation of this method, however,  was and remains a difficult problem. In the 80's, when the [[Wu's method of characteristic set|Characteristic set]] Method was introduced,  polynomial factorization was an active research area and certain fundamental questions on this subject were solved  recently&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Steel Conquering inseparability: Primary decomposition and multivariate factorization over algebraic function fields of positive characteristic&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, decomposing an algebraic variety into irreducible components is not essential to process most application problems, since weaker notions of decompositions, less costly to compute, are sufficient.

The '''Characteristic Set Method''' relies on the following variant of Ritt's Theorem.

:'''Theorem (Wen-Tsun Wu).''' For any finite polynomial set {{math|''F'' ⊂ '''k'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}}, one can compute a reduced triangular set &lt;math&gt;C \subset \langle F \rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that  all polynomial {{mvar|g}} in {{mvar|F}} reduces to zero by pseudo-division w.r.t {{mvar|C}}.

Different concepts and algorithms extended the work of [[Wu Wenjun|Wen-Tsun Wu]]. In the early 90's, the notion of a [[regular chain]], introduced independently by Michael Kalkbrener in 1991 in his PhD Thesis and, by Lu Yang and Jingzhong Zhang&lt;ref&gt;Yang, L., Zhang, J. (1994). [http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/22/086/22086436.pdf Searching dependency between algebraic equations: an algorithm applied to automated reasoning]. Artificial Intelligence in Mathematics, pp.&amp;nbsp;14715,  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; led to important algorithmic discoveries.

In Kalkbrener's vision,&lt;ref&gt;M. Kalkbrener: A Generalized Euclidean Algorithm for Computing Triangular Representations of Algebraic Varieties. J. Symb. Comput. 15(2): 143&amp;ndash;167 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; regular chains are used to represent the generic zeros of the irreducible components of an algebraic variety.  In the original work of Yang and Zhang, they are used to decide whether a hypersurface intersects a quasi-variety (given by a regular chain).  [[Regular chain]]s have, in fact, several interesting properties and are the key notion in many algorithms for decomposing systems of algebraic or differential equations.

Regular chains have been investigated in many papers.&lt;ref&gt;S.C. Chou and X.S. Gao. On the dimension of an arbitrary ascending chain.  Chinese Bull. of Sci., 38:799--804, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kalkbrener. Algorithmic properties of polynomial rings. J. Symb. Comput.}, 26(5):525--581, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Aubry, D. Lazard, M. Moreno Maza. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717199902699 On the theories of triangular sets]. Journal of Symbolic Computation, 28(1&amp;ndash;2):105&amp;ndash;124, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abundant literature on the subject can be explained by the many equivalent definitions of a regular chain. Actually, the original formulation of Kalkbrener is quite  different from that of Yang and Zhang.  A bridge between these two notions, the point of view of Kalkbrener and that of Yang and Zhang, appears in Dongming Wang's paper.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wang. Computing Triangular Systems and Regular Systems. Journal of Symbolic Computation 30(2) (2000) 221&amp;ndash;236&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various algorithms available for obtaining triangular decomposition of {{math|''V''(''F'')}} both in the sense of Kalkbrener and in the sense of [[Daniel Lazard|Lazard]] and [[Wu Wenjun|Wen-Tsun Wu]]. The '''Lextriangular Algorithm''' by [[Daniel Lazard]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Lazard, ''Solving zero-dimensional algebraic systems''. Journal of Symbolic Computation '''13''', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Triade Algorithm''' by [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~moreno/ Marc Moreno Maza]&lt;ref&gt;M. Moreno Maza: On triangular decomposition of algebraic varieties. MEGA 2000 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; together with the '''Characteristic Set Method''' are available in various computer algebra systems, including [[Axiom (computer algebra system)|Axiom]] and [[Maple (software)|Maple]].

== Formal definitions ==
Let {{math|'''k'''}} be a field and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be ordered variables. We denote by {{math|''R'' {{=}} '''k'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} the corresponding [[polynomial ring]]. For {{math|''F'' ⊂ ''R''}}, regarded as a system of polynomial equations, there are two notions of a '''triangular decomposition''' over the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''k'''}}. The first one is to decompose lazily, by representing only the [[generic point]]s of the algebraic set {{math|''V''(''F'')}} in the so-called sense of Kalkbrener.

: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(F)}=\bigcap_{i=1}^{e}\sqrt{\mathrm{sat}(T_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The second is to describe explicitly all the points of {{math|''V''(''F'')}} in the so-called sense of in [[Daniel Lazard|Lazard]] and [[Wu Wenjun|Wen-Tsun Wu]].

: &lt;math&gt;V(F)=\bigcup_{i=1}^{e}W(T_i).&lt;/math&gt;

In both cases {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are finitely many [[regular chain]]s of {{mvar|R}} and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\mathrm{sat}(T_i)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the radical of the '''saturated ideal''' of {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} while {{math|''W''(''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} denotes the '''quasi-component''' of {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Please refer to [[regular chain]] for definitions of these notions.

Assume from now on that {{math|'''k'''}} is a [[real closed field]]. Consider {{mvar|S}} a semi-algebraic system with polynomials in {{mvar|R}}. There exist&lt;ref&gt;Changbo Chen, James H. Davenport, John P. May, Marc Moreno-Maza, Bican Xia, Rong Xiao. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717111002070/pdf?md5=9344a2f6467b91cc32bcef52f9275ab2&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0747717111002070-main.pdf&amp;_valck=1 Triangular decomposition of semi-algebraic systems].  Proceedings of 2010 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2010), ACM Press, pp. 187--194, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; finitely many [[regular semi-algebraic system]]s {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''S&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that we have

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathbf{k}}(S) = Z_{\mathbf{k}}(S_1) \cup \cdots \cup Z_{\mathbf{k}}(S_e) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;'''k'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}} denotes the points of {{math|'''k'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} which solve {{mvar|S}}. The regular semi-algebraic systems {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''S&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}} form a '''triangular decomposition''' of the semi-algebraic system {{mvar|S}}.

== Examples ==
Denote {{mvar|Q}} the rational number field. In &lt;math&gt;Q[x, y, z]&lt;/math&gt; with variable ordering &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y &gt; z&lt;/math&gt;, consider the following polynomial system: 

:&lt;math&gt;S = 
\begin{cases} x^2 + y + z = 1 \\ x + y^2 + z = 1 \\ x + y + z^2 = 1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] code: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="mupad"&gt;
with(RegularChains):
R := PolynomialRing([x, y, z]):
sys := {x^2+y+z-1, x+y^2+z-1, x+y+z^2-1}:
l := Triangularize(sys, R):
map(Equations, l, R);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;One possible triangular decompositions of the solution set of {{mvar|S}} with using [http://www.regularchains.org/ RegularChains] library is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} z = 0 \\ y = 1 \\ x = 0 \end{cases}
\cup
\begin{cases} z = 0 \\ y = 0 \\ x = 1 \end{cases}
\cup
\begin{cases} z = 1 \\ y = 0 \\ x = 0 \end{cases}
\cup
\begin{cases} z^2 + 2z -1 = 0 \\ y = z \\ x = z \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
In the early 1970s, numerical range workshops were organized by [[Frank Bonsall]] and John Duncan. More activities were started in early 1990s, including the biennial workshop series, which began in 1992,
and special issues devoted to this workshop were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ando|first1=T.|last2=Li|first2=C.K.|last3=(special editors)|title=Special issue devoted to WONRA|journal=Linear and Multilinear Algebra|date=1994|volume=37|issue=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
