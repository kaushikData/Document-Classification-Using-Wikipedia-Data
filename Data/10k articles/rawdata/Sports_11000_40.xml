'''Abondance Ski Valley''' is a mid-sized ski area in the [[Haute-Savoie]] region of France, near [[Châtel, Haute-Savoie|Châtel]] and La Chapelle d'Abondance.
The resort has been open since at least 1964&lt;ref name="pistehors"&gt;http://pistehors.com/news/ski/comments/0735-abondance-abandons-skiing/&lt;/ref&gt; and was closed in 2007, when the local council voted to shut down the area after 15 years of loss-making.&lt;ref name="pistehors" /&gt; The resort was reopened, however, in 2009 when Gregory Lynn Sherwood, an American entrepreneur, made a deal with the local mayor to operate the ski area for the next 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://funinthealps.co.uk/abondance-ski-resort-is-reopening-after-two-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Abondance Ski Valley is located in the Abondance Valley, in the [[Chablais Alps]]. The resort is one of 12 ski stations in the [[Portes du Soleil]] linked ski area,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.portesdusoleil.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and is open to Portes du Soleil combined ticket holders, however it is not linked to any other resorts and a drive to La Chapelle d'Abondance or Châtel is required in order to access the rest of the Portes du Soleil.

The '''Arena Nürnberger Versicherung''' (originally known as the '''Nuremberg Arena''') is a [[Multi-purpose stadium|multi-use]] [[arena|indoor arena]] that is located in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]]. It can host sports matches, including those of [[tennis]], [[ice hockey]], [[handball]], and [[basketball]], as well as musical [[concerts]]. It has a capacity of up to 9,400 people for sports,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arena-nuernberg.de/besucher-service/saalplan-und-bestuhlung/ Bestuhlung {{de icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 11,000 people for concerts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arena-nuernberg.de/arena/zahlen-und-fakten/ und Fakten zur ARENA {{de icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The arena opened in 2001. On 22 April 2003, Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their [[Unbreakable Tour (Westlife concert tour)|Unbreakable Tour]] supporting their album [[Unbreakable - The Greatest Hits Vol. 1]]. In 2005, it was renamed '''Arena Nürnberger Versicherung''' to reflect its sponsorship by a local insurance firm. On 7 November 2009, [[David Haye]] won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List of WBA world champions#Heavyweight (Super belt: Muhammad Ali)|Heavyweight Championship]], against [[Nikolai Valuev]], at the arena, in his first attempt at the heavyweight title.

The arena is the home venue for the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|German Ice Hockey League]] club, [[Nürnberg Ice Tigers|Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers Nürnberg]], and was also the home arena for the now defunct [[Basketball Bundesliga|German League]] basketball club, [[Falke Nürnberg]].

The [[Basketball Bundesliga|German Basketball League]] club, [[Brose Bamberg]], has also played [[EuroLeague]] home games at the arena in the [[2005–06 Euroleague|2005–06 EuroLeague season]], against the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] club [[AEK Athens BC|AEK Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame?gamecode=74&amp;seasoncode=E2005 GHP BAMBERG 71 AEK ATHENS 61 DECEMBER 15, 2005 ARENA NÜRNBERGER VERSICHERUNGEN.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arena-nuernberg.de/arena/nutzungsvarianten/ansichten-sport/ Bilder von Sportvarianten Basketball {{de icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[2015–16 Euroleague|2015–16 EuroLeague season]] against the [[Liga ACB|Spanish League]] club [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame?gamecode=181&amp;seasoncode=E2015 ROSE BASKETS BAMBERG 86 REAL MADRID 90 FEBRUARY 25, 2016 ARENA NURNBERGER VERSICHERUNG.]&lt;/ref&gt; and during the [[2016–17 Euroleague|2016–17 EuroLeague season]] against the [[Turkish Basketball Super League|Turkish Super League]] club [[Efes S.K.|Efes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame?gamecode=89&amp;seasoncode=E2016 2016-17 Regular Season Round 12 DECEMBER 15, 2016 ARENA NURNBERGER VERSICHERUNG.]&lt;/ref&gt; They also played a home game in the [[2017–18 EuroLeague|2017–18 season]], against [[FC Barcelona Basket|FC Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame?gamecode=53&amp;seasoncode=E2017 NOVEMBER 15, 2017 CET: 20:00 LOCAL TIME: 20:00 ARENA NURNBERGER VERSICHERUNG.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5455">In [[chess]], '''artificial castling''' (also called '''castling by hand''') refers to a maneuver in which a [[king (chess)|king]] which has lost the right to [[castling|castle]] achieves a castled position in several normal moves, instead of the one special move.

After the following common sequence of moves:

:'''1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Nxe4 5. Bxf7+?!''' (first diagram)
White sees that if he recaptures with 5.Nxe4, Black responds with 5...d5, forking knight and bishop and winning back the piece. In that case, Black has not won material, but has destroyed White's center. Instead of allowing d5, White hopes to cause trouble for Black by returning the piece while depriving him of the right to castle. However, Black can easily castle artificially, for example:

:'''5... Kxf7 6. Nxe4 Be7 7. 0-0'''
White castles "naturally".

:'''7... Rf8'''
Black begins castling artificially.

:'''8. d4 exd4 9. Nxd4 Kg8''' (second diagram)
Black has achieved a normal castled position (Rf8, Kg8), but in several moves. The absence of any pawns in the center indicates that king safety is of particular importance in this position. Black's development lags slightly, but he also possesses the bishop pair and a [[queenside]] [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] majority, so his position is at least equal.

|}
&lt;br /&gt;
In an even more common [[Chess opening|opening]] (a main line of the [[Benko Gambit]], ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]'' A59), White uses the g2-square in an artificial castle maneuver to safeguard his king after an exchange of bishops on f1 precludes castling normally:

:'''1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 Bxa6 6. Nc3 d6 7. e4 Bxf1 8. Kxf1''' (first diagram) '''8... g6 9. g3 Bg7 10. Kg2 0-0 11. Nf3 Nbd7''' (second diagram). White has completed the artificial castle maneuver of his king and is ready to continue with 12.Re1 (or other moves).

The following game between [[Jonathan Mestel]] and [[Sergey Makarichev]] played in [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] 1979 features yet another way to artificially castle:

A unique and even humorous artificial castling took place in the game Heidenfeld–Hecht, played in the [[Nice]] [[Chess Olympiad]] 1974:
:'''1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. e5 Ne4 4. d4 Nxc3 5. bxc3 e6 6. Bd3 c5 7. f4 Nc6 8. Nf3 Qa5 9. Bd2 Qa4! 10. Be3 c4 11. Be2 Ba3 12. Bc1? Qa5''' (see diagram) White's queenside pawns were under heavy pressure, and "usual" moves such as 13.Bd2? Bb2, 13.Bxa3 Qxc3+! or 13.Qd2 Bxc1 would have all led to a loss of a pawn. So, White came up with the following unusual maneuver: '''13. Kd2! Be7 14. Qe1 Bd7 15. Ke3''' Now that the queen guards c3, the king can continue his journey to safety. '''15... f6 16. Rf1 fxe5 17. fxe5 0-0 18. Kf2 Be8! 19. Kg1''' White has "castled" in five moves instead of the usual one, but maintained material equality (although after '''19... Bg6''', Black was still better, and eventually won).

'''Baseball City Stadium''' was a [[stadium]] located in [[Davenport, Florida]] (near Haines City) that was in use from 1988-2002. It was a portion of the [[Boardwalk and Baseball]] theme park. The two facilities adjoined at the intersection of Interstate 4 and Route 27, about 25 miles southwest of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. The facility had five practice fields in addition to the stadium. It was primarily used for [[baseball]] and was the [[spring training]] home of [[Kansas City Royals]] prior to the team moving to [[Surprise Stadium]] in 2003. The ballpark had a capacity of 8,000 people.

==History==
The stadium opened on February 7, 1988; it was designed to be the cornerstone of the Boardwalk and Baseball theme park. The Royals were quick to jump at the opportunity to play in a brand new stadium and signed on for a 15-year contract.  The stadium's first event was the 1988 Pizza Hut All-Star Softball game, played in front of 4,700 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boggs helps AL beat NL in softball |author=Durward Buck |newspaper=The Ledger|date=1988-02-08 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C7USAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9vsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2826,3968895&amp;dq=baseball-city-stadium&amp;hl=en|page=1D, 5D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royals played their first spring training game at the ballpark on March 4, 1988, in front of 3,281 who saw them lose 9-7 to the [[Houston Astros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baseball by the Boardwalk |author=Muuray Chass|newspaper=New York Times|date=1988-03-05 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/05/sports/baseball-by-the-boardwalk.html|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royals also moved their Single A [[Florida State League]] affiliate, renamed The [[Baseball City Royals]] into the park for the 1988 season.

However, the Boardwalk and Baseball theme park was very rapidly becoming a financial disaster.  The owners and developers of the park, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (now Harcourt, a division of [[Reed Elsevier]]), put very little money into the park, and almost all money went into the Baseball Stadium.  The property was originally a failed park called [[Circus World (theme park)|Circus World]], and HBJ simply renovated and re-opened the park, without adding new rides, hoping that the renaming along with the stadium would allow it to compete with nearby [[Walt Disney World]].  Quickly the park started to cut costs, including closing at dusk and laying off several employees.  In September 1989 HBJ sold the theme park and stadium to [[Anheuser-Busch]].  In 1990 Anheuser-Busch closed the theme park, and by 1993 almost the entire park had been torn down.  Following the 1992 season the Baseball City Royals pulled out of the Florida State League and moved to [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

Kansas City would continue to use the Stadium as it was a very modern spring training facility and still drew very solid attendance numbers.  Anheuser-Busch kept the stadium open rather than break their contract that they had with the Royals.  In 2001 the Royals would also move their Rookie League team, the [[Arizona League Royals|Gulf Coast League Royals]] into the stadium.  However, when the contract finally ran out at the end of the 2002 season, the Royals moved all of their spring training and rookie league operations West to [[Surprise, Arizona]], where a brand new $20 million park was being built and was offered to any team willing to leave [[Florida]].  Soon after, the stadium and the [[IMAX Theater]], which were the only remaining parts of the original theme park, were demolished.

==Present day==
After sitting idle for over a decade, the land was sold to developer Victor Posner in 2001.  The ballpark was torn down in 2005 to make way for the new [[Posner Park]]; a retail complex with several big box stores opened on the site in 2008.

It is the home stadium of [[Club Atlético Colón]].  The stadium has a capacity of 33,458 and was first opened in 1946.&lt;ref name=sway&gt;{{cite web|title=ESTADIO BRIGADIER GENERAL ESTANISLAO LÓPEZ|url=https://int.soccerway.com/venues/argentina/estadio-brigadier-general-estanislao-lopez/|work=Soccerway|publisher=Perform|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground's nickname (Elephants Graveyard in English) was created in 1964, as a result of the unexpected defeat of the Brazilian team [[Santos FC]] led by [[Pelé]]. The frequent defeats of the major Argentine teams strengthened the reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.futbolred.com/copa-america-2011/noticias/argentina_no_es_bs_as/el-cementerio-de-los-elefantes-el-escenario-de-argentina-colombia/9811644|title= 'El cementerio de los elefantes', el escenario de Argentina-Colombia|trans-title='The Elephants graveyard', the scenario of Argentina-Colombia|language= Spanish|author= Gabriel Briceño|date= |publisher= Fútbol Red|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Finance and Revenue Football Club''' (F&amp;R FC) is a Burmese [[association football|football]] club operated by the [[Ministry of Finance and Revenue of Myanmar]]. The club is the most successful club in the history of the now defunct Burmese top-division football league. It won a total of 17 [[Burma First Division]] championships prior to 1996 and 11 [[Myanmar Premier League]] championships between 1996 and 2008. The club completed its dominance in the last edition of First Division football in 2009 by winning the Myanmar Premier League Cup 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.myanmarfootball.org/MFF/Eng_News/hot_2(1)_4_08.htm | title=Finance/ Revenue Club won Myanmar League Knock-Out Cup | publisher=Myanmar Football Federation | date=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F&amp;R's long presence in top division Burmese football has come to an end in April 2009 as the country's first ever professional league, the [[Myanmar National League]], does not include any football clubs run by government ministries. In April 2009, the club released 17 of its players to the MNL, for a transfer fee of 9.7 million [[kyat]]s (US$97,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soccermyanmar.com/sm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1776:2009-04-28-12-17-58&amp;catid=54:myanmar-national-league&amp;Itemid=104 | title=Players Transferred to Pro League | date=2009-04-28 | accessdate=2009-05-14 | language=Burmese | work=soccermyanmar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patrick Ewing ca. 1995.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Patrick Ewing]]]]

'''Forward–center''' or '''Bigman''' is a [[basketball]] [[basketball positions|position]] for players who play or have played both [[Basketball positions#Frontcourt (forwards and center)|forward]] and [[center (basketball)|center]] on a consistent basis. Typically, this means [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and [[center (basketball)|center]], since these are usually the two biggest player positions on any basketball team, and therefore more often overlap each other.

Forward–center came into the basketball jargon as the game evolved and became more specialized in the 1960s. The five positions on court were originally known only as [[Basketball positions#Backcourt (guards)|guards]], [[Basketball positions#Frontcourt (forwards and center)|forwards]], and the [[center (basketball)|center]], but it is now generally accepted that the five primary positions are [[point guard]], [[shooting guard]], [[small forward]], [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]], and [[center (basketball)|center]].

Typically, a forward–center is a talented forward who also came to play minutes at center on teams that need help at that position. The player could also be a somewhat floor-bound center, under seven feet tall at the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] level, whose skills suit him to a power forward position, especially if that team has a better center. One such player is [[Marcus Camby]] of the [[New York Knicks]]. At 6'11" (211&amp;nbsp;cm), he generally plays as a center, but when he played for the [[New York Knicks]] earlier in his career, he mostly played power forward because his team had one of the best pure centers in the league in  7'0" (213&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Patrick Ewing]]. Ewing himself was used as a forward–center early in his career to complement the then-incumbent Knicks center, 7'1" (216&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Bill Cartwright]]. [[Ralph Sampson]], at 7'4" (224&amp;nbsp;cm), was another notable forward–center who played center his rookie year in 1983. In 1984, he moved to power forward when 7'0" (213&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] was drafted that year. Most forward-centers range from 6' 9" (2.06 m) to 7' 0" (2.13 m) in height.

Other notable forward-centers include: [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Tim Duncan]], [[Pau Gasol]], [[Chris Bosh]], [[LaMarcus Aldridge]], [[Anthony Davis (basketball)|Anthony Davis]], and [[Draymond Green]].

[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] did not send a team to the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p.15: "England [sic] and France did not send a single competitor to America"&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous events were contested, of which only some were later recognized by the IOC as official Olympic events.  Within these, three athletes representing [[Ireland]] participated, winning one gold and one silver medal.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p.34: "John J. Daly, of Ireland, was the attraction"; p.40: "At the conclusion of the first day’s sport, a summing up of the points scored by the different countries competing showed that America led with a total of 80 points; Ireland was second with 4 points; Germany third with 3 points, and Hungary fourth with 2 points."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spalding, p.205: "T.

'''Griffin Park''' is a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Brentford]], situated in the [[London Borough of Hounslow]], Greater [[London]]. It has been the home ground of [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] since it was built in 1904. The ground is situated in a predominantly residential area and is known for being the only [[English league football]] ground to have a [[pub]] on each corner. The ground gets its name from the [[griffin]], featured in the logo of [[Fuller's Brewery]], which at one point owned the orchard on which the stadium was built.

== History ==

=== Planning, construction and opening ===
Between forming in 1889 and prior to 1904, [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] played at five grounds around [[Ealing]] – Clifden Road, Benns Field, Shotters Field, Cross Road and Boston Park Cricket Ground.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 66}} In 1903, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] chairman [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] (a prominent [[Estate Agents Ombudsman|estate agent]]), Brentford manager [[Dick Molyneux]] and club president Edwin Underwood negotiated a 21-year lease at a [[peppercorn rent]] on an [[orchard]] along the Ealing Road (owned by local [[brewery|brewers]] [[Fuller, Smith and Turner]]), with the option to buy the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] at a later date for £5,000.&lt;ref name="AZBees" /&gt; After a gypsy camp was removed from the site, work began on building the ground in January 1904, under the guidance of architects Parr &amp; Kates.&lt;ref name="AZBees" /&gt; The orchard was cut down by local volunteers, who were allowed to keep the wood.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}}

The ground was initially built with a 20,000 capacity in mind, with a provision for an increase to 30,000–40,000.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} An 800-capacity stand from Boston Park was rebuilt alongside the Braemar Road side of the ground, with an extension alongside taking the stand's capacity to 1,500.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} Beneath and behind the stand were three dressing rooms (one for each team and one for officials), a number of offices and a recreation room.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} The ground was named 'Griffin Park' after a nearby [[Public house|pub]], The Griffin, which was owned by the [[Griffin Brewery]] and was used as [[dressing room]]s and for accommodation.&lt;ref name="Menday"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/news-opinion/looking-back-eddie-menday-football-8110655 |title=Looking Back with Eddie Menday: Football grew out of rowing club |last=Eddie Menday |website=getwestlondon |access-date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a number of trial games, Griffin Park was opened on 1 September 1904.&lt;ref name="Menday" /&gt; Season tickets for the [[1904–05 Brentford F.C. season|1904–05]] season (priced between 10 [[shilling]]s and one [[Guinea (coin)|guinea]]) sold out.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}}

=== The first matches ===
[[File:Griffin Park, London, September 2015.jpg|thumb|Griffin Park pictured from the New Road stand, September 2015.]]
The first competitive match to be played at Griffin Park was a [[Western Football League|Western League]] fixture versus [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] on 1 September 1904.&lt;ref name="bees"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Brentford Football Club Official Matchday Magazine versus AFC Bournemouth 04/09/04|last=|first=|publisher=Dunwoody Sports Marketing|year=2004|isbn=|location=Newbury|page=6|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braemar Road grandstand had been completed by the time of the fixture, but as the dressing rooms were not ready, the players were forced to change at the public baths in Clifden Road.&lt;ref name="bees" /&gt; The borough surveyor also declared the grandstand unsafe and banned its use until improvements had been made.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} Argyle scored the first competitive goal at the ground through [[Fred Buck]], but four minutes from the final whistle, [[Tommy Shanks]] converted a [[James Swarbrick]] cross to secure a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref name="bees" /&gt; The attendance was estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000.&lt;ref name="bees" /&gt;

The first truly first team fixture to be played at the ground was a [[Southern Football League|Southern League First Division]] match on 3 September 1904, which yielded a 0–0 draw between Brentford and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].&lt;ref name="bees" /&gt; The Bees would have to wait until 22 October 1904 for their first victory at the ground, a 2–0 win over [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref name="bees" /&gt; The first [[The Football League|Football League]] match to be played at the ground was on the opening day of the [[1920–21 Brentford F.C. season|1920–21]] season, a 3–0 [[Football League Division Three|Third Division]] defeat to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]].{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 55}}

=== Development ===
[[File:Griffin_Park,_Braemar_Road_forecourt,_January_2015.jpg|thumb|The forecourt behind the Braemar Road stand, pictured in January 2015, with the club offices and bar visible.]]
A new grandstand was constructed on the Braemar Road side of the ground using £5,000 of the money generated from Brentford's run to the fifth round of the [[FA Cup]] during the [[1926–27 Brentford F.C. season|1926–27]] season,{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} replacing the 'cow shed'.&lt;ref name="White2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=100 Years Of Brentford|publisher=Brentford FC|year=1989|isbn=0951526200|editor-last=White|editor-first=Eric|location=|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the old grandstand, the new stand ran the length of the pitch.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} After the season, it was announced that Griffin Park would be completely redeveloped over the following decade.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} Concrete terracing was installed at the Ealing Road end of the ground in 1930.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} A new stand was constructed at the Brook Road end of the ground in the 1933 off-season and the New Road terrace was extended the following year to allow a further 5,000 supporters to be accommodated.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=140, 142, 146}} A further extension to the terracing and a roof was added prior to Brentford's debut [[Football League First Division|First Division]] season in [[1935–36 Brentford F.C. season|1935–36]], taking the New Road stand's capacity to 20,000.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=140, 142, 146}}

Little development occurred at Griffin Park between the mid-1930s, and the mid-1980s.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} The frontage of the Braemar Road stand was rebuilt in 1963, adding club offices and a club room.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=250}} Flats were built in a spare, matchday parking area behind the Ealing Road terrace in 1985 and the following year the Brook Road '[[Spion Kop (stadiums)|kop]]' was torn down and replaced by a two-tiered stand,{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} now colloquially known as the '[[Wendy house|Wendy House]]'.&lt;ref name="footballgroundguide"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/england/championship/griffin-park-brentford.html |title=Griffin Park {{!}} Brentford FC {{!}} Football Ground Guide |website=www.footballgroundguide.com |access-date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the New Road side of the ground, the 1930s extension to the terrace was removed, with a new sheet metal wall added to the back of the stand.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}}

The pitch was moved a few metres to the west in 2006, in order to accommodate box goal nets and the following year, a roof was finally added to the Ealing Road terrace.&lt;ref name="Butcher" /&gt; Numerous improvements were made after Brentford's promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] in 2014, including resurfacing of access areas, extra [[CCTV]], new signage, new heated seats in the [[Technical area|dugouts]] and [[AstroTurf]] installed in the pitch-side run-off areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2014/july/griffin-park-facelift-in-photos/ |title=A photo gallery of the Griffin Park refurbishments over the summer of 2014 |last=Chapman |first=Mark |website=brentfordfc.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the club placed in the Championship playoff places in January 2015, additional work was carried out on the New Road stand ahead of a deadline for submission of a report to the [[Premier League]], which outlined development plans ahead of a potential promotion.&lt;ref name="GriffinParkPL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/11752792._/ |title=Brentford hoping to stay at Griffin Park should Premier League beckon |website=This Is Local London |access-date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LED]] [[Advertising board|advertising boards]] were installed at the ground for the first time during the [[2017–18 Brentford F.C. season|2017–18]] season and [[goal-line technology]] was installed at the ground during the 2017 off-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2017/july/led-announcement/|title=Brentford FC Brentford Football Club Invest in LED Perimeter Advertising System|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=26 July 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2017/august/goal-line-technology-first-use/|title=Brentford FC History made at Griffin Park on Saturday|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=13 August 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crowd disturbance ===
The only occasion on which Griffin Park has been closed due to crowd trouble was following a [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] match versus [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] on 12 September 1925.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 38-39}} Ill-feeling on the pitch sparked trouble on the terraces and following the [[Referee (association football)|referee]]'s report, the [[The Football Association|FA]] closed the ground for 14 days.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 38-39}} The following home match against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] was moved to [[Selhurst Park]], where Brentford suffered a 2–0 defeat and dropped to bottom place in the Football League.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 38-39}}

=== Wartime bombing ===
Griffin Park was hit by two high-explosive bombs in 1940 and 1941, during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Portsmouth, in collaboration with the National Archives and funded by JISC. |url=http://www.bombsight.org/bombs/16057/ |title=High Explosive Bomb at Braemar Road , London – Bomb Sight – Mapping the World War 2 London Blitz |publisher=Bomb Sight |date= |accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six matches were abandoned or postponed during [[the Blitz]].{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 137-138}}

=== The "Great Fire of Brentford" ===
[[File:Brentford vs Wycombe Wanderers, Griffin Park, December 2007.jpg|thumb|The Braemar Road stand, visible during the [[Boxing Day]] match versus [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in 2007.]]
At 11:30 PM on 1 February 1983, a fire broke out in the Braemar Road Stand, possibly due to an electrical fault in the boiler room under the stand.&lt;ref name="Nostalgia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/2027192.0/ |title=Nostalgia: From our picture  files 25 years ago |website=News Shopper |access-date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire quickly spread through the timber used in the construction of the stand.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}} [[Groundsman]] Alec Banks, who lived under the stand, was rescued by then-Brentford player [[Stan Bowles]] and his wife Jane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk.p.preprod.performgroup.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10421~2788146,00.html |title=Brentford {{!}} News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} WHERE ARE THEY NOW? |date=25 July 2012 |website=brentfordfc.co.uk |accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 60 people were evacuated from homes nearby and an estimated £150,000 worth of damage was caused, including 800 seats, the away dressing room, the gymnasium, the kit store and the laundry.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}}&lt;ref name="Nostalgia" /&gt; It was after the reconstruction that the players' tunnel was moved to the western corner of the Braemar Road Stand, with the players having previously emerged from a tunnel at the half way line.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=15-20}}

=== "Fortress Griffin Park" ===
Brentford set an English football record when the club won all 21 home games during the [[1929–30 Brentford F.C. season|1929–30]] Third Division South season.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 72}} Despite the record (which still stands), the Bees finished as runners-up to Plymouth Argyle and failed to win promotion to [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = England 1929/30|url = http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1929-30.html|website = www.rsssf.com|accessdate = 18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brentford finished the 2014 calendar year with the best home record in the Football League, winning 17 of 23 games (two more than the next-best tally) and accruing a 78% winning record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2015/january/fortress-griffin-park-in-2014/ |title=Brentford with best home record in Football League |last=Brett |first=Ciaran |website=brentfordfc.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ticketing ===
The club installed an electronic ticketing system on all [[turnstile]]s at Griffin Park in the summer of 2014.&lt;ref name="Ticketing"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2014/august/match-day-ticket-arrangements-201415/ |title=Information from supporters on ticketing and access for Brentford FC match days at Griffin Park |last=Wickham |first=Chris |access-date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, supporters were able to pay on the turnstiles on match days for non-all-ticket matches.&lt;ref name="Ticketing" /&gt;

When first opened, Griffin Park had no [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] and banks surrounded the pitch, covered with ashes.&lt;ref name="AZBees" /&gt; A tiny stand was erected, which was initially refused a safety certificate.&lt;ref name="AZBees" /&gt;

=== Floodlights ===
Brentford was one of the first clubs to recognise the potential of [[Floodlight#Association football|floodlit football]] and in 1954, a sum of £5,345 was spent on erecting perimeter lights the length of the Braemar Road and New Road stands.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 52}} With the [[The Football League|Football League]] banning competitive games under floodlights, a number of [[friendly matches]] were arranged to increase revenue, with one match against an International Managers XI attracting 21,600 spectators.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 52}} By the time the Football League's ban on competitive floodlit football was lifted in February 1956, the club had received over £10,000 in gate receipts from the friendly matches.&lt;ref name="AZBees" /&gt; The original perimeter lights were replaced in August 1963 with pylons located at each corner of the ground,{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 52}} at a cost of £17,000.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=21-23}} The current floodlight lamps on the pylons were purchased from [[West London derby|West London neighbours]] [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1983.{{Sfn|Haynes|1998|p = 52}} Electronic scoreboards have been attached to two of the pylons since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2013/may/new-scoreboards-installed/ |title=New Scoreboards Installed |publisher=Brentfordfc.co.uk |access-date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floodlights were upgraded from 590 to 1000 [[lux]] during the 2015 off-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2015/june/alan-walsh-updates-on-griffin-park-improvements/ |title=Brentford FC Operations Manager Alan Walsh updates supporters on Griffin Park improvements |last=Wickham |first=Chris |website=www.brentfordfc.co.uk |access-date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Griffin Park 1982 - geograph-2023521.jpg|thumb|right|Griffin Park in 1982, with the New Road Stand visible.]]

The '''International Council of Yacht Clubs''' (ICOYC) is an international organization that operates at the level of [[Commodore (yacht club)|Commodore]]s of [[yacht clubs]] through a '''Commodores’ Forum'''.

Its vision is to improve the quality of the services yacht clubs provide to their members, as well as promoting environmental awareness and responsibility towards the environment. 

Among its practical objectives, the main thrust is to identify areas of interest and areas of concern among member clubs and to share information and experience on these areas. The ICOYC also would like to promote fellowship and informal contact among member clubs by means of sailing events as well as social activities. 
==Membership==
{{AP|List of International Council of Yacht Clubs members}}
The membership of the ICOYC is composed of prestigious yacht clubs in key yachting locations around the world, from Africa to Asia and the Pacific. Its main members are:
[[Royal Natal Yacht Club]], [[Annapolis Yacht Club]], [[Chicago Yacht Club]], [[Eastern Yacht Club]], [[Long Beach Yacht Club]], [[Newport Harbor Yacht Club]], [[Royal Canadian Yacht Club]], [[Royal Vancouver Yacht Club]], [[San Diego Yacht Club]], [[San Francisco Yacht Club]], [[Seattle Yacht Club]], [[Southern Yacht Club]], [[St. Francis Yacht Club]], [[Republic of Singapore Yacht Club]], [[Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club]], [[Royal Varuna Yacht Club]], [[Royal Freshwater Bay Yacht Club]], [[Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron]], [[Royal Perth Yacht Club]], [[Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron]], [[Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron]], [[Sandringham Yacht Club]], [[Bruxelles Royal Yacht Club]], [[Clube Naval de Cascais]], [[Gstaad Yacht Club]], [[Royal Danish Yacht Club]], [[Royal Norwegian Yacht Club]], [[Royal Swedish Yacht Club]], [[Norddeutscher Regatta Verein]], [[Nyländska Jaktklubben]], [[Royal Cork Yacht Club]], [[Royal Malta Yacht Club]], [[Société Nautique de Marseille]], [[Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee]], [[Yacht Club Italiano]] and [[Royal Southern Yacht Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icoyc.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=313682&amp;ssid=203559&amp;vnf=1 Member list]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Its origins can be traced to [[Canada]], where there was a discussion at the Royal Vancouver Yacht Club (RVYC) in 2003 about the need of an international Yacht Club organization. Practical steps were taken in 2005 when the RVYC hosted the first Commodores’ Forum, attended by representatives of yacht clubs around the world.

The International Council of Yacht Clubs was finally established in 2006 in [[Hong Kong]], when the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club hosted the second Commodores’ Forum. This event was attended by 28 yacht clubs from five continents.

'''Kamui Tips''' is a [[Japan]]ese manufacturer of [[Cue stick|cue]] tips for [[Carom billiards|billiards]] and [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]]. According to the company,&lt;ref name="Kamui Brand"&gt;[http://www.kamuibrand.com/billiard-en/?page_id=45 Kamui Brand]{{Clarify|date=September 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use [[Cite web]] or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tips are produced by founder '''Masato Hiraoka''' in his workshop in [[Hiroshima]]. The company and its products are named after the mythological ''[[Kamuy]]''.

Kamui tips first gained international exposure in October 2007, when they were introduced at the [[Billiard Congress of America|BCA]] Super Billiards Expo in the United States. They were endorsed in 2008 by top pro [[Mika Immonen]] as his tip of choice&lt;ref name="NYCGrind.com"&gt;[http://nycgrind.com/?p=7571 NYCGrind]{{Clarify|date=September 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

The tips are made primarily from [[pig leather]], and consist of many layers that are [[Lamination|laminated]] and tempered for a rubber-like consistency. Kamui's process is so specific that some of their products have been in development for more than nine years before they hit store shelves.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Currently, Kamui Tips produces two styles of tips: "Kamui Black" and "Kamui".&lt;ref name="Kamui Tips "&gt;"[http://www.kamuitips.com Kamuitips.com]"{{Clarify|date=September 2010|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

'''Kī-o-rahi''' is a ball [[sport]] played  in [[New Zealand]] with a small round ball called a 'kī'. It is a fast-paced game incorporating skills similar to [[rugby union]], [[netball]] and [[Touch football (rugby league)|touch]].&lt;ref name="odt"&gt;Shane Gilchrist, [http://innz.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=533353 'Game on, the "ki" is back in court'] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130920185818/http://innz.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=533353 |date=20 September 2013 }}, ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', 5 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Two teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.&lt;ref name="odt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jones, Renee |date=October 8, 2005 |title=McDonald's adopts obscure Maori ball game |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10349245|accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is played with varying rules (e.g. number of people, size of field, tag ripping rules etc.) depending on the geographic area it is played in. A process called Tatu, before the game, determines which rules the two teams will use.

In 2005 kī-o-rahi was chosen to represent New Zealand by global fast-food chain [[McDonald's]] as part of its 'Passport to Play' programme to teach physical play activities in 31,000 American schools.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=McDonald's Passport to Play Kicks Off in 31,000 Schools |work=McDonald's Electronic Press Kit |url=http://www.mcdepk.com/passporttoplay/ |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026064120/http://www.mcdepk.com/passporttoplay/ |archivedate=26 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The programme will give instruction in 15 ethnic games to seven million primary school children.&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;

The New Zealand kī-o-rahi representative organisation, ''Kī-o-Rahi Akotanga Iho'', formed with men's and women's national teams, completed a 14 match tour of Europe in September and October 2010. The men's team included 22-test [[All Black]] veteran [[Wayne Shelford]] who led the team to a 57–10 test win against Kī-o-Rahi Dieppe Organisation, the French Kī-o-Rahi federation.
Shelford's kī-o-rahi test jersey made him the first kī-o-rahi/rugby double international for NZ. The women's team coached by Andrea Cameron (Head of PE at Tikipunga High School) also won by 33–0. These were the first historic test matches between NZ and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northlandage.co.nz/sports.php?news_id=3605 |title=Historic tour grabs another win |work=Northland Age |accessdate=2011-02-02 |date=2010-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724193440/http://www.northlandage.co.nz/sports.php?news_id=3605 |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Although former chief executive of the [[Māori Language Commission]], Dr. [[Patu Hohepa]], a noted Māori academic, was quoted as saying "We cannot track it in the traditional Maori world... at this present time it is a mystery." Nonetheless he found the idea (that this was a traditional game) "fabulously exciting".&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; According to Henry Anderson, kaiwhakahaere (Māori sport co-ordinator) for Sport Northland, kī-o-rahi is a traditional Māori game that has been "handed down over the centuries". Harko Brown, a physical education teacher at [[Kerikeri High School]], who was taught the game in the late 1970s on his [[marae]] in the south [[Waikato]], described it as "an indigenous game imbued with [[tikanga Māori]] with a very long history ... of a pre-European nature." References to the ancient forms of the game can be found in his book ''Nga Taonga Takaro''.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nga Taonga Takaro: Maori Sports &amp; Games | publisher=[[Penguin Books (NZ)]] | author=Brown, Harko | year=2008 | isbn=9780143009702}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear when the term 'kī-o-rahi' originated as a collective term for ancient ball games played around a tupu.

It is said to be  based on the legend of      Rahitutakahina and the rescue of his wife, Tiarakurapakewai.&lt;ref name="Traditional Maori games"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/206322/traditional-maori-games-making-comeback|title=Traditional Maori games making a comeback|last=Lewis|first=John|date=21 Apr 2012|work=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|an American slang term|the Hank Williams Jr album|Out of Left Field}}
"'''Out of left field'''" is American slang meaning "unexpectedly", "odd" or "strange". The phrase came from [[baseball]] terminology, referring to a play in which the ball is thrown from the area covered by the [[left fielder]] to either home plate or first base, surprising the runner. According to mlb.com there is another meaning: "The term 'way out in left field' is taken to mean 'crazy.'" Cook County Hospital (by the West Side Grounds, the Chicago Cubs first location under what is now the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] College of Medicine) had a mental institution behind left field, The bottom line is, patients could be heard yelling and screaming things at fans behind the left field wall.'"&lt;ref&gt;http://m.mlb.com/news/article/2954187/&lt;/ref&gt; Variations include "'''out in left field'''" and simply "left field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Partridge |first1=Eric |authorlink1=Eric Partridge |last2=Dalzell |first2=Tom |last3=Victor |first3=Terry |title=The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UIjVGcSe8MC&amp;pg=PA396 |year=2007 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=0415212596|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music industry==
Popular music historian [[Arnold Shaw (author)|Arnold Shaw]] wrote in 1949 for the [[Music Library Association]] that the term "out of left field" was first used in the idiomatic sense of "from out of nowhere" by the [[music industry]] to refer to a song that unexpectedly performed well in the market.&lt;ref name=Shaw1949&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaw |first=Arnold |authorlink=Arnold Shaw (author) |date=December 1949 |title=The Vocabulary of Tin-Pan Alley Explained |journal=Notes |publisher=[[Music Library Association]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=33, 48, 50 |jstor=889665 |quote=Out of left field. Used with reference to a song that unexpectedly does well. Expression, obviously adapted from baseball, goes: 'That was a hit out of left field.' Implication is that song was not a plug song and that no work was done on it until sales and performances developed of themselves. |doi=10.2307/889665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on baseball lingo, a sentence such as "That was a hit out of left field" was used by [[song plugger]]s who promoted recordings and sheet music, to describe a song requiring no effort to sell.&lt;ref name=Shaw1949/&gt; A "rocking chair hit" was the kind of song which came "out of left field" and sold itself, allowing the song plugger to relax.&lt;ref name=Shaw1949/&gt; A 1943 article in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine expands the use to describe people unexpectedly drawn to radio broadcasting:

{{Quote|Latest twist in radio linked with the war is the exceptional number of quasi-clerical groups and individuals who have come out of left field in recent months and are trying to buy, not promote, radio time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 24, 1943 |title=Religion All of a Sudden: Groups With Self-Styled Piety Capitalizing on War Nerves by Buys on Indies But Nets Sneer |journal=The Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume=55 |issue=17 |page=8 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further instances of the phrase were published in the 1940s, including more times in ''Billboard'' magazine and once in a humor book titled ''How to Be Poor.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Bill |date=February 8, 1947 |title=Follow-up Review |journal=The Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume= |issue= |page=39 |issn=0006-2510 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nkUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Webman |first1=Hal |last2=Fischler |first2=Alan |date=June 19, 1948 |title=The Record Year |journal=The Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume= |issue= |page=14 |issn=0006-2510 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fay|first=Frank|title=How to Be Poor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xIMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22out+of+left+field%22&amp;dq=%22out+of+left+field%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DUKuT_-nGsqZiAL0pqXhAw&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBg|year=1945|publisher=Prentice-Hall|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later explanations==
In May 1981, columnist [[William Safire]] asked readers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' to send him any ideas they had regarding the origin of the phrase "out of left field"—he did not know where it came from, and did not refer to Shaw's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/books/word-watchers-at-work.html |title=Word-Watchers at Work |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |date=May 10, 1981 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, 1981, he devoted most of his Sunday column to the phrase, offering up various responses he received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/01/sports/red-smith-sportspeak-and-stuff.html |title=Sportspeak and Stuff |last=Smith |first=Red |authorlink=Red Smith (sportswriter) |date=July 1, 1981 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Safire1981&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/28/magazine/text-hj-s-at-39-inches.html |title=Out Of Left Field |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |date=June 28, 1981 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest scholarly citation Safire could find was a 1961 article in the journal ''[[American Speech]]'', which defined the variation "out in left field" as meaning "disoriented, out of contact with reality."&lt;ref name=Safire1981/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hukill |first=Peter B. |date=May 1961 |title=The Spoken Language of Medicine: Argot, Slang, Cant |journal=[[American Speech]] |publisher=The American Dialect Society |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=145–151 |jstor=453853 |doi=10.2307/453853}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Linguist [[John Algeo]] told Safire that the phrase most likely came from baseball observers rather than from baseball fans or players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |editor=John Thorn |title=The Complete Armchair Book of Baseball: An All-Star Lineup Celebrates America's National Pastime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAPaOOrSVywC&amp;pg=PA271 |year=1997 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |isbn=1578660041 |pages=270–273 |chapter=Out of Left Field}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', Safire writes that the phrase "out of left field" means "out of the ordinary, out of touch, far out."&lt;ref name=Safire2008&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&amp;pg=PA384 |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195343344 |page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variation "out in left field" means alternately "removed from the ordinary, unconventional" or "out of contact with reality, out of touch."&lt;ref name=Safire2008/&gt; He compares the term to [[left-wing politics]] and the [[Left Coast]]—slang for the liberal-leaning coastal cities in California, Oregon and Washington.&lt;ref name=Safire2008/&gt;

In 1998, American English professor [[Robert L. Chapman]], in his book ''American Slang'', wrote that the phrase "out of left field" was in use by 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Robert L. |authorlink=Robert L.

Marcus Callies, an associate professor of English and philology at the [[University of Mainz]] in Germany, wrote that "the precise origin is unclear and disputed", referring to Christine Ammer's conclusion in ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms''.&lt;ref name=Callies2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Callies |first1=Marcus |last2=Keller |first2=Wolfram R. |last3=Lohöfer |first3=Astrid |title=Bi-Directionality in the Cognitive Sciences: Avenues, Challenges, and Limitations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC3cBXfj4UcC&amp;pg=PA74 |series=Human Cognitive Processing |volume=30 |year=2011 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=902722384X |page=74 |chapter=Widening the goalposts of cognitive metaphor research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callies suggested that the left fielder in baseball might throw the ball to [[home plate]] in an effort to get the runner out before he scores, and that the ball, coming from behind the runner out of left field, would surprise the runner.&lt;ref name=Callies2011/&gt;

From the Way Out In Left Field Society:
"The phrase "way out in left field" has evolved to mean an eccentric, odd, misguided or peculiar statement or act.  Although the origin of the phrase has been challenged and debated over the years, the most logical and realistic explanation comes from an extinct baseball park called West Side Grounds that the Chicago Cubs called home from 1893 to 1915.  As legend has it, a mental hospital called the Neuropsychiatric Institute was located directly behind the left field wall.  The Institute housed mental patients who could be heard making strange and bizarre comments within listening distance of players and fans.  Thus, if someone said that you were "way out in left field," the person was questioning your sanity and comparing you with a mental patient"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Way Out in Left Field Society|url=http://www.bc3200.com/twoilfs/jumppage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cubs originally called West Side home|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080618&amp;content_id=2954187&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paintball Gun and Equipment.jpg|thumb|A paintball marker and related equipment, including ammunition and a protective mask]]
A '''paintball marker''', also known as a '''paintball gun, paint gun''', or '''marker''', is the main piece of [[paintball equipment]] in the sport of [[paintball]]. Markers use an expanding gas, such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[compressed air]], to propel [[Paintball equipment#Paintballs|paintballs]] through the barrel and quickly strike a target. The term "marker" is derived from its original use as a means for [[forestry]] personnel to mark trees and [[ranchers]] to mark wandering [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paintball-markers.net/faq.htm|title=FAQ ; Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=September 25, 2010|publisher=Paintball Markers, The}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/ |title=SPLAT! ; South Sound Plays Host to Some of the Best in the World of Paintball |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |publisher=News Tribune, The |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715171911/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/125655/splat__south_sound_plays_host_to_some_of_the/ |archivedate=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114400/1/index.htm|date=December 6, 2004|title=Who Thought This Was A Good Idea?|author=Gaines, Charles|accessdate=5 March 2010|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[muzzle velocity]] of paintball markers is approximately {{convert|90|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. While greater muzzle velocity is possible, it has been ruled unsafe for use on most commercial paintball fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emrpaintball.com/info.shtml |title=EMR PAINTBALL PARK &amp;#124; Scenario Paintball &amp;#124; Recball &amp;#124; Tournament Paintball &amp;#124; Castle Conquest &amp;#124; Paintball Safety |publisher=Emrpaintball.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When paintballs hit an object at high speed they have the potential to cause damage; a paintball colliding with human skin, even protected by cloth, may cause bruising or further tissue damage. However, the damage depends on the paintball's velocity, its impact angle, whether it breaks, and which part of the body it hits. Because of the potential for serious [[soft tissue]] damage, paintball players must wear [[Paintball equipment#Masks|masks]] to protect their eyes, mouth, and ears when [[Paintball equipment#Barrel blocks|barrel blocking devices]] are not preventing paintball markers from firing.

Most paintball markers can be disassembled into four main components: the ''body'', ''hopper'', ''barrel'', and ''gas system'' or ''air tank''.

==Marker types==
Paintball markers fall into two main categories in terms of mechanism – mechanical and [[Electropneumatic paintball marker|electropneumatic]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Mechanically operated===
[[File:PaintBallMarker.jpg|right|thumb|Spyder VS2 Paintball Marker]]
Mechanically operated paintball markers operate using solely mechanical means, and as such do not use electro-pneumatic solenoids controlled by an electronic board to fire.

There five main methods of mechanical operation:

'''Pump or Bolt Action:''' the mechanism of the marker must be manually reset in between each shot, similar to pump action shotguns and bolt action rifles. Markers of this type are the oldest used in the sport as the first ever game of paintball was played using the bolt-action Nelspot pistol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nelsonpaintball.com/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main patterns of internals upon which most pump and bolt action markers operate:
* Sheridan Valve: Named after the Sheridan series of markers which first employed this design, markers which employ this mechanism have the bolt which loads the paintball is located in a separate tube from the hammer and valve. To cock the mechanism, the bolt is pulled backwards thus opening the breech and loading a paintball. Doing so also pulls the hammer backwards against the main spring, which is then held back by a sear connected to the trigger. The bolt is then pushed forward, which loads the paintball into the barrel and the marker is ready to fire. Pulling the trigger releases the hammer which is propelled forward by the main spring, hitting the valve pin and opening the valve which allows compressed gas to flow from the valve chamber into the barrel chamber thus propelling the loaded paintball forward and out of the barrel. The valve spring  then closes the valve with the hammer still resting on the valve pin, after which this cycle must be repeared in order to fire another paintball. Notable examples of markers which operate in this way include the Sheridan K2, the Worr Games Products Sniper and the Chipley Custom Machine S6.
* Nelson Valve: Named after the Nelson Paint Company whose marker, the Nelspot 007, first employed this mechanism. In such markers the bolt, hammer and valve are all located in the same tube. To cock the mechanism, the bolt is pulled back against the main spring to allow a paintball to fall into the breach, at which point the sear latches the hammer to the bolt with the compressed main spring in between them. The bolt and attached hammer are then pushed forward to close the breach and load the paintball into the barrel, at which point the sear can be engaged by the trigger and the marker is ready to fire. Pulling the trigger dissengages the sear from the bolt, allowing the main spring to propel the hammer rearwards onto the powertube, thus opening the valve and allowing compressed gases to flow from the valve chamber to the barrel through the powertube and bolt which propel the loaded paintball forward. The valve is then closed by the valve spring and the marker is ready to be re-cocked for the next shot.  Notable examples of markers which employ this mechanism are the Nelson Nelspot 007,  the CCI Phantom and the Redux.
* Sterling "Hybrid" Valve: A variation or bybrid of these two methods of operation has been employed in the design of the Arrow Precision Sterling, wherein the bolt is located in a separate tube, as in a Sheridan valved marker, the hammer latches to a carrier similar to how it would to the bolt in a Nelson valve design, and when release it hits a Sheridan styled pin valve. There is significant debate as to what type of operations the Sterling employs, as some consider it to be a hybrid between the two main designs, and others simply consider it to be a stacked-tube Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcarterbrown.com/forums/sterling/194056-new-sterlings-several-questions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Double Action:''' the trigger mechanism of the marker both fires and resets the firing mechanism, similar to the way a double-action revolver operates. Examples include the Line SI Advantage, the NSG Splatmaster Rapide and the Brass Eagle Barracuda.

'''Throwback Semi-Auto:''' The mechanism of the marker is cycled using gasses released by the valve which reset the firing mechanism between each shot, similar to the way some semi-automatic rifles such as the AK-47 operates. The internals of blow-back operated markers can be either inline, with the bolt, valve and hammer all aligned along the same axis such as the Tippman 98, or stacked tube with the bolt in a separate tube from the hammer and valve such as the King-man Spider.

'''Blow Forward Semi-Auto:''' The firing mechanism of the marker operates using the gases stored in the valve to cycle the bolt and fire the paintball, after which a spring resets the mechanism for the next shot. Notables examples include the Air-gun Designs Auto-mag, Tippmann X-7 Phenom and the Tiberius Arms T8.

'''Pneumatically Operated Semi-Auto:''' a low pressure pneumatic piston controlled by a four-way valve connected to the trigger resets the firing mechanism in between shots, and can be thought of as semi-auto conversions of markers which would otherwise be pump or bolt action. Notable examples include the WGP Autococker, the Palmer's Pursuit Shop Blazer and Typhoon.

===Electropneumatically operated===
[[File:Ego08.jpg|right|thumb|The Planet Eclipse Ego, an [[electropneumatic paintball marker]]]]

In electromagnetic designs, the trigger, instead of being mechanically linked to the action of the marker, simply activates an electronic micro-switch (or more recently, a magnetic or optical sensor). That information is passed through control circuitry to a computer-controlled solenoid valve which can open and close very quickly and precisely, allowing gas to move into or out of various pressure chambers in the marker to move the bolt and fire the paintball. This disconnect of the trigger from the action allows electronic trigger pulls to be very short in length and very lightweight (similar to a mouse click; the mechanisms are virtually identical), which dramatically increases rate-of-fire over a fully mechanical design. Solenoid-controlled gas valve designs also allow for reduced weight of internal parts, which both lightens overall weight and reduces the time it takes for the marker to cycle through firing a single paintball.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Each branch favors a different aesthetic and values different aspects of marker design.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Marker body==
[[File:Woman with Spyder-like paintball marker participating in paintball match.jpg|thumb|A player using a Spyder paintball marker]]

Most of the marker's functions and aesthetic features are contained in its body, which contains the main components of the firing mechanism: the trigger frame, [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] and [[valve]]. Most paintball marker bodies are constructed from [[aluminium]] to reduce the marker's weight, and feature custom [[Milling machine|milling]] and color [[anodizing]].

===External design===
The largest external and ergonomic difference in marker bodies is in the trigger and barrel position.  Designers of expensive models attempt to position the trigger frame forward towards the center, or slightly forward of center of the body on speed-ball-oriented markers. This allows the [[High Pressure Air|HPA]] tank to be mounted in a position allowing compactness and balance without requiring any additional modifications that allow the tank to fall down and forwards. Such aftermarket "drop forwards", may create a larger gun profile, which can result in eliminations due to hopper hits. Users often modify less expensive markers to allow a similar mode of operation, albeit by sacrificing a low profile. Although this is not important in games where equipment hits are not counted, in most games, including [[woods-ball]] games, hopper hits are counted as an elimination. Some markers mount the barrel farther back in the gun body to preserve a compact design, sacrificing the positioning of the trigger forward on the marker body.

Paintball markers are also categorized to a lesser extent by which play style of paintball in which they are intended for use – sporting paintball such as [[Speed-ball (paintball)|Speed-ball]] and [[Stock paintball|Stock Class Paintball]], or military simulation style games such as [[Woods-ball]].

===Trigger frame===
[[Trigger (firearms)|Triggers]] are the player's primary means of interacting with the marker. The amount of force required to fire the marker, as well as the distance the trigger travels before actuating, called the ''throw'', has a marked effect upon the player's ability to achieve high rates of fire. Many markers, especially higher priced markers, use electronic trigger frames with a variety of sensing methods, including [[micro-switch]]es, [[hall effect sensor]]s or break-beam infra-red switches. These triggers have short throws, allowing a high rate of fire. Non-electronic markers sometimes use carefully set pneumatic to achieve a light and short trigger pull.

The trigger frame on non-electronic mechanical markers simply use a series of springs and levers to drop a [[Sear (firearm)|sear]], which propels the hammer in the body forward. On electronic markers, the trigger frame houses the electronics that control the [[solenoid]], as well as features such as ball detection systems. Upgraded circuit boards that add improved features are available.

===Bolt and valve assembly===
The bolt and valve assembly is the mechanism which fires the marker. The valve is a mechanical switch that controls whether or not the marker is firing. The bolt directs the flow of air and controls the entry of paintballs into the chamber. The bolt and valve may be separate components, as in many blowback and poppet-based electromagnetic markers. Alternatively, the valve may be built into the bolt, as in [[spool-valve]] electromagnetic markers.

Most modern markers have an [[open bolt]] design. When the marker is at rest, the bolt is in the "back" position, and the firing chamber is exposed to the stack of paintballs being fed by the loader. Some markers have [[closed bolt]] designs; in the rest position, the bolt, and paintball to be fired, are forward and the feed stack is closed off from the chamber. Closed bolt markers were thought to be more accurate because there is no [[reciprocating mass]] when the marker is fired. However, tests have shown that the position of the bolt has little effect on a marker’s accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.warpig.com/paintball/technical/paintguns/balistic/closedopen.shtml |title=Where’s the Bolt? |accessdate=2007-12-14 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bolt and valve in mechanical markers====
The majority of mechanical markers employ a simple [[Inline blowback (paintball)|blowback]] design utilizing a [[poppet valve]] (also known as a "pin valve"), which is opened when struck by a compression force, provided in the form of a hammer propelled by a spring. This type of marker generally uses a "stacked tube" design, in which the valve and hammer is contained in the lower tube, while the bolt, which is connected to the hammer, is in the upper tube.

When the hammer is pulled backwards the internal spring compresses, exerting exponential pressure against the hammer's continued backwards motion.  As the hammer and spring mechanism reaches the far end of its backwards range of travel, it is caught and locked in place by a metal catching device known as the sear. The sear holds the hammer in place, allowing the kinetic energy of the bolt's forward motion to be released whenever the sear is depressed.  As the trigger is pulled, the sear becomes depressed and allows the hammer to be propelled forward by the spring.  The hammer collides with the valve releasing gas from the external pressurized tank into the internal bolt chamber.  The ensuing burst of gas channels out the front end of the bolt, propelling the paintball down the barrel. The rest of the gas pushes backwards on the hammer, pushing both it and the bolt backwards until the mechanism is once again caught on the sear.  Once caught, the hammer is ready to repeat the blowback process. In cases where the pressure from the storage vessel drops under the minimum required to complete the action's cycle, the marker may "runaway" firing rapidly without additional trigger pulls required.

Poppet valves are easy to replace and require little maintenance. The downside to this design, however, is its high operating pressure, which leads to a larger recoil and less accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some markers have a separate firing and recocking sequence, which decreases the recoil caused by the cycling of the hammer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Markers with a hammer have a firing delay when compared to a full electropneumatic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Some markers are a hybrid of mechanical and electronic features. In these markers, the hammer and spring continues to activate the valve, but the hammer is released by a solenoid in an electronic trigger frame.

====Bolt and valve in electropneumatic markers====
Instead of the spring and hammer used to actuate the valve and cycle the bolt assembly in mechanical markers, electropneumatic markers use the rerouting of air to different locations in the marker. This rerouting is controlled by a solenoid that is activated by the trigger. The two types of bolt and valve mechanisms in electropneumatic markers are the ''poppet-valve'' and ''spool-valve''.

''Poppet-valve-based'' electropneumatic markers are very similar to mechanical blowback markers. These Pave a stacked-tube construction, built around a [[poppet valve]], that is opened when struck by a force. Whereas mechanical markers provide that force with a hammer propelled by a spring, the valve in poppet-Ealve markers are activated by a pneumatic [[hydraulic ram|ram]]. The bolt is connected to the ram. Poppet-valve markers have several disadvantages when compared to spool valves: external moving parts, higher pressure required for poppet to seal, a reciprocating mass and a louder firing signature. However, they are also generally more gas efficient than spool-valve models because the poppet valve opens rapidly and duIps air into the firing chamber faster. Examples of markers that utilize this mechanism are the [[Angel (paintball)|WDP Angel]], [[Planet Eclipse Ego]], [[Bob Long Intimidator]], and [[Bushmaster 2000 (paintball marker)|Bushmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdspb.com/tech/misc/markers_hammer.html Maker Classification – Markers Using a Hammer], at ZDSPB.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Spool-valve-based'' electropneumatic markers, the bolt also acts as the valve. This eliminates the need for a stacked tube construction; [[Directional control valve|spool valve]] markers have a more compact profile. Instead of a cycling hammer or ram that strikes a pin valve, the movement of the bolt is controlled by the routing of air into small chambers in front of or behind the bolt. An air reservoir behind the bolt contains the air that is to fire the paintball. When the marker is at rest, air is routed to the front of the bolt to prevent the air in the reservoir from escaping. In an "unbalanced spool valve" design, when the trigger is pulled, that air is exhausted from the marker, allowing the air in the reservoir to push the bolt forwards. In a "balanced spool valve" design, the air in the reservoir cannot force the bolt open; instead, the air from the front of the bolt is rerouted to a small chamber behind the bolt, separate from the reservoir, which then pushes the bolt forward. In either case, the movement of the bolt forward exposes pathways in the bolt or the marker that allow the air in the reservoir behind the bolt to surge forward and fire the paintball. Afterwards, airflow to the front of the bolt is restored, pushing the bolt back into its resting position.

A typical spool valve has at least one [[O-ring]] that undergoes a shear and compression duty cycle for every shot, leading to faster wear and less reliability. Additionally, smaller valve openings and longer opening times makes them less gas efficient than their poppet-valve counterparts. Since spool-valve markers have reduced reciprocating mass, and can be operated at lower pressures, they have less recoil and a reduced sound signature. Examples of markers that utilize this mechanism are the [[Dye Matrix]], [[Shocker (paintball marker)|Smart Parts Shocker]], [[Ion (paintball marker)|Smart Parts Ion]], and the MacDev Clone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdspb.com/tech/misc/markers_nohammer.html Marker Classification – Marker Without a Hammer], at ZDSPB.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tuning the bolt and valve system====
In mechanical and poppet-based electropneumatic markers, the valve is usually designed to accommodate a specific operating pressure.  Low pressure valves provide quieter operation and increased gas efficiency when tuned properly.  However, excessively low pressure can decrease gas efficiency as dramatically as excessively high pressure.

Additionally, the valve must be set to release enough air to fire the paintball. If the valve is not tuned properly, insufficient air to fire the paintball may reach the bolt. This phenomenon, known as "shoot-down", causes fired paintballs to gradually lose range, and can also occur at high rates of fire.  Some markers have integral or external chambers, called low-pressure chambers, which hold a large volume of gas behind the valve to prevent shoot-down.

Tuning can also prevent air blowing up the feed tube upon firing, which disrupts the feeding of paintballs into the marker.

==Loaders==
Loaders, commonly known as ''hoppers'', hold paintballs for the marker to fire. The main types are gravity feed, agitating and force-feed. Stick feeds are also used to hold paintballs, although they are not considered to be "hoppers".

While agitating and force-feed hoppers facilitate a higher rate of fire, they are subject to [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] failure, as well as degradation if they come into contact with moisture. Such hoppers which are not fitted with photoreceptors are prone to problems with ball breaks. When a paintball leaks paint into the hopper from a break in the hopper, the gelatin shells of the paintballs can deteriorate, causing them to stick together as well as jam in the barrel.

===Stick feed===
''Stick feeds'' are mainly used on pump and [[stock paintball|stock-class]] markers. They consist of simple tubes that hold between ten and twenty paintballs. Stick feeds are usually parallel to the barrel; player must tip the marker to load the next paintball. Some stick feeds are vertical, or at an incline to facilitate gravity feeding, though this contravenes accepted stock-class guidelines.

===Gravity feed===
''Gravity feed'' is the simplest and cheapest form of hopper available. Gravity feed hoppers consist of a large container and a feed tube molded into the bottom. Paintballs roll down the sloped sides, through the tube and into the marker. These hoppers have a maximum rate of 11.6 balls per second. Gravity feed hoppers are very cheap, since they are made of only a shell and a lid, but can become jammed easily as paintballs accumulate above the tube. Rocking the marker (and hopper) occasionally can  prevent the paintballs from jamming in the hopper.

This problem is exacerbated when using a fully electronic marker. Most mechanical markers use a blowback system for recocking, or other methods where a large reciprocating mass is involved. This will shake the balls in the hopper slightly, facilitating gravity feed. A marker with both electronically controlled recocking and firing may exhibit no shake whatsoever while operating. Because of this, small packs in the hopper are not broken up and feeding problems result.

There are also loaders that resemble military sights that mimic an ACOG or a Red Dot sight, with 20 paintballs capacity at 10 balls per second. Used normally in [[milsim]] events or low capacity (lowcap) events (for e.g.: each player can use a maximum of 50 paintballs).

===Agitating===
''Agitating hoppers'' use a propeller, spinning inside the container, to agitate the paintballs. This prevents them from jamming at the feed neck, allowing them to feed more rapidly than gravity feeds.  Older tournament-level hoppers are of the agitating type, since the higher rate of fire requires a reliable hopper.

There are two types of agitating hoppers: those with sensors – called "eyes" – and those without. The eyes consist of a LED ([[light emitting diode]]) and a [[photodetector]], typically a [[phototransistor]] or [[photodiode]], inside the neck or tube of the hopper, to detect the presence of a ball. In a hopper, the eyes detect when a ball is absent, causing it to turn. Agitating hoppers without eyes will quickly deplete batteries and may bend or dent paintballs, causing a short, less air efficient, skew shot. Agitating hoppers with eyes will only spin in the absence of a ball, preventing damage and prolonging battery life.

A third type of agitating hopper, the Cyclone Feed System manufactured by [[Tippmann]], re-routes gas to agitate the feeding mechanism. It does not need batteries to operate.

===Force-feed===
''Force-feed hoppers'' use an [[impeller]] to capture paintballs and force them into the marker. The impeller is either spring-loaded or powered by a belt system, allowing it to maintain constant pressure on the stack of paintballs in the feed tube. This allows force-feed hoppers to feed paintballs at a rate exceeding 50 balls per second, since the mechanism does not rely on gravity. Force-feed hoppers are the dominant type used in tournaments, being the only type of loader capable of maintaining the high rate of fire of electropneumatic markers.

Some markers use force-fed loaders shaped as [[Magazine (firearms)|firearms magazines]]. These are preferred when a low profile is required, as in woodsball sniper positions. Even more unusual are fully contained magazines, incorporating both a source of propellant gas and force-fed paintballs.

The newest type of force feed hoppers communicate wirelessly with the marker's electronics using [[radio frequency]]. This allows the hopper to begin feeding paintballs before the pneumatic system of the marker has begun cycling the next shot. This system almost totally eliminates mis-feeds and can increase the speed of the loader and the battery life because the loader is only in operation when the marker is preparing to fire.

==Propellant system==
[[File:CO2 Canister.jpg|thumb|right|A CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank]]
{{main|Paintball equipment#Propellants}}

The tank holds compressed gas, which is used to propel the paintballs through the marker barrel. The tank is usually filled with [[carbon dioxide]] or compressed air. High Pressure Air (HPA) is also known as "nitrogen", as air is 78% nitrogen, or because these systems can be filled with industrial nitrogen. Due to the instabilities of carbon dioxide, HPA tanks are required for consistent velocity.  Other propulsion methods include the combustion of small quantities of [[propane]] or electromechanically operated spring-plunger combinations similar to that used in an [[airsoft]] gun.

===Carbon dioxide===
[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a propellant used in paintball, especially in inexpensive markers. It is usually available in a 12&amp;nbsp;gram [[powerlet]], mainly used in stock paintball and in paintball pistols, or a tank. The capacity of a carbon dioxide tank is measured in ounces of liquid and it is filled with liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at room temperatures the vapour pressure is about {{convert|5500|kPa}}.

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; liquid must vaporize into a gas before it can be used. This causes problems such as inconsistent velocity. Cold weather can cause problems with this system, reducing the vapour pressure and increasing the chance for liquefied gas to be drawn into the marker. The low-temperature liquid can damage the internal mechanisms. Anti-siphon tanks have a tube inside the cylinder, which is bent to prevent liquid carbon dioxide from being drawn into the gun.

On the other hand, a number of paintguns were designed with specific valves to operate on liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, including some early [[Tippmann]] models and the Mega-Z from Montneel – thus solving the problem caused by phase changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warpig.com/paintball/technical/gasses/antisiphon/ |title=WARPIG - World And Regional Paintball Information Guide: antisiphon | accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siphon equipped CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks are easily identified by the clunking sound their weight makes when the tank is tipped.

After many years of use, [[Carbon dioxide]] has almost been universally replaced with High Pressure Air systems (see below)

===High-pressure air===
High-pressure air, compressed air or [[nitrogen]], is stored in the tank at a very high pressure, typically {{convert|21000|–|31000|kPa|abbr=on|lk=in}}. Output is controlled with an attached regulator, regulating the pressure between {{convert|1700|kPa|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5900|kPa|abbr=on}}, depending on the type of tank. The advantage of using regulated HPA over carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is pressure consistency and temperature stability where CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts to temperature changes causing inaccuracy and freezing during heavy use. The most popular tank size is {{convert|1100|cm3}} at {{convert|31000|kPa|abbr=on}} providing 800–1100 shots.

HPA tanks are more expensive because they must accommodate very high pressures. They are manufactured as steel, aluminium or wrapped [[carbon fiber]] tanks, the latter being the most expensive and most lightweight. Most players with electronic markers use HPA because if CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used, the marker's electronic [[Solenoid valve]] can be damaged if liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enters it.

Users are warned not put any type of lubricant in the 'fill nipple' port of a HPA tank, as petroleum may burn when subjected to highly compressed air, causing an explosion, like in a [[diesel engine]].

===Propane===
A far less common propellant is [[propane]], featured only in the [[Tippmann C3]]. Rather than simply releasing gas as in high-pressure air and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; markers, the propane is ignited in a combustion chamber, increasing pressure and opening a valve that lets the expanding gas propel the paintball. There are a number of advantages, mainly shots per tank, ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 shots (depending on the size of the tank) as opposed to the typical 1000 to 2000 shots that are standard with High Pressure Air or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks. Another advantage includes availability, as propane is readily available in many stores, whereas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and High Pressure Air are most commonly filled from compressors or pre-filled tanks, which are less common. It can also be considered safer too, because a typical high-pressure air tank holds air at {{convert|21000|-|31000|kPa|abbr=on}}, and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank at {{convert|5500|kPa|abbr=on}}, but propane is stored at {{convert|2100|kPa|abbr=on}}.

However, propane produces heat, which (when firing for an extended period at high rates of fire) can cause burns if improperly handled. It can also be a fire hazard: the Tippmann C3 releases small amounts of flames from the vents in the combustion chamber and out of the barrel when firing. If a marker develops a leak from improper maintenance, it could cause a fire.

===Gas regulation===
Marker systems have a variety of regulator configurations, ranging from completely unregulated to high-end systems using four regulators, some with multiple stages.

The regulator system affects both the accuracy and the firing velocity. Carbon dioxide regulators must also prevent liquid gas from entering the marker and expanding, causing a dangerous surge in velocity. Regulators used with carbon dioxide often sacrifice throughput and accuracy to ensure the marker operates safely. HPA-only regulators tend to have an extremely high throughput and are designed to ensure uniform pressure between shots to ensure marker accuracy at high rates of fire.

Tournament markers usually are equipped with two regulators, and another on the tank, each with a specific function. The tank regulator decreases the pressure of air from {{convert|21000|-|31000|kPa|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4100|-|5500|kPa|abbr=on}}. A second regulator is used to further reduce this pressure to near the firing pressure. This reduction allows for greater consistency. The air is then supplied to a regulator on the marker body, where the final output pressure is selected. This can be between {{convert|5500|kPa|abbr=on}} for entirely unregulated carbon dioxide markers to approximately {{convert|1000|kPa|abbr=on}} for extremely low pressure markers. After the firing pressure is decided, tournament-oriented markers use another regulator to supply gas to a separate pneumatic system, to power any other functions, such as bolt movement. This is an extremely low volume, extremely low pressure regulator, usually under {{convert|690|kPa|abbr=on}}.

==Barrels==
The marker's barrel directs the paintball and controls the release of the gas pocket behind it. Several different bore sizes are made, to fit different sizes of paintball, and there are many lengths and styles. Most modern paintball markers have barrels that screw into the front receiver. Older types slide the barrel on and screw it in place. Barrel threading must be matched to that of the marker. Common threads are: Angel, Autococker, Impulse/Ion, Shocker, [[Kingman Group|Spyder]], A-5, and 98 Custom.

Barrels are manufactured in three basic configurations: one piece, two piece and three piece. A barrel with interchangeable bores, with either two or three piece, is called a ''barrel system'', rather than a two-piece or three-piece barrel. This prevents confusion, as many two-piece barrel systems do not use an interchangeable bore system.

'''One piece''' barrels are machined from a single piece of material, usually aluminium, but stainless steel has historically been popular. Paintballs can range from .50 to .695 [[caliber]] ({{convert|0.50|-|0.695|in|mm|2|disp=output only}}), and barrels are made to match these diameters. Some one piece barrels have a ''stepped bore'' that increases from their rated bore size to around .70 caliber ({{convert|.70|in|mm|2|disp=output only}}) after {{convert|8|in}}. One-piece barrels are generally less expensive to produce and therefore to purchase, but if a different bore size is desired (for a closer fit to the size of a given brand or batch of paintballs) an entirely new barrel is required. The use of a single material for the entire barrel means that disadvantages of certain materials, such as durability (aluminum) or weight (stainless steel), cannot be mitigated.

'''Two piece''' barrels consist of a ''front'' and ''back''. The back attaches to the marker and is machined with a specified bore between .682 and .695 caliber ({{convert|.682|-|.695|in|mm|2|disp=output only}}). The front makes up the rest of the length and contains the porting. Fronts usually have a larger bore than the back. The design of a two-piece barrel allows for the use of more than one back with a front, to change the effective bore size of the barrel without changing the entire barrel. It also allows for the back to be made of a different material, or be a different color, than the front, allowing aesthetic and performance customizations.

'''Three-piece''' barrels have a single back.  A series of inserts, or ''sleeves'', with differing bores are inserted into the back. The front is attached to keep the sleeve in place. Sleeves are generally offered in either aluminium or stainless steel. Aluminium sleeves are light but can be dented or scratched easily; stainless steel versions are more resilient but carry a weight penalty. The user needs only one set of sleeves and a back for each marker. Front sections, which adjust the length of the barrel, can be interchanged. This type offers the widest selection of barrel diameters, usually .680 ({{convert|.680|in|mm|2|disp=output number only}}), .681 ({{convert|.681|in|mm|2|disp=output number only}}), .682 ({{convert|.682|in|mm|2|disp=output number only}}), .683 ({{convert|.683|in|mm|2|disp=output number only}}), and up to .696 caliber ({{convert|.696|in|mm|2|disp=output only}}).

===Length===
Typical barrels are between {{convert|76|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|530|mm|abbr=on}} long, although custom barrels may be up to {{convert|910|mm|abbr=on}} long. Longer barrels are usually quieter than shorter barrels, allowing excess gas to escape slowly. Players usually choose a barrel length between {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|mm|abbr=on}}, as a compromise between accuracy, range, and portability. Many players favor longer barrels as they permit them to push aside the large inflatable bunkers commonly used in paintball tournaments while still staying behind cover.

Most barrels are ''ported'' or ''vented'', which means that holes are drilled into the front of the barrel allowing the propellant to dissipate slowly, making the marker quieter. Porting in the first {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} of the barrel length decreases a marker's gas efficiency. For example, if a {{convert|410|mm|adj=on}} barrel has large porting that starts {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} past the threads, the ball must travel the other {{convert|250|mm}} largely on its own momentum, losing speed (due to friction) rather than gaining more speed from continued air pressure. Compensating for that requires a larger burst of gas, decreasing efficiency.  Porting too early can also dramatically increase noise, as the gas is still under a significant amount of pressure.

===Bore===
The bore is the interior [[diameter]] of the barrel. The bore must properly match the type of paint being fired, the most critical aspect of a barrel. A mismatched selection will result in velocity variations, which causes difficulty in maintaining a close match to field velocity limits and in extreme cases it can affect accuracy. Two and three-piece barrels let the barrel bore be matched to the paint diameter without needing new barrels. Correct matching is especially important in closed-bolt markers that lack ball detents because the ball will roll down, and potentially out of, the barrel. This results in either a dry fire in the event that the ball fell out of the barrel, or a lower velocity shot.

It has been proven that matching bore to paintball size is less efficient. ''Underboring'' (barrel is bored smaller than paint diameter) results in good shot consistency and efficiency. ''Overboring'' (barrel is bored bigger than paint diameter) results in good shot consistency but worse efficiency. ''Paint to barrel matching'' results in no increase in shot consistency or efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Barrel Test done by PunkWorksPaintball https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDxWqM6WS9Q&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firing and trigger modes==
Since the advent of [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] markers in the early 1990s, both insurance and competitive rules have specified that markers must be semi-automatic only; only one paintball may be fired per trigger pull. While this was a perfectly clear definition when markers were all based on mechanical and pneumatic designs, the introduction of electronically controlled markers in the late 1990s meant that technology had allowed for easy circumvention of this rule. Electronic markers are often controlled by a programmable microcontroller, on which any software might be installed. For example, software may allow the marker to fire more than once per trigger pull, called ''shot ramping''.

''Velocity ramping'' is an [[Electronics|electronic]] firing mode where a consistent, fully automatic firing rate will be triggered as long as the player maintains a low rate of trigger pulls per second.

===Pump action===
[[Pump action]] markers must be manually re-cocked after every shot, much like a [[pump action shotgun]].

Some pump action paintball markers such as the Sterling and many Nelson-based markers like the PMI Tracer and CCI Phantom offer slam-fire action, also known as an auto-trigger, which occurs when the trigger is squeezed and the marker fires with every ensuing recocking of the marker via the pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arrow-precision.co.uk/Pictures/PDF/Sterling_stp_bronze_manual.1.1.pdf |title=Sterling STP Bronze manual | accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.paintballgamers.com/| title= Paintball Guide }} Wednesday, 1 February 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semi-automatic ===
Semi-automatic markers use a variety of designs to automatically cycle a bolt and load a new paintball into the chamber with each trigger pull. This frees the player from manually pumping the marker, allowing him or her to increase the rate-of-fire.  Semi-automatic markers may have a mechanical trigger or an electronic trigger frames. An electronic trigger frame typically has a lighter trigger pull and less space between the trigger and the pressure point, allowing the player to shoot at higher rates of fire. Such frames are commonly available as upgrades to fully mechanical markers, or are integrated into the design of electropneumatic markers.

With the popularity of electronic trigger frames allowing players with such frames to achieve very high rates of fire, tournament leagues began placing limits on the maximum rate of fire of electronic markers used in their events. Manufacturers also often place their own limit on the maximum rate of fire the marker will support, to ensure reliable cycling. Such limits are called caps; tournament caps generally range from 12 to 15 balls per second, while mechanical caps vary according to the design of the marker and the firmware used. If such a cap is enforced, the marker will prevent a ball being fired less than a certain time after the last one, the time delay resulting in the desired maximum rate of fire. A trigger pull occurring before this time has elapsed will be "queued", and the marker will fire again after the delay, but most markers will limit the number of shots that can be "queued" to avoid the marker firing a number of shots after the trigger was last pulled, a so-called "runaway marker".

=== Fully automatic ===
Fully automatic markers fire continually when the trigger is pressed. The [[Tippmann]] SMG 60 was the first fully automatic paintball marker. Most electropneumatic paintball guns feature this mode. The fully automatic mode can be added to any electropneumatic marker by installing a customized logic board, or buying a completely new electronic trigger frame.

Similarly, markers can be equipped with burst modes. Ranging from between three and nine shot bursts, these modes allow the player to take accurate shots with a quick pull of the trigger, using more than one ball to increase their chances of hitting the target. In burst mode, the rate of fire can equal that of the fully automatic mode, which is useful in close range situations.

===Ramping===
''Ramping'' is a feature in some electronic markers that automatically changes the mode of fire from semi-automatic to fully automatic under certain conditions;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snipersden.com.au/look-ramping/&lt;/ref&gt; normally upon a certain number of rapid shots being fired or a minimum rate of fire achieved and sustained. Ramping can be difficult to detect because ramping modes may be inconsistently used. Ramping modes can further be hidden in the software, ensuring that a marker will fire in a legal, semi-auto mode when being tested, but an illegal ramping mode may be engaged by the player under certain conditions.

Some leagues allow a specific ramping mode to prevent problems with enforcement, and to provide a more level playing field with regard to technical skill and marker quality (and price). The rule specifies a minimum time between shots resulting in a maximum rate of fire, and that a certain number of semi-automatic shots must be fired before ramping may engage. With players consistently using a standard ramping mode, players using a different mode are more easily detected.

The rate of fire is enforced by a "PACT" timer, a standard firearms timing device that measures the time between shots. The following are common league-specific ramping modes, preset in the marker's firmware:

*'''PSP Ramping''' – Ramping begins after 3 shots; the player must maintain at least one pull per second to achieve/maintain ramping. The marker may then fire up to (and no more than) three balls per trigger pull in a "burst" fashion. Rate of fire cannot exceed 12.5 balls per second (as of 2011), even if the player pulls the trigger 5 times per second or faster.
*'''NXL Ramping''' – Ramping begins after three shots; the player needs only to hold down the trigger to maintain fully automatic fire. Rate of fire cannot exceed 15&amp;nbsp;balls per second. Firing must cease immediately upon the trigger being released.
*'''Millennium Ramping''' – Ramping begins after six trigger pulls at a minimum rate of 7.5 pulls per second; the player must maintain 7.5 trigger pulls per second to maintain ramping. Rate of fire cannot exceed 10.5 balls per second. When the player ceases to pull the trigger during ramping, no more than one extra ball may be fired after the last pull.

'''Scott Stadium''' (officially the '''Carl Smith Center, Home of David A. Harrison III Field at Scott Stadium'''), also known as '''The Ranch''', located in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;The stadium is actually in [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]], which encloses but does not include the City of Charlottesville. However, it is served by the Charlottesville post office. For more details, see the University's official "Building Category Map", which clearly shows the city-county boundary and Scott Stadium within the county, downloadable [http://www.web.virginia.edu/srem/teams/ here].&lt;/ref&gt; is the home of the [[Virginia Cavaliers football]] team. It sits on the University of Virginia's Grounds, east of [[Hereford College]] and first-year dorms on Alderman Road but west of [[Brown College at Monroe Hill|Brown College]] and [[the Lawn]]. Constructed in 1931, it is the oldest active football stadium in Virginia.

It also hosts other events, such as concerts for bands that can fill an entire stadium, such as the [[Dave Matthews Band]] in 2001, [[The Rolling Stones]] in 2005, and [[U2]] in 2009. The [[Virginia High School League]] held its Group AAA Division 5 and 6 football state championship games at the stadium until 2015. The facility has also hosted the Division I [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship]] in 1977 and 1982 and the ACC Women's Lacrosse Tournament in 2008.

==History==
Built as a replacement for the old [[Lambeth Field]] or "Colonnades," Scott Stadium bears the name of donor and University Rector Frederic Scott, and held 25,000 spectators at opening. The stadium had a view of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and specifically [[Monticello]] Mountain out the south end of the stadium. An artificial turf system was installed in 1974, making the long tradition of a mounted Cavalier riding into the stadium with the football team impossible. David A. Harrison III provided a gift allowing natural grass to be reinstalled in the stadium, and the Cavalier has ridden into Scott Stadium every game since 1995. Another unique feature of Scott Stadium is the Adventures of Cavman, which takes place a few minutes prior to kickoff, on the videoboard. In this computer generated skit, the [[mascot]] of the opposing team is causing trouble on the Grounds of UVA, and the Cavalier slays him, then rides to the stadium via the Grounds. After the skit is over, the live Cavalier rides onto the field accompanied by orange and blue fireworks.

==Stadium expansion projects==

===1981===
The first expansion to the stadium's capacity came in 1981, when upper decks and grass hill seating allowed 40,000 fans.

===2000===
Carl Smith's donations helped make the most recent contributions to Scott Stadium in 2000, filling in the upper deck and south end to allow 20,000 additional fans, and installing the pergola, state-of-the-art lighting and gigantic audio/visual tower known as "Hoo-Vision," as well as a new lighting system placed on towers with "V's" built in. The facility's official name is a result of this string of donations.

===2009===
Scott Stadium received a new scoreboard and a larger video screen, Hoo Vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UVA Getting Gargantuan Video Screen for Stadium|first=Brian|last=McNeill|url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/uva_getting_gargantuan_video_screen_for_stadium/23625/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120311173954/http://www2.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/uva_getting_gargantuan_video_screen_for_stadium/23625/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 11, 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Progress]]|location=Charlottesville|date=June 18, 2009|accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
Traditionally, men wear coats and ties and women wear [[sundress]]es to games, which is also tradition at [[University of Alabama|Alabama]], [[Auburn University|Auburn]], [[University of Georgia|Georgia]], [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]], [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State]], [[Tulane University|Tulane]], and [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]]. Beginning during the 2003 season, however, head coach [[Al Groh]] called upon fans to set aside traditional attire for orange clothing. 
The T-shirt movement has been welcomed by many, but ties and sundresses can still be easily spotted at Scott Stadium among students and alumni. Some have compromised by wearing ties with orange dress shirts or orange sundresses. ''[[The Cavalier Daily]]'', the University's daily student-published newspaper, weighed in on the debate in its September 1, 2005, lead editorial.&lt;ref name="cd"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2005/09/the-dress-up-debate/|title=The Dress-Up Debate|newspaper=[[Cavalier Daily]]|date=September 1, 2005|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Declaration'', an alternative weekly news magazine at the University, also ran a feature story on the debate prior to the 2006 home opener.&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;{{cite web |title=Orange Fever|first=Logan|last=Riddick|url=http://www.the-declaration.com/index.php?issuedate=2006-09-07&amp;showarticle=1446|work=The Declaration|date=September 7, 2006|accessdate=September 5, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928203720/http://www.the-declaration.com/index.php?issuedate=2006-09-07&amp;showarticle=1446|archivedate=September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable games==

===September 8, 1990: #14 Virginia 20, #9 Clemson 7===
UVa entered this game with an 0–29 record against Clemson. The win was Virginia's first-ever victory over an opponent ranked in the top ten. Both goalposts came down when the fans stormed the field; the first actually fell with 48&amp;nbsp;seconds still on the clock. The win proved to be something of a watershed in UVA football history in that it set the stage for the 1990 squad to begin the season 7&amp;ndash;0, rising to #1 in the polls for the first time. In addition, in contrast to Virginia's historical futility against Clemson prior to the 1990 game, as of 2013 UVA has beaten Clemson eight times (and tied once) since that 1990 win, although since 2004 the schools no longer play every year due to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]'s expansion.

===November 3, 1990: #16 Georgia Tech 41, #1 Virginia 38===
The Yellow Jackets ended Virginia's three-week reign at #1 in the polls as they overcame a two-touchdown halftime deficit to win on Scott Sisson's 37-yard [[field goal (gridiron football)|field goal]] with 0:07 left. Undefeated Georgia Tech would go on to win the rest of its games to take a share of the National Championship.

===November 2, 1995: #24 Virginia 33, #2 Florida State 28===
This nationally-televised contest was the first Thursday night game played at Scott Stadium and marked Florida State's first loss in an ACC game (after winning its first 29). In arguably the greatest victory in Virginia football history, FSU running back [[Warrick Dunn]] was stopped inches from the south end zone goal line after taking a direct snap on the game's final play. Fans stormed the field and brought down both goalposts, a feat not since repeated at Scott Stadium.

===November 16, 1996: Virginia 20, #6 North Carolina 17===
With [[Mack Brown]]'s squad poised to clinch a spot in the [[Bowl Alliance]], UVA trailed North Carolina 17–3 in the fourth quarter and the Tar Heels were driving for the knockout blow when Antwan Harris picked off a third-down pass and returned it 95&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. Following quarterback Tim Sherman's touchdown scramble on the Hoos' next drive, kicker Rafael Garcia hit the game-winning 32-yard field goal with 0:39 left. In this installment of the [[South's Oldest Rivalry (UNC-Virginia)|South's Oldest Rivalry]], Virginia extended North Carolina's winless drought in Scott Stadium to 15 years with the 20–17 upset.

===October 15, 2005: Virginia 26, #4 Florida State 21===
Ten seasons after the 33-28 milestone, Virginia's 1995 ACC Co-Championship squad was honored in a halftime ceremony. UVA went on to win in a 26&amp;ndash;21 upset for its first victory over FSU since the 1995 game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia Shocks No. 4 Florida State|author=Associated Press|url=http://virginiasports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/101605aaa.html|publisher=University of Virginia Athletics|date=October 16, 2005|accessdate=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quarterback [[Marques Hagans]] threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns, and Connor Hughes kicked four field goals in the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia Repeats History, Holds Off Florida State|author=Associated Press|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/16/sports/sp-top25sep16|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 16, 2005|accessdate=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the game a large part of the crowd [[pitch invasion|stormed the field]], with some fans climbing the goalposts. The celebration was marred, however, by the fact that 12 people were injured in the stampede accompanying the rush to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fear and football: Stampede Taints UVA Victory|first=Courteney|last=Stuart|url=http://www.readthehook.com/files/old/stories/2005/10/27/newsFearAndFootballStamped.html|newspaper=[[The Hook (newspaper)|The Hook]]|location=Charlottesville|date=October 27, 2005|accessdate=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selhurst Park''' is an [[association football]] stadium located in the London suburb of [[Selhurst]] in the [[London Borough of Croydon|Borough of Croydon]]. It is the home ground of [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace Football Club]] playing in the [[Premier League]]. The stadium was designed by architect [[Archibald Leitch]] and opened in 1924. The stadium has hosted one international football match as well as games for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. Part of the stadium incorporates a branch of [[Sainsbury's]]. The stadium was shared by [[Charlton Athletic F.C.]] from 1985 until 1991 and then by [[Wimbledon F.C.]] from 1991 until 2003.

==History==
In 1922 the site, a former brickfield, was bought from the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company]] for £2,570. The club had been pursuing a deal for the ground as early as 25 February 1919.&lt;ref name="Peskett"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Crystal Palace Story | publisher=Roy Peskett Ltd. | author=Peskett, Roy | year=1969 | pages=15–16, 78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium, designed by Scottish stadium architect [[Archibald Leitch]], was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around £30,000, and was officially opened by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] on 30 August 1924.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book | title=Crystal Palace: The Complete Record 1905-2011 | publisher=The Derby Books Publishing Company | author=King, Ian | year=2011 | pages=67–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was then only one stand, the present Main Stand, but this was unfinished due to industrial action; Crystal Palace played [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and lost 0–1 in front of 25,000 fans.&lt;ref name="Peskett" /&gt;

Two years later, on [[St David's Day]] in 1926, [[England national football team|England]] played [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in an international at the stadium.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there,&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; as were other sports including [[boxing]], [[bicycle polo]] (in the late 1940s) and [[cricket]] and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted two games for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf#page=47 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 45–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the stadium's first [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] were installed consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof mounted installations on the Main Stand,&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; but were replaced nine years later by floodlights mounted on pylons in each corner and six installations on the Main Stand roof. [[Real Madrid]] marked the occasion by playing under the new set of bulbs – a real footballing coup at the time for third division Palace, as it was Real's first ever match in London.&lt;ref name="Peskett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

The ground remained undeveloped until 1969, when Palace were promoted to [[Football League First Division|Division One]] (then the highest tier of English football) for the first time. The Arthur Wait Stand was built, and is named after the club's long-serving chairman, who was a builder by trade and was often seen working on the site himself.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; [[Arthur Wait]] was notable for overseeing Palace's rise from the 4th to the 1st Division in the 1960s. The Whitehorse Lane end was given a new look when a "second tier" of terracing, brick-built refreshments and toilets were provided along the top.

The Safety of Grounds Act required the Holmesdale Road terrace (the preferred stand for the Crystal Palace supporters) to be split into three sections for safety reasons. The remaining poorer facilities were mainly where opposition supporters were situated. New facilities were subsequently built at the back of the Holmesdale Stand. In the summer of 1981, the Main Stand terraced enclosure was redesigned and refitted with seating. This year also saw Palace sell the back of the Whitehorse Lane terrace and adjacent land to supermarket retailer [[Sainsbury's]] for £2m, to help their financial problems.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; The size of the terrace at this end was effectively halved.

[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] moved into the stadium as temporary tenants in 1985, and became with Palace the first league clubs in England to agree such a ground-sharing scheme.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; The following year, chairman [[Ron Noades]] purchased the stadium from the club as a means of raising revenue. In the summer of 1990, the lower half of the Arthur Wait Stand was converted into all-seater with the assistance of Football Trust Grant Aid, following the Taylor Report into the [[Hillsborough Disaster]]. Two rows of executive boxes (48 in total) were constructed above the Whitehorse Lane terrace (on the roof of Sainsbury's supermarket) in 1991 and this was subsequently roofed and made all-seater in the summer of 1993.

[[File:Selhurstmural.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Centenary year (2005) [[mural]] above the entrance to the players lounge at Selhurst Park.]]
Charlton moved back to [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]] via [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]]'s [[Boleyn Ground]], and [[Wimbledon F.C.]] replaced them as tenants in 1991.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; The Holmesdale terrace was demolished in 1994 and replaced a year later with a two-tiered 8,500 capacity stand.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; The roof cladding of the main stand was also replaced, the previous one having started to leak. Some 23 years on, this remains the most recent major work to be carried out at Selhurst Park.

When [[Mark Goldberg]] bought Crystal Palace, he bought just the club.  Former Palace chairman [[Ron Noades]] retained ownership of the Selhurst Park ground, having purchased it from the club in 1986. Chairman [[Simon Jordan]] took out a ten-year lease on the ground upon his purchase of the club in 2000, and Noades received rent from Palace. [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes|relocated]] to [[Milton Keynes]] in 2003,&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; a section of their fans already having decamped to the newly established [[AFC Wimbledon]] in protest, when the old club were given permission by the FA to move in 2002.

Palace chairman Jordan stated that he had completed a purchase of the freehold of Selhurst Park from Altonwood Limited (Ron Noades' company) for £12m in October 2006. However, Simon Jordan never owned the freehold or had any interest in it and his reasons for claiming he had bought it are unknown. Ownership was in fact held by Selhurst Park Limited, a joint venture between [[HBOS]] and the Rock property empire owned by [[Paul Kemsley]], a former director of Tottenham Hotspur. In April 2008, a 25-year lease was granted to Crystal Palace at an annual rent of £1.2m.

The Rock Group went into administration in June 2009, the management of the freehold was taken on by [[PwC]] acting on behalf of [[Lloyds Banking Group|Lloyds Bank]], which now own HBOS. PwC expected to sell it within two years.&lt;ref name=Times3&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/construction_and_property/article6881640.ece PwC kicks off sale of Kemsley’s trophy assets], ''The Times'', 20 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The club and Selhurst Park stadium were purchased by the CPFC 2010 consortium in June 2010, leading to the stadium and Football Club being united in a company for the first time since 1998.

January 2011 saw CPFC 2010 announce plans to redevelop the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]], the club's original home, in five years' time. However, opposition from Crystal Palace residents and Bromley council have seen the plans become increasingly infeasible, resulting in suggestions that Selhurst Park should be redeveloped gradually similar to the [[Molineux stadium]] (home to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]]).{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In June 2012, Crystal Palace co-chairman [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]] approached [[Rugby Union]] team [[London Welsh RFC|London Welsh]] about a possible ground-share. London Welsh's promotion to the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] was in doubt, as their plans to play their matches at [[Kassam Stadium]] were deemed unsuitable by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]].&lt;ref name=InsideCroydon&gt;[http://insidecroydon.com/2012/06/01/palace-make-late-bid-to-bring-premiership-rugby-to-selhurst/ Palace make late bid to bring Premiership rugby to Selhurst], ''Inside Croydon'', 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== The stands ==
[[File:Selhurst Park Stadium.jpg|thumb|350px]]

=== Holmesdale Road Stand ===
Capacity of stand: '''8,329'''

The Holmesdale is a double-tiered stand (Lower tier 5,510, Upper tier 2,819) on the south side of the stadium. Built 1994-95, this is the newest stand in the stadium, replacing the previous terrace end. It forms the SE end of the stadium.

=== Arthur Wait Stand ===
Capacity of stand: '''9,574'''

Part of this stand seats the away supporters (approx. 3,000), the 'Arthur Wait' stand named after the then chairman opened in 1969. It forms the NE side of the stadium.

=== Main Stand ===
Capacity of stand: '''5,460 + Press Seats (63)'''

This original stand opened in 1924 includes the Directors Box, new offices/Main Entrance were built at the rear of the stand during the nineties, meanwhile the exterior of the Main Stand has been re-cladded in white replacing the old original blue painted corrugated iron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28418">In 1951, the government of [[Finland]] authorized the striking of the first modern Olympic coin, a 500 [[Finnish mark|Markka]].  At first, the coins circulated as [[currency]] in the issuing country and the mintages were high. In borrowing from the traditions of ancient Greece, the coins were a memento of the 1951 Games, and a coin that [[Numismatics#Numismatists|numismatists]] could now add to their collection. With the exception of Canada's Lucky Loonie program and its 2007 25-cent pieces to commemorate the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games, it is rare that Olympic coins are minted for circulation. Traditionally, Olympic coins are numismatic coins.
.&lt;ref&gt;Coins of the Modern Olympic Games, Volume 1, Michele Menard, page 8, {{ISBN|1-895321-00-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However several host countries minted so many coins particularly silver that their value has become just slightly above the value of their metal content. Coins for the 1976 Montreal, 1984 Los Angeles, and 1988 Seoul are generally considered to fall into that category.

==2000 Sydney Olympics==
This set has been very popular with collectors, with people still trying to get hold of a complete set. The first coin in this set was sold out at the mint very quickly and it has left a lot of people with incomplete sets.

===Olympic Gold Proof Coin Collection===
* The eight gold coins of the collection depict the athlete's journey from the inspiration of the Games logo, through dedication to the task, preparation for the event and final achievement. The coins have been released progressively from October 1997 to February 2000. The worldwide mintage of gold coins is limited to only 30,000 per design.
* All the gold coins carry the 'P' mintmark of The Perth Mint and bear the year 2000, making them the first coins of the year 2000. Colour is used on selected gold coin designs - another first for Australian and official Olympic Games coins. Each coin is accompanied by a serial-numbered certificate of authenticity and is presented in a green presentation case.

'''Sydney Showground Speedway''', originally known as the Speedway Royal and later the Speedway Royale but often referred to as just The Royale or The Showground, was a dirt [[Dirt track racing]] venue at the old [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]] used from 1926 until 1996.

==History==
In 1937, The Showground was claimed to the fastest speedway in the world by the tracks promoters. The {{convert|509|m|yd|abbr=off}} egg shaped track was also the site of some spectacular crashes, some unfortunate deaths and a lot of spectacular racing. Although [[Motorcycle Speedway|solos]] were first to race at the showground on 21 July 1926, they were soon joined by [[Sidecar speedway|sidecars]] and [[Midget car racing|Speedcars]] (also known as Midgets but called Speedcars in Australia). In the 1950s [[stock cars]] began to appear joined much later by demolition derbies and jumping motorcycles over buses and the Royale would attract huge spectator attendance.

The track had a dolomite surface, which the speedway drivers and riders continually asked the owners, the [[Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales|Royal Agricultural Society of NSW]], to mix in shale and clay (as used on tracks in [[England]] such as [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]) to improve traction but this never happened. A long stated reason for this was that the Showground was also used year-round as a [[harness racing]] venue (though this excuse wore thin after the 'trotts' moved permanently to the [[Harold Park Paceway]] in the late 1940s). The only other major complaint about the track itself was that it was very narrow compared to other speedways. Where most tracks allowed three wide racing even in the corners, at the Showground there was barely enough room for two cars.

The speedway's pits were located under the Martin &amp; Angus Stand at the southern end of the track. This created a unique atmosphere with the place often filling with cigarette smoke and the smell of oil and petrol. Former dual Rugby international and part-time announcer at the speedway [[Rex Mossop]] once described the pits at the Royale as being like "Dantino's Inferno".

The start / finish line at the Showground was on the eastern side of the track in front of the Suttor Stand. Running anti-clockwise as most speedway divisions do, the track then moved into the Bull Pens for turn 1, so called as this was where the cattle would enter the arena during the [[Sydney Royal Easter Show|Royal Easter Show]]. The track announcers box was located close to the track above the Bull Pens. They then continued past the double decked Members Stand and the famous clock tower sitting on the roof, and into what riders called "The Armpit", a tight turn leading onto the back straight where the Coronation Stand stood. Turns 3 and 4 went past Martin &amp; Angus Stand and the pits before passing the Sinclair Stand in turn 4 and coming onto the main straight to finish the lap.

Although the Showground was later universally known as a Speedcar track, from the late 1920s until the 1950s the speedway was more known for its motorcycle racing, hosting many [[Individual Speedway Australian Championship|Australian Solo Championship]] and [[Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship|Australian Sidecar Championship]] meetings as well as Solo test Matches between [[Australia national speedway team|Australia]] and various visiting nations. The first test at the Showground was held on 15 December 1934 between Australia and [[Great Britain national speedway team|Great Britain]] with Australia winning 35-19 in front of 50,000 paying fans. In March 1933, The Royale hosted the unofficial [[Speedway World Championship]], won by [[England]]'s [[Harry Whitfield]] from Australian's [[Billy Lamont (speedway rider)|Billy Lamont]] and future World Champion [[Bluey Wilkinson]].

During the 1960s and 1970s the Showground was Australia's best known and best attended speedway regularly drawing crowds on a Saturday night in excess of 10,000 and often over 30,000 making speedway one of the best attended spectator sports during the Australian summer. The speedway's promotor, John Sherwood (Empire Speedways who also promoted the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]), was always looking for ways other than the racing itself to keep the crowds coming in. One of the more popular was the addition of [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] [[stripper]]s as trophy girls.

From 1947 until 1974 the Speedway hosted the annual [[Australian Speedcar Grand Prix]], following which the race moved to the [[Liverpool Speedway]] in western Sydney before returning to the Showground in 1990. NSW drivers Ray Revell and Andy McGavin won a record 5 Speedcar Grand Prix's at the Showground while [[Bob Tattersall|Bob "Two Gun" Tattersall]] of the [[United States]] won the race four times in 1960, 1962, 1966 and 1969.

One of the more unusual things at the speedway happened on 28 December 1975 when the so-called "Speedway Streaker" made his only appearance. Unlike the usual [[Streaking|streakers]] at sporting events who jump the fence and run around on the field until caught by either [[Police]] or [[Security]], this streaker rode out of the pits on a Solo motorbike completely naked other than a [[Motorcycle helmet|full faced helmet]] (to protect the guilty) and riding shoes. He did a quick lap of the track before laying the bike down on the infield. He was last seen jumping over the fence being chased by laughing policemen. Years later the streaker was revealed to be local solo rider Reg McCarthy.

The Speedway ran continuous Saturday night meetings until the close of the 1980/81 season with Sydney fans spoiled for choice with the [[Parramatta City Raceway]] running on Friday nights and the Showground as well as [[Liverpool Speedway]] both running on Saturday nights. Like other suburban based speedways around Australia such as [[Rowley Park Speedway|Rowley Park]] in [[Adelaide]], the local residents around the showground began to complain not only about the noise but also the cars parking on the streets as the showground had very little in the way of designated car parks. With some residents having powerful friends on the [[City of Sydney]] council who made increasing restrictions on noise and parking and demanded that meetings be finished no later than 10:30pm (meetings traditionally finished around 11:30pm). This, combined with the advent of [[World Series Cricket]] in 1977 attracting a lot of the spectators, forced the speedway to close for regular meetings after 1981. What was hard to take for the promoter of the Showground, [[Brisbane]] based speedcar driver Ron Wanless, was that noise tests were conducted which proved that speedway meetings were actually quieter than sporting events at the neighbouring [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], the Royal Easter Show and open air music concerts held at either venue. Traffic was also reportedly less of a problem on speedway nights than for the Easter Show or when sports such as [[rugby league]] or [[cricket]] used the SCG.

The showground enjoyed a brief revival in 1988 as a [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentennial]] Solo Test Match was held between [[Australia national speedway team|Australia]] and [[Great Britain national speedway team|Great Britain]] attracting around 15,000 spectators. Unfortunately for the local fans, Great Britain defeated Australia on the night. The last ever Solo Test Match to take place at the Showground was held on 1 January 1994 with Australia taking on [[England national speedway team|England]]. Like the first ever Test at the Showground in 1934, Australia dominated and won 68 points to 40 in front of a crowd of just over 17,000.

After 13 races held at the Liverpool Speedway, the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix returned to its traditional home as the Speedways only annual car racing event from 1990 until 1993 when the event was moved from the Speedway due to the same complaints that closed the Showground as a speedway in 1980, but returned for one last time in 1996 as the Showground was to be closed and turned into [[Fox Studios Australia]]. The 46th Australian Speedcar Grand Prix was held on 20 April. The race was won by the only competitor who had previously raced at the speedway, Australian speedway legend and 10 times [[Australian Sprintcar Championship|Australian Sprintcar Champion]] Garry Rush from western Sydney. It was his second win in the Grand Prix as he had won the 1977 event held on the asphalt at the [[Liverpool Speedway]].

One week later on Saturday 27 April 1996, approximately 25,000 fans saw Garry Rush win the last ever race held at the world-famous Sydney Showground Speedway when he took out the World Derby for Speedcars in a fitting end to the Showgrounds life as a speedway. Rush's wins in the last two main events at the Showground were for the same team with whom he had raced for at the venue some 30 years previously.

Visiting American driver [[Jay Drake]] set the Showground lap record at the 20 April Grand Prix meeting when he ran the 509 metre oval in 16.876 seconds. When asked what he thought of the famous track, Drake described it as "Awfully narrow".

==Present day==
The old Sydney Showgrounds and the Showground Speedway is now owned by and is part of [[Fox Studios Australia]] and although it now has a paved surface the track, and its narrow width, is still clearly visible.

==Fatalities==
The Sydney Showground Speedway, like other speedways of the era, saw its share of competitor fatalities. In total there were 28 deaths at the speedway between 1926 and 1973. In December 2000, a plaque was unveiled at the Fox studios site of the former Speedway by longtime track announcer Jim Shepherd. The plaque overlooks the former start line alongside the Suttor Stand (built in 1909) which is now a cafe restaurant.

'''Wavertree Sports Park''' is a large sporting, exercise and leisure complex located in the [[Wavertree]] area of [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. The sports park is home to the Liverpool Aquatics Centre, Liverpool Tennis Centre and Wavertree Athletics Centre alongside numerous other health and fitness related facilities.

==Liverpool Tennis Centre==
Liverpool Tennis Centre has six indoor acrylic tennis courts and six outdoor macadam tennis courts, four of which are floodlit.  The venue was built with funding from the Lawn Tennis Association, Sport England and Liverpool City Council.  It has hosted major tennis competitions, including the Liverpool International Tennis Tournament in 2003 and the Nike Junior International in 2013 and 2014. Until recently, the Centre was closed to the public during the day but is now open from 9.00am every day for coaching and pay-and-play customers.

== Liverpool Aquatics Centre ==
The Liverpool Aquatic Centre is a £17million development. It opened on 15 March 2008. The development has two swimming pools, one Olympic standard 8-lane 50 metre pool and a smaller four lane 20m pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colsc.net/htm/lac.htm http://www.colsc.net/htm/lac.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It cost £2.1million to maintain in 2008.&lt;ref name=lac-cost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/01/31/liverpool-s-olympic-swimming-pool-cost-taxpayers-1-5m-64375-22822908/|title= Liverpool's Olympic swimming pool cost taxpayers £1.5m|last=Bartlett|first=David|date=31 January 2009|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fund the build, £13m was borrowed by Liverpool City Council. The final bill will be £31m, once the debt is repaid in 2008, at a cost of £1.3m a year.&lt;ref name=lac-cost /&gt;

==Wavertree Athletics Centre==
[[File:Athletics track, Wavertree Playground - geograph.org.uk - 39239.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior athletics track]]
The Wavertree Athletics Centre was a training facility for the 2012 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7275361.stm|title= Olympic training venues - North West|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 January 2010 | date=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity of the athletics stadium is 480. There is an outdoor 8 lane 400 metres synthetic running track and an interior 4-lane 60 metre track. It is home to Liverpool Harriers and Athletic Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolharriers.co.uk|title=Liverpool Harriers|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium hosted the first ever baseball World Cup game in 1938.
