'''Achasanseong Fortress''' is an earthen mountain fortress of the Korean [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period.  Originally built by [[Baekje]], it was occupied in turn by each of the Three Kingdoms.  It stands on [[Achasan|Achasan Mountain]], in [[Gwangjin-gu]], [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], at an altitude of 200 meters above [[sea level]].  It has a [[perimeter]] of roughly 1 kilometer and an [[area]] of about 3375 m².  

The first mention of this fortress in historical records comes from the ''[[Samguk sagi|Samguk Sagi]]'''s statement that [[King Chaekgye of Baekje]] ordered it to be fortified against an expected [[Goguryeo]] invasion.  At that time, Achasanseong Fortress would have played a key role in the defense of the Baekje capital [[Hanseong]] from the north.  

In 475, Goguryeo overran this and the other defenses of Baekje, and [[King Gaero of Baekje]] was brought to Acha and executed.  The fortress and the rest of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] valley were conquered by [[Silla]] in 553.  The Goguryeo general [[Ondal (Goguryeo)|Ondal]] later died here while trying to reclaim the fortress.

Achasanseong Fortress was designated as a historic landmark in 1973, and has since become a common local tourist destination.

In 2011, it was replaced by the [[Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board]].

==History==
The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau was established  by the [[Swiss parliament]]. Operations began in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bfu.admin.ch/en/index.htm Welcome to the website of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau]." ([https://www.webcitation.org/6GGE6rgtc?url=http://www.bfu.admin.ch/en/index.htm Archive]) Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau. Retrieved on 30 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The bureau was headquartered on the grounds of [[Payerne Airport]] and in [[Payerne]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bfu.admin.ch/en/bfu_lageplan.htm How to find us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724115331/http://www.bfu.admin.ch/en/bfu_lageplan.htm |date=24 July 2010 }}."

Retrieved on 9 June 2009. "Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau AAIB Aeropole 1 Route de Morens 1530 Payerne Switzerland "&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally the original aircraft accident reports were written in the language of the Swiss region where the aircraft accident occurred. Some reports had English versions available.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bfu.admin.ch/en/dokumentation_berichte.htm Reports]." ([https://www.webcitation.org/6AU6ALBoR?url=http://www.bfu.admin.ch/en/dokumentation_berichte.htm Archive]) Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.

The agency was disestablished on 1 November 2011 when it and the [[Investigation Bureau for Railway, Funicular and Boat Accidents]] merged to form the [[Swiss Accident Investigation Board]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uvek.admin.ch/org/00469/02946/02958/index.html?lang=en Swiss Accident Investigation Board SAIB]."

'''''Amorosa visione''''' (1342, revised c. 1365) is a narrative poem by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], full of echoes of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' and consisting of 50 canti in ''[[terza rima]]''. It tells of a dream in which the poet sees, in sequence, the triumphs of Wisdom, Earthly Glory, Wealth, Love, all-destroying Fortune (and her servant Death), and thereby becomes worthy of the now heavenly love of Fiammetta. The triumphs include mythological, classical and contemporary medieval figures. Their moral, cultural and historical architecture was without precedent, and led [[Petrarch]] to create his own ''[[Trionfi (poem)|Trionfi]]'' on the same model. Among contemporaries [[Giotto]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] stand out, the latter being celebrated above any other artist, ancient or modern.

The '''Battle of Mamma''' took place in 690 between the Arab Muslim forces of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and the [[Berbers]] led by [[Kusaila|Caecilius]] of [[Kingdom of Altava]].

==Background==
The [[Arabs|Arab]] general [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] had led his men in an expedition across north Africa, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean and marching as far south as the [[Draa River|Draa]] and [[Sous River|Sous]] rivers. On his return to the east, he was ambushed by the Berber-Byzantine coalition led by Caecilius at the [[Battle of Vescera]] in which he was defeated and killed in 682.&lt;ref name=Conant&gt;{{cite book | last = Conant | first = Jonathan | title = Staying Roman : conquest and identity in Africa and the Mediterranean, 439-700 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 0521196973 | pages = 280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caecilius at that time held undisputed mastery over North Africa and marched to [[Kairouan]] in triumph.&lt;ref name="Conant"/&gt;

When [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] became the [[caliph]], he was effective in increasing the size of his empire. Therefore, he ordered [[Zuhair bin Qais Al-Balawi]] who was stationed in [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] to lead an army to retake [[Ifriqiya]] and its capital Kairouan.

In order to mount a stronger resistance, Caecilius took a position in the [[Aurès Mountains]] in which he can manage to retreat in case of defeat, while the Muslim leader Zuhair took a decision to camp outside Kairouan near the water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = El Hareir| first1 = Idris| last2 =M'Baye | first2 = Ravane| title = The Spread of Islam Throughout the World, Series: Different aspects of Islamic culture, 3| publisher = UNESCO Publishing | location = Paris, France | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-92-3-104153-2 | pages = 309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a heavy battle in the valley of Mamma, the Arab invaders eventually managed to defeat the defending troops and to kill their legendary king Caecilius.

==Aftermath==
The Arab leader Zuhair and his troops went back to [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] to fight against the invading [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. The incoming ships of Byzantines came with large number of soldiers in which they defeated the Arabs and killed Zuhair.

[[Dihya]] succeeded Caecilius as the war leader of the Berber tribes and opposed the encroaching Arab Islamic armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Dynasty]]. Another Arab general [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] marched from Egypt and captured the major Byzantine city of [[Carthage]] and other cities after the [[Battle of Carthage (698)|Battle of Carthage]]. Searching for another enemy to defeat, he was told that the most powerful monarch in North Africa was Dihyā, and accordingly marched into [[Numidia]]. The armies met near [[Meskiana]] in the present-day province of [[Oum el-Bouaghi]], [[Algeria]]. She defeated Hasan so soundly that he fled Ifriqiya and holed up in [[Cyrenaica]] for four or five years.

The '''Diocese of Karaganda''' is a Latin [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[suffragan]] in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of the Metropolitan of [[Mary Most Holy in Astana]], yet remains subject to the missionary [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]].

Its [[cathedral]] episcopal see is the Marian Cathedral of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], in the city of [[Karaganda]] in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/dps/html/dps-ka_karaganda.php Diocese of Karaganda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104050715/http://ucanews.com/dps/html/dps-ka_karaganda.php# |date=2010-01-04 }} at Union of Catholic Asian News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/1589/In_the_land_of_the_Gulag_a_statement_of_faith_in_the_future.aspx Catholic World Report: "In the land of the Gulag, a statement of faith in the future - A new cathedral in Kazakhstan has been dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima" by Joanna Bogle] September 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The city also had the former Cathedral of St. Joseph.

Promoted on 1999.07.07 as Diocese of Karaganda, losing territory to establish [[Apostolic Administration of Astana]], [[Apostolic Administration of Almaty]] and [[Apostolic Administration of Atyrau]].

== Statistics ==

The '''Democratic Party for a British Gibraltar''' ('''DPBG''') was a [[British unionism|Pro-British]] [[political party]] in [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name="Gold2012"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Gold|title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6ZnmbCBJtkC&amp;pg=PT77|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-27674-5|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the disbandment of the [[Integration with Britain Party]], the '''Gibraltar Democratic Movement''' was established in 1976 in response to the British government stating that integration with the United Kingdom or independence were not viable options for the territory.&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p325 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially led by [[Joe Bossano]], a union leader and founder of the IWBP,&lt;ref&gt;McHale, p324&lt;/ref&gt; and won four seats in the [[Gibraltar general election, 1976|1976 elections]].&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; Prior to the [[Gibraltar general election, 1980|1980 elections]] the party was taken over by [[Peter Isola]] and was renamed the "Democratic Party for a British Gibraltar".&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; As a result, Bossano left the party to form the [[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party]].

The [[Gibraltar general election, 1980|1980]] the party won six seats,&lt;ref&gt;McHale, p327&lt;/ref&gt; failing to replace [[Joshua Hassan]]'s [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? | first=Peter| last=Gold | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=0-415-34795-5 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Gibraltar general election, 1984|1984 elections]], the DPBG was replaced by the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party as the main opposition party, having failed to secure any seats.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, p60&lt;/ref&gt; It was dissolved some time later.

{{Politics of Benin}}

[[Benin]] is divided into 12 [[Department (subnational entity)|departments]] (French: ''départements''), and subdivided into 77 [[commune (subnational entity)|communes]] (see [[Communes of Benin]]). In 1999, the previous six departments were each split into two halves, forming the current 12. Each of the six new departments was assigned a capital in 2008.

A '''Euro container''' or '''KLT''' box (from {{lang-de|'''Kleinladungsträger'''}}, “small load carrier”) is an industrial stacking container conforming to the '''VDA 4500''' standard. The standard was originally defined by the [[German Association of the Automotive Industry]] (VDA) for the automotive industry but subsequently adopted across many other areas of manufacturing and the shipping industry. The most common sizes are 600mm×400mm and 400mm×300mm and meaning that these stack easily on to a [[Euro-pallet]] measuring 1200mm×800mm.

The '''European Heritage Heads Forum''' (EHHF) is an informal professional and expert network that brings together the heads of the European state heritage authorities (built heritage, landscapes, archaeology, etc.) to share knowledge and ideas and promote consistency in the management of the historic environment in the 21st century. The heads are mostly the directors-general of the departments in charge of immovable heritage within the national relevant ministries (Ministry of Culture, Environment, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stubbs|first1=John H.|last2=Bouchenaki|first2=Emily G.

Discussion centres on emerging trends, political engagement, European legislation and the scope of international heritage protection and how these affect national heritage policies and impact upon historic monuments, sites and urban centres. The Council of Europe, the European Commission, as well as the representatives of the civil society are associated with the activities of the EHHF by attending the annual meetings and encouraging the impact assessment of the cultural heritage sector at EU level. The EHHF acts as an advocate for heritage and produces strong statements on specific issues to support common concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News article|url=http://www.europanostra.org/news/335/|website=Europa Nostra|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Heritage Heads Forum in Oslo|url=http://www.riksantikvaren.no/en/Topics/International-activities/International-Project-News/European-Heritage-Heads-Forum-in-Oslo|website=Riksantikvaren|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A European Heritage Summit was first organised in London on 26–28 April 2006 by Dr. [[Simon Thurley]], former Chief Executive Officer of [[English Heritage]]. The mission of the Summit was to gather for the first time the European heritage leaders who had the opportunity to exchange their experience and initiate common actions. It was attended by 23 European states which agreed in the Final Statement to continue to meet annually as a forum of European heritage heads, known as the “European Heritage Heads Forum”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thurley|first1=Simon|title=European Heritage|url=http://simonthurley.com/european-heritage/|website=Simon Thurley|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following EHHF annual meetings have been successively hosted by different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warr|first1=Alexandra|title=The Conservators' Guide to European Institutions|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/european-institutions/european-institutions.htm|website=Building Conservation|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the EHHF annual meeting was attended by a record of 26 European states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of participants|url=http://ehhf.eu/sites/g/files/g1439326/f/201407/EHHF_Participant_list.pdf|website=EHHF|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The EHHF Troika ==
The steering committee of the EHHF is a Troika composed of the head, or heads, of heritage of the country which hosted the annual meeting in the previous year and the heads of the countries which will host the subsequent two meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Statement 2006|url=http://ehhf.eu/sites/g/files/g1439326/f/201408/EHHF_2006_ACTION_PLAN_final.pdf|website=EHHF|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troika meetings are chaired by the host of the next annual meeting. Future hosting countries are chosen by general agreement at the annual meeting.

== The EHHF Secretariat ==
The EHHF Secretariat reports to the Troika and is responsible for organising the annual meetings, circulating information to EHHF members, following-up the actions agreed by the EHHF, maintaining the EHHF website and upholding the original purpose for the informal meeting of the heads of the European heritage agencies to:

== The European Heritage Legal Forum ==
The European Heritage Legal Forum (EHLF) was founded in 2008 following the EHHF annual meeting held in Copenhagen, Denmark. The heads agreed in their Final Statement to the creation of a sub-committee to improve their capacity for early identification of EU legislation which may pose a potential threat to cultural heritage. A forum of legal experts appointed by the national competent authorities was subsequently formed which reports to the EHHF. The mission of the EHLF is to ensure that relevant information on the development and potential consequences of proposed legislation developed by the European Union is circulated in a timely manner to heritage state authorities. In addition to this monitoring task, the EHLF may make recommendations to the EHHF for revised wording of the draft legislation and possible exemptions for cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Final Statement 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karl Goehner|first1=Wolfgang|title=EHLF|url=http://www.w-goehner.de/joomla/ehlf.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EHLF (European Heritage Legal Forum)|url=http://www.dnk.de/international/n2329?node_id=2331|website=Deutschen Nationalkomitee für Denkmalschutz|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3225">:This article is about a historic Polish law.
'''''Incompatibilitas''''' (a [[Latin]] term, meaning "incompatibility") was a principle instituted in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] (later, from 1569, in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]), which forbade an individual to hold two or more official [[public administration|administrative]] positions. The principle of ''incompatibilitas'' evolved in the 15th-16th centuries in response to a demand from '''middle''' and '''lesser nobility''' (''[[Szlachta]]''), and it was designed to curtail the sway of more powerful '''high nobility'''/[[aristocracy]]/[[plutocracy]] (the ''[[Magnate]]s'').

The specific acts of law that constituted the ''incompatibilitas'' rule were bans on holding:
* a [[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district office]] simultaneously with a [[starosta]]'s office ([[przywilej czerwiński]], 1422);
* two separate district offices;
* a [[voivode]]'s office simultaneously with a starosta's office ([[przywilej nieszawski]], 1454);
* a [[kanclerz]]'s (chancellor's) office simultaneously with a starosta's, voivode's or [[castellan]]'s office;
* a voivode's or castellan's office simultaneously with a starosta's office (1538);
* two or more city starosta offices (''starostwo grodowe'') (1562 or 1563);
* a voivode's and castellan's offices simultaneously with another [[Political minister|minister]]ial office other than that of [[hetman]] (1565, as each of those offices, except that of hetman, granted its holder a seat in the [[Senate of Poland]], a [[privy council]] rather than an upper chamber).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071107020120/http://www.bezuprzedzen.pl/urzedy/poczatki.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonwealth ministers were the equivalents of modern central-government officials. There were 10 officials (5 for Poland, 5 for Lithuania): a ''Great Crown Marshal'', ''Great Lithuanian Marshal'', ''Great Crown Chancellor'', ''Great Lithuanian Chancellor'', ''Crown Deputy Chancellor'', ''Lithuanian Deputy Chancellor'', ''Great Crown Treasurer'', ''Great Lithuanian Treasurer'', ''Court Crown Marshal'' and ''Court Lithuanian Marshal''. The Court Marshals were considered subordinate to the Great Marshals. [[Lithuania]]n ministers, while enjoying the same powers as [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Crown]] ministers, were considered to be lower in the hierarchy. Hetmans were also considered "ministers" but had no seat in the ''Senat''.

The '''International Rhine Regulation Railway''' ({{lang-de|Internationale Rheinregulierungsbahn}}) was an [[industrial railway]] situated on both banks of the [[Alpine Rhine]] river to the south of its outfall into [[Lake Constance]]. Large parts of the line have been preserved. As this stretch of the Rhine forms the international boundary between [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], the railway is located in both countries.&lt;ref name=strecke&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its name suggests, the railway's original purpose was to assist in the engineering works needed to regulate the Rhine in this area - the so-called [[Rhine Regulation]]. It is constructed to [[750 mm gauge railways|750 mm gauge]] ({{track gauge|750mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) and is partially electrified at 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]] using overhead lines.&lt;ref name=alpb&gt;{{cite web

'''Kärdla Airport''' ({{lang-et|'''Kärdla lennujaam'''}}, {{airport codes|KDL|EEKA|p=n}}) is an [[airport]] in [[Estonia]]. The airport is situated {{convert|7|NM|lk=in}} east&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; of the town of [[Kärdla]] on [[Hiiumaa]] island.

The airport has an asphalt runway, 14/32, and is {{convert|1520|x|30|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; The runway was upgraded in 1998.

==Overview==
Kärdla Airport opened in 1963. During the next years there was fairly high activity at the airport, with regular flights to [[Tallinn]], [[Haapsalu]], [[Vormsi]], [[Kuressaare]], [[Riga]], [[Pärnu]], [[Viljandi]] and [[Tartu]], and charter flights to [[Murmansk]], [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]]. 24,335 passengers travelled via Kärdla Airport in 1987. Air traffic sank dramatically after Estonia became independent in 1991, and in 1995 only 727 passengers travelled via the airport. Since then the traffic has increased again, and 10,551 passengers travelled via the airport in 2010.

The airport has annual Flight Days in the first weekend of August.

On 23 November 2001, an airplane with 17 people on board crashed on its way from Tallinn to Kärdla, near Palade at Hiiumaa. Two people died in the crash. The investigation and the trial still continues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisemin.gov.ee/atp/index.php?id=2097]{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [http://www.planecrashinfo.com/2001/2001-61.htm Plane Crash Info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315185001/http://www.planecrashinfo.com/2001/2001-61.htm |date=March 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luxembourg for Finance''' (LFF) is the Agency for the Development of the [[Luxembourg]] Financial Centre.

==Introduction==
The agency is a public-private partnership between the Luxembourg government&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/|title=gouvernement.lu // L’actualité du gouvernement du Luxembourg - Accueil|website=www.gouvernement.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Luxembourg Financial Industry Federation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourgforfinance.com/en/about-us/luxembourg-finance/profil-luxembourg|title=PROFIL Luxembourg|work=Luxembourg for finance|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which brings together the various trade bodies of the Luxembourg financial sector, such as the Luxembourg Banker’s Association, the [[Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry#cite note-ALFI appoints Denise Voss as Chairman-2|Luxembourg Investment Fund Industry]] or the Association of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies in Luxembourg.

==Purpose==
Founded in 2008, its objective is to help develop and diversify Luxembourg’s [[financial services]] industry, position the financial centre abroad and identify new business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/investir/secteurs-cles/finance/acteurs-publics/index.html|title=Acteurs publics|access-date=2017-03-14|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; LFF connects international investors to the range of financial services provided in Luxembourg, such as [[investment fund]]s, [[wealth management]], capital market operations or advisory services.

==Rankings==
The Luxembourg Financial Centre is ranked as the leading financial centre in the Eurozone and 2nd in the European Union after London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wort.lu/en/business/global-financial-centres-index-luxembourg-ranks-3rd-most-competitive-european-financial-centre-57062aa91bea9dff8fa75bef#|title=Global Financial Centres Index: Luxembourg ranks 3rd most competitive European financial centre|date=2016-04-07|work=Wort.lu|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''livre''' was the currency of [[Luxembourg]] until 1795. It was subdivided into 20 ''[[solidus (coin)|sols]]'', each of 4 ''liards''. In the late 18th century, coins were issued in denominations of ½ and 2 liards, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 72 sols, with the lower three denominations in copper, the highest minted in silver and the others in [[Billon (alloy)|billon]]. The last issues of 1795 were 1 sol coins minted during the [[Siege of Luxembourg (1794–1795)|siege of Luxembourg]].

[[File:Microstates.PNG|upright=1.4|thumb|The world's five smallest sovereign states by area, from largest to smallest: [[San Marino]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]] shown in the same scale for size comparison.]]
[[Image:BlankMap-World-v5 small states.PNG|upright=1.4|thumb|Map of the smallest states in the world by land area. Note many of these are not considered microstates.]]

A '''microstate''' or '''ministate''' is a [[sovereign state]] having a very small population or very small land area, and usually both. The meanings of "state" and "very small" are not well-defined in international law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Warrington, E. (1994). "Lilliputs Revisited". ''Asian Journal of Public Administration'', 16(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Recent attempts, since 2010, to define microstates have focused on identifying political entities with unique qualitative features linked to their geographic or demographic limitations. According to a qualitative definition, microstates are: "modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf|title = Microstates as Modern Protected States: Towards a New Definition of Micro-Statehood|last = Dumienski|first = Zbigniew|date = 2014|journal = |accessdate = 2014-06-07|doi = |publisher = Centre for Small State Studies|series = Occasional Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this and most other definitions, examples of microstates include [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], [[Andorra]], [[Cook Islands|the Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].

The smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is [[Vatican City]], with 842 citizens as of July 2013 and an area of only {{convert|44|ha}}. However, some scholars dispute qualifying the Vatican as a state, arguing that it does not meet the "traditional criteria of statehood" and that the "special status of the Vatican City is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the Pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions, and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations."&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, M. (1972). "Diminutive States in the United Nations". ''The International and Comparative Law Quarterly'', 21(4), pp.609–630.&lt;/ref&gt;

Microstates are distinct from [[micronation]]s, which are not recognized as sovereign states. Special territories without full sovereignty, such as the [[Crown Dependencies|British Crown Dependencies]], [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|the Chinese Special Administrative Regions]] and [[overseas territories]] of [[Danish Realm|Denmark]], [[Overseas territories of France|France]], the [[Dutch Caribbean|Netherlands]], [[States and territories of Australia|Australia]], [[Dependencies of Norway|Norway]], the [[United States insular area|United States]] and the [[Overseas territories of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], are also not considered microstates.

== Quantitative definitions of microstates and their limitations ==
Most scholars identify microstates by using a quantitative threshold and applying it to either one variable (such as the size of its territory&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet, O. &amp; Tahiroglu, M., 2002. Growth and equity in microstates: Does size matter in development? International Journal of Social Economics, 29(1/2), pp.152–162.&lt;/ref&gt; or population&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, P.J. &amp; Herr, R.A., 2008. Microstate diplomacy in the south pacific. Australian Outlook, (April 2012), pp.37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;) or a composite of different variables.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, G.L., 1975. Impact of Very Small Size on the International Behaviour of Microstates (International Studies), SAGE Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is agreed that microstates are the smallest of all states, there is no consensus on what variable (or variables) or what cut-off point should be used to determine which political units should be labelled as "microstates" (as opposed to small "normal" states).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Neemia, U., 1995.

While employing simple quantitative criteria may seem straightforward, it can also be perceived as potentially problematic. According to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as "inconsistency, arbitrariness, vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Qualitative definitions==
In response to the problems associated with the quantitative definitions of microstates, some academics have suggested finding states with unique features linked to their geographic or demographic smallness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Amstrup, N., 1976. The Perennial Problem of Small States: A Survey of Research Efforts. Cooperation and
Conflict, 11(2), pp. 163–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Neumann, I.B. &amp; Gstöhl, S., 2004. Lilliputians in Gulliver’s World ? Small States in International Relations.&lt;/ref&gt; Newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oest, K.J.N. &amp; Wivel, A., 2010. Security, profit or shadow of the past? Explaining the security strategies of microstates. Cambridge Review of International Affairs, 23(3), pp. 429–453.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, it has been argued that such approaches could lead to either confusing microstates with weak states&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (or [[failed states]]) or relying too much on subjective perceptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Microstates as modern protected states ===
In order to address both the problems with quantitative approaches and with definitions based on qualitative features, it has been argued that a useful and meaningful way to isolate microstates from other types of states, would be to see them as "modern protected states".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): "microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or [[dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as: [[Liechtenstein]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], [[Niue]], [[Andorra]], [[the Cook Islands]] or [[Palau]].

== Historical anomalies and aspirant states ==
A small number of tiny sovereign political units are founded on historical anomalies or eccentric interpretations of law. These types of states, often labelled as "microstates," are usually located on small (usually disputed) territorial enclaves, generate limited economic activity founded on [[tourism]] and [[philatelic]] and [[numismatic]] sales, and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded.

One example is the [[Republic of Indian Stream]], now the town of [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]]—a geographic anomaly left unresolved by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the U.S. Revolutionary War, and claimed by both the U.S. and Canada. Between 1832 and 1835, the area's residents refused to acknowledge either claimant.

Another example is the [[Cospaia Republic]], which became independent through a treaty error and survived from 1440 to 1826. Its independence made it important in the introduction of tobacco cultivation to Italy.

Another is [[Couto Misto]], disputed by Spain and Portugal, that operated as a [[sovereign state]] in its own right until the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1864)|1864 Treaty of Lisbon]] that partitioned the territory, with the largest part becoming part of Spain.

'''NME Radio''' was a radio station operated under ''[[NME]]'' magazine branding, that broadcast an  [[alternative music]] format. It first began broadcasting on 24 June 2008 and ceased on 25 March 2013. The station was revived in 2018 at http://www.nme.com/audio.

== History ==
[[File:Reading festival radio 1 tent 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Radio 1/NME tent at the 2005 [[Reading Festival]]]]
Initial plans for an NME-branded radio station were revealed to the media in late 2007 by Sammy Jacob, creator of [[XFM]], who left the station following its purchase by [[Global Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/xfm-co-founder-to-launch-nme-radio/036608|title=Xfm co-founder to launch NME Radio|work=Music Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station began operating under licence soon after by DX Media, a company operated by Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sophie Morris |title=My Life In Media: Sammy Jacob |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-life-in-media-sammy-jacob-842666.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plunkett&gt;{{cite news |author=John Plunkett |title=NME Radio to go up against Xfm |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/24/commercialradio.ipc |work=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |date=24 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast from studios in the Blue Fin Building in [[South Bank (London)|South Bank]], [[London]], also home to [[IPC Media]], NME Radio was launched on 24 June 2008 with its first track being "[[Knights of Cydonia]]" by British rock band [[Muse (band)|Muse]].&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/nme-radio/37562 |title=Muse song first ever played on NME Radio |publisher=NME Radio |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday 11 June 2010, almost two years after its launch, [[The Guardian]] reported that NME Radio was to cease broadcasting on [[DAB digital radio]], [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media]] and [[Freesat]] platforms, and would revert to an online only "[[jukebox]]" format after DX Media had decided to end the agreement to operate the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.6003 | title= NME Radio To Leave DAB | publisher= Radio Today | date= 11 June 2010 | accessdate= 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10317346 | title= NME digital radio service pulled | publisher= BBC News | date= 15 June 2010 | accessdate= 15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2010, IPC Media signed a new licence agreement with local radio group [[Town and Country Broadcasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/21/nme-radio-town-and-country-broadcasting | title= NME Radio to bring back presenters | publisher= The Guardian | date= 21 July 2010 | accessdate= 22 July 2010 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett}}&lt;/ref&gt; NME Radio relaunched in September 2010 and returned to some regional digital audio broadcasting (DAB) multiplexes. The station returned to Freesat and Sky, where it was available until 5 December 2011. Following the new licensing agreement, operation sites were split between IPC Media's London HQ and Town and Country Broadcasting's station in south Wales, [[Nation Radio]].

The Town and Country incarnation of the station ceased broadcasting on 25 March 2013 at midday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/nme-radio-comes-to-unexpected-end/054109|title=NME Radio comes to unexpected end|work=Music Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==

Under the control of DX Media, NME Radio featured 16 hours of live broadcasting with a variety of presenters. Following the stations purchase by [[Town and Country Broadcasting]], some daytime programmes were initially introduced.

== Availability (at time of demise) ==
* [http://nmeradio.com Online]
* [[DAB Radio]] – Cardiff &amp; Newport Multiplex, Berkshire &amp; North Hampshire Multiplex.

'''NRJ Belgique''' is a private [[Belgium|Belgian]] radio station broadcasting in [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], and is the Belgian version of the popular [[France|French]] radio station [[NRJ]].

==History==
On 24 June 1994, the Belgian version of NRJ is created by the [[NRJ Group]].

== NRJ Hits TV ==
NRJ Hits TV is Belgium's first and only television channel broadcasting non-stop video clips from French, Belgian and international artists 24/7. It was launched in 2014 as an internet channel, but went on cable/satellite in 29 March 2016. The promise is "Hit Music Only".

In fact, on the plan, Marco Leulier, the channel's program director, found that it was not necessary to broadcast all day, every day music videos only. Formerly, there was a plan of creating an MyNRJ-style block on NRJ Hits TV, but this was later removed.

The channel has three fundamentals:
* 100% Music: A strong promise of musical exclusively programming. This isn't the playlist on the NRJ radio station. The sequences of the clips are mixed to ensure viewers have the best listening experience.
* 100% Hits: A program schedule largely emphasizes on hit music with a focus on recently-released songs.
* Big events: NRJ Hits TV covers every NRJ-produced musical events across the world.

Here're programs broadcast on the channel until 24 August 2017:
* ''Morning Hit'': Daily 7-9am.
* ''Teen Pop'': Daily 4-5pm.
* ''Frenchits'': Daily 5-6pm.
* ''Extravadance'': Fridays and Saturdays 8pm-midnight.
* 4 extra programs each Wednesday and Sunday: ''Clip List'' (6-8pm), ''Live Hits'' (8-9pm), ''Cover Hit'' (9-10pm), ''Rap &amp; RnB Non Stop'' (10pm-midnight).
* ''Le Hit NRJ'': Saturdays 6-8pm.
* ''Hit des Clubs'': Fridays 6-8pm.
* ''Hit Music Only'': All other times.
* There may be a special broadcast from 8pm to midnight on Thursday.

Here're programs broadcast on the channel since 25 August 2017:
* ''Hit Music Only'': Daily 9am-4pm &amp; 8pm-7am.
* ''Morning Hit'': Daily 7-9am.
* ''Teen Pop'': Daily 4-5pm.
* ''Frenchits'': Daily 5-6pm.
* Programs from 6pm to 8pm: ''Eurohot 30'' (Monday &amp; Thursday), ''Hit NRJ'' (Tuesday &amp; Saturday), ''Clip List'' (Wednesday &amp; Sunday) and ''Hit des Clubs'' (Friday).

==Frequencies==
{{emptysection|date=March 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2028">Symbols of [[Latvia]] are items or symbols that have symbolic meaning to, or represent, [[Latvia]]. These symbols are seen in official capacities, such as [[flag]]s, [[coats of arms]], [[postage stamp]]s, and [[currency]], and in [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s. They appear less formally as recurring themes in  [[Latvian literature|literature]], art and [[folk art]], [[heraldry]], monuments, clothing, personal decoration, and as the names of parks, bridges, streets, and clubs. The less formal manifestations may be classified as [[national emblem]]s.

During the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupation]] of Latvia by the [[Soviet Union]] and briefly by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], the anthem, coat of arms and flag were prohibited from display and the [[Sovietization of the Baltic states|Soviet versions]] of the [[Flag of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|flag]], [[Emblem of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|coat of arms]] and the [[Anthem of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|anthem]] were used during its rule as a [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet republic]]. All national symbols of Latvia were reinstated in 1990 before Latvia restored its independence a year later which are considered the [[State continuity of the Baltic states|continuation]] of the Latvian state before its occupation in 1940. The public display of the [[Nazi]] [[swastika]] and the Soviet [[hammer and sickle]] along with other symbols associated with them are now banned in Latvia in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1502">'''Nusa-kor-kamuy''' (ヌサ・コﾙ・カムイ) is an [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[kamuy]]'' (''god'').  Called the ''community-founding kamuy'', he represents the dead and serves as a messenger to the other ''kamuy''.

==Mythology==
Nusa-kor-kamuy is the originator of ''nusa'' or ''inau'', sacred carved wands that represent the ''kamuy'' in Ainu ritual.  He is responsible for maintaining the row of ''inau'' arranged outside of a traditional Ainu dwelling, and he carries the ''inau'' and other offerings to the gods, along with humans' messages of reverence.  He is called upon to assist in rituals, ensuring that the respect behind them is properly conveyed to the ''kamuy''.  He is assisted in his tasks by [[Yushkep Kamuy]], the spider goddess.&lt;ref name="ash"&gt;Ashkenazy, Michael. ''Handbook of Japanese Mythology''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-Clio, 2003. 225-226&lt;/ref&gt;

Nusa-kor-kamuy is usually said to be the brother of the snake god, [[Kina-sut-kamuy]], but sometimes the two are regarded as a single entity. Nusa-kor-kamuy is also sometimes presented as a female deity.

The '''Rimland''' is a concept championed by [[Nicholas John Spykman]], professor of international relations at Yale University. To him geopolitics is the planning of the security policy of a country in terms of its geographical factors. He described the [[sea|maritime]] fringe of a country or continent; in particular the densely populated western, southern, and eastern edges of the Eurasian continent.

He criticized Mackinder for overrating the Heartland as being of immense strategic importance due to its vast size, central geographical location and supremacy of land power rather than sea power. He assumed that the Heartland will not be a potential hub of Europe, because:

# Western Russia was then an agrarian society
# Bases of industrialization were found to the west of the Ural mountains.
# This area is ringed to the north, east, south, and south-west by some of the greater obstacles to transportation (ice and freezing temperature, lowering mountains etc.).
# There has never really been a simple land power–sea power opposition.

Spykman thought that the Rimland, the strip of coastal land that encircles [[Eurasia]], is more important than the central Asian zone (the so-called [[The Geographical Pivot of History|Heartland]]) for the control of the Eurasian continent. Spykman's vision is at the base of the "[[containment]] politics" put into effect by the United States in its relation/position to the Soviet Union during the post-World War II period.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Thus, 'Heartland' appeared to him to be less important in comparison to 'Rimland.'

==Concept==
According to Spykman, "Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia, who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world."

The Rimland, [[Halford Mackinder]]'s "Inner or Marginal Crescent", was divided into three sections:
* The [[Europe]]an [[coast]] land;
* The [[Arabian]]-[[Middle Eastern]] [[desert]] land; and,
* The [[Asia]]tic [[monsoon]] land.
Rimland or inner crescent contains most of world's people as well as large share of world's resources. Rimland is in between Heartland and marginal seas, so it was more important than Heartland. It included Asia minor, Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, South East Asia, China, Korea and East Siberia except Russia.

All the aforesaid countries lie in the [[buffer zone]] that is between sea power and land power.

Rimland countries were amphibian states, surrounding the Eurasian continents.

While Spykman accepts the first two as defined, he rejects the simple grouping of the Asian countries into one "monsoon land." [[India]], the [[Indian Ocean]] [[littoral]], and [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] were geographically and [[civilization]]ally separate from the [[China|Chinese]] lands.

The Rimland's defining characteristic is that it is an intermediate region, lying between the heartland and the marginal sea powers.  As the amphibious buffer zone between the land powers and sea powers, it must defend itself from both sides, and therein lies its fundamental security problems. Spykman's conception of the Rimland bears greater resemblance to [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]'s "debated and debatable zone" than to Mackinder's inner or marginal crescent.

The Rimland has great importance coming from its demographic weight, natural resources, and industrial development. Spykman sees this importance as the reason that the Rimland will be crucial to containing the Heartland (whereas Mackinder had believed that the Outer or Insular Crescent would be the most important factor in the Heartland's containment).

==Applicability==
He called for the consolidation of the Rimland countries to ensure their survival during World War II. With the defeat of Germany and the emergence of the USSR, Spykman's views were embraced during the formulation of the Cold War American policy of containing communist influence.

But as the states within the Rimland had varying degree of independence, and a variety of castes, races, and culture, it did not come under the control of any single power.

==Criticism==
* It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
* In his concept of air power he did not include the use of modern missiles with nuclear war heads.
* The Rimland is not a region but a unit, otherwise the epitome of geographical diversity.
* The Rimland-Theory is biased towards Asian countries.
* The Rimland-Theory does not take into the various conflicts going on between its different countries (India vs. Pakistan, etc.)

'''Rodrigo Afonso''' ([[floruit|fl.]] late 15th century) was a Portuguese colonial administrator.

==Biography==
His early life is unknown.  He was probably born on Ribeira Grande (now [[Cidade Velha]]) and was the first colonial governor who was born in Cape Verde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rulers.org/rulc1.html#Cabo_Verde|title=Cape Verde|website=rulers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Cape_Verde.html|title=Cape Verde|website=worldstatesmen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was probably was one of the first Portuguese people born in Cape Verde.  He was likely a son of the explorer [[Diogo Afonso]].

He was later the 2nd and last captain of Northern [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]].  He was donated the island of [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]] in 1490 and became captain on from October 29, 1497 until 1505 and three days later for Boa Vista Island.  The main administration of Southern Santiago would be ruled only by the [[List of colonial governors of Cape Verde|corregedor of Cape Verde]], from 1588 to 1975 as governor.

'''Saint Eulalia’s flag''' or [[pennon]] is the historical flag of [[Barcelona]] and one of its main symbols. Over a maroon background it is represented the figure of the city’s patron through a saltire, its main attribute. Early twentieth Century, the flag was held on City Council balcony every [[February 12]], [[Eulalia of Barcelona|Saint Eulalia]] of Barcelona’s Day.&lt;ref&gt;«[http://culturapopular.bcn.cat/ca/festes-i-tradicions/personatges-i-elements-festius/peno-de-santa-eulalia Bandera de Santa Eulàlia]». Cultura popular de Barcelona. Barcelona: Institut de Cultura de Barcelona Web (CC-BY-SA via OTRS).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two versions of the same emblem: The pennon and the flag. The pennon is lighter, is the ancient military standard. On the other hand, the flag is bigger and it had a ceremonial use. Saint Eulalia’s flag has an important historical meaning because it waved in City Council balcony in 1713 when the Council decided to [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–14)|resist]]. It was also the standard held by Rafael de Casanova when he was hurt in the last attack for the city defence, 11 September 1714.

The ensign, usually allocated in Tercentenary room of the City House, was shown in solemn acts, both lay and religious, as well as in the calls to citizens to defend the city against foreign enemies.

'''Sammarinese''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˌ|m|ær|ɪ|ˈ|n|iː|z}}) is the demonym for the people of the country of [[San Marino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of SAMMARINESE|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Sammarinese|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waldman|first1=Carl|last2=Mason|first2=Catherine|title=Encyclopedia of European peoples|date=2006|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=9781438129181|pages=690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
San Marino recognizes two official languages: [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romagnol dialect|Sammarinese]]. Approximately 83 percent of the population speak Sammarinese, which is considered a variation of the [[Emiliano-Romagnolo dialect]], found in the surrounding Italian region. While Italian is the language of everyday use, phrases and idioms from Sammarinese are used.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==Religion==
Although historically San Marino fought against the political control of the [[Holy See]], most Sammarinese people are [[Catholic]], but there is no [[state religion]]. Many of San Marino's official ceremonies are held in the [[Basilica di San Marino]], the republic's main church, or in other churches. There are a total of nine Catholic [[parishes]] all of which comprise the [[diocese]] of San Marino.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of San Marino - history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, family, social, marriage|url=http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/San-Marino.html|website=www.everyculture.com|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association===
"We are delighted that the SBCA Board of Directors has agreed to form a Foundation. Our industry has a presence in every state," said SBCA Executive Director, Joe Widoff. "Workers and their families live in thousands of communities throughout the country and the goal of the Foundation is to help meet the needs of these communities in meaningful ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hager|first=Amy|title=SBCA Announces the SBCA Foundation|url=http://sbca.org/high-speed-news/2011/021711.html|accessdate=March 15, 2011|date=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FCC===
{{Main|Federal Communication Commission}}

==Detail==
The Fourth Circuit acknowledged that both [[Direct-broadcast satellite|DBS]] and [[cable television]] operators engage in speech protected by the First Amendment when making channel and content selections. However, the court endorsed the holding in Turner that preserving "free" broadcast television constituted a content-neutral measure that imposes only incidental burdens on speech sufficient to pass muster using intermediate First Amendment scrutiny. The court held that imposing mandatory carriage requirements on satellite television operators furthers an important, narrowly drawn governmental interest:
#preserving a multiplicity of local broadcast outlets; and
#preventing the grant of a compulsory copyright license from undermining broadcast television competition, an outcome that could occur should DBS operators deprive their customers access to non-network broadcast stations.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Frieden, Analog and Digital Must-Carry Obligations of Cable and Satellite Television Operators in the United States, Pennsylvania State University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress Options===
*It could have decided to give satellite carriers a station-by-station copyright license that could be used free of carriage obligations([http://www.4thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/ 4th Cir]. 2001)
*The other choice was to impose the carry one, carry all rule in order to create a market-by-market copyright license([http://www.4thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/ 4th Cir]. 2001)
'''The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]''' has said that the "principal inquiry in determining content neutrality...is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of [agreement or] disagreement with the message it conveys". This inquiry involves two steps.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Minor Benjamin, professor, Duke University School of Law, Telecommunication Laws and Policy, Oct, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*First: we must examine the plain terms of the regulation to see whether, on its face, the regulation confers benefits or imposes burdens based upon the content of the speech it regulates. if it does not, we then ask whether the regulation's manifest purpose is to regulate speech because of the message it conveys.

:&lt;blockquote&gt; Each satellite carrier providing, under section 122 title 17, secondary transmissions to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station shall carry upon request the signals of all television broadcast stations located with in that local market.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Marguerite. "Verizon CEO slams Net neutrality". http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-10379932-266.html. Retrieved 2 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:we disagree. SHVIA's carriage&lt;ref&gt;International telecommunication union, John wily, Sept,10,2002&lt;/ref&gt; obligations are not triggered simply by the  decision to carry a local broadcast station in a given market. instead, they are triggered by the decision to carry that station by making use of the 122 license. A satellite carrier that privately negotiates the required copyright clearances can retransmit the signal of a [http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/cblbdcst.html local broadcast station] without incurring any carriage obligations, but a carrier that retransmits the same signal by means of the statutory copyright license must comply with the carry one, carry all rule.&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Weiser, University of Colorado, Telecommunication, Oct,2002&lt;/ref&gt; thus, the burdens of the rule do not depend on a satellite carrier's choice of content, but on its decision to transmit that content by using one set of economic arrangements rather that another. Accordingly, we hold that the carry one, carry all rule is content neutral on its face&lt;ref&gt;James B. Speta, Northwestern Law School, Telecommunication Laws and Policy, Oct, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
*Second: We must decide whether the carry one, carry all rule in content-based in it purpose. the satellite carriers claim that the rule has a content-based in its purpose. The satellite carriers claim that the rule has a content-based purpose because it seeks to promote the survival of independent broadcast stations, including affiliates of emerging networks, [http://www.chicagonewscoop.org/independent-station%E2%80%99s-power-lies-with-its-people/ commercial independent stations], and public broadcasting stations. in support of this claim they cite language from the Conference Report indicating that Congress was concerned that satellite carriers would choose to carry only affiliates of the major networks and that other [http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/cblbdcst.html local broadcasters]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/cblbdcst.html local broadcasters] Cable television fact sheet, Cable Carriage of Broadcast Stations&lt;/ref&gt; would be cut off from portions of their potential viewing audiences. in addition, the satellite carriers rely on legislative history suggesting that Congress sought to protect local broadcast stations because those station s provide valuable news and public affairs programming to their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Howard A. Shelanski
Georgetown Law School, Telecommunication policy, Washington D.C., Sept, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress Decision===
Congress chose the second because it feared that cherry picking of major network affiliates within local markets would make it more difficult for non-carried stations in those markets to reach their audiences

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the conferees expect that subscribers who receive no broadcast signals at all from their satellite service may install antennas or subscribe to cable service in addition to satellite service, the Conference Committee is less sanguine that subscribers who receive network signals and hundreds of other programming choices from their satellite carrier will undertake such trouble and expense to obtain over-the-air signals from independent broadcast stations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4thcoa.courts.state.tx.us 4th Cir. 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Difference between Cable and Satellite===
*'''Cable''' systems are local, and nearly all have enough channel capacity to carry all the broadcast stations in their local market and still provide an attractive mix of national and regional non-broadcast programming.&lt;ref&gt;275.F.3d. 337-US, January 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Satellite'''The satellite carriers, in contrast, currently beam the same 450 to 500 channels throughout the continental United States and thus could not comply with the rule requiring them to retransmit the signals of each of the country's roughly 1,600 local broadcast stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/011151.P.pdf] Feb 13, 2002 UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&lt;/ref&gt;

===The proposed legislation violates federal law===
Additionally, this 10-day notice period runs afoul of federal law as it is a restriction that unreasonably delays or prevents installation, maintenance or use of satellite services. The FCC derived its authority to create the OTARD Rule via the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] ("1996 Act"). In Section 207 of the 1996 Act, Congress directed the FCC to "promulgate regulations to prohibit restrictions that impair a viewer's ability to receive video programming services through devices designed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service, or digital broadcast satellite services."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbca.com/assets/pdf/SBCA-Testimony-CT-Feb172009.pdf] Testimony of Lisa V. McCabe Director, Public Policy and Outreach, Feb 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

===Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act&lt;ref&gt;Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act [section] 110 report: a report of the Register of Copyrights, February 2006 / U.S. Copyright Office.&lt;/ref&gt;===

==== Historical Introduction ====
Three statutory licenses in the Copyright Act ("Act") govern the retransmission of distant and local over-the-air broadcast station signals. There is one statutory license applicable to cable television systems and two statutory licenses applicable to satellite carriers.which are license 111, license 109, and license 120&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. House. Committee on the Judiciary, Satellite Home Viewer Extension and&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Then and Now ====
*Recent changes in the video programming marketplace and in video distribution technology are shaking the foundations of the communications industry and the law. The Internet, [[digital television]], and video services using Internet Protocol, have changed the way individuals receive and consume all types of media. Traditional cable and satellite services are losing subscribers and market share to these newer technologies. There is also less interest in programming retransmitted over distant [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/audio/bcast.html broadcast signals] as a result of these new platforms and systems. These fundamental shifts call into question the appropriateness of the current statutory licensing systems in the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Communications Commission, FCC ISSUES NOTICE REGARDING MEASUREMENT STANDARDS FOR DIGITAL TELEVISION SIGNALS PURSUANT TO SATELLITE HOME VIEWER EXTENSION AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2004, US Fed News Service, Including US State News, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[television|Broadcast television stations]] are changing the scope and breadth of their services, too. Digital television technology allows broadcasters to provide more programming choices to over-the-air viewers as well as to cable and satellite subscribers. Digital television stations now provide a mix of high definition and standard definition broadcast signals and may possibly offer interactive television services in the future. More importantly, such stations are able to "[[multicast]]" by splitting their digital signals into smaller streams each of which may be independently programmed. It is axiomatic that the digital television transmissions are much different than traditional analog transmissions. For that reason, the existing distant signal licenses, whose foundations were built upon analog broadcast technology, cannot readily accommodate the [http://www.digitaltv-labs.com/?go=About~us,Press vibrant capabilities of digital television].

===Extended Signal Importation Opportunities===
SHVERA provides [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] operators with better opportunities to import distant broadcast signals into markets lacking "local-into-local&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/shvera.html]&lt;/ref&gt;" delivery of nearby signals and localities unserviced by terrestrial broadcast network signals. 
'''local-into-local''' means that if a satellite customer lives in an area where the satellite company has decided to provide the service, the customer can receive local TV channels. If the company decides that it will not provide local broadcast stations in an area, the consumer may still receive local broadcast stations by using an antenna or basic cable service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/shva/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retransmission of Distant Digital Network Signals===
SHVERA also offers [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] operators the opportunity to deliver distant digital network signals into "digital white areas" where the nearest network broadcaster does not currently offer digital content, or where adequate off-air reception does not occur.

====Summary====

The satellite and cable regulatory frameworks attempt to balance a number of longstanding, but potentially conflicting, public policy goals—most notably, localised, competitive provision of video services, support for the creative process, and preservation of free over-the-air broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Goldfarb, Reauthorizing the Satellite Home Viewing Provisions in the Communications Act and the Copyright Act: Issues for Congress, Specialist in Telecommunications Policy February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They also attempt to balance the interests of the satellite, cable, broadcast, and program content industries. Congress incorporated the sunset provisions in SHVERA&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/crs/R40624_020210.pdf] Charles B. Goldfarb, SHRDDNS Report&lt;/ref&gt; because of its concern that market changes could affect these balances.
The statutory provisions distinguish between the retransmission of local signals—the broadcast signals of stations located in the same local market as the subscriber—and of distant signals. Provisions block or restrict the retransmission of many distant broadcast signals in order to protect local broadcasters from competition from distant signals and to provide them with a stronger negotiating position vis-à-vis the satellite and cable operators, with the intention of fostering local programming. But the regulatory framework also recognizes that [https://www.census.gov/population/www/ U.S. households] benefit from the receipt of certain distant broadcast signals and includes explicit retransmission and copyright rules for these.

==Ruling==

===Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/shva/shvia.pdf] at 106th Congress First Session, in the state of united states, Nov 17th, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;===
This Act modified the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988. SHVIA permits satellite broadcasters to provide local broadcast TV signals to all their subscribers in that local TV station's market. SHVIA also permits satellite broadcasters ([http://www.itvdictionary.com/definitions/satcaster_definition.html/ satellite broadcasters]. 2000-2001) to provide "distant" or national broadcast programming to subscribers. SHIVA Fact Sheet&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/policy/shvera.doc] information sheet, Oct, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Famous Quote''' The Act also imposes a "carry one, carry all" rule, which was designed to "preserve free television for those not served by satellite or cable and to promote widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Carry one.carry all'''&lt;ref&gt;Ted Hearn, Plan Allows Satellite Giants To Down Convert HD Signals For Years, Multichannel News, 3/19/2008&lt;/ref&gt;
The National Association of Broadcasters, which did not return requests for comment, is probably going to be unhappy because the FCC plans to allow DirecTV and Dish to down convert broadcasters' HD signals to a less pristine picture resolution for several years.
The satellite giants-which combined serve about 30 million pay-TV subscribers-convinced FCC officials that they lacked the channel capacity to provide every eligible station in HD immediately. They insisted that they needed several years to prepare for a full HD carriage requirement.
HD signals stress capacity because they take up much more bandwidth than digital signal transmitted at lower resolution.
The FCC's HD rules for satellite were far more lenient than the ones originally proposed by FCC chairman Kevin Martin. He started off at full HD carriage in February 2009, coupled with a market-by-market waiver process.
Martin scuttled his original plan after DirecTV and Dish Network complained that it was draconian and damaging to their ability to compete with cable.
Instead, the FCC decided to give DirecTV and EchoStar until 2013 to carry all stations in HD within any market where they have elected to carry any station's signal in HD format.
The "carry one, carry all in HD" principle kicks in when a satellite company starts carrying local signals in HD. DirecTV's decision to carry local TV signals in HD does not force Dish to do likewise in the same market.

===Circuit Judge&lt;ref&gt;D.C Court Appeals Ruling, United States Appeals Court, For the District of Columbia, Argued March 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;===
Rogers, Circuit Judge:  Following enactment of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] promulgated a rule prohibiting restrictions on certain over-the-air reception devices ("[http://www.neighborhoodlink.com/article/Association/FCC_Satellite_Antenna_Regulations OTARD]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighborhoodlink.com/article/Association/FCC_Satellite_Antenna_Regulations], FCC Satellite and Antenna Regulations-the OTARD Rule, Oct, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule invalidated

'''Shatter belt''' is a [[concept]] in [[geopolitics]] according to which on the political map are recognized and analyzed strategically positioned and oriented regions that are deeply internally divided and encompassed in the competition between the great powers in the geostrategic areas and spheres&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Geopolitics of the World System|last=Cohen|first=Saul|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2003|isbn=978-0847699070|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definitions==
The conceptual foundation of the shatterbelts in the geopolitics stems from the analytical approach of examining the world map of states and empires in terms of their geopolitical struggle, military and political relations seen in relation to those strategically positioned areas that are characterized by a greater inclination of internal division from which they arise conflicts and at the same time are strategically important for the great powers. Linking the term fragility ("on glass") is an obvious result of long-standing clashes with a great deal of disruptive influence, light chaos and, in general, a propensity for devastating conflicts in these regions&lt;ref name="Gosar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosar|first=Anton|date=2000|title=The Shatter Belt and the European Core - A Geopolitical Discussion on the Untypical Case of Slovenia|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013306804212|journal=GeoJournal - Spatially Integrated Social Sciences and Humanities|volume=October vol. 52, 2|pages=107-117}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence, the term "shatter belt" itself is generally referring to a geographical region that is endangered by local conflicts within the states or between countries in the region, as well as the involvement of the opposing great powers outside the region&lt;ref name="Hansen &amp; Diel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen; Diel|first=Paul R.; Paul F.|date=January 1994|title=Testing empirical propositions about shatterbelts, 1945–76|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0962629894900094|journal=Political Geography|volume=Vol. 13, 1|pages=33-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The concept of the shatter belt - a fragment of fragility in geopolitics is still defined as strategically positioned and oriented regions that are both deeply internally divided and captured in the competition between the great powers in the geostrategic areas and spheres. Regions marked as a fragile belt are often blamed for a large scale of interstate / conflict, especially in relation to major power conflicts. Regarding their engagement and close connection with major and global conflicts of power, the regions considered as shatter belts are at the same time the main crisis hot spots or hard-to-reach areas in world politics and international relations&lt;ref name="Шаревски"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Шаревски|first=Марио|date=2017|title=Геополитичката положба на Македонија како ранлива точка на балканскиот појас на кршливост во услови на бегалската криза|url=|journal=Геополитичката и геостратегиската положба на Република Македонија во услови на мигрантската и бегалска криза|volume=Македонска академија на науките и уметностите|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Sibi, l’âme du violon''''' is a 2010 documentary film directed by Michel K. Zongo.

== Synopsis ==
A blind violinist called Sibi has been singing and playing in cabarets in the most popular neighborhoods of [[Koudougou]], [[Burkina Faso]], for more than 30 years. He knows the origins of the ethnic groups and the most important family lines in the region. The film goes to the encounter of this extraordinary man who holds, despite himself and surrounded by general indifference, the living history of the region, and its oral traditions, now threatened with extinction. A message in a bottle before it is too late and these memories disappear forever.

The '''United Nations Environment Programme''' (UNEP), an agency of the [[United Nations]], coordinates the organization's environmental activities and assists developing countries in implementing [[environmental peacebuilding|environmentally sound policies and practices]]. It was founded by [[Maurice Strong]], its first director, as a result of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm Conference) in June 1972 and has overall responsibility for environmental problems among United Nations agencies; however, international talks on specialized issues, such as addressing climate change or combating desertification, are overseen by other UN organizations, like the Bonn-based Secretariat of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]]. UNEP's activities cover a wide range of issues regarding the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], marine and terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, environmental governance and green economy. It has played a significant role in developing international environmental conventions, promoting [[environmental science]] and information and illustrating the way those can be implemented in conjunction with policy, working on the development and implementation of policy with national governments, regional institutions in conjunction with environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs). UNEP has also been active in funding and implementing environment related development projects.

UNEP frequently uses the alternative name UN Environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unenvironment.org/about-un-environment&lt;/ref&gt; 

UN Environment has aided in the formulation of guidelines and treaties on issues such as the international trade in potentially harmful chemicals, transboundary [[air pollution]], and contamination of international waterways. Relevant documents, including scientific papers, are available via the UNEP Document Repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wedocs.unep.org/ |title= Home |website=UNEP Document Repository|date=  |author= |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Meteorological Organization]] and UN Environment established the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) in 1988. UN Environment is also one of several Implementing Agencies for the [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF) and the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the [[Montreal Protocol]], and it is also a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://undg.org/about/undg-global/undg/ |website=United Nations Development Group |title=About » UNDG at the Global Level » UNDG|date=2017|author= |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Cyanide Management Code]], a programme of best practice for the chemical's use at gold mining operations, was developed under UN Environment's [[aegis]].

==History==
UNEP headquarters was established in Nairobi, Kenya, on 5 June 1972 as an outcome from the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972) with a staff of 300, including 100 professionals in a variety of fields, and with a five‐year fund of more than US$100 million. At the time, US$40 million were pledged by the United States and the remainder by 50 other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwinn Hill (October 20, 1975), [https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/20/archives/un-environment-effort-a-start-a-long-way-to-go-un.html U.N. Environment Effort: A Start, a Long Way to Go] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
===Executive Director===
UNEP's current acting Executive Director [[Joyce Msuya]] took office in November 2018, following the resignation of [[Erik Solheim]]. Prior to that appointment, she was UNEP's Deputy Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tanzanian appointed to head U.N. Environment Programme |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/11/21/tanzanian-appointed-to-head-united-nations-environment-programme/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=AfricaNews |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 1972, the UN General Assembly unanimously elected [[Maurice Strong]] to be the first head of UN Environment. Also Secretary General of both the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which launched the world environment movement, and the 1992 Earth Summit, Strong has played a critical role is globalizing the environmental movement.

The position was then held for 17 years (1975–1992) by Dr. [[Mostafa Kamal Tolba]], who was instrumental in bringing environmental considerations to the forefront of global thinking and action. Under his leadership, UN Environment's most widely acclaimed success—the historic 1987 agreement to protect the ozone layer—the [[Montreal Protocol]] was negotiated. He was succeeded by [[Elizabeth Dowdeswell]] (1992–1998), [[Klaus Töpfer]] (1998–2006), [[Achim Steiner]] (2006–2016), and [[Erik Solheim]] (2016–2018).

===Notable achievements===
UNEP has registered several successes, such as the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]] for limiting emissions of gases blamed for thinning the planet's protective ozone layer, and the 2012 [[Minamata Convention on Mercury|Minamata Convention]], a treaty to limit toxic mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Alister Doyle (February 17, 2013 ), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-test-idUSBRE91G03Q20130217 Reformed U.N. formula for making planet greener to get first test] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

UNEP has sponsored the development of solar loan programmes, with attractive return rates, to buffer the initial deployment costs and entice consumers to consider and purchase solar PV systems. The most famous example is the [[Indian Solar Loan Programme|solar loan programme]] sponsored by UN Environment helped 100,000 people finance solar power systems in [[Solar power in India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=504&amp;ArticleID=5562&amp;l=en Solar loan programme in India]&lt;/ref&gt; Success in India's solar programme has led to similar projects in other parts of the developing world, including [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Mexico]].

UNEP sponsors the Marshlands project in the [[Middle East]]. In 2001, UN Environment alerted the international community to the destruction of the Marshlands when it released satellite images showing that 90 percent of the Marshlands had already been lost. The UN Environment "support for Environmental Management of the Iraqi Marshland" commenced in August 2004, in order to manage the Marshland area in an environmentally sound manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marshlands.unep.or.jp/ UN Environment Marshland project in Middle East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006021403/http://marshlands.unep.or.jp/ |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure full participation of global communities, UN Environment works in an inclusive fashion that brings on board different societal cohorts. UN Environment has a programme for young people known as Tunza. Within this programme are other projects like the [[AEO for Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/DEWA/africa/youth/about.htm AEO-for-Youth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223100118/http://www.unep.org/DEWA/africa/youth/about.htm |date=23 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glaciers shrinking'''

{{further|Retreat of glaciers since 1850}}
[[Glacier]]s are shrinking at record rates and many could disappear within decades, the U.N. Environment Programme said on 16 March 2008. The scientists measuring the health of almost 30 glaciers around the world found that ice loss reached record levels in 2006. On average, the glaciers shrank by 4.9 feet in 2006, the most recent year for which data are available. The most severe loss was recorded at [[Norway]]'s Breidalblikkbrea glacier, which shrank 10.2 feet in 2006. Glaciers lost an average of about a foot of ice a year between 1980 and 1999. But since the turn of the millennium the average loss has increased to about 20&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/weather/03/16/un.climate.ap/index.html U.N.: Glaciers shrinking at record rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric vehicles'''

At the fifth Magdeburg Environmental Forum held from 3–4 July 2008, in Magdeburg, Germany, UN Environment and car manufacturer [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] called for the establishment of infrastructure for [[electric vehicle]]s. At this international conference, 250 high-ranking representatives from the world of politics and non-government organizations discussed solutions for future road transportation under the motto of "Sustainable Mobility–[[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|the Post-2012 CO2 Agenda]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climate-l.org/2008/07/11/unep-and-daimler-call-for-infrastructure-for-electric-and-fuel-cell-vehicles/ |title=UNEP and Daimler Call for Infrastructure for Electric and Fuel-cell Vehicles |author= |date=4 July 2008 |work= |publisher=Climate-L.org |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20091213000040/http://climate-l.org/2008/07/11/unep-and-daimler-call-for-infrastructure-for-electric-and-fuel-cell-vehicles/ |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reports===
UNEP publishes many reports, atlases and newsletters. For instance, the fifth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) assessment is a comprehensive report on environment, development and human well-being, providing analysis and information for policy makers and the concerned public. One of many points in the GEO-5 warns that we are living far beyond our means. It notes that the human population is now so large that the amount of resources needed to sustain it exceeds what is available.

In June 2010, a report from UN Environment declared that a global shift towards a [[veganism|vegan diet]] was needed to save the world from hunger, fuel shortages and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Carus [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet UN urges global move to meat and dairy-free diet], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 June 2010

===International years===
* 2007 – [[Year of the Dolphin|(International) Year of the Dolphin]]
(International) Patron of the Year of the Dolphin was H.S.H. [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]] of [[Monaco]], with Special Ambassador to the cause being [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] of the [[Backstreet Boys]] musical group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/530059 Newswise Science News | Pop Superstar Nick Carter to Help Wild Dolphins and Oceans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) in February 2007, the "Paris Call for Action" &amp;mdash; read out by French President [[Jacques Chirac]] and supported by 46 countries &amp;mdash;  called for the United Nations Environment Programme to be replaced by a new and more powerful "United Nations Environment Organization (UNEO)", to be modelled on the [[World Health Organization]]. The 46 countries included the European Union nations, but notably did not include the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, the top four emitters of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=environment&amp;storyID=2007-02-03T144510Z_01_L03357553_RTRIDST_0_DCBRIGHTS-GLOBALWARMING-APPEAL-DC.XML|title=46 nations call for tougher U.N. environment role|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-02-03|first=Alister|last=Doyle|df=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, following the Rio+20 Summit, a decision by the General Assembly of the United Nations to "strengthen and upgrade"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/NEWSCENTRE/default.aspx?DocumentId=2700&amp;ArticleId=9363]&lt;/ref&gt; the UN Environment Programme (UN Environment) and establish universal membership of its governing body was confirmed.
