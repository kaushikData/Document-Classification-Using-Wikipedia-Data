'''''Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture''''' is a discredited 2000 book by historian Michael A. Bellesiles about American [[gun culture]], an expansion of a 1996 article he published in the ''[[Journal of American History]]''. Bellesiles, then a professor at Emory University, used [[Fabrication (science)|fabricated research]] to argue that during the early period of US history, guns were uncommon during peacetime and that a culture of gun ownership did not arise until the mid-nineteenth century.

Although the book was initially awarded the prestigious [[Bancroft Prize]], it later became the first work for which the prize was rescinded following a decision of [[Columbia University]]'s Board of Trustees that Bellesiles had "violated basic norms of scholarship and the high standards expected of Bancroft Prize winners."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1157.html Statement of Columbia University Board of Trustees, December 13, 2002]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesis==
The thesis of ''Arming America'' is that [[gun culture in the United States]] did not have roots in the colonial and early national period but arose during the 1850s and 1860s. The book argues that [[guns]] were uncommon during peacetime in the United States during the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]], [[History of the United States|early national]], and [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|antebellum]] periods, that guns were seldom used then and that the average American's proficiency in use of firearms was poor. Bellesiles maintains that more widespread use and ownership of guns dated to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a period of widespread advance in firearm [[manufacturing]] and a consequent reduction in price and improvement in accuracy.

==Scrutiny==
The book garnered many enthusiastic professional reviews and won the prestigious [[Bancroft Prize]] in 2001. The book's thesis bore upon ongoing political controversies about [[gun control]] and the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] advocates criticized it. Actor [[Charlton Heston]], then-president of the [[National Rifle Association]], described the book's argument as "ludicrous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/01/books/l-arming-america-266906.html | title = Letter to the ''New York Times'' | first = Charlton | last = Heston | authorlink = Charlton Heston | date = October 1, 2000 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Roger Lane]]'s review in the ''[[Journal of American History]]'' said that the book's research was “meticulous and thorough.” He wrote that Bellesiles had "attacked the central myth behind the National Rifle Association's interpretation of the Second Amendment." Lane declared Bellesiles’ evidence so formidable that "if the subject were open to rational argument," the debate would be over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/2/614.full.pdf+html | title = Review of ''Arming America'' | journal = The Journal of American History |date=September 2001 | pages = 614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clayton Cramer]], a historian, software engineer, gun enthusiast and early critic of Bellesiles, later argued that the reason "why historians swallowed ''Arming America'''s preposterous claims so readily is that it fit into their political worldview so well...&amp;nbsp;''Arming America'' said things, and created a system of thought so comfortable for the vast majority of historians, that they didn’t even pause to consider the possibility that something wasn’t right."&lt;ref name="cramer-hnn"&gt;{{cite web | first = Clayton E. | last = Cramer | title = What Clayton Cramer Saw and (Nearly) Everyone Else Missed | url = http://hnn.us/articles/1185.html | publisher = [[History News Network]] | date = January 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Peter Charles Hoffer]], an advocate of gun control, lent support to Cramer's charge when, in a 2004 examination of the Bellesiles case, he noted that influential members of the historical profession had "taken strong public stands on violence in our society and its relation to gun control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Peter Charles | last = Hoffer | title = Past Imperfect: Facts, Fictions, Fraud—American History from Bancroft and Parkman to Ambrose, Bellesiles, Ellis, and Goodwin | location = New York | publisher = PublicAffairs | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the academics solicited for [[blurbs]] by Bellesiles’ publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]] "were ecstatic in part because the book knocked the gun lobby."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 161: “systematically dismantles one of our most cherished and dangerous national myths.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellesiles energized this professional consensus by attempting to play "the professors against the NRA in a high-wire act of arrogant bravado."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he replied to Heston’s criticism by telling the actor to earn a Ph.D. before criticizing the work of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  He pointed out that Cramer was "a long time advocate of unrestricted gun ownership" while he was a scholar who had "certain obligations of accuracy that transcend current political benefit."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 157-58. On February 16, 2000, Bellesiles had been a featured speaker at a symposium sponsored by the [[Brady Center|Brady Center to Prevent Handgun Violence]]. A [http://www.gunlawsuits.org/symposium.asp link] to the Brady Campaign Legal Action Project Second Amendment Symposium, February 16, 2000, was posted by the pro-gun control Potowmack Institute, among others; since then the Brady Campaign has deleted all references to Michael Bellesiles and their own Second Amendment Symposium from their website.&lt;/ref&gt; After Bellesiles claimed he had been flooded by hate mail, both the [[American Historical Association]] and the [[Organization of American Historians]] endorsed a resolution condemning the alleged harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 159-60.&lt;/ref&gt; As Hoffer later wrote, Bellesiles was convinced that whether the entire profession agreed with “his stance on gun ownership (and I suspect most did), surely academic historians would not let their expertise be impugned by a rank and partisan amateur like Cramer.” &lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 158-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the politics of the issue mattered less to historians "than the possibility that Bellesiles might have engaged in faulty, fraudulent, and unethical research."&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Historian's Toolbox: A Student's Guide to the Theory and Craft of History'' (Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 2003), 117&lt;/ref&gt; As critics subjected the historical claims of the book to close scrutiny, they demonstrated that much of Bellesiles' research, particularly his handling of probate records, was inaccurate and possibly fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1157.html History News Network]&lt;/ref&gt;  This criticism included noting several serious errors in the tables published in the book, as well as in the ''Journal of American History'' article, namely, that they did not provide a total number of cases and gave percentages that "were clearly wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two scholarly articles,&lt;ref&gt;

*purported to count guns in about a hundred wills from 17th- and 18th-century [[Providence, Rhode Island]], but these did not exist because the decedents had died intestate (i.e., without wills);
*purported to count nineteenth-century San Francisco County probate inventories, but these had been destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake and fire]];
*reported a national mean for gun ownership in 18th-century probate inventories that was mathematically impossible;
*misreported the condition of guns described in probate records in a way that accommodated his thesis, as for instance, claiming that in Providence records most guns were listed as old or broken when fewer than 10% were so listed;
*miscited the counts of guns in nineteenth-century Massachusetts censuses and militia reports,
*had more than a 60% error rate in finding guns listed as part of estates in Vermont records; and
*had a 100% error rate in the cited gun-related homicide cases of seventeenth-century [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]].

Critics also identified problems with Bellesiles's methods of citation.  Cramer noted that Bellesiles had misrepresented a passage by [[George Washington]] about the quality of three poorly prepared [[militia]] units as if his criticism applied to the militia in general. (Washington had noted that the three units were exceptions to the rule.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/weekend/books/books-cramer092300.shtml Clayton E. Cramer, "Shots in the Dark: Bellesiles Arming America is novel in both senses"], ''National Review'', 23 Sep 2000, accessed 30 Mar 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Cramer wrote, "It took me twelve hours of hunting before I found a citation that was completely correct. In the intervening two years, I have spent thousands of hours chasing down Bellesiles’s citations, and I have found many hundreds of shockingly gross falsifications."&lt;ref name="cramer-hnn"/&gt;

==Emory investigation and resignation==
As criticism increased and charges of scholarly misconduct were made, Emory University conducted an internal inquiry into Bellesiles's integrity, appointing an independent investigative committee composed of three leading academic historians from outside Emory.&lt;ref&gt;Unlike the initial wave of criticism, made primarily by non-academics or non-historians, professional historians conducted this investigation. The three historians were Stanley Katz of Princeton, [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]] of Harvard, and Hanna Grey, emerita at the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bellesiles failed to provide investigators with his research notes, claiming the notes were destroyed in a flood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/08/books/08GUNS.html?scp=3&amp;sq=bellesiles&amp;st=cse  "Historian's Prizewinning Book on Guns is Embroiled in a Scandal", ''The New York Times,'' December 8, 2001]. There was water damage to the building containing Bellesiles' office—as was reported in [http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2000/May/ermay.8/5_8_00bowden.html Emory University's daily paper]—but critics disputed the plausibility of Bellesiles' claim that the problem explained his missing research records. The waterline break at Emory occurred in April 2000, after ''Arming America'' went to press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial hardcover edition of the book, Bellesiles did not give the total number of probate records which he had investigated, but the following year, after the "flood," Bellesiles included in the paperback edition  the claim that he had investigated 11,170 probate records. "By his own account," writes Hoffer, "the flood had destroyed all but a few loose papers of his data. It was a mystery how supposedly lost original data could reappear to enable him to add the number of cases to the 2001 paperback edition, then disappear once again when the committee of inquiry sought the data from him" (Hoffer, 153). One critic tried, unsuccessfully, to destroy penciled notes on yellow pads by submerging them in his bathtub, in order to prove that water damage would not have destroyed Bellesiles' notes.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Sternstein, [http://hnn.us/articles/742.html "'Pulped' Fiction: Michael Bellesiles and His Yellow Note Pads,"], History News Network, May 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarly investigation confirmed that Bellesiles' work had serious flaws, calling into question both its quality and veracity. The external report on Bellesiles concluded that "every aspect of his work in the probate records is deeply flawed" and called his statements in self-defense "prolix, confusing, evasive, and occasionally contradictory." It concluded that "his scholarly integrity is seriously in question."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/news/Releases//Final_Report.pdf Stanley N. Katz, Hannah H. Gray, and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, "Report of the Investigative Committee in the Matter of Professor Michael Bellesiles," July 10, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellesiles disputed these findings, claiming to have followed all scholarly standards and to have corrected all errors of fact known to him. Nevertheless, with his "reputation in tatters," Bellesiles issued a statement on October 25, 2002, announcing the resignation of his professorship at Emory by year's end.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 166. Emory accepted Bellesiles' resignation effective December 31, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Bellesiles was working as a [[bartender]] while continuing to write history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20120917/NWS10/309209649 | title=Michael Bellesiles: Bartender, Writer, History Buff|author=Jen Matteis|accessdate=March 1, 2017|date=September 17, 2012|work=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of the scandal==
In 2002, the trustees of Columbia University rescinded ''Arming America'''s [[Bancroft Prize]], the first such action in the history of the prize. [[Alfred A. Knopf]], publisher of ''Arming America'', did not renew Bellesiles' contract, and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] withdrew its name from a fellowship that the [[Newberry Library]] had granted Bellesiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20020521.html Statement of NEH Chairman Bruce Cole on Newberry Library Fellowship Award (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, ''Arming America'' was republished in a revised and amended edition by [[Soft Skull Press]]. Bellesiles continued to defend the book's credibility and thesis, arguing that roughly three-quarters of the original book remained unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softskull.com/files/weighed_even_balance.pdf Michael Bellesiles, "Weighed in an Even Balance"], Soft Skull Press (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians who initially admired ''Arming America'' ceased to defend Bellesiles. The nationally prominent historian [[Garry Wills]], who had enthusiastically reviewed ''Arming America'' for the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/10/books/spiking-the-gun-myth.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bellesiles+wills&amp;st=nyt Garry Wills review in New York Times] (Sept. 10, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; later said, in a 2005 interview on [[C-SPAN]], "I was took. The book is a fraud."  Wills noted that Bellesiles "claimed to have consulted archives he didn't and he misrepresented those archives," although "he didn't have to do that," since "he had a lot of good, solid evidence."  Wills added, "People get taken by very good con men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanarchives.org/program/184749-1 Garry Wills Interview], ''BookTV'', C-SPAN (Jan. 2, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Roger Lane]], who had reviewed the book positively in the ''[[Journal of American History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/88.2/br_2.html Roger Lane, review of ''Arming America,'' ''Journal of American History''] (September 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; offered a similar opinion: "It is entirely clear to me that he's made up a lot of these records. He's betrayed us. He's betrayed the cause. It's 100 percent clear that the guy is a liar and a disgrace to my profession. He's breached that trust."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1074.html Quoted in article published at History News Network]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Pauline Maier]] reflected that it seemed historians had "ceased to read carefully and critically, even in the awarding of book prizes."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Hoffer, 169-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hoffer concluded, "Bellesiles's condemnation by Emory University, the trustees of the Bancroft Prizes, and Knopf provided the gun lobby with information to blast the entire history profession....Even though H-Law, the [[Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture|Omohundro Institute]], the [[Organization of American Historians|OAH]], and the [[American Historical Association|AHA]] rushed to his side and stated principled objections to the politicization of history, they hesitated to ask the equally important question of whether he had manipulated them and betrayed their trust."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within France, there are three main types of [[baccalauréat]] degrees:
*the ''baccalauréat général'' (general baccalaureate);
*the ''baccalauréat professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate);
*the ''baccalauréat technologique'' (technological baccalaureate).

The '''baccalauréat technologique''' (technological baccalaureate) is one of them.

There's a more important choice in the variety of specialities such as laboratory science, hotel management, or marketing management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid147/le-baccalaureat-technologique.html |title=Le baccalauréat technologique - Ministère de l'Éducation nationale |publisher=Education.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Technological baccalaureates were created in 1968 and are grouped into three sets:

Series F:
*F1: Mechanical Engineering,
*F2: Electronics,
*F3: Electrical,
*F4: Civil Engineering,
*F5: Physics
*F6: Chemistry laboratory
*F7: Biological Sciences (Biochemistry option)
*F7: Biological Sciences (Biology option)
*F8: medical and social sciences,
*F9: Energy Equipment,
*F10: Microtechnology (to be recut in F10A: Micro Devices option and F10B: Micro-optics option);

Series G:
*G1: Business Administration,
*G2: quantitative management techniques,
*G3: Commercial Techniques;

Series H: Computer Techniques.
Later sections appear F artistic:

Series F:
*F11: Techniques of music;
*F11 ': Techniques of dance;
*F12: Applied Arts (1980).

The 1992 reform put in place the following series:

*Industrial Science and Technology (ITS);
*Science and Technology Laboratory (STL);
*Tertiary science and technology (STT);
*Medical Social Sciences (SMS).
*Hospitality (removing the old patent BT technician and implementation of BTNH more general and versatile built around the various activities of the hotel world namely the applied management, culinary arts, tableware and service and reception / floors and accommodation).

After the renovation of the sector STT (now STG in 2005 and MGT in 2012) and SMS (now ST2S 2007) 1 is the Industrial Science and Technology in 2011, which is split into two new sets industry: science and technology design and applied arts and science and technology industry and sustainable development, there are eight sets of technology degree.

==Opportunities==
Unlike the professional baccalaureate, which is for more immediate use, the technological baccalaureate is for further studies. The vast majority of graduates are heading to higher education, mainly to studies senior technicians (there are many, such as Optician BTS BTS and DUT DUT such as Biological Engineering) technology adapted to their basic training and eventually to professional licences and beyond.

The technological renovation series in 2012, which strengthened the teaching of general subjects, aims to improve the success rate of those with a university degree in technology from the first year of a degree.

They can also move towards the preparatory classes for the grandes écoles TSI, or TB TPC are reserved for graduates to STI, STL STL SPCL biotechnology or to prepare the entrance exam to engineering schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5118">'''Te'udat Bagrut''' ({{Lang-he-n|תעודת בגרות}}) is a certificate which attests that a student has successfully passed [[Israel]]'s high school [[matriculation examination]]. Bagrut is a prerequisite for higher education in Israel. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercazrakefet.org/articlenav.php?id=97 What is Bagrut?]&lt;/ref&gt; A Bagrut certificate is awarded to students who pass the required written (and in some cases oral) subject-matter examinations with a passing mark (55% or higher) in each exam. The Bagrut certificate however should not be confused with a [[high school diploma]] (''te'udat g'mar tichon'', {{Lang-he-n|תעודת גמר תיכון}}), which is a certificate awarded by the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry of Education]] attesting that a student has completed 12 years of study.

65.5% of Israeli high school 2014 graduates or other individuals studying for the 2014 exam (usually post-[[Conscription in Israel|compulsory military service]] persons completing Bagrut requirements later in life in order to apply for higher education) had passed the requirements to be eligible to receive a Bagrut certificate. Of the overall population who was of high school graduation age in 2014, 52.7% were eligible to receive a Bagrut certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bagrut eligibility information|url=http://edu.gov.il/owlHeb/Tichon/BechinotVbagruyot/BechinotAbagrut/Pages/entitlement-data-2014.aspx|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Education]]|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Bagrut examinations assess knowledge on subjects studied in high school. They are frequently compared to the [[New York (state)|New York State]] [[Regents Examinations]], the [[College Board]]'s [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) tests, the British [[A-level]]s, and the German [[Abitur]]. Bagrut scores are one of the criteria examined in applications to elite military units and Israeli academic institutions.&lt;ref name=Fulbright&gt;[http://fulbright.org.il/en/?page_id=1286 Education in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt; Other criteria include students' high school grades and the [[Psychometric Entrance Test]].

The process of matriculation in Israel is supervised by the country's Ministry of Education. The exams of all compulsory subjects and most elective subjects are designed and written by the Ministry, thereby creating a standard measure of the students' knowledge throughout the country. In academically oriented high schools, the last two years of studies are geared to preparing students for the bagrut exams.
[[File:Matriculation geography test.jpg|thumb|150px|Bagrut exam sheet]]

==Compulsory subjects==
* Religious [[Scripture]]s – [[Tanakh]], the [[Christian Bible]], or the [[Qur'an]], as relevant to the appropriate sector of the population
* Language
** [[Hebrew grammar|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic grammar]]
** Hebrew or Arabic composition
* [[English language]] (written and oral)
* [[Mathematics]]
* Knowledge of the nation and state
** [[Civics]] and [[Minorities]] studies
** [[History]] of the [[Jewish People]]
* [[World History]]
* Hebrew/Arab and world [[literature]]
* At least one elective, such as geography, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, Arabic, French, social sciences etc.
* [[Physical Education]] (only for students who studied in a traditional high-school setting, i.e., not those studying under the "external" track)

Most exams are available in different levels of difficulty, expressed in "units of study". In most subjects, students may choose the number of units in which they are tested. In order to receive a "full" matriculation certificate, the student must take and pass at least one subject matter exam at the 5-unit level of difficulty and earn a total of at least 21 combined study units in all bagrut exams taken. Correspondingly, the make up of a student's classes during his or her high school years is matched to the student's expected units of study they will test in their bagrut exams. So for example, a student who is planning to take the 5-unit mathematics exam will take mathematics courses specifically designed for a 5-unit level of difficulty all throughout their high school career.

==History==
A copy of the 2010 mathematics exam (in the four and five units levels) was leaked to students, but a teacher reported it to authorities and all tests were replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/math-matriculation-goes-digital-in-israel-1.292042|title=Math matriculation goes digital in Israel|last=Kashti|first=Or|date=2010-05-25|work=Haaretz|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the percentage of 17-year-olds who passed the matriculation exams rose to 48.3 percent and the number of students sitting for the exams in both the Jewish and the Arab school systems increased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/sa-ar-hails-2-2-rise-in-bagrut-pass-rate-1.355419 Sa'ar hails 2.2% rise in bagrut pass rate ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yearly citation for research paper.png|thumb|Yearly citation c(t) for a research paper from the e Physical Review corpus.]]
'''Citation dynamics''' describes the number of [[references]] received by the [[article (publishing)|article]] or other scientific work over [[time]]. The [[citation]] dynamics is usually described by the bang, that take place 2–3 years after the work has been published, and the burst size spans several [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]]. The presence of bursts is not consistent with other models based on [[preferential attachment]]. Those models are able to account for the skewed citation distribution but their reference accumulation is gradual.&lt;ref name="eom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eom|first1=Young-Ho|last2=Fortunato|first2=Santo|title=Characterizing and Modeling Citation Dynamics|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024926&amp;type=printable|website=journals.plos.org|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of scientific production has changed significantly over the past years. Due to [[Technological change|technological progress]], the number of published papers has been increasing exponentially until now. This, along with a much shorter time needed for the article to be published, has affected the [[citation]] dynamics of the modern papers. Furthermore, if the [[reference list]] of the study includes papers published in different years, older papers tend to have more citations. This may not necessarily because they are better but just because they had more time to accumulate those references.

It has been found that citation distributions are best described by a shifted [[Power law|power-law]].&lt;ref name='eom'/&gt; The [[probability]] that paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is cited at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; after publication as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pi_{i}(t) = \eta_{i}c_i^tP_{i}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; serves as the outcome variable for each particular paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Fitness,  &lt;math&gt;\eta_i&lt;/math&gt;, captures the inherent differences between papers, accounting for the perceived [[novelty]] and importance of a discovery. &lt;math&gt;c_i^t&lt;/math&gt; represents the cumulative number of citations acquired by a paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a log-normal survival probability.&lt;ref name="Barabasi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Dashun|last2=Song|first2=Chaoming|last3=Barabási|first3=Albert-László|title=Quantifying Long-Term Scientific Impact|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/342/6154/127.full.pdf|website=science.sciencemag.org|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The probability is equal

: &lt;math&gt;P_{i}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_it} exp \left \lbrack -\frac{(ln t - \mu_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right \rbrack &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time; &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is [[longevity]], capturing the decay rate; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; indicates immediacy, governing the time for a paper to reach its citation peak.
The ultimate impact &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; represents the total number or citations that the paper receives during its lifetime.

:  &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\infty} = m(e^{\lambda_i} - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a global parameter that has the same value for all publications. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the relative fitness of the paper. From the above formula, we can see that the total number of references that the paper can receive during its lifetime depends only on its relative fitness which is very hard to quantify.

'''cris cheek''' (intentionally uncapitalized) is a multimodal [[poet]], [[performance writer]], and professor at [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]].  Born in London in 1955, he lived and worked in that capital until the early 1990s. An early influence was working alongside [[Bill Griffiths]] and [[Bob Cobbing]] at the Poetry Society printshop in London and the Writers Forum group of poets who met with regularity on the premises in Earls Court, such as Allen Fisher. In 1981 he was a co-founder of [[Chisenhale Dance Space]] and for much of that decade worked on diverse projects alongside musicians from the London Musicians Collective, choreographers and live artists. His music and sound collaborations include Slant (a trio with [[Philip Jeck]] and Sianed Jones). His radio program "Music of Madagascar" produced for BBC Radio 3 won a Sony Gold Specialist Award (now Radio Academy Awards) in 1995. Between 1994-2005 he and Sianed Jones were based in the most easterly English town of Lowestoft. He taught on the [[Performance Writing]] course from 1995 at [[Dartington College of Arts]] where he became a Research Fellow in interdisciplinary text (2000-2002). A large body of interdisciplinary performance writing was produced in collaboration with Kirsten Lavers under the author function Things Not Worth Keeping between 1999-2007. In 2005 he became a professor at Miami University in Ohio. He was Altman Fellow in The Humanities Center [[Miami University]] 2011-12, co-presenting the Networks and Power symposium and a conference on Network Archaeology from which an issue of the online journal [[Amodern]], co-edited with Nicole Starosielski and Braxton Soderman, was published. He currently lives in Northside, Cincinnati with Dr. Erin Edwards.

==Early life and work==
cris cheek was born in Enfield, [[London]] and educated at [[Highgate School]], graduating in 1972. He worked at the printshop of the Consortium of London Presses in the basement of the Earls Court premises of the National Poetry Centre between 1975-77. Initially he helped [[Bill Griffiths]] and [[Bob Cobbing]] to produce in-house volumes of [[Poetry Review]] there under the editorship of [[Eric Mottram]] and became print shop manager in 1977. He is among a wave of poets in London following the lead of the [[British Poetry Revival]] whose poetry integrates spatial, sonic and semantic performative concerns. His early live performance work was in duet with [[Clive Fencott]] and then a trio with the addition of [[Lawrence Upton]] as JGJGJJGJG (as long as you can say it that's our name). They were on occasion joined by [[Bill Griffiths]] and [[Jeremy Adler]]. He ran several little press imprints such as Bluff Books, Shabby Editions and the little worry interrupt as well as editing the short-lived magazine RAWZ. Through his work with Jacky Lansley and Fergus Early on their production I Giselle he became involved with X6 Dance Space and then [[Chisenhale Dance Space]] and subsequently made collaborations with influential New Dance choreographers such as Mary Prestidge, Kirstie Simson, Miranda Tufnell and Dennis Greenwood, Patricia Bardi, Michael Clark and Sue MacLennan between 1982-1986. In 1987 he and Sianed Jones traveled to Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania and Madagascar researching into social  forms of music and dance.

==Recent life and works==
cris cheek lived in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Canning Town]] between 1981-1994. Whilst working for dance and performance artists and improvising music groups, he began writing songs with Sianed Jones, performing and recording with [[Philip Jeck]] as Slant. Slant released 3 albums, Hive (These Records, 1989), Slant (Sound &amp; Language, 1993) and The Canning Town Chronicle (Sound &amp; Language, 1994). Jones and cheek moved to [[Lowestoft]] as global internet networks bloomed. He was very active in poetics e-list communities for the following twenty years. During this time, he taught [[Performance Writing]] at [[Dartington College of Arts]], working alongside [[Caroline Bergvall]] as well as many others. cheek also made contemporary vaudeville shows with folk musician [[Chris Foster (folk singer)|Chris Foster]] that toured to village halls and community centers around England.

While working at Dartington cris began teaching with and subsequently working with Kirsten Lavers to produce a substantial web of projects under the author function Thinks Not Worth Keeping, shortened to TNWK.

The '''Dance and Drama Awards''' are a scholarship scheme which subsidises professional vocational training at some of the leading [[performing arts]] schools in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DG_064226 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112152900/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/14To19/MoneyToLearn/DG_064226 |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1998, the awards are funded and regulated by the British Government through the [[Learning and Skills Council]] and are awarded to selected students at 21 specialist performing arts institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://danceanddrama.lsc.gov.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Dance and Drama Awards are offered to selected students, who are commencing training at the 21 specialist vocational schools chosen for the scheme.  Through a process of auditions, the awarding school will identify the most talented students and allocate awards appropriately.  The offer of an award is not based on the student's ability to finance their own training, but on their talent and potential ability in the fields of professional [[dance]], [[drama]], [[musical theatre]] or [[stage management]].  The award pays a substantial contribution towards the cost of attending the relevant course and in many cases, also includes a means tested maintenance grant, which can be used towards the student's contribution to the course fees, or the cost of accommodation and other expenses associated with attending full-time training.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Courses==
The courses for which the awards are given are specially devised by [[Trinity College, London]] and, upon completion, provide a professional level qualification at either Level 5 or Level 6 on the [[National Qualifications Framework]].  Completion of one of these courses gives formal accreditation of the skills, knowledge and understanding that are acquired in training for employment as a professional actor, dancer, performing artist or in production roles supporting performance.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

This series of qualifications are not intended to demonstrate academic achievement, but are vocational qualifications designed to prepare the student for a professional career in the performing arts industry, with the learning outcome being to achieve a high level of ability in the relevant skill rather than a high level of knowledge.  This is represented by the fact that despite the courses being offered as post-16 [[further education]], the qualifications are actually rated at graduate level.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Courses which are eligible for funding:'''&lt;ref&gt;http://danceanddrama.lsc.gov.uk/qualifications/&lt;/ref&gt;

*National Diploma in Professional Dance
*National Diploma in Professional Production Skills

== Schools ==
All the schools which participate in the Dance &amp; Drama Awards scheme are validated by Trinity College and are inspected for educational standards by [[OFSTED]].  They are chosen for their ability to provide the highest standard of training to the most talented students.  They are some of the top performing arts training establishments in the UK.  Graduate destinations include employment in West End theatre and with some of the most prestigious acting and dance companies worldwide.

The '''Das–Naglieri cognitive assessment system''' (CAS) test is an individually administered test of cognitive functioning for children and adolescents ranging from 5 through 17 years of age that was designed to assess the planning, attention, simultaneous and successive cognitive processes as described in the [PASS theory of intelligence].

== History ==
CAS development began with an attempt to offer an alternative to the [[IQ test]] (Das, Kirby &amp; Jarman, 1975,&lt;ref name=das-kirby-jarman-1975&gt;Das, J. P., Kirby, J. R., &amp; Jarman R. F. (1975).  Simultaneous and successive syntheses:  An alternative model for cognitive abilities.  Psychological Bulletin, 82, 87–103.&lt;/ref&gt; 1979&lt;ref name=das-kirby-jarman-1979&gt;Das, J. P., Kirby, J. R., &amp; Jarman, R. F. (1979). Simultaneous and successive cognitive processes. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). Developed and published in 1997 by [[Jagannath Prasad Das (psychologist)|J.P. Das]], PhD of the [[University of Alberta]] and Jack Naglieri, PhD, then at [[Ohio State University]], the CAS has its theoretical bases both in the [[neuropsychology]] of Luria as well as in [[cognitive psychology]].

CAS is based on the planning, attention-arousal, simultaneous and successive (PASS) cognitive processing theory (or the [[PASS Theory of Intelligence]]), a modern theory within the information-processing framework (Das, Naglieri &amp; Kirby, 1994&lt;ref name=das-naglieri-kirby-1994&gt;Das, J. P., Naglieri, J. A., &amp; Kirby, J. R. (1994). Assessment of cognitive processes. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;). Roots of CAS are in Luria’s (1973)&lt;ref name=luria-1973&gt;Luria, A. R. (1973). The working brain: An introduction to neuropsychology. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; organization of cognitive functions in the brain as well as in cognitive psychology of Baddeley, Estes, Posner and other contemporary psychologists. Their work has guided the selection and interpretation of CAS tests.

The [[Kaufman assessment battery for children]] or KABC by ([[Alan S. Kaufman]], 1983&lt;ref name=kaufman-kaufman-1983&gt;Kaufman, A.S., &amp; Kaufman, N.L. (1983). Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. Circle Pines, MN: American Guidance Service.&lt;/ref&gt;
) is perhaps the first battery of commercially available tests to provide a psychometric assessment of cognitive processes. K-ABC has used several references to the early research of Das and his colleagues (Das, Kirby &amp; Jarman,1979&lt;ref name=das-kirby-jarman-1979 /&gt;) on simultaneous and successive processing, a precursor to PASS theory. KABC did not assess the Arousal-Attention, and Planning functions, as CAS did, until K-ABC II appeared in 2004. The latter provides two theoretical bases, one of them in Luria (1966)&lt;ref name=luria-1966&gt;Luria, A. R. (1966). Higher cortical functions in man. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and by default, the 4 PASS processes) and the other in Cattell-Horn-Carroll model (CHC) which is essentially an elaboration of fluid and crystallized intelligence (McGrew 2005&lt;ref name=mcgrew-2005&gt;McGrew, K.S. (2005). The Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory of Cognitive Abilities. D. Flanagan &amp; P. L. Harrison (Editors). Contemporary Intellectual Assessment New York: The Guilford Press. Pp136-182.&lt;/ref&gt;). Some may consider this a strength of KABC-II. However, two important features of CAS have set it apart from ability measures within fluid and crystallized abilities of CHC, and verbal-performance IQ:

* CAS is a system of assessment of ‘processes’, not abilities. Ability tests such as WISC/WAIS
* those that measure fluid and crystallized abilities address different constructs than process assessments.  CAS process measures may have the same contents in several of its sub-tests (i.e. verbal, as in Simultaneous Verbal, and Word-series, see next section) but the codes are different (Simultaneous contrasted with Successive. see McCrea 2009&lt;ref name=mccrea-2009&gt;McCrea, S.M.(2009). A cognitive neuropsychological examination of the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System Subtests: A report of three stroke cases studied longitudinally during recovery.  International Journal of Neuroscience,119,553–599.&lt;/ref&gt; for further discussion).

== The CAS battery ==
[[File:Cas-structure.jpg|frame|right|Cognitive process subtests in the CAS battery]]
The CAS standard battery consists of three subtests for each PASS Scale (12 subtests in all) whereas the basic battery has 2 subtests for each scale (8 in total). It takes an hour to administer the standard battery and 40 minutes for the basic battery (Naglieri &amp; Das, 1997&lt;ref name=naglieri-das-1997&gt;Naglieri, J. A., &amp; Das, J. P. (1997). Cognitive Assessment System.  Administration and scoring manual. Interpretive handbook. Itasca, IL: Riverside.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The CAS battery provides a standard score for each process as well as a Full Scale standard score. The average internal reliability coefficients across ages 15–17 for the PASS scales are:

* Planning = .88
* Attention = .88
* Simultaneous = .93
* Successive = .93
* Full Scale = .96.

Each of these scales are described in detail below. For further explanation, see Naglieri, 1999 (B),&lt;ref name=naglieri-1999b&gt;Naglieri, J. A. (1999 B). How valid is the PASS theory and CAS? School Psychology Review, 28, 145–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Naglieri &amp; Das (2005).&lt;ref name=naglieri-2005&gt;Naglieri, J. A., (2005). The Cognitive Assessment System. In D. P. Flanagan and P. L. Harrison (Eds.) Contemporary Intellectual Assessment (Second Edition) (pp. 441–460). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional details on the origin of each of the 12 tests in CAS have been discussed at some length in Das, Naglieri &amp;Kirby (1994)&lt;ref name=das-naglieri-kirby-1994 /&gt; and more recently in a review by McCrea (2009).&lt;ref name=mccrea-2009 /&gt;

=== Planning Scale ===
Planning helps us select or develop strategies needed to complete tasks for which a solution is needed, and is critical to all activities where an individual has to determine how to solve a problem The Planning scale includes matching numbers, planned codes, and planned connections.

In the matching numbers subtest, children are presented with four pages containing eight rows of numbers. The child is instructed to underline the two numbers that are the same.

The planned codes subtest contains two pages, each with a distinct set of codes arranged in seven rows and eight columns. At the top of each page is a legend that indicates how letters relate to simple codes (e.g., A = OX; B = XX; C = OO). In the planned connections (a variation of Trails test) subtest the child is instructed to connect numbers in sequence that appear in a quasi-random order (e.g., 1–2–3, etc.). For these two tests, the child connects numbers and letters in sequential order, alternating between numbers and letters (e.g., 1-A-2-B, etc.).

All Planning subtests include strategy assessment. This is conducted after the administration of each subtest and recorded in two categories:

*Observed strategies – those seen by the examiner
* Reported strategies – those obtained following completion of an item (Naglieri,1999 A&lt;ref name=naglieri-1999a&gt;Naglieri, J. A. (1999 A). Essentials of CAS assessment. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Attention Scale ===
Attention is a mental process that involves focusing on selected aspects of external events, internal events, or stimuli. Attention is controlled by intentions and goals. The Attention scale includes the expressive attention, number detection, and receptive attention subtests.

Expressive attention (a variation of the Stroop test) has two forms, one for children 7 years and younger, and the other 8 &amp; over.

The receptive attention subtest contains two separate tasks; in the first task, targets are letters that are physically the same (e.g., BB but not Bb). For the second task, targets are letters that have the same name (e.g., Bb but not Ab). This subtest is an adaptation of Posner &amp; Boise (1971).&lt;ref name=posner-boise-1971&gt;Posner, M.I.&amp; Boise, S.J. (1971)  Components of attention. Psychological Review,78,391–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Simultaneous Scale ===
Simultaneous processing is essential for organization of information into groups or a coherent whole. It requires both nonverbal and verbal processing for the analyses and synthesis of logical and grammatical components of language and comprehension of word relationships. The Simultaneous scale has nonverbal matrices, verbal spatial relations, and figure memory.

Nonverbal matrices items present a variety of shapes; it is similar to Progressive Matrices.

Verbal spatial relations subtest measures the comprehension of logical and grammatical descriptions of spatial relationships. In this subtest, the child is presented with six drawings, arranged in a specific spatial manner, and a printed question (e.g., show me the triangle to the left of the circle). The child is instructed to choose one of the six drawings that best answers the question.

In Figure memory, a combination of Figure-Copying and Memory for Designs, the child is presented a two- or three-dimensional geometric figure for 5 seconds and then presented immediately with a response page, on which the original geometric figure is embedded in a larger, more complex geometric pattern. The child is asked to identify the original design.

=== Successive Scale ===
Successive processing is involved whenever information must be remembered or completed in a specific order or sequence. The Successive scale has word series, sentence repetition, and sentence questions.

In word series, the examiner reads the child a series of words and then asks to repeat the words in the same order.

Sentence repetition requires the child to read 20 sentences aloud one by one. After each sentence is read, the child is asked to repeat the sentence exactly as presented.

The sentence questions subtest uses the same type of sentences that are used in the sentence repetition subtest. However, now the child is read a sentence and asked a question about it. For example, the examiner reads “The blue yellows the green” and asks the child “Who yellows the green?” In a modified form, it has been used as a test of working memory.

Speech Rate (Ages 5 to 7) is an 8-item timed subtest that requires the child to repeat a string of 3 common words, such as dog-girl-book, over and over again as fast as possible until asked to stop. The score is the time it takes the child to complete 10 repetitions before stopping.

== Present Use ==
CAS is used for understanding cognitive development of typical and atypical children, as well as cognitive impairment in adults. It has been used for research, diagnosis, and clinical evaluation by several professionals including educational and school psychologists because it provides good guidelines for educational interventions.

Research on the relationship between the CAS and achievement has shown that the PASS processes strongly predict academic achievement in spite of the fact that it does not include vocabulary (Naglieri and Rojahn, 2004&lt;ref name=naglieri-rojahn-2004&gt;Naglieri, J. A., &amp; Rojahn, J. R. (2004). Validity of the PASS Theory and CAS:  Correlations with Achievement.  Journal of Educational Psychology, 96, 174–181.&lt;/ref&gt;). Similarly, CAS tests have been used for understanding, assessment of and intervention with educational problems associated with reading disabilities (Das, 2009&lt;ref name=das-2009&gt;Das, J.P. (2009). Reading difficulties and Dyslexia:An interpretation for teachers. New Delhi:SAGE International Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
) such as autism, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (Naglieri, 2005&lt;ref name=naglieri-2005 /&gt;). CAS tests have also been used for clinical evaluation of mental retardation and cognitive changes in ageing (Das, 2003&lt;ref name=das-2003&gt;Das, J.P. (2003). Cognitive Aging and Down Syndrome: An Interpretation .International Review of Research in mental retardation. Volume 26, Pp 261–306.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Deserving of special mention is the use of CAS tests for fair assessment of minorities (Naglieri, 2005&lt;ref name=naglieri-2005 /&gt;) and First Nation children whose chronic weakness in reading has been identified as a successive processing deficit compounded by poor home literacy (Das, Janzen &amp; Georgiou, 2007&lt;ref name=das-janzen-georgiou-2007&gt;Das JP, Janzen T, Georgiou GK. (2007). Correlates of Canadian Native Children's Reading Performance: From Cognitive Styles to Cognitive Processes. Journal of School Psychology 45(6):589–602.&lt;/ref&gt;) both of which can be improved through PASS-related intervention (Hayward, Das &amp; Janzen, 2007&lt;ref name=hayward-das-janzen-2007&gt;Hayward D, Das JP, Janzen T. (2007). Innovative programs for improvement in reading through cognitive enhancement: a remediation study of Canadian First Nations children. Journal of Learning Disabilities 40(5):443–57.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Additionally, CAS with supplementary tests has been found useful for research related to executive decision making in management (Das, Kar, &amp; Parrila,1996&lt;ref name=das-kar-parilla-1996&gt;Das, J.P., Kar, B. &amp; Parrila, R. (1996). Cognitive Planning:The psychological basis of intelligent behaviour.  New Delhi:SAGE International Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;).

CAS withstands adaptation and translation into other languages. CAS in Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Castillian), Norwegian and Swedish are commercially available. In addition, CAS has been used in Chinese, Greek, Norwegian and Dutch research.

== Criticisms ==
The CAS meets at least two challenges, first in terms of its factor-analytic purity (Naglieri &amp; Das,1997 Interpretive handbook), and second in extending its scope by supplementary tests, especially for assessment of Executive Functions.

The validity of CAS comprising the 4 PASS constructs is adequately supported by several books and studies (Das, Naglieri, &amp; Kirby, 1994;&lt;ref name=das-naglieri-kirby-1994 /&gt; Das, Kar &amp; Parilla, 1996;&lt;ref name=das-kar-parilla-1996 /&gt; Das, 2009&lt;ref name=das-2009 /&gt;). The CAS Interpretive Handbook, (Naglieri and Das, 1997&lt;ref name=naglieri-das-1997 /&gt;) reported information about the factor structure of the CAS providing evidence that the PASS four-factor solution was the best solution based on the convergence of factor-analytic results, clinical utility of the four separate scores, evidence of strategy use and theoretical interpretation of the subtests.

Keith and Kranzler (1999&lt;ref name=keith-kranzler-1999&gt;Keith, T. Z., &amp; Kranzler, J. H. (1999). Independent confirmatory factor analysis of the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS): What does the CAS measure? School Psychology Review, 28, 117–144.&lt;/ref&gt;) challenged this position and argued that there was insufficient support. Naglieri (1999 B&lt;ref name=naglieri-1999b /&gt;) and Puhan, Das &amp; Naglieri (2005)&lt;ref name=puhan-das-naglieri-2005&gt;Puhan, G., Das, J.P.&amp; Naglieri, J.A. (2005). Separating planning and attention: evidential and consequential validity. Canadian Journal of School Psychology, 20, 75–84.&lt;/ref&gt; responded with reasonable evidence and rational arguments in defense of the structure of the test and the validity of the 4-factor CAS. However, the issue has not yet been resolved as yet.

Additionally, the importance of using factor-analysis in support of theories of intelligence has not been supported by major contemporary theories of intelligence such as those advanced by Gardner, Robert Sternberg, Das (2004)&lt;ref name=das-2004&gt;Das, J.P. (2004). Theories of intelligence: issues and applications. In Hersen, M. (Eds.), Comprehensive Handbook of Psychological Assessment Volume 1 (pp. 5–21). New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt; or even by Jensen (2006)&lt;ref name=jensen-2006&gt;Jensen, A.R. (2006). Clocking the mind. Oxford:Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; in his chronometric approach to general intelligence, Clocking the Mind. An insistence on factor analytic confirmation may even be a hindrance to the desirable goal of closing the gap between psychology and the business of intelligence test development. The challenge for CAS is to extend itself into new areas of cognitive importance such as Executive Functions, and evaluation of neuropsychological impairments in an aging population. Curiously enough, few if any of the existing assessment instruments for these areas have emphasized the necessity of factor analysis.

Insofar as constructive criticism goes, supplementary tests are necessary for extending the application of CAS. To begin with existing tests, the Successive subtests should have a nonverbal measure, such as Luria’s test that asks participants to continue a series “+++__ __+++__ __+++__ __......”, or a motor response of tapping to dot sequences such as “… .. … .. … … .. ” as given in Das, Kirby &amp; Jarman (1979).&lt;ref name=das-kirby-jarman-1979 /&gt;

Similarly, Attention subtests should include both a continuous performance test, and a more cognitively loaded vigilance test (Das, Naglieri &amp; Kirby,1994).&lt;ref name=das-naglieri-kirby-1994 /&gt; In regard to Executive Functions, one would notice that elements of it are already included in CAS : Expressive attention (Stroop) = inhibition of response; Planned Connection (Trails) = shifting. But the existing Planning scale must be supplemented by tests of complex planning (Das, Kar &amp; Parrila,1996&lt;ref name=das-kar-parilla-1996 /&gt;), and so-called ‘hot’ tests that involve affective decision making, such as the predicament test (Channon, 2004).&lt;ref name=channnon-2004&gt;Channon, S. (2004). Frontal lobe dysfunction and everyday problem-solving: Social and non-social contributions Acta Psychologica,115: 235–254&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, the CAS will increase its reach as a system for assessment of intelligence in keeping up with advances in psychological and neurological foundations of cognitive functions. Thus it may follow Cronbach’s (1975)&lt;ref name=cronbach-1975&gt;Cronbach, L. J. (1975). Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology. American Psychologist 30:671–84.&lt;/ref&gt; advice for closing the gap between psychology and intelligence testing.

'''David Glyn Bowen''' (1933–2000) was a Welsh [[Congregationalist]] minister and missionary. He grew up in the [[Swansea]] area and attended [[Swansea Grammar School]] (1945–1952). He subsequently studied at University College, [[Cardiff]], graduating in 1955 with an honours degree in [[Hebrew]]. He later studied at [[Memorial College, Brecon]] (where he began to learn Welsh), and [[University of Princeton]], [[United States]] where in 1959 he was awarded the degree of MTh. for a thesis on the Church of [[South India]]. On his return to the UK in 1960, he took up the appointment of minister of Castle Street Congregational Church, Tredegar, [[Monmouthshire]]. In 1963 he married, and under the patronage of the [[London Missionary Society]] he and his wife travelled to [[Western Samoa]] where David was appointed Principal of Malua Theological College, he remained in the position for the next five years. He returned to the UK 1968 on appointment to a teaching post in Stepney, East [[London]]. Subsequently, he was appointed lecturer in Religious Studies at Bradford Training College and he remained there until 1999, when he retired form the position.

His published writings include: ‘The Sathya Sai Baba Hindu Community in Bradford’ (the subject of his PhD(Leeds) thesis), and ‘Who's Jesus Anyway?’, a poem by him which was published in 'Coracle', the official publication of the Iona Community ([[Scotland]]).

He died (of cancer) in May 2000. His funeral was held at Little Lane Church, Bradford.

A '''geoboard''' is a [[mathematical manipulatives| mathematical manipulative]] used to explore basic concepts in [[plane geometry]] such as [[perimeter]], [[area]] and the characteristics of [[triangle]]s and other [[polygon]]s. It consists of a physical board with a certain number of nails half driven in, around which are wrapped [[geo bands]] that are made of rubber. rubber bands can also be used.

Geoboards were invented and popularized in the 1950s by Egyptian mathematician [[Caleb Gattegno]] (1911-1988).&lt;ref name=geoboard&gt;{{cite book|last=Gattegno|first=Caleb|title=Geoboard geometry.|year=1971|publisher=Educational Solutions Worldwide Inc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0-87825-020-2|pages=72|url=http://issuu.com/eswi/docs/1027_geoboard_geometry}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Structure and use==
A variety of boards are used. Originally made out of plywood and brass nails or pegs, geoboards are now usually made out of plastic. They may have an upright [[square lattice]] of 9, 16 or 25 nails or more, or a circle of nails around a central nail. Students are asked to place rubber bands around the nails to explore geometric concepts or to solve mathematical puzzles.

Geoboards may be used to learn about:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=edited by|title=Mathematics : meeting the challenge|year=1992|publisher=Mathematical Association of Victoria|location=Brunswick, Vic.|isbn=0-909315-49-3|pages=283–288|author=Carroll, J.|editor=Horne, Marj |editor2=Supple, Marjorie|chapter=Using the geoboard for teaching primary mathematics}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 January 2012--&gt; [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Using+geoboards+in+primary+mathematics:+going+...+going+...+gone%3F...-a0181898042 cited by Hilary Scandrett]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Albert McElroy''' (born 25 May 1922, [[Houston, Texas]], died 7 October 2006) was a prominent pioneering [[African-American]] journalist. Among many "firsts" achieved by McElroy, he became the first African American to earn a [[master's degree]] in [[journalism]] from the [[Missouri School of Journalism|University of Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15294613/ns/us_news-life/t/george-mcelroy-columnist-reporter-dies/#.UCw8CZ2PV_A |title=George McElroy, columnist and reporter, dies - US news - Life - Race &amp; ethnicity - NBCNews.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
George McElroy was born 25 May 1922 in [[Houston, Texas]] to Hugh and Philomena McElroy.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/houstonchronicle/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=19535518|title=George Albert McElroy Obituary: View George McElroy's Obituary by Houston Chronicle |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Hugh George McElroy was a highly decorated war veteran who fought in the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] against [[Pancho Villa]] and who fought alongside General [[John J. Pershing]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]], and later was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] for his bravery in service during World War I.&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmcbx |title=McElroy, George Albert |author=Merline Pitre |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George McElroy was raised in the [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]] area of Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Serbino Sandifer-Walker |url=http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/George-McElroy-A-storyteller-history-maker-1868163.php |title=George McElroy: A storyteller, history maker - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=2006-10-15 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from St Nicholas High School, he served in the [[United States Navy]], usually stationed in Asia from 1940 to 1948, then as an information specialist at [[Ellington Air Force Base]] in [[Houston]].&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Pioneering-black-columnist-George-McElroy-dies-1515403.php |title=Pioneering black columnist George McElroy dies |author=Sarah Viren and Alexis Grant |newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and fight against segregation==
After he was [[Honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] from the military, McElroy returned to his still-segregated home state of Texas. Due to [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] (separate, but equal) laws of the time, he was forced to attend [[Texas Southern University]] (then-called Texas State University for Negroes (TSUN)) after being denied admission to the [[University of Texas]] (UT). He had applied to the University of Texas following the landmark decision of [[Sweatt v. Painter]]. In his letter of denial from UT, he was told that UT and TSUN both offered the courses he was seeking. Being a Negro, according to segregation laws, he had to attend TSUN. He responded to the denial  letter from UT stating that although the courses were offered at both universities, there was little else "equal" about the universities.&lt;ref name=before_brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavergne|first=Gary M.|title=Before Brown|year=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas, USA|isbn=978-0-292-72200-2|pages=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q--b6ExcLUwC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=george+mcelroy+journalist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nx6yP1aWXR&amp;sig=RWWhD0a61S7aN-XVUHNtqFZXnzs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EDwsUJvbPOHfyAGHx4HYBg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20mcelroy%20journalist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
McElroy sued for the right to attend UT,&lt;ref name=legacy /&gt; but ultimately earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in journalism from TSUN in 1956.&lt;ref name="brick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brickfish.com/pages/blogs/blogview.aspx?bid=23800&amp;returnurl=list |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118233651/http://www.brickfish.com/pages/blogs/blogview.aspx?bid=23800&amp;returnurl=list |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-18 |title=Brickfish Social Media: George McElroy |publisher=Brickfish.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McElroy received a [[scholarship]] from the [[Wall Street Journal]] to attend the [[Missouri School of Journalism|University of Missouri]].&lt;ref name="chron_pioneer" /&gt; In 1970, he became the first African American to earn a [[master's degree]] in journalism from the university.

==Journalism career==
In 1937, McElroy landed a job as a youth column writer at the ''Informer'', the oldest African-American newspaper in Texas. He was paid $3 per column. Throughout his off-and-on 58-year tenure with the newspaper, he functioned in virtually every capacity of running the periodical. He retired in 1996, but served as ''Editor Emeritus'' until his death in 2006.&lt;ref name="darden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baystate-banner.com/archives/stories/2006/10/101206-12.htm |title=Pioneering black journalist McElroy dies at age 84 |publisher=Baystate-banner.com |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from the University of Missouri, McElroy considered several job offers and accepted a position as a "colored sports" writer for the now-defunct [[Houston Post]] daily [[newspaper]] in 1954&lt;ref name=book_nabj&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Wayne|title=Black Journalists: The NABJ Story|year=1997|publisher=August Press|location=United States of America|isbn=0-9635720-4-0|pages=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I21yBNr9eQoC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=george+mcelroy+journalist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YA3Wh8gQsg&amp;sig=x-l4_vQiz40z2b5o874TphNiPTI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EDwsUJvbPOHfyAGHx4HYBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20mcelroy%20journalist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and in 1956, he became a weekly columnist.&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.hsj.org/Schools/Newspaper/tabid/100/view/frontpage/schoolid/781/articleid/108117/newspaperid/757/A_true_pioneer_Newsman_and_mentor_George_McElroy_inspired_many_area_black_journalists.aspx |title=Insight - Houston Chronicle Classroom - A true pioneer: Newsman and mentor George McElroy inspired many area black journalists |publisher=My.hsj.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was the first black reporter and the first black columnist at the paper which, at that time, was the largest morning newspaper in Texas.&lt;ref name=jet_columbia&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jet Stringer's Article in Columbia U. Journal|journal=Jet Magazine|date=15 April 1965|volume=28|issue=1|pages=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ysIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In spite of his position as a regular columnist, his likeness in the paper above his column was a black and white sketch of his image as opposed to photos as presented for his white counterparts at the paper.&lt;ref name=chron_pioneer /&gt;

In response to question to him c. 1970 from a reader of his column, McElroy responded:&lt;ref name=chron_pioneer /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world, the nation, the state, the city are all multicolored, as in a rainbow and multiracial. A professional journalist simply cannot afford to reside in a racial-isolation ward. He must travel and he must converse and he must observe and he must be curious.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1960, during an annual meeting of the Houston Press Club, the club presented a skit portraying the year's presidential candidates. (McElroy was the first African American member of the club). Local television reporter [[Dave Ward (reporter)|Dave Ward]] portrayed [[Democratic Party (United States)|democratic]] candidate [[Lyndon Johnson]]. Performing in [[Whiteface (performance)|whiteface]], McElroy portrayed the role of  [[Alabama]] [[governor|Gov.]] [[George Wallace]],&lt;ref name=gridiron /&gt; a vigilant [[segregationist]], after no one else wanted to portray the [[Independent (politician)#United States|independent]] candidate.&lt;ref name=wallace group=Note&gt;Gov. George Wallace is best known for his infamous attempt to block the de-segregation of the [[University of Alabama]] and four elementary schools in defiance of federal mandates. {{cite web|last=Webb|first=Debbie|title=Wallace in the Schoolhouse Door: Marking the 40th Anniversary of Alabama's Civil Rights Standoff|url=https://www.npr.org/2003/06/11/1294680/wallace-in-the-schoolhouse-door|publisher=NPR.org|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This portrayal made McElroy the first black cast member of the club's annual "Gridiron Show". Picketers lined the streets and the cast members received death threats leading to Houston mayor [[Louie Welch]] provided police protection for McElroy for 72 hours.&lt;ref name=chron_golden /&gt;

Also in 1960, thirteen students from Texas Southern, led by Eldrewey Stearns, held a [[sit-in]] at the counter at a Houston area Weingarten store in protest of segregation using a model laid out by experienced sit-in students at [[Fisk University]]. In planning how to attract press coverage for the sit-in, they contacted McElroy for input who committed to send a photographer from ''The Informer'' and advised on calling the police themselves. This tip proved to be instrumental in the protest. Over 100 people eventually participated in the protest which ended peacefully. The Houston television and printed press coverage dubbed the event as the "first sit-in west of the Mississippi."&lt;ref name=no_color&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Thomas R.|title=No Color Is My Kind: The Life of Eldrewey Stearns and the Integration of Houston|year=1997|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas, USA|isbn=978-0-292-71198-3|pages=26–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaQN9VP6NAwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McElroy also served as the Texas correspondent for [[Jet Magazine]] and was elected as President of the Press Club of Houston.&lt;ref name="gridiron" /&gt; Throughout his career as a journalist, McElroy interviewed numerous persons of interest including [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Fidel Castro]],&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt; [[Muhammad Ali]], [[George Foreman]] and six American presidents.&lt;ref name=brick /&gt;

In a 2000 interview, McElroy stressed the continued need for black press stressing that African Americans are closer to the issues concerning their own community and he credits black press for being first in bringing the effects of crack cocaine into the limelight long before it was deemed an issue in mainstream media.&lt;ref name=albany&gt;{{cite book|last=Owens|first=Reginald|title=The Journal for Multi-Media History: The Black Press|year=2000|publisher=University at Albany, State University of New York|location=New York, New York|url=http://www.albany.edu/jmmh/vol3/blackpress/blackpress.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We cover issues that the major dailies don't see or fail to see. We're closer to problems and concerns in our community. We see them first.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Teaching career==
Simultaneously with his journalism career, McElroy taught journalism in the Houston area for over four decades.&lt;ref name="chron_pioneer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Pioneering-black-columnist-George-McElroy-dies-1515403.php |title=Pioneering black columnist George McElroy dies - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holywood Rudolf Steiner School''' is a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]] located in [[Holywood]], [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]] which teaches children using methods inspired by [[Rudolf Steiner]]. The school is [[co-educational]], serving ages 3 to 17 with an enrollment of more than 160 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentschools.com/northern_ireland/the-holywood-rudolf-steiner-school_35610.html Independent Schools Directory: The Holywood Rudolf Steiner School]. Accessed 2008-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was founded in 1975 in two rooms at the [[Glencraig]] [[Camphill Movement|Camphill Community]] at [[Seahill]], just outside Holywood. In the early days the school moved site frequently before moving to its current site at Croft Road in Holywood in 1976. In 1979 a new building which became the school hall was added. In 1993 a new block was built comprising four new classrooms. In 1997, with the help of the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], a new [[kindergarten]] was added. In 2000 another new block of classrooms was completed, again with National Lottery funding.

The school was granted provisional registration as an "independent school" in 1976 and final registration in 1993.&lt;ref name=application&gt;[http://archive.nics.gov.uk/edu/061005e-edu.htm Application for maintained status turned down], Department for Education News Release, 5 October 2006. Accessed on 2008-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The school's application for "maintained status" was turned down in 2006 because the school did not take steps to meet certain statutory and other mandatory requirements. The department made no objections in principle to state funding. During negotiations senior civil servants acknowledged the benefits of breaking the Steiner School into the state sector, and drew parallels with the decision of the State to fund Irish language schools. Officials at the Department of Education in Northern Ireland have followed closely developments in England where the New Labour administration initiated steps to provide state funding for a number of Steiner Schools, a development that came to fruition under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. &lt;ref name=application/&gt;

==Integration==
Holywood's school website contends that it "has some claim to be the first fully [[Integrated Education|integrated school]] in Northern Ireland since the troubles began as it has had children from different communities sharing their culture, gifts and abilities throughout the school's history."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5363">Policy '''Impact Assessments''' (IAs) are formal, evidence-based procedures that assess the economic, social, and environmental effects of [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelle|first=Camilla|author2=Weiland, Sabine |title=Policy assessment: the state of the art|journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal|date=2012|volume=30|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1080/14615517.2012.663256}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been incorporated into policy making in the [[OECD]] countries and the [[European Commission]].

Key types of impact assessments include global assessments (global level), policy impact assessment (policy level), strategic environmental assessment (programme and plan level), and [[environmental impact assessment]] (project level). Impact assessments can focus on specific themes, such as [[social impact assessment]]s and gender impact assessments.

IAs can improve legislation by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Klaus|author2=Ferretti, Johanna |author3=Guske, Anna-Lena |author4=Turnpenny, John |author5=Jordan, Andrew |author6= Adelle, Camilla |title=Sustainability in Impact Assessments A Review of Impact Assessment Systems in selected OECD countries and the European Commission|journal=OECD|date=2011|volume=SG/SD(2011)6/FINAL|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/Sustainability%20in%20impact%20assessment%20SG-SD%282011%296-FINAL.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informing policy makers about potential economic, social, and environmental ramifications
* Improving transparency so that contributions to sustainability and "better regulation" are disclosed and [[Special Interest Group|special interest]] [[lobbying]] is discouraged
* Increasing public participation in order to reflect a range of considerations, thereby improving the legitimacy of policies
* Clarifying how public policy helps achieve its goals and priorities through policy indicators
* Contributing to continuous learning in policy development by identifying causalities that inform ex-post review of policies

== Procedure ==
The department which is responsible for the policy proposal usually has to carry out the IA. Although the purpose and orientation of IA procedures differ, IA guidelines in the various jurisdictions all follow a similar set of steps to be followed by desk officers:
# Planning of the IA
# Carrying out the impact analysis
# Consultation of affected stakeholders and the general public
# Coordination with affected departments
# Summary and presentation of findings in a report
# Forwarding findings to decision makers
# Publication of the IA report (not in all countries)

The analytical steps, which mainly relate to step 2, can be set out as
i.	Problem definition
ii.	Definition of policy objectives
iii.	Development of policy options
iv.	Analysis of impacts
v.	Comparison of policy options and recommendation of one option
vi.	Defining monitoring measures.

== Methods ==
Throughout the IA process, methods can be used for support. In recent years governments have increasingly invested in developing and applying methods and tools for IA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Podhora|first=Aranka |author2=Helming, K |author3=Adenäuer, L. |author4=Heckelei, T. |author5=Kautto, P. |author6=Reidsma, P. |author7=Rennings, K. |author8=Turnpenny, J. |author9=Jansen, J.|title=).

Depending on usage, IA methods can be classified as methods for
* Scoping (e.g., checklists)
* For qualitative analysis (e.g., [[focus groups]])
* For quantitative analysis (e.g., [[life-cycle assessment]], [[material flow accounting]], modelling)
* Aggregation and comparison of options (e.g., [[cost–benefit analysis]])
* Analysing coherence (e.g., Gender IA)
* Supporting participation and involvement (e.g., internet consultation)
* Data presentation and involvement (e.g., [[GIS]])
* [[Monitoring and evaluation]] (e.g., indicators)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LIAISE – Network of Excellence|title=LIAISE KIT – Knowledge for Decision Making|url=http://www.liaise-kit.eu/|accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Long a professor of English and Comparative Literature at [[San Diego State University]], Farber taught subsequently for seven years in the English Department at the [[University of San Diego]]. He is widely known as the author of a 1967 anti-establishment essay, "[[The Student as Nigger]]," in which he likened the student-professor relationship in American universities to that of slave and master.  This piece, based on his experience as a teacher and as an often-arrested activist in the civil rights movement, served as the title essay of his first book.  Subsequent books were ''The University of Tomorrowland'' and ''A Field Guide to the Aesthetic Experience''.  Since then he has published essays that include "The Third Circle: On Education and Distance Learning," "What Is Literature?  What Is Art?  Integrating Essence and History," "Toward a Theoretical Framework for the Study of Humor in Literature and the Other Arts," "Teaching and Presence," and "On Not Betraying Poetry."  Farber’s short story “Gorman,” which appeared in his first book, was included in ''The Year’s Best Science Fiction No. 4'', edited by [[Brian Aldiss]] and [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]].

As a child, Farber was a radio actor and also appeared as Fleance in Orson Welles’s film version of [[Macbeth]].  A member of the 500 Club, made up of child actors who had each appeared in over 500 radio shows, Farber initiated the role of Stevie Kent, president of the Beverly Hills Beavers, on [[The Jack Benny Program]].  Among the other radio shows on which he appeared were [[The Great Gildersleeve]], [[Lux Radio Theatre]], [[The Screen Guild Theatre]], [[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]], and [[Suspense]].  In addition, he performed in a number of radio adaptations of literary works—appearing as [[David Copperfield]] on Favorite Story, as [[Huckleberry Finn]] on [[NBC University Theater]], and as [[Oliver Twist]], together with [[Basil Rathbone]] as Fagin, on [[Stars over Hollywood (radio program)|Stars Over Hollywood]].  He played Oliver Twist again, with Rathbone, on a [[Columbia Records]] album.

==Civil rights movement participation==
In the civil rights movement, Farber was a member of the Non-Violent Action Committee (N-VAC), which was formed as a more militant alternative to the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], and which was active in fighting job discrimination in [[Los Angeles]]. He was arrested seven times during this period, serving a number of jail sentences, and was arrested on one further occasion for participating in an anti-[[Vietnam War]] demonstration against [[The Dow Chemical Co.]], which supplied napalm to the U.S. military.  He was present as an observer for N-VAC throughout the Watts Rebellion (often referred to as the [[Watts Riots]]) in 1965.  His account of this event was first published in the L.A. Free Press and has since been reprinted in ''Reporting Civil Rights'', published by the [[Library of America]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">'''Josias Priest''' (''c.'' 1645 – 3 January 1735 in [[Chelsea, London]]) was an [[England|English]] dancer, dancing-master and [[Choreography|choreographer]].

==Biography==
In 1669, Priest was arrested along with four others for dancing and making music without a license. In 1668, he was a dancing-master in [[Holborn]], and in 1675 he moved to [[Leicester Fields]] to run a [[boarding school]] for [[Gentleman|gentlewomen]]. In 1680 he started a similar school at Gorge's House in [[Chelsea, London]]. Here Priest &lt;!--(sic)--&gt; hosted [[opera]]s, including [[John Blow]]'s ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1684) and [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689). It is widely believed that Priest choreographed dances for these and other semi-operas by Purcell, including ''[[Dioclesian]]'', ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', ''[[The Indian Queen (opera)|The Indian Queen]]'', and ''[[King Arthur (opera)|King Arthur]]'' ; however, the evidence is not entirely conclusive. 

In 1699 [[Thomas Bray]] published a collection of dance music which included music for dances by Josias Priest and his son, Thomas Priest. Only one dance by Priest survives, a 'Minuet by Mr Preist'&lt;!--Please do not change this spelling, Preist is correct--&gt; in ''An Essay for the Further Improvement of Dancing'' (1711) published by Edmund Pemberton.  References to Priest's choreography remain in some musical sources, however.  The surviving minuet is for twelve women and uses a limited step vocabulary of [[minuet step]]s forwards, backwards and sideways, the main choreographic interest being in the floor patterns.  It is recorded in a simplified form of [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]] that was typically used for recording [[English country dance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=musdi&amp;fileName=134/musdi134.db&amp;recNum=32&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/musdibib:@field(NUMBER+@band(musdi+134)) facsimile of Priest's choreography] can be found at The Library of Congress' [[An American Ballroom Companion]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leisure Learning Unlimited, Inc.''' is a privately owned continuing-education firm in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], which after operating for nearly four decades, ceased to function normally during the first quarter of 2017. Established in 1979 by Ted Weisgal and Kathy Kamin, Leisure Learning Unlimited (LLU) offered non-credit courses for people interested in taking up new hobbies, getting exercise and recreation, enhancing their careers, and socializing. The face-to-face classes stopped and the online classes were supposed to be offered by a new business.

== Office, main campus and external class locations ==

Leisure Learning's main campus (and its offices and Computer Center) is in Southwest Houston at 6363 Richmond Avenue. Many LLU instructors convene classes at their businesses and homes, particularly the cooking and music instruction classes. Excursions such as hiking, biking, and kayaking, take place at outdoor venues.

== Leisure Learning class schedule ==

LLU prints and distributes its schedule every two and a half months. It is on display in approximately 1,000 locations across the city. The publication racks are usually located at the entrances of restaurants, retail stores, grocery stores, and nightclubs. Several county, municipal, and school system libraries also stock the schedules.

== Variety of classes ==

In a recent course schedule, LLU offered 1,129 sessions of 478 classes on a wide array of subjects, including arts and crafts; fine arts; book and film discussion; cooking and nutrition; do-it-yourself home and vehicle repair; social dancing; photography; computer skills; instrumental and vocal music; travel; relationship advice; business; financial planning; and sports, recreation and fitness.

== Leisure Learning student base ==

As of March 2009, over 11,000 Houston-area residents have taken 20 or more courses from LLU. Of those repeat students, more than 1,200 have taken 50 classes. The large student base and word-of-mouth promotion contribute to LLU's visibility in the greater Houston community.

Many elective students visit from American and European Universities and have the opportunity for hands on training.

Subjects covered:
*[[Anatomy]]
*[[Biochemistry]]
*Community Medicine-Part I
*[[Microbiology]]
*[[Pathology]]
*[[Pharmacology]]
*[[Physiology]]

The basic science training takes place at Deep Campus. After passing all the subjects of basic sciences, a student is promoted to the clinical aspect of the course.

The next five semesters are devoted to the study of clinical sciences, and are held at Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara. The students are intensively trained and evaluated. The third year university examinations are held at the end of the 7th semester, and include the following subjects:

*Community Medicine-Part II
*[[Forensic Medicine]]
*[[Ophthalmology]]
*[[Otorhinolaryngology]]

*[[Medicine]] and allied subjects (Part I &amp; II)
*[[Surgery]] and allied subjects (Part I &amp; II)
*[[Obstetrics]] and [[Gynecology]]
*[[Pediatrics]]

==Hospital==
[[Manipal Teaching Hospital]] (MTH) is a 700-bedded hospital, located at Phulbari, Pokhara. The 5-storey hospital building houses an extensive medical library, students classrooms, a canteen, the main atrium, an auditorium along with outpatient departments and inpatient wards. All the medical students and faculty reside close by in other buildings.

===Treatment cost===
Treatment cost is reasonably affordable. Most tests and interventions are cheaper than that of government hospitals. There is also a Poor Patients' Fund (PPF) that provides free treatment to poor patients.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Poor Patients' Fund (PPF)===
Also known as Asha, the PPF is an [[NGO]] managed by the students (mainly the 5th semester students). Funds are raised by the students by various means such as organizing movie shows, dances, college fetes, sales of T-shirts and sweat shirts, donations from the students and faculty, etc. The fund supports the cost of treatment of those patients who are unable to afford it themselves.

The '''National Examinations Council''' (also known as NECO) is an examination body in [[Nigeria]] that conducts the [[Senior Secondary Certificate Examination]] and the General Certificate in Education in June/July and December/January respectively.

== History ==

NECO was created by former Head of State [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]] in April 1999.&lt;ref name="neco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neconigeria.org/corporate/about.html |title=National Examinations Council (NECO): Introduction |publisher=Neconigeria.org |date=2003-10-30 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5380">A '''Nodal Point''' in UK school admissions over-subscription criteria is a defined geographical location, used as a form of catchment to ensure a school not only serves pupils close to the school but also others slightly further away with little or no priority access to other schools.&lt;ref name="AdmissionsGuidance"&gt;{{cite web |title=Free school admissions guidance |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/389813/Free_School_Admissions_Guidance.pdf |publisher=Department for Education |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases distance from a child's home to the nodal point is used for prioritising admissions, instead of distance to the school itself.  Nodal points can also be known as '''Admissions Points''' or '''Centroid Points'''.&lt;ref name="EuropaSchool"&gt;{{cite web |title=Admissions Policy for Europa School UK |url=https://www2.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/sites/default/files/folders/documents/childreneducationandfamilies/educationandlearning/schools/admissionpolicies/4002_1516.pdf |website=Oxfordshire.gov.uk |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandwellAcademy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sandwell Academy Centroid Points |url=https://www.sandwellacademy.com/Uploads/documents/Y7%20Admissions/Sandwell%20Academy%20Centroid%20Points%202019.pdf |publisher=Sandwell Academy |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term nodal point is also sometimes used within admissions policies to define a specific location ''on school premises'' to which home-school distance will be measured.&lt;ref name="TurnhamAcademy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Turnham Academy Admission Arrangements 2019/2020 |url=https://www.stepacademytrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Turnham-Admission-Arrangements-2019-2020.pdf |publisher=Turnham Academy |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FairlawnPrimary"&gt;{{cite web |title=Admissions Policy |url=http://www.fairlawn.lewisham.sch.uk/admissions/ |publisher=Fairlawn Primary School |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Nodal admissions points are used by some [[local authorities]] to mitigate the effects of the [[Greenwich Judgement]] on their statutory duty to provide sufficient school places for local children.&lt;ref name="sandwellNodalPoints"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandwell Academy Initiative Update|url=https://cmis.sandwell.gov.uk/Cmis5/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=4RzqTG71KAzZ5tikWqHd9gOM1t44r5ruofYMfEzN07r3%2B2I5mNzGAw%3D%3D&amp;rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&amp;mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&amp;d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D|publisher=Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HillingdonNodalPoints"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation Findings: School Admissions Criteria|url=https://modgov.hillingdon.gov.uk/documents/s30734/Detailed%20Consultation%20Responses%20Council%20Response.pdf|publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also used by schools which are not located within, or near the centre of, the area that they are intended to serve,&lt;ref name="EalingFields"&gt;{{cite web |title=Admissions |url=https://ealingfields.org.uk/attending-our-school/admissions |publisher=Ealing Fields High School |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSAreport2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Shan |title=Office of the Schools Adjudicator Annual Report, September 2015 to August 2016 |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/585915/OSA_Annual_Report_2016.pdf |website=Office of the Schools Adjudicator |publisher=Department for Education |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by schools which have opened at a temporary location, pending a move to a permanent site.&lt;ref name="OneDegreeAcademy"&gt;{{cite web |title=One Degree Academy Admissions Policy |url=https://new.enfield.gov.uk/services/children-and-education/one-degree-academy-admission-criteria-2019-children.pdf |publisher=One Degree Academy |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools that are intended to serve a wide area, or several dispersed areas, use transport hubs such as train stations as nodal points.&lt;ref name="BBCBirmingham"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coughlan |first1=Sean |title=One school, four catchment areas |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32412744 |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HealthFuturesUTC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Admissions Policy and Procedure |url=http://www.healthfuturesutc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Admissions-Policy-Procedure-2018.pdf |publisher=Health Futures UTC |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nodal points have also been used to ensure a mixed socio-economic intake.&lt;ref name="BristolScrutinyDoc"&gt;{{cite web |title=School Admission Arrangements in Bristol |url=https://democracy.bristol.gov.uk/documents/s11614/04a.%20Different%20Admission%20Systems.pdf |publisher=Bristol Local Authority |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northern School of Contemporary Dance''' ('''NSCD''') is a higher education institution in [[Chapeltown, Leeds|Chapeltown]], [[Leeds]], England specialising in [[contemporary dance]]. It is an affiliate of the [[Conservatoire for Dance and Drama]], and students can obtain a Bachelor of Performing Arts (B.P.A.) degree, validated by the [[University of Kent]]. A foundation course and postgraduate qualifications are also offered, and a programme of adult, youth and children's classes is available for the local community.

==History and buildings==
The school was founded in 1985 by [[Nadine Senior]] MBE and in 1987 it moved into its current premises, a red-brick former synagogue on Chapeltown Road built 1929-1932. The building is grade II [[listed building|listed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1255639 |desc= The Northern School of Contemporary Dance |grade=II |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are the boundary walls, which probably date to about 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1255641 |desc=Wall gates and piers to north east and west of Northern School of Contemporary Dance |grade=II |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1987 and 1997, a series of phased developments were carried out which extended the site to include the adjacent Brandsby Lodge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nscd.ac.uk/view.aspx?id=20|title=About us; History|publisher=NSCD|accessdate=21 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224131421/http://www.nscd.ac.uk/view.aspx?id=20|archivedate=24 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also a grade II listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1255632 |desc= The Northern School of Contemporary Dance |grade=II |accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This £3.2 million redevelopment, which resulted in the creation of four new dance studios and additional teaching facilities, was completed with funding support from the National Lottery through the Arts Council of England and the Foundation for Sports and the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nscd.ac.uk/view.aspx?id=88|title=About us; History; Timeline|publisher=NSCD|accessdate=1 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228151822/http://www.nscd.ac.uk/view.aspx?id=88|archivedate=28 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the converted Synagogue re-opened its doors as The Dome Theatre and in 1993 was renamed The Riley Theatre in dedication to the memory of Jeffrey Riley, who was the School’s Technical Director between 1985 and 1993.

Founding Principal Nadine Senior MBE retired in 2001 and was replaced in 2002 by Gurmit Hukam. A year later, in 2003, NSCD became officially affiliated to the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdd.ac.uk/affiliate-schools/nscd/|title=Affiliate Schools; NSCD|publisher=CDD|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Janet Smith left her position as Artistic Director of Scottish Dance Theatre to become the current principal of the School.

==Vocational training==
NSCD offers full-time vocational training in contemporary dance at foundation, degree and postgraduate diploma/MA level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nscd.ac.uk/view.aspx?id=230|title=Courses; Our courses|publisher=NSCD|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The training includes classes influenced by the techniques of Cunningham and Graham, the more modern hybrid, evolved techniques and release based techniques as well as complementary training in ballet, yoga and fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nscd.ac.uk/view.aspx?id=233|title=Courses; Our courses; BPA (hons) in Contemporary Dance; Technique and Performance Practice|publisher=NSCD|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre for Advanced Training==
In 2004, with funding support from the Department for Children, Schools &amp; Families’ Music and Dance Scheme, NSCD and [[Northern Ballet]] came together to establish Yorkshire Young Dancers (YYD), the first national dance Centre for Advanced Training (CAT) in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nscd.ac.uk/view.aspx?id=640|title=Community Programmes; Yorkshire Young Dancers (YYD) National Centre for Advanced Training|publisher=NSCD|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now a total of 10 dance CATs offering pre-vocational dance training to young people across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaldancecats.co.uk/|title=National Dance Cats|publisher=National Dance Cats|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Boerbok.jpg|thumb|100px|A Boer goat buck, This is some of the breed of goat found at Ogongo Agricultural College]]
The '''Ogongo  Agricultural College''' is a college based in [[Omusati Region]], in the northern part of Namibia. The college was founded in 1973 to train locals in agriculture. The college was closed between 1988 and 1992 due to civil disorder.The Ogongo Agricultural College is part of the University of Namibia  and it has led to job creation for the local population and attracts visitors from across the country as well as abroad. Apart from employment, the college, which is at the moment known as the University of Namibia Ogongo campus offers the inhabitants a variety of agricultural products such as milk, vegetables as well as meat. the campus in addition is a relief to poor parents and guardians who could not afford to send their children to a far away town such as Windhoek in order for them to get tertiary education, the campus is situated in the village and therefore cuts even costs for transport, accommodation and food as some student commute from home to school everyday. apart from that, the campus is also of great help to its inhabitants on the fact that it offers its open buildings to host various community functions such as award ceremonies of the local schools, weddings, or most commonly the entertainment events like Miss Ogongo and others . by doing this the institution promotes youth empowerment of the youth in the village. The Campus is on a 4,350 ha farm of which 1000 ha serves as a game park. This offers a unique opportunity to conduct almost all student field practical on campus and a further opportunity for research and community engagements in agriculture production and the management of natural resources.

 Indeed, the campus is mandated to develop innovative ways of crop and animal production as well as environmental management and instil this knowledge in the student clientele and the community.Training at Ogongo focuses on Agriculture, Management of natural resources and Environmental Science. Specifically, students may opt for any of the four (4) flagship programmes, namely the Bachelor of Science Degree in Crop Science, Bachelor of Science Degree in Integrated Environmental Science, Diploma in Agriculture as well as the Diploma in Natural Resources Management. All students admitted at Ogongo have a chance to be accommodated in the University hostels, making it very convenient to access the Campus facilities even at night. Being a Campus with a low student population, inter-personal interactions are actualized creating a homely, conducive learning environment.[http://www.unam.edu.na/ogongo-campus]

==History==
The idea to start OpenSesame came to the founders Don Spear, Joshua Blank, Aaron Bridges and Tom Turnbull in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2013/02/meet-the-40-opensesames-josh-blank.html | title=Meet the 40: OpenSesame's Josh Blank VIDEO | publisher=Portland Business Journal | date=7 February 2013 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Andy Giegerich}}&lt;/ref&gt; They founded the company on the idea to aggregate fragmented elearning content from reputable publishers and resources including [[FranklinCovey]], Cegos and Wiley through a Learning Management System (LMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silkroad.com/event/silkroad-partners-opensesame-deliver-personalized-elearning-solution/ | title=SilkRoad Partners with OpenSesame to Deliver Personalized eLearning Solution | publisher=SilkRoad | accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bluevolt.com/news/portland-based-technology-company-bluetech-llc-expands/ | title=Portland-Based Technology Company BlueTech, LLC Expands | publisher=Bluevolt | date=27 October  2010 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Kim Oates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elearningindia.in/e-learning-products/off-the-shelf-courses/ | title=Off the shelf courses | publisher=E-Learning India | accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on creating an ecommerce platform where any seller can add courses for sale and any buyer can purchase courses for use in their company's learning and development program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2014/07/opensesame_out_on_its_own_work.html | title=OpenSesame, out on its own, works to upgrade 'e-learning' | publisher=Oregon Live | date=10 July 2014 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Mike Rogoway}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went through the [[Portland State University]] Business Accelerator and after conducting a few pilot trials, OpenSesame received seed funding of $2 million from Harmony Investments on October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://siliconflorist.com/2011/09/12/opensesame-unlocks-2-million-funding/ | title=OpenSesame unlocks $2 million in funding | publisher=silicon Florist. | date=12 September 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Rick Turoczy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.finsmes.com/2011/10/opensesame-raises-2m-funding.html | title=OpenSesame Raises $2M in Funding | publisher=FinSMEs | date=14 October 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company soon gained some major clients including satellite TV giant [[Dish Network]], SilkRoad Technology, [[Five Guys Burgers]] and [[Fries]]. In January 2014 the company raised another round of Series A funding of $10 million led by [[Partech Ventures]] to create a corporate content delivery platform modeled after [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2014/01/opensesame_portland_e-learning.html | title=OpenSesame, Portland e-learning startup, raises $8 million | publisher=Oregon Live | date=13 January 2014 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Mike Rogoway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/14/opensesame-lands-8m-to-become-the-itunes-of-corporate-training-content/ | title=OpenSesame Lands $8M To Become The iTunes Of Corporate Training Content | publisher=TechCrunch | date=14 Jan 2014 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Rip Empson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2014/01/what-is-opensesame-going-to-do-with-8m.html | title=OpenSesame's $8M will fuel employee growth in Portland | publisher=Portland Business Journal | date=12 January 2014 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Malia Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marketplace allows the seller to set the price of the content, with a share in the profits for distributing through OpenSesame’s marketplace. On July 22, 2014 OpenSesame was granted US Patent Number US 8784113 B2 for their “Open and Interactive e-Learning System and Method.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US8784113]{{Citation|title=Open and interactive e-learning system and method|date=Jul 22, 2014|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US8784113|inventor-last=Bridges|inventor2-last=Day|inventor3-last=Blank|inventor-first=Aaron H.|inventor2-first=Jason S.|inventor3-first=Joshua D.|issue=US8784113 B2|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://siliconflorist.com/2013/05/02/oregon-technology-awards-names-cloudability-startup-year/ | title=Oregon Technology Awards names Cloudability "Startup of the Year" | publisher=Silicon Florist | date=2 May 2013 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Rick Turoczy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Since 2011, the OpenSesame development team has been focusing on the content and the development of features in line with the businesses' needs. The main concern of the company is not to build up a large number of new features on its marketplace, but to concentrate upon a few elaborated tools that can integrate with the various LMS’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=24867918 | title=Company Overview of OpenSesame Inc. | publisher=Bloomberg L.P. | accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bentley.edu/impact/articles/companies-where-millennials-thrive-opensesame | title=Companies Where Millennials Thrive: OpenSesame | publisher=Bentley University | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Melissa Massello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
OpenSesame is used in continuing professional development for employees and professionals via courses obtained online. Its platform allows companies to buy courses created by industry experts instead of having to create their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2013/02/portlands_tech_renaissance_is.html | title=Portland's tech renaissance is great for software developers, not so for those looking to hire | publisher=Oregon Live | date=14 February  2013 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Mike Rogoway}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows businesses to search for courses offered by its sellers, they can preview the content, read reviews and know about the content seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-news-wire/PRNews_20160310SF43481/opensesame-announces-training-jam-in-portland-oregon-april-2224.html | title=OpenSesame announces Training Jam in Portland, Oregon April 22–24 | publisher=Morning Star | date=10 March 2016 | accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2014/10/why-opensesame-takes-a-chance-on-inexperience.html | title=Why this startup takes a chance on inexperience | publisher=Portland Business Journal | date=30 October 2014 | accessdate=24 April 2016 | author=Malia Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://trainingmag.com/trgmag-article/online-vs-class-success | title=ONLINE VS.

In [[academic publishing]], a '''postprint''' is a digital draft of a [[academic journal|research journal]] article after it has been [[peer review]]ed. A  digital draft before peer review is called a [[preprint]]. Jointly, postprints and preprints are called [[eprint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, Stevan]] (2003). [http://cogprints.org/3019/ "Electronic preprints and postprints"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Expressed in the [[CrossRef]] terminology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/glossary.html CrossRef glossary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830003949/http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/glossary.html |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; any draft starting from the ''author's original version'' but prior to the ''accepted version'' is a preprint, whereas any draft from the ''accepted version'' onward, including the ''version of record'' or ''definitive work'', is a postprint.

Since the advent of the [[Open Archives Initiative]], preprints and postprints have been deposited in [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]], which are interoperable because they are compliant with the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]].

Eprints are at the heart of the [[open access]] initiative to make research freely accessible online. Eprints were first deposited or [[self-archiving|self-archived]] in arbitrary websites and then harvested by virtual [[archive]]s such as [[CiteSeer]] (and, more recently, [[Google Scholar]]), or they were deposited in central disciplinary archives such as [[Arxiv]] or [[PubMed Central]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">: ''Rapira is also a name for the [[T-12 antitank gun]].''

'''Rapira''' ({{lang-ru|Рапира}}, rapier) is an educational [[procedural programming]] language developed in the [[Soviet Union]] and implemented on [[Agat computer]], [[PDP-11]] clones (Electronika, DVK, BK series) and Intel-8080/Z80 clones (Korvet).  It was an interpreted language with dynamic type system and high level constructions.  The language originally had a [[Russian language|Russian]]-based set of keywords, but [[English language|English]] and [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] were added later.  Also, it was more elegant and easier to use than existing Pascal implementations of the time{{According to whom|date=October 2015}}.

Rapira was used in teaching [[computer programming]] in Soviet schools.  The programming environment included a text editor and an integrated debugger.

Sample program:
 ПРОЦ СТАРТ()
     ВЫВОД: 'Привет, мир!!!'
 КОН ПРОЦ

The same, but using the English lexics [sic, from the article referenced below]:
 proc start()
      output: 'Hello, world!!!';
 end proc

Rapira's ideology was based on such languages as [[POP-2]] and [[SETL]], with strong influences from [[ALGOL]].

Consequently, for example, Rapira implements a very strong, flexible and interesting data structure, so-named 'tuples'. Actually, tuples in Rapira are heterogeneous lists with such allowed operations as indexing, joining, length count, getting of sublist, easy comparison, etc.

'''Ruth Arnon''' ([[Hebrew]]: רות ארנון) is an [[Israel]]i [[biochemist]] and codeveloper of the [[multiple sclerosis]] drug [[Copaxone]]. She is currently the Paul Ehrlich Professor of Immunology at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], where she is researching anti-cancer and influenza vaccinations.

==Early life==
Arnon's father, Alexander Rosenberg&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shalvi A. 2009. Ruth Arnon [Internet]. Jewish Women's Archive; [cited 13 Apr 2015]. Available from http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/arnon-ruth&lt;/ref&gt; was interested in science from a young age.  After serving in the Jewish Legion during [[World War I]], Rosenberg attended [[Technische Hochschule]] in Vienna.  He realized his own interest in electricity in 1929 and moved with his wife and two children to Toulouse to complete studies in electrical engineering as well as earn a master's in mathematics.  Rosenberg then returned to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and worked for the Electrical Corporation until the mid 1960s.  Ruth Arnon attributes her own love for science to her relationship with her father.

Ruth Rosenberg was born in [[Tel Aviv]], June 1, 1933.  Because her older siblings had already taught Ruth basic reading and arithmetic, she started school in the second grade.  When she finished elementary school, her mother realized her potential and convinced Barukh Ben-Yehuda (1894-1990) to allow her to  attend high school at [[the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]].  Along with many in the youth movement, Ruth wished to join the military.  Being too young, she studied chemistry at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and joined the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] special academic study program allowing her to study and spend summers doing military training. Arnon earned her master's degree in 1955, and served for two years as an officer in the IDF. During her time in the military, she married Uriel Arnon, an engineer at the Technion in Haifa.  Ruth and Uriel Arnon had two children: Michal (b. 1957) and Yoram (b. 1961)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Career as a Scientist==
===Overview===

Ruth Arnon joined the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in 1960.  She has focused most of her life on the field of immunology.  While at Weizmann, Arnon served as the Head of the Department of Chemical Immunology, as the Dean of the Faculty of Biology and as Vice President of the Institute. &lt;ref&gt;Prof. Ruth Arnon. 2010. [Internet.] The InterAcademic Partnership. [cited 13 Apr 2015]. Available from: 2015. http://www.interacademies.net/Activities/10880/BAS2013/2013ConferenceAgenda/20211/20755.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Professor Arnon served as the Director of the Institute's MacArthur Center for Molecular Biology of Tropical Diseases from 1958-94.  Much of Arnon's work has been in the development of vaccinations and cancer research.  One of her largest contributions to science was working alongside Professor Michael Sela to develop a drug for multiple sclerosis called [[Copaxone]].

Ruth Arnon served as the Chairperson of the Sciences division of the Israel Academy of Sciences from 1995 to 2001.  She later was elected as President of the Israel Academy. She is also a member of the EMBO, the [[European Molecular Biology Organization]].  Arnon served as Secretary-General of the International Union of Immunological Sciences, the President of the European Federation of Immunological Societies, and is also a member of the European Union Research Advisory Board.

Prof. Arnon has been involved in the publishing of more than four hundred articles and books in biochemistry and immunology, and has been the recipient of many prestigious awards throughout her career, most of which are listed in the Awards and Honors section below.

===Copaxone===

Prof. Arnon and Prof. Sela developed a new drug application for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] called Copolymer 1.  Its chemical name is glatiramer acetate.  It was submitted by the TEVA Pharmaceutical Company to the FDA for approval, under the name of [[Copaxone]], on June 14, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=8793553|year=1996|author1=Arnon|first1=R|title=The development of Cop 1 (Copaxone), an innovative drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis: Personal reflections|journal=Immunology Letters|volume=50|issue=1–2|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since multiple sclerosis is an immunological disease, Cop 1 is an immunospecific drug, which is no surprise, as Arnon has focused the majority of her work in the field of immunology.  It specifically aids neuroprotection and generation as well as prevents the demyelination of axons, a hallmark of diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  In fact, studies by Arnon et al. have shown an increase in [[myelination]] as a result of Cop 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2014.08.573|title=Enhanced myelination in autoimmunity and in normal development induced by immunomodulatory treatment|journal=Journal of Neuroimmunology|volume=275|pages=213–214|year=2014|last1=Aharoni|first1=Rina|last2=Eilam|first2=Raya|last3=From|first3=Renana|last4=Bar Lev|first4=Dekel D.|last5=Sela|first5=Michael|last6=Arnon|first6=Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2004 article, Arnon and Aharoni state that glatiramer acetate is "highly effective in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in various species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=521994 | pmid=15371592 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0404887101 | volume=101 Suppl 2 | title=Mechanism of action of glatiramer acetate in multiple sclerosis and its potential for the development of new applications | year=2004 | journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| pages=14593–8 | last1 = Arnon | first1 = R | last2 = Aharoni | first2 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current Research===

Prof. Arnon is currently performing research on a universal, recombinant influenza vaccination, as well as cancer vaccine research.  In a 2009 paper, Arnon speaks of research using [[virus-like particle]]s (VLP) to induce an immune response.&lt;ref&gt;={{Cite journal|pmid=19492960|year=2009|author1=Arnon|first1=R|title=Preclinical efficacy of a virus-like particle-based vaccine against avian influenza H5N1|journal=Future Microbiology|volume=4|issue=5|pages=503–5|last2=Ben-Yedidia|first2=T|doi=10.2217/fmb.09.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; These particles cannot replicate, but possess the specific antigen presenting proteins that immune cells use to identify viruses.  Therefore, a vaccine could introduce VLPs to an individuals immune system and bring about the production of memory cells.  Arnon and Ben-Yedidia hypothesize that these vaccines would be effective against [[H5N1]], a pandemic virus more commonly known as bird flu.  They have tested the various synthetic vaccinations on mice and observed a significant immune response.  In addition, they have put human lymphocytes in mice and also observed an immune response.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Ruth Arnon.  Weizmann Institute of Science: Department of Immunology [Internet]. [cited 15 Apr 2015]; Available from: http://www.weizmann.ac.il/immunology/sci/ArnonPage.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research formed the basis of the company [[BiondVax]], who have taken the universal flu vaccine into human clinical trials.

In 2017 Prof. Arnon was appointed co-chair of the UK-Israel Science Council, alongside [[Robert Winston|Prof. Lord Robert Winston]]. She has been a founding member of the council since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org.il/en/Science-Council|title=UK-Israel Science Council {{!}} British Council|website=www.britishcouncil.org.il|language=en|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Feigin''' (1 July 1928 - 24 April 2011) was a Latvian music educator and composer who lived and worked in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feigin|url=http://furore-verlag.de/womencomposers/overview_a-z/f/|publisher=furore-verlag|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was born in [[Latvia]], and studied piano and composition at the ''[[Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music]]'' originally known as the '''Riga Conservatory of Music'''. She graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees. She moved to Israel in 1972 and founded a Conservatory of Music in [[Holon]] in 1973, working as its director until 1983. Feigin worked for "Jeunesses Musicales d'Israel"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeunesses Musicales International]]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1973 to 1990, organizing concerts for youth. Her music has been performed internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Piano Music by Women Composers: Women born after 1900|author=Dees, Pamela Youngdahl|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&amp;pg=PA166 |title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first=Julie Anne|last=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|accessdate=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical Achievements==
Sarah would teach children as well as teach at music education institutions when she lived in Israel. Her preferred instruments are '''organ''' and '''piano''' when composing music. Her work has been published by the [[Israel Music Institute]], and her pieces have been on the Israeli radio on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Feigin&gt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/2020055?q=sarah+feigin&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sarah Feigin composed pieces such as, chamber music, music for piano, educational pieces, songs for ballets, and vocal music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women Opera Composers: Biographies from the 1500s to the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqDPDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=sarah+feigin+composer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vx5xH3xceO&amp;sig=JVmU_h-ULOsNnEZk-oA_uama11g&amp;hl=en&amp;esa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit9Zew4svXAhVY3WMKHXw3DX04ChDoAQguMAo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Sarah received an award for her work "''Thoughts On Playing''" at the '''International Composition Competition''' in Miami, Florida.

----
She has written songs for the piano that involve four hands and up to six hands at once. 
Some pieces include,&lt;ref name=Composition&gt;{{cite web|title= Compositions|url=http://www.israelcomposers.org/composer.html?id=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
On October 9, 2012 an album called ''Clarinet Repertoire Of Women Composers'' was released, and the '''last''' song is the Fantasia for Clarinet and Piano by Sarah Feigin -- ''Written in 1996, in Israel.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarinet Repertoire Of Women Composers |url=http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Sarah-Feigin/Composer/109953-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Sarah's ''birth name'' was &lt;u&gt; Sarah Kugel &lt;/u&gt;, which changed when she married ''Oscar Feigin'' who was a professor of [[polymer chemistry]]. Sarah gave birth to Ilana and Carmela, then she left Latvia in 1972, to help her family emigrate to Israel. This gave her a new sense of creativity, which led to some of her compositions to have certain elements of [[Israeli folk music]]. 
She passed away in Holon, Israel on April 24, 2011 of a serious illness.&lt;ref name="Feigin"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1627">'''Science Colleges''' were introduced in 2000 as part of the now defunct [[Specialist school|Specialist Schools Programme]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system enabled [[Secondary education#England, Wales and Northern Ireland|secondary schools]] to specialise in certain fields, in this case, [[science]] and [[mathematics]]. Schools that successfully applied to the [[Specialist Schools Trust]] and became Science Colleges received extra funding from this joint private sector and government scheme. Science Colleges also acted as a local point of reference for other schools and businesses in the area, with an emphasis on promoting science within the community.

The funding received by such Colleges was dependent on the number of pupils currently attending and was on average approximately £1,600. The funding was often used by schools to upgrade their facilities to a standard befitting a "Specialist" institution. A proportion of the money was used to spread the skills of the school into the local community, often involving outreach centres or adult education schemes.

It was in the late 1960s and early 1970s that the [[Philippines]] saw a surge in student activism. This could be chalked up to the onset of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] administration and its declaration of [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], which bore witness to tens of thousands of [[human rights]] violations, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco, Katerina. “Martial Law, the dark chapter in Philippine history.” Rappler, September 22, 2016. http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146939-martial-law-explainer-victims-stories&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, several factors and events in [[History of the Philippines|Philippine history]] that contributed to the increase in [[student activism]] during this period.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;“A History of the Philippine Political Protest,” Official Gazette. Accessed November 5, 2016. http://www.gov.ph/edsa/the-ph-protest/&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Economy|economic]] decline, increase in [[unemployment]] rates, the growth of intra-elite conflicts, and internal dissension and disruption all factored into the context of student activism in the Philippines. It was around this time that businesses in Manila tried to find opportunities to withdraw when the city started to be deemed unsafe. Five Communist oriented [[guerrillas]] in the countryside had also regained some of the momentum similar to the [[Hukbalahap|Huks]] had before they were contained by [[Ramon Magsaysay|Magsaysay]] in the 1950s. The coming of a revolution was considered a possibility waiting to happen at one point as riots and demonstrations erupted, causing colleges to be closed down. All of these culminated in an effort to storm the [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Chester|year=1980|title=Philippines Values and Martial Law|jstor=20070329|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume= 11|pages= 110–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The mobilization of the studentry ==
The mobilization of students during this period trained a huge number of activists who later joined the underground opposition, the [[New People's Army|New People’s Army]], after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. This imposition caused [[Democracy|democratic]] institutions that permitted these mobilizations to be closed down, forcing activists to turn to [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]]. It was, however, introducing [[social reform]] as the focus of the [[ideology]] that drove the mobilization of Filipino students during the first phase. These moderates were organized and represented through the National Union of the Students of the Philippines (NUSP), a dominant force in the student movements during the late 1960s. In 1970, moderates initially led the student movements but due to the dynamics of the political conflicts, radicals soon gained the upper hand in these movements. The expansion of higher education and the atmosphere present in the country at that time gave way for Filipino students to become increasingly critical and collectively engaged.&lt;ref name=":("&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parsa|first1=Misagh|title=States, Ideologies, and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis Of Iran, Nicaragua, and The Philippines|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=41_EXD1hWlgC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=student%20movement%20martial%20law%20philippines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sFmnZSHjeW&amp;sig=HPK-BPVLa5Pff_8OZ2ulqaGPgKo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=student%20movement%20martial%20law%20philippines&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that students were at the forefront of several movements and even became the most active and participative group in the scene of politics. In the years 1970 and 1971 alone, student activists participated in 214 demonstrations and 39 class boycotts, and as reported in [[The Manila Times]], issued 72 statements. They joined forces and established coalitions with reformists and radical factions of working classes and even participated in 76 demonstrations alongside farmers and workers.&lt;ref name=":(" /&gt;

== [[Communist Party of the Philippines|The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)]]/Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) ==
The CPP/PKP was one party that played an important role in mobilizing student movements in the country. While the CPP/PKP leadership initially dismissed them as "unneeded," there were small underground cells in some schools that played support roles to the more important and bigger Party cells in the factories and among the peasantry.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Abinales, Patricio. “The Left and the Philippine Student Movement: Random Historical Notes on Party Politics and Sectoral Struggles.” Kasarinlan 1, no. 2 (1985): 41 - 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political value of students was recognized more by the Americans who realized that students were adept as publicity (propaganda) and pressure groups for government reforms and against the PKP-led Huk rebellion of the '50s. The Party only began recognizing their importance in the '60s when self-taught [[Marxism|Marxists]] spearheaded an anti-clerical and nationalist campaign at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman|University of the Philippines]]. Radicals who were brought into the Party's fold formed [[Kabataang Makabayan]] (KM) in 1964.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Shortly thereafter, however, this youth faction was expelled from the party. Led by [[Jose Maria Sison]], they “re-established” the CPP/PKP, calling it the Communist Party of the Philippines—Marxist–Leninist (CPP-ML), setting themselves apart from the original, lesser-known party solely known today as the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930|Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 (PKP-1930)]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

What became the CPP-ML’s most immediate concern was cadre recruitment and training; being a party composed of practically urban intellectuals and students who lacked revolutionary experience but made up for it with their idealism, among others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Some notable events leading up to the declaration of martial law ==

=== [[First Quarter Storm|The First Quarter Storm]] ===
The nationwide student demonstration that took place on January 26, 1970 proved how militant student organizations had achieved a high level of organization and commitment from its followers. The violent demonstrations that would extend to March of that same year would become known as the First Quarter Storm.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== The Battle of [[Mendiola Street|Mendiola]] ===
On January 30, 1970, some 10,000 chanting students and laborers marched across Mendiola Bridge in an attempt to storm the Malacañang. Upon their arrival at the gates of the palace, they commandeered a fire truck and rammed it through the main gate. Despite their efforts to penetrate the palace, the Metropolitan Command (METROCOM) of the Philippine Constabulary repulsed them towards Mendiola Bridge.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Primitivo Mijares, in ''The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos'', recounts that what followed was the so-called "Battle of Mendiola" that pitted young boys and girls, armed with bamboo sticks and stones, facing Armalite-wielding 'shock troops' of Marcos from the Presidential Guard Battalion. "It was a massacre," he adds.&lt;ref name=":(" /&gt;

=== [[Diliman commune|The Diliman Commune]] ===
The Diliman Commune was a nine-day uprising at the University of the Philippines-Diliman from February 1 to February 9, 1971. It started out as a peaceful rally in which students voiced their support for the ongoing strike against the oil price hike and escalated into an uprising in which students, supported by the school administration, protested against military incursions into the University.&lt;ref&gt;Taguiwalo, Judy M. “Notes on the 1971 Diliman Commune.” Diliman Diary (blog). February 24, 2011. http://diliman-diary.blogspot.com/2011/02/notes-on-1971-diliman-commune.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Plaza Miranda bombing|The Plaza Miranda Bombing]] ===
On August 21, 1971, four grenades were hurled at the stage of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]'s grand miting de avance at [[Plaza Miranda]] in [[Quiapo, Manila]], killing nine and wounding 95 others. A great number of the Party's leaders and senatorial candidates were seriously injured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tiglao, Rigoberto D. “Days of Shame: August 21, 1971 and 1983.” The Manila Times. August 20, 2013. Accessed November 26, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.manilatimes.net/days-of-shame-august-21-1971-and-1983/31664/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This caused a great wave of public outrage and sparked disgust towards a system that seemed to tolerate senseless acts of violence. This prompted Marcos to suspend the writ of habeas corpus a month later. It was restored on January 1972, with talks of an imminent revolution already rife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties (MCCCL) Rallies ===
The military used the suspension of the write of habeas corpus to their advantage to arrest well-known activists such as Luzvimindo David of KM and Gary Olivar of the Movement for a Democratic Philippines (MDP) and swoop down on headquarters of several mass movements.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The people responded by vigorously opposing the threat of a fascist rule. Led by [[Jose W. Diokno]], an enormous alliance of civil libertarians, progressive Constitutional Convention delegates, students, professionals, workers came together to form the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties (MCCCL).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Their three basic demands were as follows: a) lifting the writ of habeas corpus; b) release of political prisoners; and c) resistance of plan by Marcos government to declare martial law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The alliance proved to be successful as they managed to forge unity among diverse groups such as those from the 'Nat-Dem' and 'Soc-Dem' groups as well as various civic organizations on the bases of these demands. In rally after rally attended by as many as 50,000 people, the MCCCL warned of the imminence of martial law even as ''the writ of habeas corpus'' was eventually restored. It held the biggest demonstration on September 21, 1972...”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The declaration of martial law in 1972 ==
On September 27, 1972, Marcos declared Martial Law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Gregg Jones]], an American author, writes, "Martial law left the once-formidable legal protest movement in disarray, its leaders in hiding or in prison, its activists driven into the underground or cowering in fear." This is not to say that political protest vanished entirely, however; as he elaborates, "In the late 1970s, against the backdrop of a weakening economy, communist efforts to rebuild an urban protest movement were beginning to bear fruit."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Student activism in universities ==

=== University of the Philippines-Diliman (UPD) ===
As far back as the 1950s, the University of the Philippines has been the breeding ground of many intellectuals and radical activists.&lt;ref&gt;Valte, Maricris. “The Philippine Student Movement: Prospects for a Dynamic Student Politics.” Kasarinlan 1, no.3 (1987): 49 - 62.&lt;/ref&gt; It comes as no surprise, then, that in the 1960s and 1970s, the university played an active role in conducting demonstrations, marches, and rallies to raise awareness of sectoral struggles and to campaign against the Marcos dictatorship and land reform policy, among others. Some of the clear examples of the school's activism include the ratifying of the Diliman Declaration on March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fqslibrary.wordpress.com/2010/02/19/left-to-right-the-student-activists/|title=Left to Right: The Student Activists.|last=Liu|first=Nancy|date=February 19, 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student activists from the university stirred up the masses of youth and the working class to conduct protest actions, from the March 1961 demonstration of 5,000 UP student demonstrators that scuttled the anti-communist witch hunt of the Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities (CAFA) to the 1970 [[First Quarter Storm]] that rocked the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] with almost weekly marches and rallies of 50,000 to 100,000 people campaigning against the administration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philippines Under Martial Law|last=Lopez|first=Salvador|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|year=1974|isbn=|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sison, Jose Maria. “The Incubation of Activism in the University of the Philippines.” Jose Maria Sison (blog). June 26, 2010. http://josemariasison.org/the-incubation-of-activism-in-the-university-of-the-philippines/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Diliman Commune ====
[[File:UP Activists during Martial Law.png|thumb|Students from the University of the Philippines come together to protect the autonomy of the university from militarization under the Marcos Regime|263x263px]]

In 1971, students who formed the "Diliman Commune," supported by faculty members and non-academic personnel, occupied the Diliman campus and barricaded roads to protest deteriorating conditions in the country during the administration.&lt;ref&gt;The Philippine Daily Inquirer. “Did you know: Diliman Commune.” Inquirer.Net. February 10, 2014. Accessed November 26, 2016. http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/576040/did-you-know-diliman-commune&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Museum and Library. “The Diliman Commune.” The Official Tumblr Page of the Presidential Museum and Library.

[[Salvador P. Lopez]], then president, urged his students, faculty, and employees to maintain the [[autonomy]] of the university as the military sought control of the campus in order to identify suspected leftists, activists, and critiques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ateneo de Manila University (AdMU) ===
Several activists from the Ateneo de Manila University (AdMU), most notably Edgardo Gil "Edjop" Jopson, founder of the single biggest student union at the time, [[National Union of Students in the Philippines (NUSP)|National Union of Students in the Philippines]] (NUSP) and Ferdidand "Ferdie" Arceo, founder of Ligang Demokratiko ng Ateneo (LDA), played vital roles in campaigning to overthrow the dictatorship. Among the other well-known activists from the university are Lazaro "Lazzie" Silva, Jr. and William "Bill" Begg, active members of Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan sa Loyola (SDK-L) and Kabataang Makabayan-Ateneo (KM), respectively, and Artemio "Jun" Celestial, Jr., a member of the Student Catholic Action and the secretary-general of the student government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living And Dying In Memory Of 11 Ateneo De Manila Martial Law Activists|last=Montiel|first=Cristina Jayme|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Quezon City|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cabato, Regine D. &amp; Sayson, Frances P. “Braving the storm.” The Guidon.

==== Founding of Ligang Demokratiko ng Ateneo (LDA) ====
Ferdie, together with like-minded students in AdMU, established LDA in 1970, the first radical activist organization in Ateneo. Members conducted discussion groups, recruited students, advised student leaders, and created a space for dialogue among members of the student body. Eventually, LDA split into two separate organizations, SDK-L and KM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== The National Union of Students (NUSP) Iloilo Conference ====
During the NUSP's 13th annual conference in 1969, Edjop was elected as president. When delegates returned to Manila, they led a huge rally in front of congress; all while President Marcos was delivering his State of the Nation Address (SONA).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Under Edjop's two-term tenure, the National Union became participative in socio-political issues amidst the First Quarter Storm that brought forth the Second Propaganda Movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The National Union of Students of the Philippines. “NUSP: Edgar Jopson, Martyr of the People.” NUSP.Org (blog). September 21, 2012. http://nusp.org/edjop-curriculum/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De La Salle University (DLSU) === 
At the [[De La Salle University]], then De La Salle College, student activists clashed with the school administration over matters involving the Brother Becker Case, NROTC, tuition fees, and student rights and academic freedom. The activists questioned the elitist orientation of the institution and campaigned for a more nationalistic education.&lt;ref name=":)"&gt;Jimenez, Jose Victor D. “The First Sparks of Student Activism at De La Salle College, 1968 - 1972.” Presentation at the De La Salle University Research Congress 2014, Manila, Philippines, March 6–8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Filipinization of Education ====
The prevalence of the affluent was one of the issues that was brought up in the 1960s; it was a question of whether the "wide-cross section of the public" could be "represented." Questioning why a Philippine institution had an administrator who was American, textbooks that were written by foreigners, and instruction that was done in English, student activists urged the administration to adopt a "more [[Nationalism|nationalistic]]" stance. Included in this was their call for the "Filipinization of education" by ousting non-Filipino presidents of schools, colleges, and universities, and appointing qualified Filipinos to head the institutions in their place.&lt;ref name=":)" /&gt;

==== The Brother Becker Case ====
On Friday afternoon of December 6, 1968, more than 600 students held a four-hour demonstration to show their support for Brother Edward Becker FSC who was dismissed by the College. They circulated leaflets which divulged the imputations hurled against Becker.&lt;ref name=":)" /&gt;

This case provided the students the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding academic freedom as well as student rights. Arthur Aguilar, Student Council chairman, eventually managed to steer the dialogue away from the Becker case, in a meeting with Brother H. Gabriel Connon FSC and Dr. Waldo Perfecto, academic vice-president, on December 8, 1968 during the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. He declared that the "issue was only incidental and the Becker case was merely a catalyst, the 'final straw' so to speak which ignited student protest over school policies."&lt;ref name=":)" /&gt;

==== Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) ==== 
On July 17, 1971, some 600 cadets refused to attend an [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps (Philippines)|NROTC]] drill, with their refusal stemming from their dissatisfaction with the present NROTC system as well as their protest against the hazing of [[Shore patrol|Shore Patrol]] trainees by probationary officers. The Student Council backed this boycott in a resolution.&lt;ref name=":)" /&gt;

'''SuperMemo''' (from "Super Memory") is a [[learning]] method and [[software]] package developed by SuperMemo World and SuperMemo R&amp;D with [[Piotr Woźniak (researcher)|Piotr Woźniak]] in [[Poland]] from 1985 to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on research into [[long-term memory]], and is a practical application of the [[spaced repetition]] learning method that has been proposed for efficient instruction by a number of psychologists as early as in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the developers of SuperMemo and some other proponents of [[spaced repetition]] learning, the process can optimize long-term knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Woźniak: [http://www.supermemo.com/articles/theory.htm Theoretical aspects of spaced repetition in learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software implementation==

The SuperMemo program stores a database of questions and answers constructed by the user. When reviewing information saved in the database, the program uses the SuperMemo algorithm to decide what questions to show the user. The user then answers the question and rates their recall - did they answer the question easily, with hesitation, not at all, and so on - and their rating is used to calculate how soon they should be shown the question again. While the exact algorithm varies with the version of SuperMemo, in general, items that are harder to remember show up more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2008/04/ff-wozniak/&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides simple text questions and answers, the latest version of SuperMemo supports images, video, and HTML questions and answers.&lt;ref&gt;http://super-memory.com/help/new.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algorithms ==
The specific algorithms SuperMemo uses have been published, and re-implemented in other programs.

Different algorithms have been used; SM–0 refers to the original (non-computer-based) algorithm, while SM-2 refers to the original computer-based algorithm released in the 1987 (used in SuperMemo versions 1.0 through 3.0, referred to as SM-2 because SuperMemo version 2 was the most popular of these).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/beginning.htm 3. Account of research leading to the SuperMemo method, 3.1. The approximate function of optimal intervals] and [http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm 3.2. Application of a computer to improve the results obtained in working with the SuperMemo method], [[Piotr Woźniak (researcher)|P. A. Woźniak]], ''Optimization of learning,'' Master's Thesis, University of Technology in Poznan, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent versions of the software have further optimized the algorithm.

As of June 2016, the latest version of the SuperMemo algorithm is SM-17, released in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo_Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of SM3+ ===
The SM-2 algorithm uses the performance on a card to schedule only that card, while SM-3 and newer algorithms use card performance to schedule that card and similar cards. The additional optimizations sometimes yield perverse results – answering "hard" on a card may yield an interval longer than answering "easy" on a card – and are criticized as reducing the robustness of the algorithm, making it more sensitive to variations – non-uniform difficulty of cards (a problem in versions 4 to 6, according to Woźniak), inconsistencies in studying, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#_what_spaced_repetition_algorithm_does_anki_use What spaced repetition algorithm does Anki use?], "If you are very consistent in your studies and all cards are of a very similar difficulty, this approach can work quite well. However, once inconsistencies are introduced into the equation (cards of varying difficulty, not studying at the same time every day), SM3+ is more prone to incorrect guesses at the next interval – resulting in cards being scheduled too often or too far in the future.

"Furthermore, as SM3+ dynamically adjusts the "optimum factors" table, a situation can often arise where answering "hard" on a card can result in a longer interval than answering "easy" would give. The next times are hidden from you in SuperMemo so the user is never aware of this."&lt;/ref&gt;

Woźniak disagreed with the criticism, but noted that in practice the other factors affecting study make it not very important.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supermemo.com/help/smalg.htm#New_SuperMemo_algorithms_are_superior.2C_but_this_should_not_determine_your_choice_of_your_learning_program&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-SuperMemo implementations ===
Some of the algorithms have been reimplemented in other, often [[free software|free]] programs such as [[Anki (software)|Anki]], [[Mnemosyne (software)|Mnemosyne]], and [[Org-mode|Emacs Org-mode]]'s Org-drill. See full [[list of flashcard software]].
 
&lt;!-- Please don't link to anything which doesn't have a WP article. These are just the most notable clones; this isn't meant to be a comprehensive link-dump paragraph. --&gt;
The SM-2 algorithm has proven most popular in other applications, and is used (in modified form) in Anki and Mnemosyne, among others. Org-drill implements SM-5 by default, and optionally other algorithms such as SM-2.

'''Tallinn University''' ('''TU'''; {{lang-et|Tallinna Ülikool}}, ''TLÜ'') is a public research university in [[Estonia]]. Located in the centre of [[Tallinn]], the capital city of Estonia, Tallinn University is one of the three largest institutions of higher education in the country. In the 2019 edition of QS World University rankings, it has been ranked among the top 1000 universities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tallinn University Profile |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/tallinn-university |website=QS University Rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tallinn University's predecessor, Tallinn Teachers' Seminar, was founded in 1919. Tallinn University in its present form was established on 18 March 2005 as the result of a merger of several universities and research institutions in Tallinn:  Academic Library of Estonia (1946), Baltic Film and Media School (1992/97), Estonian Institute of Humanities (1988), Institute of History (1946) and Tallinn Pedagogical University (1919/52/92). In 2015, Tallinn University underwent a structural reform, whereby its 20+ structural units (the legacy of the numerous mergers leading to its establishment) were reorganized into six schools in order to optimize funding and eliminate overlap between units in research and teaching.

==Academics==
{{Infobox world university ranking

}}

Tallinn University's main campus buildings have Latin names.

Terra (Latin: earth) is the main and oldest building on Tallinn University's campus. It was built for the Tallinn English College in 1938. The building is under heritage protection (architects Alar Kotli and Erika Nõva).&lt;ref name="tlu.ee1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlu.ee/en/university/campus|title=Campus|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nova (Latin: new) houses the Baltic Film and Media School. Features include individual and group work rooms, lecture halls, a film studio, a television studio, sound studios, a cinema, a computer class and editing rooms. The building was completed in 2012, and was designed by architects Karli Luik, Maarja Kask and Ralf Lõoke.&lt;ref name="tlu.ee1"/&gt;

Mare (Latin: sea) was designed to optimise the amount of light penetrating into the building. The building was completed in 2006; the architects were Mattias Agabus, Eero Endjärv, Raul Järg, Priit Pent and Illimar Truverk.&lt;ref name="tlu.ee1"/&gt;

Astra (Latin: star) is the newest building in the university. This building is features laboratories. The building was designed by Ignar Fjuk and completed in 2012.

Silva (Latin: forest) was completed in 1982 and is a typical example of Soviet architecture. Designed by the architect Ester Liiberg.

Ursa (Latin: bear) was built in 1964 and presently houses the Arts Department.

==Internationalisation==
Internationalisation is positioned as one of Tallinn University's goals, affecting its development strategies and priorities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tlu.ee/en/university/About-Us|title=About Us / Tallinn University|website=www.tlu.ee|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university offers a range of English-language academic programmes at all levels of study, as well as short courses aimed at international students. As of 2016, Tallinn University ranked third in the Baltic states by the percentage of international students, behind [[Tallinn University of Technology]] and slightly ahead of the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With international faculty comprising 11.1% of the total faculty&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, it was also ranked among the top 15 institutions in the Emerging Europe and Central Asia by the percentage of international faculty&lt;ref name=":EECA18" /&gt;.

Tallinn University currently maintains over 40 inter-university agreements with universities in Europe, U.S., Japan, China, Russia, and several other countries as well over 400 Erasmus exchange agreements with universities from all over the European Union&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">The '''teach-back method''', also called the '''"show-me" method''', is a communication confirmation method used by healthcare providers to confirm whether a patient (or care takers) understands what is being explained to them. If a patient understands, they are able to "teach-back" the information accurately. This is a communication method intended to improve [[health literacy]].

There can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is.&lt;ref name="In Focus"&gt;Teach Back: A tool for improving provider-patient communication. The Ethics Center. 2006. Retrieved from http://www.ethics.va.gov/docs/infocus/InFocus_20060401_Teach_Back.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can be due to various reasons such as a patient not understanding medical terminology, not feeling comfortable asking questions or even cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Not only does the teach-back method help providers understand the patient's needs in understanding their care, it also allows providers to evaluate their communication skills.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Case studies led by the [[National Quality Forum]] on the informed consent processes of various hospitals found that those that effectively used the teach-back method benefited in areas of quality, patient safety, risk management and cost/efficiency.&lt;ref name="NQF"&gt;Implementing a National Voluntary Consensus Standard for Informed Consent: A User's Guide for Healthcare Professionals. National Quality Forum. 2005. Retrieved from http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2005/09/Implementing_a_National_Voluntary_Consensus_Standard_for_Informed_Consent__A_User’s_Guide_for_Healthcare_Professionals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==
The [[National Quality Forum]] describes the practice as follows:&lt;ref name="NQF"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Who''' should use the method→ Any healthcare providers. E.g. physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals&lt;br /&gt;
'''What''' should patients teach-back→Information about their diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, risks and benefit of treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
'''When''' to ask for teach-back→ Early in the care process&lt;br /&gt;
'''Why''' is it important→Many patients have difficulty understanding medical information.&lt;br /&gt;
'''How'''→When asked to teach-back, patients should be able to clearly describe or explain the information provided to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the patient's successful or unsuccessful teach-back, the provider will clarify or modify the information and reassess the teach-back to confirm the patient's comprehension and understanding.&lt;ref name="Heiges"&gt;The Teach Back Method. SurroundHealth. 2012. Retrieved from www.surroundhealth.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge retention ==
The cycle of reassessing and teaching back to confirm comprehension has been found to improve knowledge retention and lower readmission rates in heart failure patients.&lt;ref name="White, Garbez, Carroll, Brinker &amp; Howie-Esquivel"&gt;Is "teach back" associated with knowledge retention and [[Hospital Readmission|hospital readmission]] in hospitalized heart failure patients? The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. 2013 Mar-Apr;28(2):137-46. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0b013e31824987bd&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond healthcare literacy, the teach-back method can be utilized in academic and professional settings as well. Teachers often create [[feedback loops]]  in which the instructor asks the student to share what they heard, and promote peer to peer coaching  where students explain what they just learned to other students. Retention is also most positively impacted in [[participatory learning]] environments, when students participate in group discussions, practice by doing, and teaching others.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Teaching Methods and Retention. 2002. Retrieved from http://www.simulations.co.uk/pyramid.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6340">'''Technology Shabbat''' or '''[[Technology Shabbat|Tech Shabbat]]''' are terms for a rest or cessation from the use of all technology with screens, ie smartphones, computers, tablets and television. The term was first coined in 2010 by filmmaker and internet pioneer [[Tiffany Shlain]] and husband [[UC Berkeley]] robotics professor [[Ken Goldberg]]. Shlain introduced the concept in a series of articles and films such as the [[Harvard Business Review]]&lt;ref name="Harvard Business Review"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shlain|first1=Tiffany|title=Tech’s Best Feature: The Off Switch|url=https://hbr.org/2013/03/techs-best-feature-the-off-swi|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=Harvard Business Review|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after participating in The National Day of Unplugging, which began in 2008 by Reboot, a nonprofit think tank of Jewish professionals, based in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="NY Times 2" /&gt; The Technology Shabbat was inspired by the traditional Shabbat or Sabbath, a weekly day of rest in most popular religions.&lt;ref name="CBS News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ngak|first1=Chenda|title=In digital age, where do parents set boundaries?|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-digital-age-where-do-parents-set-boundaries/|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=CBS News|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|title=A tour of an unplugged SF home|url=https://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/A-tour-of-an-unplugged-SF-home-4199145.php|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Although not named as such, the concept of a Technology Shabbat evolved as early on as the creation of the internet, with more people participating since the advent of portable devices, according to Mark Glaser, editor of MediaShift on [[PBS]].org.&lt;ref name="Oregonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MediaShift"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glaser|first1=Mark|title=Poll: How Often Do You Take a Break from Technology?|url=http://mediashift.org/2012/06/poll-how-often-do-you-take-a-break-from-technology160/|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=MediaShift|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, [[Secretary of State]] [[George Shultz]] would take an hour each week in his office for quiet reflection with only a paper and pen.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonhardt|first1=David|title=You’re Too Busy. You Need a ‘Shultz Hour.’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/opinion/youre-too-busy-you-need-a-shultz-hour.html|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=NY Times|date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shlain first disconnected in 2008, when her father, [[Leonard Shlain]] was diagnosed with brain cancer. During his infrequent lucid moments, she'd turn off her cell phone.&lt;ref name="Times of Israel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Gabe|title=The ‘digital diva’ is on a quest for the makings of a mensch|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-digital-diva-is-on-a-quest-for-the-makings-of-a-mensch/|accessdate=8 February 2018|work=Times of Israel|date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt; Soon after, she and her husband [[Ken Goldberg]], as members of Reboots, participated in the first annual National Day of Unplugging, and contributed a poem to commemorate the day, which was turned into a film by Shlain called "Yelp: With Apologies to Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl'".&lt;ref name="Oregonian" /&gt; Around that time, their family began the ritual of Technology Shabbats. 


==Rituals== 
For a Technology Shabbat, all screens are turned off for 24 hours, and many of those who partake chose Friday night until Saturday night. Suggested alternatives to technology include activities like reading books, taking walks, visiting new neighborhoods, engaging in outdoor activities and using pen and paper.&lt;ref name="Oregonian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levy|first1=Shawn|title=A Tech Sabbath offers a chance to unplug, recharge|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/madaboutmovies/2012/05/a_tech_sabbath_offers_a_chance.html|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=Oregonian|date=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Internet is a vortex,”  Portland writer Tammy Strobel told the ''[[The Oregonian|Oregonian]]'' as the reason she and her husband turn off the computer on Sundays to observe Tech Sabbath. “I can get lost in it for hours. And time is something we can never get back.”&lt;ref name="Oregonian" /&gt;

Among the rabbis who advocate unplugging for the Jewish Sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset are New York City's Elliot J. Cosgrove of Park Avenue Synagogue.&lt;ref name="NY Times 2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Considine|first1=Austin|title=And on the Sabbath, the iPhones Shall Rest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/fashion/18sabbath.html|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=NY Times 2|date=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filmography ==

The concept of Technology Shabbat has been featured in several films made by Shlain. These include "[[Connected: An Autoblogography About Love, Death, &amp; Technology]]"&lt;ref name="Jewish News of N. California"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Israel|first1=Ira|title=In crazybusy era of always being in touch, are we losing touch|url=https://www.jweekly.com/2012/05/04/in-crazybusy-era-of-always-being-in-touch-are-we-losing-touch/|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=Jewish News of Northern California|date=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, "Yelp: With Apologies to Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl'" in 2011,

The '''Terra Santa College''' is the oldest school of Cyprus.

==History==
[[File:Collegio Terra Santa.jpg|thumb|Collegio di Terra Santa|thumb|right|280px|Terra Santa College - [[Nicosia]]]]
In 1646, the [[Custody of the Holy Land]], the order of the Franciscan monks that is situated in Jerusalem founded the Terra Santa College in Nicosia, Cyprus. Their main principles were Virtue, Diligence and Creativity.  Initially the college operated as a Primary School, while in 1913 it broadened its horizons with the creation of the Secondary School. In 1970 the operation of the Nursery School commenced, bringing our school to the current form which comprises Primary and Secondary education.  The main attribute of the school is multiculturalism.

The 28 January 2013, Terra Santa School and [[University of Cyprus]] signed an agreement that recognize Terra Santa School as prototype and experimental model school of the University of Cyprus.

'''The Rumie Initiative''' (Rumie) is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] based in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. The organization develops and delivers low-cost technology that enables the distribution of [[digital learning]] resources to communities with limited Internet access.

== History ==
The Rumie Initiative was founded by Tariq Fancy in 2013 to educate children in underserved communities around the world using affordable technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2014/12/28/bringing_education_to_the_worlds_poor_children.html|title=Bringing education to the world's poor children {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, Rumie’s products are deployed in more than 20 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rumie.org/locations/|title=Rumie Initiative|work=Rumie Initiative|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization received popular attention during the 2014 [[Ebola crisis|Ebola Crisis]], when it partnered with the [[Liberia]]n NGO ''Camp for Peace'' to deploy Rumie tablets as part of a rehabilitation program for [[Military use of children|child soldiers]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/11/20/ebola-liberia-digital-education/|title=As Liberian schools remain closed, tablets could become digital classroom|last=Santus|first=Rex|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Ebola epidemic, however, schools across the country were shuttered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28576010|title=Ebola: Liberia shuts schools to tackle outbreak|date=2014-07-30|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rumie's tablets quickly became a resource for children to continue their education from home.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2014/12/11/eduoverebo-using-tablets-to-help-liberian-children-study-in-spite-of-ebola/#4444f34495a4|title=The Rumie Initiative: Using Tablets As Learning Tools In Ebola-Stricken Communities|last=Guerrini|first=Federico|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Rumie began deploying its technology to assist children affected by the Syrian refugee crisis.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/851770/help-syrias-refugee-children-by-assigning-them-homework/|title=Help Syria’s refugee children by assigning them homework|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2015/12/30/toronto-non-profit-bringing-educational-tablets-to-kids.html|title=Toronto non-profit wants help bringing solar-powered educational tablets to kids in need {{!}} Metro Toronto|work=metronews.ca|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, a primary challenge was the deficit of free digital learning content for Syrian students. In response to this issue, Rumie announced during a 2015 presentation at [[Y Combinator (company)|Y-Combinator]] that it was opening the LearnCloud—a portal for free-license learning content, allowing users to find, share, and rate free digital educational resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Funding ==
[[Tariq Fancy]], a former investment banker and private equity investor, founded Rumie with his personal savings, committing to work without salary until the organization became financially sustainable. In early 2014, Rumie raised $1 million in philanthropic donations from outside backers, including [[W. Edmund Clark|Ed Clark]], the retired CEO of [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank]], [[Rob McEwen]], the chairman and CEO of McEwen Mining Inc.,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Mark Wiseman]], then the CEO of the [[CPP Investment Board|Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=John J.-H.|last2=Migdal|first2=Amram|date=2016-01-19|title=Rumie: Bringing Digital Education to the Underserved|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=50471|journal=Harvard Business School Case Collections|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumie has subsequently raised funding from large institutional backers, including [[Google]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and [[Scotiabank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotiabank.com/corp/en/0,,11017,00.html#!#3075|title=News Release {{!}} Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabank.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Goss's School of Rock''' is a rock music program, trialled in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in the early 1990s. It is now a nationwide organization in [[New Zealand]], growing immensely since its formation in 2005. It helps children aged 11–17 learn about [[rock music]], how to be part of a band, and how to successfully turn that "garage band" into a working, successful band.

The School of Rock is currently running in [[Wellington]] and there is also the [[Auckland]] School of Rock, a programme run by a team of professional musicians.

The school regularly accepts [[Singing|vocalists]], [[guitarist]]s, [[bassist]]s, [[drummer]]s and [[Keyboardist]]s, while other instruments, such as [[saxophone]]s, may be auditioned as necessary and contacts kept for needed circumstances.

== Program ==

In most cases bands are created from individual sign-ups. In some cases entire or partial bands sign up, looking for instruction and help obtaining new members. Students are encouraged, and eventually expected, to begin or continue to have private tuition for their chosen instruments.

Quoted from the school's website: "The School of Rock teaches young musicians how to be in a band. Rockers-in-training learn important life skills - like how to work together, [[Improvisation|improvise]], prepare new material, and perform in front of an audience - all while learning [[Classic rock|classic]] and [[modern rock]] that will make them better musicians. It's a great way to meet other young people interested in rock music, and to learn how to jam in a structured environment."

The term time program is intended to be taken over three years, with attempts to get the bands who are graduating their third year signed to established New Zealand [[Record label|music labels]].

===The Year One and Year Two term programmes feature===

*Weekly 90-minute practices at the school including training by Thomas Goss and his staff of professional musicians, with extra practices organized at the bands' discretion.
*At least one rock concert per term at local venues, including the School's own performance space, "School of Rock House".
*Master classes on performance and [[Songwriter|songwriting]].

Wellington bands in the Year 2 stage go through "The Arc", a creation of Thomas's, where the involved band record a 6–8 song EP, designing, promoting, releasing and touring the CD themselves, assisted by Goss. In 2007, the bands who are about to graduate Year 2 are also recording and touring a compilation of singles, with airplay on New Zealand radio stations expected.

The Year 3 course is still in its final planning stages, with the first batch of bands ready to progress into Year 3 studies in April 2007.

== Rock Camp ==

"Rock Camp" is the banner activity of the School of Rock, and an extension for those currently attending the term time program. The aim of the camp is to allow many teenage musicians from all around the country to come together and play rock music together, making friendships with like-minded people, and participate in workshops to help their instrumental skills, performance, and their songwriting. Also included as part of the camp was special talks from industry professionals on rock topics like promotion, booking, recording, getting signed, internet, and [[copyright]].

105 musicians attended the 2006 camp, a huge increase from 60 at the 2005 (and first) camp. Students and mentors from all over New Zealand were present, with Warren Maxwell of [[Fat Freddy's Drop]], [[The Mint Chicks]] and [[Ben Shepard]] of [[Sinate]] attending as special guests.

The '''University of California, Riverside''' ('''UCR''' or '''UC Riverside'''), is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] and one of the 10 general campuses of the [[University of California]] system. The main campus sits on {{convert|1900|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in a suburban district of [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], California, United States, with a branch campus of {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} in [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]]. In 1907 the predecessor to UCR was founded as the [[UC Citrus Experiment Station]], Riverside which pioneered research in [[biological pest control]] and the use of [[plant hormone|growth regulators]] responsible for extending the [[citrus]] growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on [[University of California, Riverside Citrus Variety Collection|citrus diversity]] and [[Entomology Research Museum|entomology]], as well as [[Eaton collection|science fiction]] and [[UCR/California Museum of Photography|photography]], are located at Riverside.

UCR's undergraduate [[UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|College of Letters and Science]] opened in 1954. The [[Regents of the University of California]] declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000&amp;nbsp;students by 2015, more than $730&amp;nbsp;million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999.&lt;ref name="UCR factsheet"&gt;{{cite web | title=UCR Factsheet | url=https://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside | accessdate=2007-08-22| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070820032842/https://www.ucr.edu/about/factsheet.html| archivedate = August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007"&gt;{{cite web | title=UCR Facts and Impacts 2007| url=https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html | publisher= University of California, Riverside |accessdate= 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary accreditation of the [[UC Riverside School of Medicine]] granted in October 2012 and the first class of 50 students was enrolled in August 2013.

UCR's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the [[Big West Conference]] of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of [[Box Springs Mountain]]. The UCR women's basketball team won back-to-back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the men's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001.

In 2018, the university hired its first two Nobel Prize winners to its faculty. Richard Schrock and Barry Barish joined UCR's College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/55018|title=Nobel Laureate Barry Barish Joins UC Riverside Faculty|work=UCR Today|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A Gary Anderson Graduate School of Managment.JPG|thumb|left|The original UC Citrus Experiment Station which now houses the [[A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management]] at the [[UCR School of Business Administration]].]]

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Southern California]] was a major producer of citrus, the region's primary [[export|agricultural export]]. The industry developed from the country's first [[navel orange]] trees, planted in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the UC Regents established the UC [[Citrus Experiment Station]] (CES) on February 14, 1907, on {{convert|23|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} of land on the east slope of [[Mount Rubidoux]] in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in [[fertilization (soil)|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop]] improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site, {{convert|475|acre|ha|0|sp=us}} near Box Springs Mountain.&lt;ref name="citrus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruther |first=Walter |author2=E.

The 1944 passage of the [[Servicemen's Readjustment Act (USA)|GI Bill]] during [[World War II]] set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered [[liberal arts college]] next to the CES. State Senator Nelson Dilworth, former Assemblyman [[Philip L. Boyd]] and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite press release | title=University of California, Riverside Campus Timeline | url=http://www.info.ucr.edu/announce/20020722timeline.html | year=2002 | publisher=UCR News | accessdate=2008-01-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20021017025918/http://www.info.ucr.edu/announce/20020722timeline.html | archivedate=2002-10-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gabbert Oral History transcript | url=http://www.ucrhistory.ucr.edu/pdf/gabbert.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=University of California, Riverside, Oral History Project | date=1998-04-02 |accessdate=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Earl Warren]] signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2&amp;nbsp;million for initial campus construction.&lt;ref name="Lovekin"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lovekin | first=Kris | title= Enjoying Our Past | journal=Fiat Lux | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=14–17 | publisher= University of California, Riverside |date=February 2004 | url=http://www.fiatlux.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=583 | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Campus, occupying approximately {{convert|600|acre|ha|0|sp=us}}, hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the [[architecture]] of the major buildings followed the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California.&lt;ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /&gt;

[[Image:Bell Tower, UCR.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Carillon]] [[Bell tower|Bell Tower]] is the dominant landmark in the center of the main campus.]]
Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the College of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) in April 1951. A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more [[Modern architecture|Modern]] style were completed by 1954: the Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. After the Regents declared UCR a "general campus" of the UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an east–west axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway.&lt;ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /&gt; The Bell Tower, one of only five [[carillon]]s in California, was built in this period. Designed by [[A. Quincy Jones]], the tower is {{convert|161|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and contains 48&amp;nbsp;bells, each weighing from {{convert|28|lb|kg}} to {{convert|5091|lb|kg}}, covering four chromatic [[octave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= History of the Bell Tower | publisher= UCR Bell Tower Fund | url= http://www.belltower.ucr.edu/subpage.php?content=history.html | accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UCR Belltower night.JPG|thumb|UCR Bell Tower at night]]After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades. However, enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the period include: [[UC Riverside Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering|Bourns Hall]], completed in 1995; the Humanities &amp; Social Science building, completed in 1996; and the Science Library, completed in 1998.

UCR's academic policies are set by its Academic Senate, a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Duties and Structure of the Academic Senate: A Brief Review, Academic Senate Office | publisher=University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.senate.ucr.edu/senate_site/cms.php?node=duties_and_structure | accessdate=2008-01-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106102624/http://www.senate.ucr.edu/senate_site/cms.php?node=duties_and_structure| archivedate = November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCR is organized into four academic colleges, two professional schools, and several interdisciplinary divisions. UCR's liberal arts college, the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, was founded in 1954, and began accepting graduate students in 1960. The [[College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences]], founded in 1960, incorporated the CES as part of the first research-oriented institution at UCR; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974.&lt;ref name="Hinderaker" /&gt; UCR's newest academic unit, the Bourns College of Engineering, was founded in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title= UC Riverside College of Engineering Hires Thirteen New Faculty Members | url = http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=717 | date=2003-12-22 | publisher = University of California, Riverside | accessdate = 2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnas.ucr.edu/about/history.html|title=UCR College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, History|publisher=University of California, Riverside|accessdate=2008-03-12

[[College and university rankings|Institutional rankings]] of UC Riverside vary widely, depending on the criteria of the publication. For instance, UC Riverside was ranked the #15 college in the United States by the Social Mobility Index college rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialmobilityindex.org/|title=2017 Social Mobility Index|publisher=CollegeNET|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2018 edition of ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'''s "America's Best Colleges", UCR was ranked tied for 85th among national universities; criteria include professor peer assessment, student selectivity and retention, as well as faculty resources, financial resources, and alumni giving.&lt;ref name="USNews"/&gt; In the 2018 edition of the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' college rankings, UCR ranked 28th among national universities. ''Washington Monthly'' assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country). In the 2018 edition of ''Webometrics Ranking of World Universities'' based in Spain, UCR was ranked 67th among national universities and 127th among world universities. ''Money'' magazine ranked UC Riverside 32nd in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2018 Best Colleges ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Money's Best Colleges |url=http://time.com/money/collection/moneys-best-colleges/ |publisher= Money|date=2018 |accessdate=September 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daily Beast ranked UC Riverside 153rd in the country out of the nearly 2000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Daily Beast's Guide to the Best Colleges 2013 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/16/college-rankings-2013-daily-beast-guide-to-the-best-colleges.html |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=October 16, 2013 |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]] published by ''Academic Analytics'' in 2006, UCR as an institution ranked 46th among top research universities considering such criteria as faculty publications, citations, research funding and other honors.&lt;ref name="A New Standard for Measuring Doctoral Programs"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Fogg | first= Piper | title=A New Standard for Measuring Doctoral Programs | journal= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date= 2007-01-12 | url=http://chronicle.com/free/v53/i19/19a00801.htm | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, more than 110&amp;nbsp;UCR faculty members have been elected fellows of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Over the course of UCR's history, seven current or former faculty members have been elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and more than 50 have received [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s.&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007" /&gt;

===Economic and research impact===
UCR operated under a $435&amp;nbsp;million budget in fiscal year 2005–06. The state government provided $153&amp;nbsp;million, student fees accounted for $111&amp;nbsp;million, the federal government financed $84&amp;nbsp;million, and $45&amp;nbsp;million came from university sales and services. Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $18&amp;nbsp;million. Overall, monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion in California.&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007" /&gt; Faculty members received nearly $87&amp;nbsp;million in research funding in 2005–06, mostly from federal agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Sponsored Programs Activity, Fiscal Year 2006 Annual Summary Report | publisher= University of California, Riverside, Office of Research | year= 2006 | url= http://or.ucr.edu/Files/pdf/annual2006.pdf | format= PDF | accessdate= 2007-08-22 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070808175051/http://or.ucr.edu/Files/pdf/annual2006.pdf | archivedate= 2007-08-08 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total research [[expenditure]]s at Riverside are significantly concentrated in [[agricultural science]], accounting for 53% of total research expenditures spent by the university in 2002.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture"&gt;{{cite web | last = ICF Consulting | url = http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/itstartshere/report/fullreport.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030530034047/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/itstartshere/report/fullreport.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2003-05-30 | format = PDF | title = California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture | date = March 2003 | publisher = University of California, Office of the President | accessdate = 2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top research centers by expenditure, as measured in 2002, include the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Center for Environmental Research and Technology, the Center for Bibliographical Studies, the Air Pollution Research Center, and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt;

Throughout UCR's history, researchers have developed more than 40&amp;nbsp;new citrus varieties and invented new techniques to help the $960&amp;nbsp;million-a-year California [[agribusiness|citrus industry]] fight pests and diseases.&lt;ref name="UCRFacts2007" /&gt; In 1927, [[entomologist]]s at the CES introduced two [[wasp]]s from [[Australia]] as natural enemies of a major citrus pest, the citrophilus [[mealybug]], saving growers in Orange County $1&amp;nbsp;million in annual losses. This event was pivotal in establishing [[biological control]] as a practical means of reducing pest populations.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Saywer | first= Richard C. | title=To Make a Spotless Orange: Biological Control in California | location=[[West Lafayette, Indiana]] | publisher=[[Purdue University Press]] | year= 1996 | isbn=1-55753-285-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of [[gibberellic acid]] allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods. The ultimate result of his work, which continued through the 1980s, was the extension of the citrus-growing season in California from four to nine months.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt; In 1980, UC Riverside released the Oroblanco [[grapefruit]], its first [[patent]]ed citrus variety. Since then, the citrus breeding program has released other varieties such as the Melogold grapefruit, the Gold Nugget mandarin (or [[tangerine]]), and others that have yet to be given [[trademark]] names.&lt;ref name="California's Future: It Starts Here, UC's Contributions to Growth, Health, and Culture" /&gt; To assist entrepreneurs in developing new products, UCR is a primary partner in the Riverside Regional Technology Park, which includes the City of Riverside and the [[Riverside County, California|County of Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;

Admission to UC Riverside is rated as "selective" by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-riverside-1316|title=University of California-Riverside |year=2014|accessdate=2014-08-23|publisher=[[U.S. News and World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Fall 2015, UCR received 38,505 freshmen applications; 21,608 were admitted (56.1%).&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt; The average [[GPA]] of the enrolled freshmen was 3.69, while the average [[SAT]] scores were 545 for critical reading, 574 for math, and 549 for writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sara.ucr.edu/main_menu.html?id=profile |title=Student Profiles, New Freshman Profile – 2015 |publisher=University of California, Riverside |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030124155/http://sara.ucr.edu/main_menu.html?id=profile |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, 43.4 percent of admitted students were first generation college students, 38.7 percent came from low family income backgrounds, and 24 percent graduated from low-performing high schools as measured by [[Academic Performance Index]] (API) scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=California Freshman Admit Profile Fall 2004, 2005, 2006 | url=http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/2006/freshman_admit_profile_2006.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=University of California | accessdate=2006-08-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040309/http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/2006/freshman_admit_profile_2006.pdf | archivedate=2006-09-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, ''[[U.S. News]]'' ranked UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving [[Pell Grants]] (42&amp;nbsp;percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation.&lt;ref name="ethnic diversity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economic diversity"/&gt;

According to statistics released by the Education Trust, a national nonprofit, in 2005 UC Riverside graduated 65.3 percent of its students in six years, a figure consistent with national averages but behind the average set by the top five public research universities by as much as 22 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Measuring Up 2006, The National Report Card on Higher Education | url=http://measuringup.highereducation.org/_docs/2006/NationalReport_2006.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education | accessdate=2007-08-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185403/http://measuringup.highereducation.org/_docs/2006/NationalReport_2006.pdf | archivedate=2007-09-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=University of California, Riverside, Graduation Rates | url=http://www.collegeresults.org/search1a.aspx?InstitutionID=110671 | publisher=The Education Trust | accessdate= 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, UCR's consistency with the national average is well above the median of 39 percent for low-income-serving institutions as calculated in 2006 by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]], making the campus a model for successful approaches to [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in higher education.&lt;ref name="Hebel"/&gt;

Much of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs. Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[New York Times]]'' to run stories stating that UCR is a "campus of choice" for minority students.&lt;ref name="LAT011507"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Traub"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE2DA163DF931A35756C0A96F958260 |title=The Class of Prop. 209|work=[[New York Times Magazine]]|accessdate=2008-01-29|last=Traub|first=James|authorlink=James Traub|date=1998-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCR was the first college in California to open a staffed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) resource center in 1993, the first UC campus to offer a LGBT minor studies program in 1996, and the first campus in the nation to offer a [[gender-neutral housing]] option in 2005.&lt;ref name="LGBT ranking"/&gt; In recognition of this, ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' recognized UCR as one of the nation's best campuses for LGBT students in 2006, although it did not make the top 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Windmeyer | first=Shane L. | title=The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students | publisher=Alyson Publications, Inc. | year=2006 | isbn=1-55583-857-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Princeton Review]]'' listed UCR as a "Best Western College."&lt;ref name="unhappy students"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/highereducation/stories/PE_News_Local_S_hiednotes11.468022b.html |title=UCR not ranked high in survey's happiness category |last=Regus |first=Elaine |date=2008-08-10 |work=[[Press Enterprise (California)|Press Enterprise]] |publisher=[[A.

===Housing===
[[Image:Sunset, UCR.jpg|thumb|The [[Box Springs Mountains]] at dusk from the Pentland Hills [[residence hall]].]]
UCR's residence halls consist of three structures—Aberdeen-Inverness, Lothian, and Pentland Hills—which {{as of|2002|lc=y}} housed 2,930&amp;nbsp;students in triple, double and single rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus [[apartment complex]]es such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Oban, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959&amp;nbsp;students. UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest, a low-density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher-density residence halls.&lt;ref name="LongRangePlan2005" /&gt; Glen Mor, an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills, was opened in 2007, and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex, which is now known as Falkirk, for student housing in 2007.&lt;ref name="HighlanderRidge"&gt;{{cite press release | title=UC Riverside Buys University House at Highlander Ridge | url=http://www.newsroom.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=1575 | publisher=University of California, Riverside | date=2007-04-27 | accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus.&lt;ref name="HighlanderRidge"/&gt; Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend.&lt;ref name="University of California, Riverside, campus life"&gt;{{cite web | title= University of California, Riverside, campus life | url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_1316_brief.php | work= [[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting UCR's diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include ''Unete a Mundo'', for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a Pan African Theme Hall for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a [[gender-neutral]] community. UCR's three academic colleges in the humanities, sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls, and halls exist for honor students and transfer students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UCR Housing Services | publisher = University of California, Riverside | url = http://housing.ucr.edu/CampusLiving/SpecialInterestCommunities.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070212232055/http://housing.ucr.edu/CampusLiving/SpecialInterestCommunities.htm | archivedate = 2007-02-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations and activities===
UCR hosts over 375&amp;nbsp;registered student organizations, including the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Organizations| publisher= University of California, Riverside |url=http://resources.ucr.edu/studentlife/studentorgs/default.aspx | accessdate= 2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 16&amp;nbsp;elected senators, who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment, 5 Executive Cabinet Officers (President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs, Vice President of External Affairs, and Vice President of Finance), and 6 Directors, who are in charge of the various parts of ASUCR, and a Judicial Council of 6, which adjudicates any cases involving personnel misconduct or interpretation of the Constitution. Membership is composed of all UCR students who pay mandatory activity fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=ASUCR Constitution| publisher=Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside| url=http://asucrexchange.ucr.edu/asucr_constitution_2015.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2016-03-22}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASUCR assesses these fees and distributes funds to registered student groups on campus, including student lobbying groups, a right that ASUCR won in a federal court case against the Regents in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ASUCR v.

Of the registered student groups, 40 are [[fraternities and sororities]]. Nine men's fraternities belong to the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference]]; seven women's sororities belong to the [[National Panhellenic Conference]]; seven men's fraternities and ten women's sororities represent the [[National Multicultural Greek Council]], and two others fall under the campus [[La Raza|Raza]] Assembly and are unique to UCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraternity and Sorority Life |publisher=University of California, Riverside |url=http://studentlife.ucr.edu/Student+Organizations/Fraternity+and+Sorority+Life.htm |accessdate=2007-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013112901/http://studentlife.ucr.edu/Student%2BOrganizations/Fraternity%2Band%2BSorority%2BLife.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life, although chapter houses are not permitted.&lt;ref name="University of California, Riverside, extracurriculars"&gt;{{cite web | title= University of California, Riverside, extracurriculars | url= http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drextras_1316_brief.php | work= [[US News and World Report]] | accessdate= 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including the Greek letter organizations, more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Community Involvement | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url=http://www.impact.ucr.edu/ci.html |accessdate= 2007-08-23| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070727042846/http://www.impact.ucr.edu/ci.html| archivedate = July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through UCR Hillel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iehillel.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Student media organizations include ''The Highlander'' student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, ''The Highlander'' remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however ''The Highlander'' is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Highlander Referendum, 2001 | publisher= Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside |url=http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html | accessdate= 2007-08-22| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060904172637/http://www.elections.ucr.edu/2001/Referenda/highlanderreferenda.html| archivedate = September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, ''The Highlander'' published a comic depicting a stereotypical [[Asian American]] graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last=Healy | first=Scott.

On-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB's major events include the Block Party Concert, Winter Soulstice, Homecoming Bonfire and Spring Splash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= ASPB | publisher= University of California, Riverside | url= http://www.aspb.ucr.edu | accessdate= 2007-08-22 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070703212643/http://aspb.ucr.edu/ | archive-date= 2007-07-03 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other on-campus events take place at The Barn, one of the original buildings on campus grounds. Throughout the 60s', 70s' and 80s' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead. During the 90s' however, the university administration sought to avoid a "party school" stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant, The Big West Bar and Grill. As recently as the fall of 2007, concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on-campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community.

The Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR's counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=GASUCR, About the Council| publisher=Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside| url=http://www.gsa.ucr.edu/Council.html| accessdate=2007-08-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721194608/http://www.gsa.ucr.edu/Council.html| archivedate=2007-07-21| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCR's [[varsity team]]s compete in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. Programs include men's and women's soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women's volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men's and women's soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from [[NCAA Division II]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="Division I"/&gt; While at Division II level, UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men's baseball and women's volleyball. {{as of|2006}}, UCR had produced 17&amp;nbsp;individual national champions, 175&amp;nbsp;[[All-American]]s and many conference and regional champions. The men's golf team represented UCR in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA West Regionals after winning back-to-back Conference Championships in those respective years while having three athletes ranked in the top 100 in the country.

After being ordained as a deacon in 1853, he was subsequently appointed to All Saints, Gordon Square (1853–5), St. Paul's, Lisson Grove (1855–7), and [[St Giles in the Fields]] (1857–9), before departing England to serve a rector of [[St. Paul's School, Calcutta]], India. He was later senior chaplain with the Khyber field force from 1879 to 1881, for which he was honoured with the Afghan medal. After returning to England he was briefly a principal of the Jews' Episcopal Chapel, Cambridge Heath, before being appointed vicar of [[Hungarton]] in 1882. In 1884 he opened a hostel, Ayerst Hall, in Cambridge to assist poorer men with their education, and was curate of Newton, Cambridgeshire, from 1888 to 1890.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{citation |last=Buckland |first=A.
