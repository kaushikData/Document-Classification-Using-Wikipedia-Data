Despite repeated intrigues, he failed to become god. Multiple accounts mentioned his [[Mysticism|mystic]] and occult skills.

== Desire of God ==

Apsethus attempted to prove that he was divine, leading to claims that he desired to become God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ante-Nicene Christian Library: Hippolytus, Bishop of Rome, v. 1 (1868)|author=Sir James Donaldson|page=197|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was compared with [[Simon Magus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Simon Magus: His Philosophy and Teachings|author=G.

== As occult ==

Apsethus trained [[parrot]]s that flew around Northern Africa. They would utter the phrase "Apsethus is God". Apsethus asserted himself to be God. The [[Libyans]] sacrificed to Apsethus, as they started believing him to be a voice from Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = THE QUARTERLY REVIEW. VOL. LXXXIX.

Later a Greek caught one of these parrots. He trained the parrot to say, "Apsethus having caged us, compelled us to say Apsethus is a god".

'''Bi Gan''' or '''Bigan''' ({{zh|c=比干}}) was a prominent Chinese figure during the [[Shang dynasty]]. He was a son of King [[Wen Ding]], and an uncle of the last Shang king, [[King Zhou of Shang|Di Xin]].  He is immortalized as a Taoist deity.  Though he is commonly known as Bi Gan, his actual surname is "Zi" (子).

Notorious for his corruptness, Di Xin was annoyed by Bi Gan's advice to rectify his ways. He ordered Bi Gan's execution through extraction of the heart 比干剖心, under the eerie pretext of curiosity "whether the Sage's heart has seven openings". The plot became a popular element of the Warring States philosophic discourse.  

Bi Gan was honored by [[Confucius]] as "one of the three men of virtue" of the Shang, together with Weizi [[:zh:宋微子|微子]] and [[Jizi]] 箕子 (The ''[[Analects]]'', Wei Zi chapter).  

Bi Gan was later deified as [[Cai Shen]], the god of fortune. It was greatly popularized by depiction in the famous Ming dynasty novel [[Fengshen Bang|The Investiture of the Gods]], describing his confrontation with [[Daji]].

'''William George Hayden''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|AC}} (born 23 January 1933) is a former Australian politician who served as the [[List of Governors-General of Australia|21st Governor-General of Australia]], in office from 1989 to 1996. He had earlier been leader of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] from 1977 to 1983, as well as serving as a cabinet minister in the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam]] and [[Hawke Government]]s.

Hayden was born in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]]. He attended [[Brisbane State High School]] and then joined the [[Queensland Police]], working as a police officer for eight years while studying economics part-time at the [[University of Queensland]]. Hayden was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1961|1961 federal election]], aged 28. When [[Gough Whitlam]] led the Labor Party to victory [[Australian federal election, 1972|in 1972]], he was made [[Minister for Human Services (Australia)|Minister for Social Security]]. He replaced [[Jim Cairns]] as [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] in 1975, but served for only five months before the government [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|was dismissed]].

In early 1977, Hayden challenged Whitlam for the party leadership and was defeated by just two votes. He succeeded Whitlam as [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] at the end of the year, following Labor's defeat at the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 election]]. Hayden led the party to the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 election]], recording a substantial swing but falling well short of victory. He was replaced by [[Bob Hawke]] just a few weeks before the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]], after months of speculation. Hayden served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade]] from 1983 to 1988, then left parliament to assume the governor-generalship. He held that position for seven years, with only [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Gowrie]] having served for longer.

==Early life==
Born in [[Brisbane]], Bill Hayden was the son of George Hayden, an [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] sailor originally from [[Oakland, California]], and already 52 years old at the time of Bill's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Hayden, ''Hayden: An autobiography'', ''op. cit'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandparents were from [[County Cork, Ireland]] and significant parts of his approach to social issues and politics throughout his public life reflected this background and non-denominational education at [[Brisbane State High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

A keen sportsman, he played rugby and rowed, and served in the Australian Military Force, and Navy as well as the Queensland Public Service and Police Force (the latter, from 1953-61).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Hayden), former Australian Governor-General|work=Alumni|publisher=[[University of Queensland]]|url=http://www.alumni.uq.edu.au/index.html?page=285|accessdate=26 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607110001/http://www.alumni.uq.edu.au/index.html?page=285|archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his education privately, completing an economics [[academic degree|degree]] (on a part-time basis) at the [[University of Queensland]]. Prior to the 1970s, he was a self-described [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/saturdayextra/stories/2005/1498213.htm|title=Interview: Bill Hayden on the Dismissal – 30 years later|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=5 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics (1961–1988)==
[[File:Bill Hayden 1962.jpg|thumb|left|Bill Hayden c. 1962]]
During the late 1950s he became active in the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Denis |title=Hayden: A Political Biography |date=1980 |publisher=Angus and Robertson |location=Australia |isbn=0 207 14101 0 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Australian federal election, 1961|1961 federal election]] he surprised almost everyone, including himself, by winning the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat of [[Division of Oxley|Oxley]], located in southwest Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, ''ibid'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He ousted [[Donald Alastair Cameron|Don Cameron]], the Minister for Health in the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government, on a nine-point swing. Hayden's win was part of a 15-seat swing to Labor that nearly brought down the Menzies government.

Overcoming initial resistance to his membership of the Labor party (due to a perception within the party of his father's views as too radical) he was admitted and was soon popularly elected as one of the then youngest members of the federal parliament (only 28 years old at the time he entered it), Hayden proved to be a diligent, well-spoken parliamentarian. In 1969, he became a member of the Opposition front bench.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, ''op. cit.'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; When Labor won the [[Australian federal election, 1972|1972 election]] under [[Gough Whitlam]], Hayden was appointed [[Minister for Human Services (Australia)|Minister for Social Security]], and in that capacity, among other efforts to promoting reform, introduced the single mothers pension and [[Medicare (Australia)|Medibank]], Australia's first system of universal health insurance. On 6 June 1975, he succeeded [[Jim Cairns]] as [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]], a position he held until the Whitlam government [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|was dismissed by the Governor-General]], [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], on 11 November 1975. Labor suffered its worst-ever defeat in [[Australian federal election, 1975|the election held a month later]], and Hayden was left as the only Labor MP from Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, ''op. cit'', p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition Leader===
When Labor lost the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 election]] in yet another landslide, Whitlam retired as leader and Hayden was elected to succeed him. Aged 44, he was the youngest person to be elected leader of the Labor Party since [[Chris Watson]] in 1901. His political views had become more moderate, and he advocated economic policies which encompassed the private sector and the American alliance. Several opinion polls during early 1980 showed the ALP under Hayden neck-and-neck with, or actually ahead of, Fraser's administration.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

At the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 election]]. Labor finished a mere 0.8 percent behind Fraser's government on the two-party vote, having gained a nationwide swing of over four percent. Yet, due to the geographically uneven nature of the swing (strong in Victoria and, to a lesser degree, Western Australia and New South Wales, but comparatively weak everywhere else), Labor fell 12 seats short of toppling the Coalition. Hayden did, however, manage to slash Fraser's majority, from 48 seats to 21. He not only regained most of what Labor had lost in the previous two elections, but put the party within striking distance of winning the next election.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

By 1982 it was evident that Fraser was manoeuvring to call an early election. But the main threat to Hayden came less from Fraser than from elements in Hayden's own party. [[Bob Hawke]], a former union leader who had been elected to Parliament two years earlier, began mobilising his supporters to challenge Hayden's leadership. On 16 July 1982 Hayden narrowly defeated a challenge by Hawke in a party ballot but Hawke continued to plot against Hayden.&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-politics-books.com/ccp0-prodshow/bill-hayden-autobiography.html|title=Hayden – Bill Hayden An Autobiography|author=Bill Hayden|year=1996|publisher=Pymble N.S.W.: Angus &amp; Robertson|accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December Labor surprised many pundits by its failure to win the vital [[Flinders by-election, 1982|Flinders by-election]] in Victoria, further raising doubts about Hayden's ability to lead the ALP to power.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "Flinders fallout", ''The Australian Financial Review'', Dec 6, 1982, and Gregory Hywood, '"Kingmaker" Button ponders Hayden's future', ''The Australian Financial Review'', 24 Dec 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 1983, in a meeting in [[Brisbane]], various leading Labor figures, including [[Paul Keating]] and Senator [[John Button]], told him that he must resign.&lt;ref name="Hayden"/&gt; He reluctantly accepted their advice.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Balderstone, 'The 'Little General' who had to drop a friend', ''The Age'', 5 February 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke was then elected leader, unopposed. Later that morning, unaware of the events in Brisbane, Fraser in [[Canberra]] called [[Australian federal election, 1983|a snap election for 5 March]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Fraser had been well aware of the infighting within Labor and wanted to call an election before the party could replace Hayden with Hawke. It was only a few hours before the writs were issued that Fraser learned of Hayden's resignation. At a press conference that afternoon Hayden, still chagrined, said that "a drover's dog could lead the Labor Party to victory, the way the country is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article116447838 |title=Statements from Hayden Bowen, Hawke |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=57, |issue=17,295 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=4 February 1983 |accessdate=28 January 2018 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden's quip about a "drover's dog" became part of Australian political history. Hayden himself referred to it good-humouredly many years when he said, "There are so many things I did in my political life that I am very proud of. ...  But the one thing I am remembered for is damn well saying 'A drover's dog could win the next election'. It seems to have settled into political idiom. The only person who didn't like it was Bob Hawke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=ktendolle |title=Drover's dog couldn't win this time: Hayden |url=https://www.qt.com.au/news/drovers-dog-couldnt-win-this-time-hayden/1997087/ |accessdate=19 August 2018 |date=26 August 2013 |ref=The Queensland Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign Minister===
[[File:(10) 1988 Bill Hayden, Russian FM Shevardnadze, Moscow.jpg|thumb|right|Hayden in 1987, signing an agreement with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (right).]]
Labor won the 1983 election handily, and Hayden became Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In that post, he advocated closer integration between Australia and its Asian neighbours. In a 1983 interview, he stated: "Australia is changing. We're an anomaly as a European country in this part of the world. There's already a large and growing Asian population in Australia and it is inevitable in my view that Australia will become a Eurasian country over the next century or two. Australian Asians and Europeans will marry another and a new race will emerge: I happen to think that's desirable." ''[[Asiaweek]]'', 19 August 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P0_aCOdTtQQC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=Australia+will+become+a+Eurasian+country+Hayden&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Australia%20will%20become%20a%20Eurasian%20country%20Hayden&amp;f=false Quoted in ''Pacific centuries: Pacific and Pacific Rim History since the Sixteenth Century'' by Dennis Owen Flynn, Lionel Frost, A. J. H. Latham, 1999, Routledge, page 232]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Foreign Minister Hayden had oversight of the Australian foreign aid program. He pursued efforts to engage Vietnam and Cambodia despite vehement opposition from allied nations and key stakeholders. In 1983 Hayden announced a review of the Australian foreign aid program (known as the "Jackson Review" after the chair, [[Gordon Jackson (businessman)|Sir Gordon Jackson]]) which reported in March 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government Publishing Service, ''Report of the Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program'', Canberra, {{ISBN|0 644 03344 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main recommendations of the report, which were directed at improving the professional quality of the Australian aid program, were accepted by the Government. During the next few years, in various speeches Hayden set out the foreign aid priorities of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Hayden, 'Policy and Economics of Foreign Aid', ''Economic Analysis and Policy'', 17 (1), March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor-General (1989–1996)==
After winning the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 election]], Hawke offered Hayden the post of [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] as a consolation for replacing him earlier as Labor Leader in 1983 and thus denying him the chance to become Prime Minister. The Queen's appointment of Hayden as Governor-General to succeed Sir [[Ninian Stephen]] was announced in mid-1988.&lt;ref&gt;There had been considerable media speculation about the appointment in the months beforehand but the decision was only confirmed when an official announcement was made.

He took up the post of Governor-General in early 1989 and served during the period of transition from the Hawke Government to the [[Paul Keating|Keating Government]] in December 1991. The usual term of for a Governor-General was five years but, by agreement between the government and Hayden, his term was extended for an additional two years to early 1996.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role|title=Governor-General's Role|last=|first=|date=13 June 2017|website=Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/constitution/gg/governor-generals-since-1901|title=Governors-General Since 1901|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Politics.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his appointment as Governor-General, he became, ''ex officio'', Chancellor and Principal Companion of the [[Order of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role|title=Governor-General's Role|last=|first=|date=|website=Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously said he would never accept any honours.

==Later life==
[[File:Howard and Hayden.jpg|thumb|right|Bill Hayden and [[John Howard]] at [[Padraic McGuinness]]'s funeral in 2008]]
By the late 1990s Hayden joined the board of ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]''. In the debate preceding the [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|1999 republic referendum]], he rejected the specific proposal and sided with the monarchists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s57757.htm|title=Anti-republican cause recruits Bill Hayden|series=PM |network=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|airdate=7 October 1999|credits=Reporter: Sally Sara |station=[[ABC Radio National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating he only supported direct election of a president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.au/ARM-2001/mediaroom/mr16.htm |title=Republicans call for the real Bill Hayden to stand up in the No referendum case |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011128041639/http://www.republic.org.au/ARM-2001/mediaroom/mr16.htm |archivedate=28 November 2001 |df=dmy }} ''Republic.org.au'', 17 August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since retirement from the position of Governor-General, Hayden has continued to contribute to public policy discussion in Australia. While on the board of ''Quadrant'', he took time to lend personal support to the publication and wrote a tribute to its editor [[Padraic McGuinness|P.P. McGuinness]] on his death in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/workingmans-friend/story-e6frg7ef-1111115419156 'Workingman's friend', ''The Australian'', 29 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also continued to write opinion and comment pieces for other magazines and newspapers in Australia about current social, economic and political issues including foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;See his article on gay rights in Australia, 'We've come so far on gay rights but it's not enough', ''The Punch'', 6 October 2009 [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/workingmans-friend/story-e6frg7ef-1111115419156], and his comment on US-China relations in Asia 'Caught in the US-China wash', ''The Australian'' 11 June 2011 [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/commentary/caught-in-the-us-china-wash/story-e6frgd0x-1226073219459].&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Hayden was baptised as a [[Roman Catholic]] at [[St Mary's Church, Ipswich]]. He told ''[[The Catholic Leader (Brisbane)|The Catholic Leader]]'' that  "there’s been a gnawing pain in my heart and soul about what is the meaning of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://catholicleader.com.au/uncategorized/former-atheist-and-political-leader-bill-hayden-baptised-at-age-85-at-st-marys-church-ipswich|title=Former atheist and political leader Bill Hayden baptised at age 85 at St Mary's Church, Ipswich|publisher=''[[The Catholic Leader (Brisbane)|The Catholic Leader]]''|date=18 September 2018|access-date=18 September 2018}} See also Kristian Silva, '[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-19/bill-hayden-turns-to-god-at-85-baptism-brisbane/10280724 Bill Hayden, former Labor leader, turns to God despite atheist past'], ''ABC News'', 19 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  The baptismal ceremony was attended by a gathering of family, friends, and former colleagues.  Hayden's siblings, Patricia Oxenham, John Hayden, and Joan Moseman, along with other members of family, were present for the event.

==Honours==
By virtue of being Governor-General, he was the Chancellor of the [[Order of Australia]] and its Principal Companion (AC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the [[University of Queensland]] in 1990 for his distinguished contributions to Australian life. Other awards included admission to the Order of St John Australia and also the Gwanghwa Medal of the Korean Order of Diplomatic Merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alumni.uq.edu.au/bill-hayden-former-australian-governor-general University of Queensland, Alumni and Community] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720045736/http://www.alumni.uq.edu.au/bill-hayden-former-australian-governor-general |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 he was recognised as the Australian [[Humanism|Humanist]] of the Year by the [[Council of Australian Humanist Societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsnsw.asn.au/ahoy.html Australian Humanists of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 at the 45th State Conference of the Queensland Branch of the [[Australian Labor Party]], Hayden was made a Life Member of the party.

In September 2017, in delivering the second Hayden Oration at the University of Southern Queensland in Ipswich, former Australian prime minister [[Paul Keating]] spoke at length of Hayden's contribution to the Labor Party. Keating spoke, in particular, of the reform period during the Hawke Labor Government in the 1980s in Australia. He noted that the foundations for the reforms had been set down before the Labor Party won office in 1983 during the period when Hayden was Leader of the Opposition and was working to prepare the Party for government. "Those great reforms", Keating said, "began with the frameworks Bill Hayden brought to the front bench, the day he became Leader of the Labor Party."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Keating, '[http://www.keating.org.au/shop/item/the-hayden-oration The Hayden Oration 29 September 2017'], University of Southern Queensland, Ipswich Campus, Queensland. A summary of Keating's remarks was carried in several major Australian newspapers, including in Mark Kenny, '[http://www.theage.com.au/national/bill-hayden-the-most-visionary-pm-we-never-had-says-paul-keating-20170927-gyplac.html Bill Hayden, the most visionary PM we never had, says Paul Keating'], ''The Age'', 30 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christ at the Sea of Galilee''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Tintoretto|Jacopo Tintoretto]]. The painting depicts [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] raises a hand toward the [[apostles]], who appear in a boat amid hostile waves at sea. It is an example of [[mannerism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Christ at the Sea of Galilee| accessdate=2018-04-17| publisher=Aaron Art Prints| url=http://www.aaronartprints.org/tintoretto-christattheseaofgalilee.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European art style that exaggerates proportion and favors compositional tension. This can be seen in the expressive postures of the figures and the muted, yet intense color of the sea and sky.

Tintoretto had a mostly [[Venice|Venetian]] audience and was known for painting scenes of Venice, but this painting departs from this path. Additionally, the scene was made to look overly dramatic rather than realistic. The paint is thin and Tintoretto uses extreme highlights, intensifying the darkness and light that seems to come from a compressed and directed light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Muhlberger| first=Richard| title=The Bible in Art: The New Testament| publisher=New York: Portland House| year=1990| pages=82-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is currently on display in the Samuel H. Kress Collection at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=nga&gt;{{cite web| title=National Gallery of Art| publisher=National Gallery of Art| url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.41637.html| accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{universalism}}
'''Christian universalism''' is a school of [[Christian theology]] focused around the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]] – the view that all human beings will ultimately be "saved" and restored to a right relationship with God.

The term ''Christian universalism'' was used in the 1820s by Russell Streeter of the ''Christian Intelligencer'' of Portland – a descendant of [[Adams Streeter]] who had founded one of the first [[Universalist Church]]es on September 14, 1785.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Streeter Familiar conversations: in which the salvation of all mankind is ... – Page 266 1835 "We now come to those distinguished men, MURRAY and WINCHESTER, who, as our oppo- sers would have people believe, were the inventors and first preachers of Christian Universalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''not Russell Streeter.''' The Christian repository: Volume 9 – Page 218 [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]] (1800–1889) – 1829 "In a piece entitled Christian Universalism, in the Christian Intelligencer, volume 3d, page 4, he wrote the following: "The Editor," speaking of himself, "deems it a solemn obligation to protest against proceedings calculated to make an"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The journal of Unitarian Universalist history: Volumes 26–28 Unitarian Universalist Historical Society – 1999 "The adoption of the name Christian Universalist can, nevertheless, be explained plausibly in the context of Dean's debate with Aesop. "&lt;/ref&gt; Christian universalists believe this was the most common interpretation of [[Christianity]] in [[Early Christianity]], prior to the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Ken R. (July/August 2006). [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/salvationconspiracy.html "The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal"]. ''The Universalist Herald''.  See also: J.W. Hanson. ''Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First 500 Years''. Boston and Chicago: Universalist Publishing House, 1899.

(January/February 2006). [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/universalistsgone.html "Where Have All the Universalists Gone?"]. ''The Universalist Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a formal [[Christian denomination]], Christian universalism originated in the late 18th century with the [[Universalist Church of America]]. There is currently no single denomination uniting Christian universalists, but a few denominations teach some of the principles of Christian universalism or are open to them.  In 2007, the [[Christian Universalist Association]] was founded to serve as an ecumenical umbrella organization for churches, ministries, and individuals who believe in Christian universalism.

[[Unitarian Universalism]] historically grew out of Christian universalism but is not an exclusively Christian denomination. It formed from a 1961 merger of two historically Christian denominations, the [[Universalist Church of America]] and the [[American Unitarian Association]], both based in the [[United States]].

== Beliefs ==
In his ''Plain Guide to Universalism'', the universalist [[Thomas Whittemore (Universalist)|Thomas Wiltmore]] wrote, "The sentiment by which Universalists are distinguished, is this: that at last every individual of the human race shall become holy and happy. This does not comprise the whole of their faith, but, merely that feature of it which is peculiar to them and by which they are distinguished from the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/univ2.html ''Plain Guide to Universalism'' Chapter 2, Paragraph 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining central beliefs of Christian universalism are compatible with Christianity in general:
*[[God in Christianity|God]] is the loving Parent of all people, see [[Love of God]].
*[[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] reveals the nature and character of God and is the spiritual leader of humankind, see [[New Covenant]].
*Humankind is created with an [[immortal soul]] which death does not end—or a [[Christian mortalism|mortal soul]] that shall be resurrected and/or preserved by God—and which God will not wholly destroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/books/TheBibleHell.html |title=The Bible Hell |chapter=Destroy Soul and Body in Hell
|first=J.W. |last=Hanson |edition=4th |location=Boston |publisher=Universalist Publishing House |date=1888
}}: "The immortal soul is not meant, but the life. As though Jesus had said: 'Fear Not those who can only kill the body, but rather him, who if he chose could annihilate the whole being.'"&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Christian views on sin|Sin]] has negative consequences for the sinner either in this life or the [[afterlife]]. All of God's punishments for sin are corrective and remedial.

In 1899 the Universalist General Convention, later called the [[Universalist Church of America]], adopted the Five Principles: the belief in God, belief in Jesus Christ, the immortality of the human soul, that sinful actions have consequence, and [[universal reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/prof.html |title= Historic and Universalist Professions of Faith |at=sec. Five Principles of Faith |publisher=Auburn University |date= n.d.|accessdate=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] as a sixth point is found in the statement of faith adopted in 2007 by the [[Christian Universalist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianuniversalist.org/faq.html#faith |title=The Christian Universalist Association &gt; About Us / FAQ |publisher=Christianuniversalist.org |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Christian universalism, theosis— which can be translated as [[Apotheosis|divinization]] or the process of being made more God-like—means to be made more Christ-like, or that all souls will ultimately be reconciled and conformed to the image of the glorified resurrected Christ.

==Views on Hell==
Christian Universalists disagree on whether or not Hell exists. However, they do agree that if it does, the punishment there is corrective and remedial, and does not last forever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/univ2.html] Plain Guide to Universalism Chapter 2, Section III There are some Universalists who hold to punishment after death, nevertheless, we are glad to hail them as Universalists. They agree with us in our views of the great consummation, -- all punishment, in their view, is disciplinary, and they denounce punishment, either in this world or the next, having any other object, as cruel and unjust.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purgatorial Hell===
Purgatorial Universalism was the belief of some of the early church fathers such as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], and [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. It asserts that the unsaved will undergo hell, but that hell is remedial (neither everlasting nor purely retributive) according to key scriptures and that after purification or conversion all will enter Heaven.

Fourth-century Christian theologian and Bishop [[Diodorus of Tarsus]] wrote: "For the wicked there are punishments, not perpetual, however, lest the immortality prepared for them should be a disadvantage, but they are to be purified for a brief period according to the amount of malice in their works. They shall therefore suffer punishment for a short space, but immortal blessedness having no end awaits them…the penalties to be inflicted for their many and grave sins are very far surpassed by the magnitude of the mercy to be shown to them."&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Hanson, citing Assemani Bib. Orientalis, III, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eternal Hell in Christian history===
Christian Universalists assert that the doctrine of eternal Hell was not a part of Christ's teachings nor even the early church, and that it was added in.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, Jacob "How &amp; When The Idea of Eternal Torment Invaded Church Doctrine" [http://brazenchurch.com/how-hell-invaded-church-doctrine/#_edn2]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first clear mention of endless misery is to be found in a work from 155-165 CE by [[Tatian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatian's Address to the Greeks, chap. XIII. &amp; XIV.|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tatian-address.html|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early references to a Hell of infinite duration come from Latin church father [[Tertullian]] in the late 2nd and 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christianuniversalist.org/resources/articles/salvation-conspiracy/]''The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal'' "The first person to write about Eternal Hell was the Latin North African Tertullian"&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theologian [[Edward Beecher]] in the first four centuries there were six main theological schools and only one of them advocated the idea of eternal Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Beecher, "HISTORY OF OPINIONS ON THE SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE OF RETRIBUTION"[http://www.tentmaker.org/books/Retribution/retribution22.htm] "What, then, was the state of facts as to the leading theological schools of the Christian world, in the age of Origen, and some centuries after? It was, in brief, this: There were at least six theological schools in the Church at large. Of these six schools, one, and only one, was decidedly and earnestly in favor of the doctrine of future eternal punishment. One was in favor of the annihilation of the wicked. Two were in favor of the doctrine of universal restoration on the principles of Origen, and two in favor of universal restoration on the principles of Theodore of Mopsuestia."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origins of the idea of Hell as eternal====

Christian Universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion- an epoch of time), as giving rise to the idea of eternal Hell.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"&gt;[http://christianuniversalist.org/resources/articles/salvation-conspiracy/ The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/EternalPunishmentNotTrueToGreek.html "Eternal" Punishment (Matthew 25:46) Is NOT Found In The Greek New Testament.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://carm.org/look-word-aionion A look at the word "aionion"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ken Vincent writes "When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, 'aion' became 'aeternam' which means 'eternal."&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"/&gt; He also states that the first written record of the idea of an eternal Hell comes from Tertullian, who wrote in Latin.

The second major source of the idea of Hell as eternal was the 4th-century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. According to author Steve Gregg, it was Tertullian's writings, plus Augustine's views and writings on eternal Hell which "overwhelmed" the other views of a temporary Hell. First Augustine's views of Hell were accepted in the early Latin Church, out of which rose the Roman Catholic church. Up until [[The Reformation]] Augustine's view of Hell as eternal was not questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Steve. ''All You ever Wanted to Know about Hell'' p.130=131&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mistranslation of the Greek Word Aion====

About the word aion as having connotations of "eternal" or "temporal", the 19th century theologian [[Marvin Vincent]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aion, transliterated aeon, is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. Aristotle (peri ouranou, i. 9,15) says: "The period which includes the whole time of one's life is called the aeon of each one." Hence it often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one's life (aion) is said to leave him or to consume away (Iliad v. 685; Odyssey v. 160). It is not, however, limited to human life; it signifies any period in the course of events, as the period or age before Christ; the period of the millennium; the mythological period before the beginnings of history....&lt;br&gt;

The adjective aionios in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation, as, on the other hand, aidios, which means everlasting, has its meaning limited to a given point of time in Jude 6. Aionios means enduring through or pertaining to a period of time. Both the noun and the adjective are applied to limited periods....&lt;br&gt;

Words which are habitually applied to things temporal or material cannot carry in themselves the sense of endlessness. Even when applied to God, we are not forced to render aionios everlasting. Of course the life of God is endless; but the question is whether, in describing God as aionios, it was intended to describe the duration of his being, or whether some different and larger idea was not contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vincent|first=Marvin|title=Note on Olethron Aionion (eternal destruction)|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/vincent.html|work=Word Studies in the New Testament|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Arguments against the idea of eternal Hell====

Author Thomas Talbott states that if one believes in the idea of eternal Hell or that some souls will be destroyed, one must either let go of the idea that it is God's wish and desires to save all beings, or accept the idea that God wants to, but will not "successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter."&lt;ref&gt;Talbott, Thomas, "Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = &lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/heaven-hell/&gt;. "Theists who accept the traditional idea of everlasting punishment, or even the idea of an everlasting separation from God, must either reject the idea that God wills or desires to save all humans and thus desires to reconcile them all to himself (see proposition (1) in section 1 above) or reject the idea that God will successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter "&lt;/ref&gt;

Author David Burnfield defends the [http://www.patristicuniversalism.com postmortem view], that God continues to evangelize to people even after they die (1 Chron 16:34; Isa 9:2; Matt 12:32; Rom 8:35-39; Eph 4:8-9; 1 Pet 3:18-20; 4:6) The main problem with the traditional view – and one that has never been satisfactorily addressed – is how can one “accept Christ” if they have never heard of Christ, or were unable to understand the message (i.e. too young, mentally handicapped, etc.).

{{See also|Universal reconciliation#History|l1=History of Universal Reconciliation}}

According to the ''[[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge|New Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]]'' (1912), over the first five hundred years of Christian history there are records of at least six theological schools: Four of these schools were Universalist (one each in [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Caesarea]], and [[Edessa]]–[[Nisibis]]), one taught conditional immortality (in [[Ephesus]]), and the last taught eternal hell (in [[Carthage]] or [[Rome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|journal=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge|title=Christian Universalism| volume= 12|location=New York, London |publisher=Funk and Wagnalls Company| page=96|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc12.u.ii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universalist Church of America]], originally called the Universalist General Convention, emerged in the late 18th century from a mixture of [[Anabaptists]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], liberal [[Quakers]], and people influenced by [[Pietist]] movements such as [[Methodism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/history.html#earlymodern |title=The Christian Universalist Association &gt; History of Universalism |publisher=Christianuniversalist.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans from these religious backgrounds gradually created a new denominational tradition of Christian Universalism during the 19th century.  The Universalist Church of America grew to be the sixth largest denomination in the United States at its peak.

[[John Murray (minister)|John Murray]], who is called the "Father of American Universalism," was a disciple of the Welshman James Relly and promoted Relly's Universalist form of [[Methodism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/jamesrelly.html "James Reilly"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414165028/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/jamesrelly.html |date=2008-04-14 }}. UUA.org, [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/history.html#earlymodern "History: Early Modern"]. ChristianUniversalist.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a central figure in the founding of the Universalist Church of America in 1793.  He served as pastor of the Universalist Society of Boston and wrote many hymns.

Another important figure in early American Christian Universalism was [[George de Benneville]], a French [[Huguenot]] preacher and physician who was imprisoned for advocating Universalism and later emigrated to Pennsylvania where he continued preaching on the subject.  De Benneville was noted for his friendly and respectful relationship with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and his [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]] and multicultural view of spiritual truth which was well ahead of his time.  One of his most significant accomplishments was helping to produce the Sauer Bible, the first German language Bible printed in America.  In this Bible version, passages teaching universal reconciliation were marked in boldface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/georgedebenneville.html |title=George de Benneville |publisher=5-temp.uua.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144354/http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/georgedebenneville.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant early modern Christian Universalist leaders include [[Elhanan Winchester]], a Baptist preacher who wrote several books promoting the universal salvation of all souls after a period in [[purgatory]], who founded the first Universalist church in Philadelphia, and founded a church that ministered to [[African American]] slaves in South Carolina;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/elhananwinchester.html "Elhanan Winchester"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820004906/http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/elhananwinchester.html |date=2008-08-20 }}. UUA.org, [http://www.tentmaker.org/biographies/elhanan-winchester.htm "Biographies: Elehan Winchester"]. TentMaker.org.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hosea Ballou]], a Universalist preacher and writer in New England;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/hoseaballou.html |title=Hosea Ballou |publisher=5-temp.uua.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144518/http://www25-temp.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/hoseaballou.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hannah Whitall Smith]], a writer and evangelist from a Quaker background who was active in the [[Holiness movement]] as well as the [[women's suffrage]] and [[temperance movement|temperance]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/biographies/hannah-smith.htm |title=Hannah Whitall Smith |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate branch of Christian Universalism that arose in the early 20th century was the [[Primitive Baptist Universalists]], also called "No-Hellers."  They were a group of Baptists in the central and southern Appalachian Mountain region of the United States that taught universal reconciliation and, like [[Hosea Ballou]], embraced the "Ultra-Universalist" position that there is no literal hell beyond earth.&lt;ref name=CUHist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/history.html#recent |title=The Christian Universalist Association &gt; History of Universalism |publisher=Christianuniversalist.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unity School of Christianity]], founded in 1889 by [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles]] and [[Myrtle Fillmore]], has taught some Universalist beliefs such as God's total goodness, the divine nature of human beings, and the rejection of the traditional Christian belief that God condemns people to hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unityonline.org/aboutunity/whoWeAre/faq.html#teachings |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Unity |publisher=Unityonline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universalist Church of America gradually declined in the early to mid 20th century and merged with the [[American Unitarian Association]] in 1961, creating the modern-day [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], which does not officially subscribe to exclusively Christian theology. Christian Universalism largely passed into obscurity for the next few decades with the end of the Universalist Church as a separate denomination.  However, the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] remains as an organization for Christians from the Unitarian Universalist tradition and liberal Christians interested in [[Unitarianism]] and Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uuchristian.org/S_Who.html |title=Who Are The UU Christians? |publisher=Uuchristian.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004141928/http://www.uuchristian.org/S_Who.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians from a [[Pentecostal]] background who were involved in the [[Latter Rain (post-World War II movement)|Latter Rain Movement]] of the 1940s and 1950s came to believe in the ideas of Christian Universalism on their own, separately from the Universalist Church tradition.  They emphasized the teachings of universal reconciliation and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]].  These ideas were spread primarily through newsletters and traveling evangelists from the 1950s to 1980s, and were not typically identified by the term "Universalism."  The only significant organization representing these beliefs that emerged within the [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic tradition]] was the Home Missions Church, a loosely organized network of ministers and house churches founded in 1944.

==Universal reconciliation in the Testament and pre-modern Christianity==
{{Main|Universal reconciliation}}

== Modern types ==
There are three general types of Christian Universalism today – Evangelical Universalism, Charismatic Universalism, and Liberal Christian Universalism – which by themselves or in combination with one another describe the vast majority of currently existing and identifiable versions of Christian Universalist belief and practice.

===Evangelical Universalism===
The type of Christian Universalism that departs the least from orthodox or traditional Christian doctrine is Evangelical (Christian) Universalism, also called Biblical or [[Trinitarian Universalism]].  Evangelical Universalists hold to conservative positions on most theological or doctrinal issues except for the doctrine of [[hell]], in which case they assert [[universal reconciliation]] instead of eternal torment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasonclark.church/blogs/2008/02/evangelical-universalism-oxymoron/ "Evangelical Universalism – Oxymoron"]. JasonClark.church February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to emphasize the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Jesus Christ for the sins of all humanity as the basis for their Universalism.

In 2006 a mainstream evangelical writer, revealed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robin |last=Parry |url=http://theologicalscribbles.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-am-evangelical-universalist.html |title=Theological Scribbles: I am the Evangelical Universalist |publisher=Theologicalscribbles.blogspot.com |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Robin Parry]] in 2009, under the pseudonym of "Gregory MacDonald" (taken from the names, [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and [[George MacDonald]]) released a book ''The Evangelical Universalist''.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;MacDonald, Gregory (a pseudonym). ''The Evangelical Universalist.'' 2006. {{ISBN|1-59752-365-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 this inspired the creation of a forum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evangelicaluniversalist.com/ |title=Forum |publisher=Evangelicaluniversalist.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring "Gregory MacDonald" and [[Thomas Talbott]], to discuss Evangelical Universalism and related topics. Evangelical Universalists derive a large part of their beliefs from [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Reformed theology]].  Many of them come from an Evangelical Christian background, but they may or may not identify with this movement and seek to remain with it.

Some Evangelical Universalists avoid using the word "Universalism" to describe their beliefs, perhaps because of the negative connotations of this word among conservative Christians. Alternative terms that are in use among Evangelical Universalists include the "Larger Hope" or "Blessed Hope" and the "Victorious Gospel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/feuds/feuds_index.html |title=Tentmaker Ministries battles for the Victorious Gospel of Jesus Christ|first= Gary |last=Amirault|publisher= Tentmaker Ministries |work=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charismatic Universalism===
Some Christians with a background in the [[Charismatic movement]] or [[Pentecostalism]] have developed a version of Universalism which could be called Charismatic (Christian) Universalism.  Charismatic Universalists usually do not call their theology "Universalism" but commonly refer to their specific beliefs by the terms "Reconciliation" (shorthand for universal reconciliation, the doctrine of [[apocatastasis]]) and "Sonship" (shorthand for "Manifest Sonship" which is a variant of the doctrine of [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingdombiblestudies.org/Revelation/rev33.htm "From The Candlestick to the Throne, Part 33, The Church in Ephesus" (section "I Will Remove Your Candlestick")]. Author refers to "the teaching or doctrine of reconciliation, sonship and the kingdom".&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "[[Feast of Tabernacles]]" is used by some Charismatic Universalists as a term for their post-Pentecostal spiritual tradition, reflecting a symbolic interpretation of this Jewish festival as an entrance into a fuller knowledge and relationship with God and understanding of God's plan for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gods-kingdom-ministries.org/COLDFUSION/Chapter.cfm?CID=237 "Chapter 7 The Feast of Tabernacles"]. gods-kingdom-ministries.org, and [http://toseekthelight.blogspot.com/2007/12/coming-into-light-part-1.html "Coming into Light prt 1"]. ToSeekTheLight blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charismatic Universalism is marked by its emphasis on theosis; the idea that the [[return of Christ]] is a body of perfected human beings who are the "Manifested Sons of God" instead of a literal return of the person of Jesus;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hearingthetruthofgod.com/id69.html "ID69"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719083646/http://www.hearingthetruthofgod.com/id69.html |date=2008-07-19 }} and [http://www.hearingthetruthofgod.com/id349.html "ID349"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509073941/http://hearingthetruthofgod.com/id349.html |date=2008-05-09 }}. HearingtheTruthofGod.com.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that these Sons will reign on the earth and transform all other human beings from sin to perfection during an age that is coming soon (a version of [[millennialism]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hearingthetruthofgod.com/id269.html "ID269"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509071504/http://hearingthetruthofgod.com/id269.html |date=2008-05-09 }} HearingtheTruthofGod.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and the absolute sovereignty of God, the nonexistence or severe limitation of human [[free will]], and the inevitable triumph of God's plan of universal reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/savior-of-the-world/FreeMoralAgent-Eby.html "Free Moral Agent-Eby"], Tentmaker.org, and [http://www.hearingthetruthofgod.com/id116.html "ID116"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509064944/http://hearingthetruthofgod.com/id116.html |date=2008-05-09 }}. HearingTheTruthOfGod.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Some see similarities to the teachings of [[Remonstrants|Jacob Arminius]], a Dutch theologian who tried to modify [[John Calvin]]'s teachings about [[predestination]].

Many Charismatic Universalists meet in [[house churches]] or do not belong to a church at all.  Most of the evidence of Universalism existing as a school of thought within the Charismatic movement is found in a large number of internet-based ministries that are informally networked with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sigler.org/kingdom/page1.html |title=is one of the largest collections of links to Charismatic Universalist websites, ministries, house churches and groups |publisher=Sigler.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal Christian Universalism===
[[Liberal Christian]] Universalists include some members of [[mainline Protestant]] denominations, some people influenced by the [[New Age]] and [[New Thought]] movements, some people in the [[emerging church]] movement, some [[Unitarian Universalists]] who continue to follow Jesus as their primary spiritual teacher, and some Christians from other religious backgrounds who may or may not attend church.

Liberal Christian Universalism emphasizes the all-inclusive love of God and tends to be more open to finding truth and value in non-Christian spiritual traditions compared to the attitude of other forms of Christian Universalism, while remaining generally Christ-centered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savioroftheworld.net/nonchristian.htm Non-Christian]. SaviorOfTheWOrld.net. Example of this view.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to Evangelical Universalism, Liberal Christian Universalism views the Bible as an imperfect human document containing divine revelations, is not necessarily Trinitarian, and often downplays or rejects blood atonement theology in its view of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/deityofchrist.html "Deity of Christ"], [http://www.universalist-herald.net/Theology.html "(section "Christian Universalism 'Endorsed' by Jesus Seminar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093547/http://www.universalist-herald.net/Theology.html |date=2008-05-09 }}, and [http://www.newbeginningministries.com/articles/metaphysical_bible.html "Metaphysical Bible"], NewBeginningMinistries.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Liberal Christian Universalists believe in [[Christian mysticism|mystical]] philosophies such as [[panentheism]] and [[process theology]], [[Gnostic]] or [[New Age]] ideas such as the [[preexistence]] and [[reincarnation]] of the soul,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newbeginningministries.com/articles/Oneness_True_Spiritual_Life.html Oneness True Spiritual Life"], [http://www.savioroftheworld.net/conclusion.htm "Conclusion"]  and [http://www.savioroftheworld.net/reincarnation.htm "Reincarnation"].

The [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] is an organization for Liberal Christian Universalists, especially those who belong to the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]. The [[Liberal Catholic Church]], the [[Catholic Universalist Church]] and the [[Unity Church]] are liberal Christian denominations which teach some Universalist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~LiberalCatholic/tenets.htm |title=See especially the section entitled "The Liberal Catholic Act of Faith" |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.ca/cr-Unity.htm "Unity"].

=== Hybrid types ===
{{Original research|section|date=March 2010}}
Former Pentecostal Bishop [[Carlton Pearson]]'s "Gospel of Inclusion" appears to be a hybrid between Charismatic and Liberal Christian Universalism. He is now a minister in the [[United Church of Christ]], a liberal Christian denomination, but continues to believe in some ideas and practices of Pentecostal or Charismatic forms of Christianity.  Pearson has also incorporated some New Age and New Thought teachings into his message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntmo.org/?content=pearson.php?PHPSESSID=0f1e95c29d11ac1558ac58469d358842 |title=New Thought Ministries of Oregon – NTMO.org Homepage |publisher=Ntmo.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian McLaren]] is a Christian leader in the emerging church movement who is sympathetic to the idea of Universalism but does not embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://blog.christianitytoday.com/outofur/archives/2006/05/brian_mclarens.html "Brian's rejection that he is a Universalist"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808045453/http://blog.christianitytoday.com/outofur/archives/2006/05/brian_mclarens.html |date=2009-08-08 }}.

A number of ministers and evangelists connected with Restoration Nation conferences are Universalists who draw from both the Evangelical and Charismatic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restoration-nation.tv "Videos of many conference speakers"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Indian Hills Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heavenly Faith denomination, which is a [[Restorationist]] sect that blends [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Methodism]], and [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismaticism]], openly embraces Universalism, even going so far as to say that all Creation, including those individuations of it which are currently enemies of the [[Christian Church|Church]], will eventually be saved. However, it maintains a traditional [[eschatology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theheavenlyfaith.wix.com/heavenly-faith Heavenly Faith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220040256/http://theheavenlyfaith.wix.com/heavenly-faith |date=2013-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian Universalist Association]] is putting forth a message which seeks common ground among all major contemporary types of Christian Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/movement.html |title=The Christian Universalist Association &gt; A Unique Spiritual Movement |publisher=ChristianUniversalist.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Proponents of Christian Universalism===

The conversion of Bishop [[Carlton Pearson]] to a form of Universalism and his subsequent excommunication by the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops in 2004 caused Christian Universalism to gain increased media attention because of Pearson's popularity and celebrity status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |url=http://www.washtimes.com/news/2004/apr/20/20040420-104557-5370r/ |work=Washington Times|title= 'Inclusionism' deemed heresy |publisher=WashTimes.com |date=2004-04-20 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Eric Stetson and Kalen Fristad gathered a group of thirteen ministers and evangelists from several denominations to found the [[Christian Universalist Association]], an [[interdenominational]] organization for churches, ministries, and individuals who believe in Christian Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianuniversalist.org/events/foundingmeeting.html |title=The Christian Universalist Association &gt; Special Events &gt; Founding Board Meeting |publisher=ChristianUniversalist.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
About the current state of Christian Universalism, they state: 
"Many Christian philosophers, theologians, writers, and scholars are coming to believe in a Universalist interpretation of Christianity. A rapidly growing number of books are being published on the subject of Christian Universalism. Hundreds of Christian Universalist websites have exploded across the internet over the past few years, run by people with a wide variety of religious backgrounds and viewpoints. It appears that Universalism is beginning to develop into one of the most significant ecumenical movements among Christians of our time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://christianuniversalist.org/resources/articles/history-of-universalism-part-2/ The History of Universalism (Part Two)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disagreements===
There are many religious issues on which Christian Universalists disagree with each other, depending on their theological background and denominational tradition.  Some examples include:

*A wide range of ways of understanding the Bible, such as [[Biblical inerrancy]], [[Biblical infallibility]], [[Biblical criticism]] and [[higher criticism]], also various views of the [[Biblical canon]] and [[apocryphal]] texts.
*Whether God's oneness is best described by the orthodox Christian concept of [[Trinity]] or in some other way, such as classical [[unitarianism]], [[Socinianism]], [[modalism]], etc.
*Whether Jesus Christ will literally return at some future time to consummate his reign on Earth ([[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|futurism]] and [[millennialism]]), or only returns metaphorically in the present or future, or whether these prophecies were fulfilled in ancient times and we now live during the Messianic Age ([[preterism]]).
*The specific nature of the afterlife (literal versus metaphoric [[heaven]] and [[hell]], [[purgatory]], [[reincarnation]], other ideas).
*Whether the shed blood of Christ on the cross is a literal [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for the sins of the world or whether this is metaphorical, and what the atonement accomplished – [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction]] (Roman Catholic view), [[John Calvin]]'s [[penal substitution]] (Reformed and common evangelical view), [[Hugo Grotius]]' [[atonement (governmental view)|moral government]] (classical Arminian and Methodist view), [[Gustaf Aulen]]'s [[Christus Victor]] (Eastern Orthodox view, commonly held by Anabaptists), or [[Peter Abelard]]'s [[atonement (moral influence view)|moral influence]] (modernist-liberal theological view), etc.
*Whether non-Christians can be saved in Christ ([[inclusivism]]), whether salvation in Christ is even necessary for all people ([[Religious pluralism|pluralism]]), or whether salvation occurs only after profession of belief in the Lordship of Jesus Christ ([[exclusivism]]).
*Whether Christian Universalists should attend denominational churches in the hope of converting them, or should start their own new churches, or should leave the organized church entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evangelicaluniversalist.blogspot.com/2008/05/should-we-form-universalist.html "Should we Form Universalist"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/faq.html#organization "FAQ: Organization"] offer two very different views on this subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

'''De La Salle College''' in [[Jersey]] is an independent [[Catholic school|Roman Catholic school]] taking its name from [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle|St. John Baptist de La Salle]] (1651–1719), who founded the [[De La Salle Brothers]] in France.

==History==
[[File:De La Salle College Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|De La Salle College]]
De La Salle College takes its name from St. John Baptist de La Salle (1651–1719), who founded the Brothers' Order in the time of [[Louis XIV]]. Today the Order has establishments in over 80 countries.

A few Brothers settled in Jersey at the time of the [[French Revolution]] and remained in the Island for several years. Then, from 1866 to 1896, a school of up to 300 pupils run by the Brothers' flourished in St. Thomas's Parish. The Brothers left the Island in 1896, but were invited to return in 1917 to found another school.

The school was established at Berry House next to St. Thomas's Church in [[Saint Helier|St. Helier]] and was initially known as St. Aloysius College. Within a year the main site of the school was moved to a property known as "The Beeches" on Wellington Hill in the parish of [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|St. Saviour]]. It was at this point that the name De La Salle College was first given to the school.

Under the direction of Brother Edward, the first and longest-serving Headmaster (33 years), the school grew significantly in numbers. On opening day, 1&amp;nbsp;October 1917, there were just a dozen pupils. By the start of the following year the number had increased to 57 and reached 100 by 1921. In 1933 enrollment topped the 200 mark and a school holiday was given to mark the occasion.

The transfer of the school from the French Province in [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]] to the Province of [[London]] in 1948 marked a distinct change in the fortunes of the school. By 1949 no fewer than 470 pupils were attending the school. New buildings were planned and erected in the mid-1950s. Many past pupils testify to the tremendous spirit in the school even at times when it lacked buildings and facilities. Without this spirit it is difficult to appreciate how the school could have survived.

Two significant factors have helped ensure that the school has a bright future well into the next century. The first was the introduction of the Covenant Scheme. Begun in the mid-1960s, it led initially to the opening of the swimming pool and gymnasium and then to a period of rapid expansion. The 6th Form Block, Science Building, C.D.T. workshops, Art Rooms and the Computer Room were completed in quick succession. Secondly, in 1976, the [[States of Jersey]] agreed to provide the school with generous financial assistance in the form of a capitation grant for running costs.

The 6th Form Block, Science Labs and I.T. facilities, Art Rooms, C.D.T. workshops and Drawing office, a new Infant School, six new classrooms for secondary and a new Junior School were all completed thanks to the help provided through the Covenant Scheme.

A “new age” began in the late 1990s when negotiations began with the States of Jersey for capital funding and the building of 8 new classrooms and a library and resources area began in January 2003.

Though there is no longer a Brothers’ Community in Jersey, the school retains close links with the Brothers who are Trustees of the College.

'''Ehsan Jami''' (born April 20, 1985) is an Iranian-born [[Iranian-Dutch]] [[politician]]. From March 7, 2006 until November 6, 2007 he was member of the [[city council]] of [[Leidschendam-Voorburg]] on behalf of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Dutch Labour Party]] (PvdA). From that date until 2010 he continued to be a member of the city council as independent member 'fraction Jami'. In 2007 he was one of the two founders of the former [[Central Committee for Ex-Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2426314.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Young Muslims begin dangerous fight for the right to abandon faith | first=David | last=Charter | date=2007-09-11 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jami was born on April 20, 1985 in [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]] and was raised there. His father is a [[Physician|doctor]]. His mother converted, later in her life, to [[Christianity]]. As son of a doctor, Jami enjoyed substantial privileges in [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran]]. In an interview, Jami stated: "My grandparents were Muslim, but my father was non-religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.voorburg.pvda.nl/download.do/id/100026941/cd/true/ Ehsan Jami: “I'm a social democrat to the bone”], De Rode Reiger, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in a different interview, he described his father as Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.trouw.nl/deverdieping/dossiers/article735774.ece "I don't want evolution, I want revolution"], Dagblad Trouw, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Political engagement by Jami's father forced the family to leave the country. Together with his parents and his older sister, the then nine-year-old Jami arrived in the Netherlands in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.ehsanjami.pvda.nl/renderer.do/clearState/true/menuId/393001/returnPage/393076/ Wie is Ehsan?]. ''www.pvda.nl''. Retrieved August 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; later obtaining [[Dutch nationality law|Dutch nationality]].

==Career==
Jami studied Management Science for one and a half year in the Netherlands and joined the [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour party]] as member in 2003. He was elected to the city council of [[Leidschendam-Voorburg]] in the local elections of March 2006.

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Jami started reading the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]], after which he decided he didn't identify with either. Jami criticized [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], describing him as a "criminal".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel.asp?artnr=158085 Labour party Ex-Muslim: "Muhammad was a criminal"]  Elsevier, 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Loubna Berrada (founder of the Advisory Committee for Integration, part of the [[right-wing]] [[VVD|Liberal party]]), Jami founded the [[Central Committee for Ex-Muslims]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.spitsnet.nl/nieuws.php/1/3259/online Ehsan Jami fights for freedom of religion], Sp!ts, 6 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation, supported by [[Afshin Ellian]], aims to support [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates of Islam]]. Berrada left the committee shortly after it was founded because she felt Jami challenged Islam itself too much, saying: "I don't wish to confront Islam itself. I only want to spread the message that Muslims should be allowed to leave Islam behind without being threatened".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/71475/Oprichtster-stapt-voorlopig-uit-comit%C3%A9-ex-moslims.html Founder leaves committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214144858/http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/71475/Oprichtster-stapt-voorlopig-uit-comit%C3%A9-ex-moslims.html |date=December 14, 2008 }}, De Pers, 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 2007, Jami was attacked in his hometown [[Voorburg]] by three men. The attack is widely believed to be linked to his activities for the committee. The national anti-terrorism coordinator's office, the public prosecution department and the police decided during a meeting on 6 August that "additional measures" were necessary for the protection of Jami who has subsequently received extra security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&amp;story_id=42621 Extra security for Ehsan Jami], Expatica.com,  7 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, he penned an op-ed together with PVV politician [[Geert Wilders]] for the Dutch daily [[Volkskrant]], likening the threat of Islam to the rise of Adolf Hitler's National Socialism in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jami writes opinion piece with Wilders | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&amp;story_id=44322 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a response to National Antiterrorism Coordinator [[Tjibbe Joustra]]'s remarks in ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'', who criticized the tone used by some people in the discussion about Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Concern about anti-Islam comments | url = http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=1&amp;story_id=44186 | publisher = Expatica | date = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2007, Jami announced that he was working on a film project due to be released in February 2008 which he felt could be comparable in terms of controversy to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Yoeri Albrecht en Joost Eerdmans in een spraakmakend gesprek met Ehsan Jami | url = http://www.hetgesprek.nl/archief/17/ | publisher = Het Gesprek | date = 2007-10-04|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2008 he cancelled this project after being urged to do so by [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Dutch Minister of Justice]] [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin]] and threats from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article521586.ece/Jami_ziet_af_van_animatiefilm_tegen_islam&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after months of deliberation, Jami again decided to release the film. The short film was released on 9 December 2008. The announcement was followed by calls from European Islamic organizations for boycott of Dutch products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Boycot Nederlandse producten om film Jami'  | url = http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/nederland/article1909934.ece/_Boycot_Nederlandse_producten_om_film_Jami_.html | publisher = de Verdieping Trouw | date = 2008-11-26|language=nl}}. Translated by [http://islamineurope.blogspot.com/2008/11/netherlands-new-mohammad-movie.html Islam in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch Premier Jan Peter Balkenende issued an apology for Jami's film.

After expressing strong opinions against [[Islam]], strong criticism of the PvdA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2007/08/jami_attacks_labour_leader.php|title=Jami attacks Labour leader - DutchNews.nl|date=17 August 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comparing the Islamic Prophet Muhammad with [[Adolf Hitler]], he was asked to give up his council membership as part of the PvdA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2007/10/exmuslim_jami_asked_to_quit_co.php Ex-Muslim Jami asked to quit council seat]&lt;/ref&gt; By refusing to resign and continuing as an independent member, he lost his membership of PvdA.

Jami was allegedly cited in the writings of [[Anders Behring Breivik]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/07/norway_shooter_made_many_refer_1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Co-founder Berrada quit the committee in June 2007 because she felt Jami acts too aggressively towards the entire religion of Islam, stating: "I don't wish to confront Islam itself. I only want to spread the message that Muslims should be allowed to leave Islam behind without being threatened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depers.nl:80/binnenland/71475/Oprichtster-stapt-voorlopig-uit-comit%C3%A9-ex-moslims.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214144858/http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/71475/Oprichtster-stapt-voorlopig-uit-comit%C3%A9-ex-moslims.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 December 2008|title=Oprichtster stapt voorlopig uit comité ex-moslims - zondag 14 december 2008 - DePers.nl|date=14 December 2008|publisher=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eurydice''''' is a 2003 play by [[Sarah Ruhl]] which retells the myth of [[Orpheus]] from the perspective of [[Eurydice]], his wife. The story focuses on Eurydice's choice to return to earth with Orpheus or to stay in the underworld with her father (a character created by Ruhl). Ruhl made several changes to the original myth's story-line. The most noticeable of these changes was that in the myth Orpheus succumbs to his desires and looks back at Eurydice, while in Ruhl's version Eurydice calls out to Orpheus (causing him to look back) perhaps in part because of her fear of reentering the world of the living and perhaps as a result of her desire to remain in the land of the dead with her father.  Ruhl's script has been explicitly written so as to be a playground for the designer of the sets.

==Plot==

[[File:Eurydice Ruhl Shimer College reading King Lear.jpg|thumb|Eurydice's father reads to her from ''King Lear'' in a [[Shimer College]] production of ''Eurydice''.]]
The play consists of three movements, divided into numerous scenes: 7 in the first movement, 20 in the second movement, and 3 in the third movement.

The play begins with Eurydice and Orpheus, two young lovers, who are about to get married.  In the Underworld, Eurydice's dead father has managed to preserve his memory and his ability to read and write, and tries to send her letters.  During the wedding, Eurydice goes outside to get a drink of water and she meets a man (the "Nasty Interesting Man") who tells her he has a letter from her father. Eurydice decides to go to his apartment to retrieve the letter, but as she leaves his apartment after resisting the man's attempts to seduce her, she trips and falls to her death on the stairs.

At the beginning of the second movement, there is no set change, but "the movement to the underworld is marked by the entrance of stones":{{sfn|Ruhl|2006|p=357}} Little Stone, Big Stone, and Loud Stone, who serve as a [[Greek chorus|chorus]].

Eurydice enters the Underworld through an elevator, inside which it is raining.  Upon arrival, she meets her father, who tries to reteach Eurydice about her past since she has lost her memory after being dipped in the river [[Lethe]]. The Stones try unsuccessfully to stop them, because the dead are not allowed to remember their past or speak in human language. Rooms are also not allowed in the Underworld, but Eurydice's father creates one for her out of pieces of string. He gradually re-teaches her human language and her past.  While the father is away at work, the Lord of the Underworld enters as a child riding a tricycle and attempts to seduce Eurydice, but fails.

Meanwhile, in the land of the living, Orpheus writes a letter to Eurydice, which her father delivers and reads to her. Orpheus also sends her a copy of the ''[[Complete Works of Shakespeare]]'' by attaching it to a piece of string, and Eurydice's father reads to her from ''King Lear''. Orpheus sends another letter, and then resolves to go to the Underworld himself to find her.

In the third movement, Orpheus arrives at the gates of the Underworld, singing a song so powerful it makes the Stones weep.  The Lord of the Underworld tells him that he may take Eurydice back, but only if he does not turn around to look at her.  Eurydice is then faced with the decision to either stay with her father or go back with her husband.  At her father's insistence, she follows Orpheus.  But as she catches up to him, she calls out his name, and he turns to look at her, causing her to die a second death.  Meanwhile, her father has decided that he wants to forget everything, and dips himself in the river again.  When Eurydice returns, her father is lying silent on the ground, having lost all of his language and memory forever.

As Eurydice mourns her father, the Lord of the Underworld returns, having grown from a child to superhuman height.  He orders her to be his bride. Eurydice pens a letter to Orpheus and his next wife, then immerses herself in the river and lies down in forgetfulness. Finally, Orpheus too enters from the elevator, having truly died this time. He finds Eurydice's letter to him, but because he has been dipped in the river, he cannot read it.

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==

The figure in the foreground suggests victory, potency,and ample preparation or confidence. 
Also suggests unwilling or unnecessary contributions from losing parties .  This card also is the "defeat card" in the deck. The ragged-looking and "torn-asunder" sky implies a frayed, shabby, and jagged celestial plane.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This card can represent dangerous overconfidence, and in its reversed form indicates a seeming-triumph which will be ultimately calamitous.

A '''Holy Lie''' is a philosophical concept coined by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his note manuscript [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|''The Will to Power'']]. It is also mentioned in another of Nietzsche's books, [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Antichrist'']].

== Sources ==
The idea of a holy lie is seen in part one of the second book of "The Will to Power," which consists of two critiques. The two critiques are "the critique of religion" and "the critique of morality" respectively.

== Concept ==
A holy lie, according to Friedrich Nietzsche, is the means by which priests and philosophers obtain the piety of their audiences.&lt;ref name="Der wille"/&gt;{{quote|The means he employs are as follows: he alone is all knowing; he alone is virtuous......|The Will to Power, Book 2, Part 1, Note 139|source=}}

Nietzsche argues that the purpose of human action is altered by the holy lie since the original moral standards of the general public is influenced by the moral standards preached by the priests and philosophers. Consequently, the human faculty of moral judgment based on the "beneficial" versus the "harmful" is in dysfunction. People who accept the holy lie do not evaluate the fairness of a thing by what Nietzsche calls "The natural notion". Instead, the notions, standards and doctrines preached by the preachers(priests and philosophers) substitutes the natural notion.&lt;ref name="Der wille"&gt;The Will to Power. Page 94-96. Penguin Classics&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In this way, a conception of ''good'' and ''evil'' is created which appears to be entirely detached from the natural notions......In this way, the famous notion of "Conscience" is finally created. An inner voice which does not evaluate an act by its consequences, but by its intention and conformity of that intention to the "Law".|The Will to Power, Book 2, Part 1, Note 141|source=}}

In his book ''The Antichrist'', Nietzsche further explains his idea with an example of [[Paul the Apostle]] and the downfall of the [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Antichrist.Note 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irreligion in Mozambique''' is not uncommon among Mozambicans largely in part due to past government suppression of religion. Though [[Christianity]] predominates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Maputo Journal: In Marx's Garden: Atheism Wilts, Faith Blooms|publisher= [[The New York Times]]|date=|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/10/world/maputo-journal-in-marx-s-garden-atheism-wilts-faith-blooms.html|accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to census results 19% of the country do not identify with a religion.

The '''Jewish Community Watch''' is a Jewish organization dedicated to the prevention of [[child sexual abuse]] (CSA) within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community. Originally based in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], the organization has been noted for its controversial&lt;ref name=tabletmag1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Questions and Answers with reporters|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/q-a-with-times-reporters-about-abuse-in-ultra-orthodox-jewish-communities/|accessdate=19 August 2015|work=New York Times|date=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''wall of shame''' where it publicizing the names of people it considers suspected abusers by posting their names and alleged activities on the organization's website.

==Founding==
The founder of JCW, Meyer Seewald, is a [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] resident who, along with his brother Schneur Seewald, started the Jewish Community Watch in Crown Heights to investigate and exposes orthodox Jewish community members suspected of [[child sexual abuse]] (CSA).&lt;ref name=seewaldreturns/&gt;&lt;ref name="Details about Seewald"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meyer Seewald was born in 1988 to a Lubavitch family in Crown Heights.|url=http://mosrimwatch.com/meyer-seewald.html|website=Mosrimwatch.com|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Meyer Seewald was born in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] to Tzvi and Fayge Seewald, who became religious and belong to the Chabad-Lubavitch community in Crown Heights.&lt;ref name="Details about Seewald" /&gt;

Seewald first became involved in anti-abuse work after two of his friends confided in him that they were abused by a local man who had organized youth programs in the community.&lt;ref name=tabletmag1/&gt; Seewald later published his own recollections of being victimized at an overnight summer camp by his counselor.&lt;ref name="Details about Seewald" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tabletmag1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=32005 Abuse org to hold event]. ''COLlive.com''. Accessed Sep 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 Seewald became engaged to Raizel Kahn from Florida.&lt;ref name="Collive Seewald Engaged"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ceitlin|first1=Yehuda|title=Mazel Tov|url=http://www.collive.com/mt_show.rtx?id=9192|website=Collive.com|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Chaim|url=http://www.shturem.org/index.php?section=congrats&amp;id=20461|website=Shturem.org|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Engagement|url=http://www.shmais.com/chabad-news/latest/mazeltov/item/meyer-seewald-crown-heights-to-raizel-kahn-bay-harbor-islands-fl|website=Shmais.com|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and recognition===
On December 12, 2012, the Brooklyn District Attorney, [[Charles J. Hynes|Charles Hynes]], presented an award of excellence to Seewald for; "tireless service and dedication to the community," in exposing Jewish Sexual Predators.&lt;ref name="Algemeiner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliyahu-federman/brooklyn-da-awards-jewish_b_2289448.html |title= Brooklyn DA Awards Jewish Organization That Exposes Sexual Predators | work = [[Huffingtonpost]] |date= December 13, 2012 |accessdate= April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crownheights.info"/&gt;

== Activities and initiatives ==

==="Wall of Shame"===
Sharon Otterman and Ray Rivera, in the New York Times stated that Jewish Community watch is one amongst several blogs and web sites publishing photos of people accused as molesters. They state that although this is a risky move legally - the sources believe it is justified by the need to warn the community, particularly given that the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has a policy of not publicizing arrests or indictments in such cases.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The [[Tablet Magazine]] Noted that Seewald claims to have a database of 225 suspected offenders. JCW’s Wall of Shame posted 36 people accused of abuse. 21 of the 36 have been arrested and charged. According to Seewald, a person is added when the board has determined there is sufficient evidence. When a victim is unwilling—or unable due to the statute of limitations—to press charges; Seewald conducts his own investigation; selectively exposing alleged abusers on his Wall of Shame.&lt;ref name="tabletmag1"&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/138918/jewish-community-watch "Watching the Jewish Community Watch and Its 'Wall of Shame:' A young man’s brazen blog about alleged child sex-abusers in the Chabad community divides Crown Heights."] ''Tablet Magazine''. July 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Jewish Journal]]'' discussed the wall of shame similar to the tablet and reported that JCW says that its review process  includes "personal interviews with multiple alleged victims and what appears to be a thorough investigation process" and that "JCW will only post a suspect if its board unanimously agrees that the person is a child predator". It concludes that "neither Seewald nor JCW has ever been sued for libel or defamation regarding its publicizing of accused abusers".&lt;ref name="jewishjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sichel |first=Jared |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/childhood_abuse_victims_name_alleged_abuser |title=Childhood abuse victims name alleged abuser &amp;#124; Los Angeles |publisher=Jewish Journal |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wall of Shame controversies====
The [[Tablet Magazine|Tablet]] points out that while Seewald says that molesters are more afraid of the Wall of Shame, than going to jail, - his "Wall of Shame has also proved to be deeply problematic, used irresponsibly, and it can easily undermine the organization's objectives and destroy an innocent person’s life." Ben Hirsch, a co-founder of Survivors for Justice, an organization that advocates and educates on issues of child safety, says that Seewald is on a dangerous track. Noting that by setting up a separate registry  and justice system [from law enforcement agencies], it perpetuates the same message of the rabbis that "we can deal with this issue in-house". The message must instead be that the only way to deal with child sex abuse, is to report it directly to the police.&lt;ref name=tabletmag1 /&gt;

=====Man removed after charges dropped=====
The [[Tablet Magazine|Tablet]] notes a case where the wall of shame posted a special-education teacher who was accused of abuse by an autistic boy he tutored. After being arrested and charged by the Brooklyn District Attorney, the investigation was dropped when the child retracted his claim. The teacher wrote that Seewald confronted him at his house “rather aggressively,” and demanded he confess to molesting the child. This individual was placed on the Wall of Shame, in an effort to warn the community of the potential harm.  When the case was dismissed, JCW removed the teacher from the Wall. The exposure,  he says, destroyed his career and social standing. He wrote that “In people’s eyes I was no longer a Jew, let alone a human being, ... I was regarded as a monster, an out-of-control, filthy, dangerous beast; capable of snatching little children and sexually abusing them.” Soon after, Seewald removed his name and picture from the blog, citing that there was insufficient evidence against him. The teacher said that because forgiveness is in his nature, he removed his article criticizing JCW and replaced it with one praising Seewald’s work, blaming the student who falsely accused him rather than JCW. The tablet concluded that JCW’s credibility never fully recovered from the debacle.&lt;ref name=tabletmag1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabadinfo.com/?url=article_en&amp;id=31001 |title=News &amp;#124; Yes, Publish Abusers Name ● Opinion |publisher=Chabad.Info |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Teacher wrote about his case which was published on local blogs.&lt;ref name="Innocent Man on Wall of Shame"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Victim's Plea|url=http://mosrimwatch.com/a-victims-plea.html|website=Mosrimwatch.com|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JCW officially responded to this case in a letter to the teacher "Daniel G.". JCW commented that; "[individuals] who have been arrested and charged with crimes relating to child sexual abuse [will be exposed]. When an individual is charged, the charges and arrest are available on the public record and the community should be notified... Considering Jewish Community Watch was not involved with the investigation, he was immediately removed from the site and a further update was published regarding the dropped charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www1.chabad.info/?url=article_en&amp;id=30592 |title= JCW Responds: Halacha, On Our Side | work = chabad.info |date= April 4, 2013 |accessdate= April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project E.M.E.S.===

JCW initiated project E.M.E.S. to warn counselors against abusing campers. ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' noted that because only two camps signed up for the program, Seewald created a video warning all camp staff members that his organization would not tolerate abuse. The video received 16,000 hits in three days.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://forward.com/articles/179392/would-be-jewish-camp-molesters-get-video-warning/ Would-Be Jewish Camp Molesters Get Video Warning]."

===Public events===
The JCW has organized a number of public events dedicated toward addressing the issues of sexual abuse in the Orthodox Jewish community. At one event in Crown Heights, speakers included community rabbis, activists, therapists, former victims, and Brooklyn's District Attorney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=32019 "Hundreds at Event Against Abuse."] ''COLlive.com''.

Its efforts have brought awareness worldwide to CSA.

== Endorsements ==
A comedian and local Chabad celebrity [[Mendy Pellin]], published a letter supporting JCW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=25723&amp;alias=standing-up-or-sitting-for-others |title=Standing Up (or Sitting) For Others |publisher=Collive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendy stated that "Where many of our community leaders have shied away from addressing this issue head-on, Meyer has devoted himself to doing the dirty work that needs to be done to keep our children safe."

Other endorsements include Rabbi Blau (Rabbi of Yeshiva University), Asher Lipner (a child sexual psychiatrist), Benny Forer (orthodox Jewish Deputy District Attorney) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishcommunitywatch.org/letters-of-endorsement/|title=Endorsement Letters|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Community response===
Members of the Chabad community, posting on local news blogs, have criticized the JCW website for not providing enough information on how investigations are performed, and for not detailing the evidence behind accusations of wrongdoing. The site has also been criticized for posting incriminatory information prior to individuals being arrested or charged, and accused of later refusing to change or remove information alleged by some members of the community to be false.&lt;ref name="chabadinfo1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chabadinfo.com/?url=article_en&amp;id=30032 |title= Jewish Community Watch Kosher? | work = chabad.info |date= April 4, 2013 |accessdate= April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the one claim above, no proof has ever been written or submitted demonstrating JCW has posted anyone wrongfully.

'''John Charlton Polkinghorne''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE|FRS}} (born 16 October 1930) is an English [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]], [[Theology|theologian]], writer and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest.  A prominent and leading voice explaining the [[relationship between science and religion]], he was [[professor]] of [[mathematical physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1968 to 1979, when he resigned his chair to study for the priesthood, becoming an ordained [[Church of England|Anglican]] priest in 1982. He served as the president of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] from 1988 until 1996.

Polkinghorne is the author of five books on physics, and 26 on the relationship between science and religion; his publications include ''The Quantum World'' (1989), ''Quantum Physics and Theology: An Unexpected Kinship'' (2005), ''[[Exploring Reality|Exploring Reality: The Intertwining of Science and Religion]]'' (2007), and ''[[Questions of Truth]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Metaxas|title=Socrates in the City: Conversations on "Life, God, and Other Small Topics" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vgB5N_ouMIC&amp;pg=PT336 |date=13 October 2011|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Polkinghorne Reader'' (edited by [[Thomas Jay Oord]]) provides key excerpts from Polkinghorne's most influential books. He was knighted in 1997 and in 2002 received the £1 million [[Templeton Prize]], awarded for exceptional contributions to affirming life's spiritual dimension.&lt;ref name=Templeton/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Polkinghorne was born in [[Weston-super-Mare]] to Dorothy Charlton, the daughter of a groom and George Polkinghorne, who worked for the post office. John was the couple's third child. There was a brother, Peter, and a sister, Ann, who died when she was six, one month before John's birth. Peter died in 1942 while flying for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Oconnor&gt;O'Connor, J. J. and Robertson, E. F. [http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Polkinghorne.html John Charlton Polkinghorne profile at gap-system.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607140449/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Polkinghorne.html |date=7 June 2011 }}; retrieved 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at the local primary school in [[Street, Somerset]], then was taught by a friend of the family at home, and later at a Quaker school. When he was 11 he went to Elmhurst Grammar School in Street, and when his father was promoted to head postmaster in Ely in 1945, Polkinghorne was transferred to [[The Perse School]], Cambridge.&lt;ref name=Oconnor/&gt; Following [[National Service]] in the [[Royal Army Educational Corps]] from 1948 to 1949, he read Mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1952 as [[Senior Wrangler]], then earned his PhD in physics in 1955, supervised by Nobel laureate [[Abdus Salam]] in the group led by [[Paul Dirac]].&lt;ref&gt;''From Physicist to Priest'', pp. 9–11; 23–29; 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Physics===
He joined the [[CICCU|Christian Union]] of [[UCCF]] while at Cambridge and met his future wife, Ruth Martin, another member of the Union and also a mathematics student. They married on 26 March 1955, and at the end of that year sailed from Liverpool to New York. Polkinghorne accepted a postdoctoral [[Harkness Fellowship]] with the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he worked with [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. Toward the end of the fellowship he was offered a position as lecturer at the [[University of Edinburgh]], which he took up in 1956.&lt;ref name=Oconnor/&gt;

After two years in Scotland, he returned to teach at Cambridge in 1958. He was promoted to reader in 1965, and in 1968 was offered a professorship in mathematical physics, a position he held until 1979,&lt;ref name=Oconnor/&gt; his students including [[Brian Josephson]] and [[Martin Rees]].&lt;ref&gt;''From Physicist to Priest'', pp. 40–50.&lt;/ref&gt; For 25 years, he worked on theories about elementary particles, played a role in the discovery of the [[quark]],&lt;ref name=Templeton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeton.org/humble_approach_initiative/Pneumatology/participants/polking.html |title=Participants |accessdate=2007-04-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010200/http://www.templeton.org/humble_approach_initiative/Pneumatology/participants/polking.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}, John Templeton Foundation, 2005, accessed 17 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and researched the analytic and high-energy properties of [[Path integral formulation|Feynman integrals]] and the foundations of [[S-matrix|S-Matrix theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Margenau &amp; Roy Abraham Varghese (eds.), ''Cosmos, Bios, Theos''. Peru, IL: Open Court, 1992, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; While employed by Cambridge, he also spent time at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and at [[CERN]] in Geneva. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=Oconnor/&gt;

===Priesthood and Queens' College===
Polkinghorne decided to train for the priesthood in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''From Physicist to Priest'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He said in an interview that he felt he had done his bit for science after 25 years, and that his best mathematical work was probably behind him; Christianity had always been central to his life, so ordination offered an attractive second career.&lt;ref name=Oconnor/&gt; He resigned his chair in 1979 to study at [[Westcott House, Cambridge]], an Anglican theological college, becoming an ordained priest on 6 June 1982 (Trinity Sunday). The ceremony was held at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and presided over by Bishop [[John A. T. Robinson]]. He worked for five years as a curate in south Bristol, then as vicar in [[Blean]], Kent, before returning to Cambridge in 1986 as dean of chapel at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]].&lt;ref name=Templeton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reisz/&gt; He became the president of Queens' College that year, a position he held until his retirement in 1996.&lt;ref name=Reisz&gt;Reisz, Matthew. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=405402 On the side of the angels], ''Times Higher Education'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Canon (priest)|canon theologian]] of [[Liverpool Cathedral]] from 1994 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''Third Way'', December 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
In 1997 he was made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (KBE), although as an ordained priest in the Church of England, he is not styled as "Sir John Polkinghorne".&lt;!-- how is he styled? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polkinghorne.net Official Website] This is a strange quirk of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Forms of address]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Honorary Fellow of [[St Chad's College]], Durham and awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[University of Durham]] in 1998; and in 2002 was awarded the [[Templeton Prize]] for his contributions to research at the interface between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;For basic biodata see ''Who's Who 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke on "The Universe as Creation" at the [[Trotter Prize (Texas A&amp;M)|Trotter Prize]] ceremony in 2003.

He has been a member of the [[British Medical Association|BMA]] Medical Ethics Committee, the [[General Synod of the Church of England]], the [[Doctrine Commission (Church of England)|Doctrine Commission]], and the [[Human Genetics Commission]]. He served as chairman of the governors of The Perse School from 1972 to 1981. He is a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge and was for 10 years a canon theologian of [[Liverpool Cathedral]].  He is a founding member of the [[Society of Ordained Scientists]] and also of the [[International Society for Science and Religion]], of which he was the first president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issr.org.uk/presidents.asp ISSR Presidents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828211048/http://www.issr.org.uk/presidents.asp |date=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected to give the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1993–1994, which he later published as ''The Faith of a Physicist''.

In 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] as part of their 50-year celebrations. This included giving a public lecture on "The Dialogue between Science and Religion and Its Significance for the Academy" and an "[[Eastern civilization|East]]–[[Western civilization|West]] Dialogue" with [[Chen Ning Yang|Yang Chen-ning]], a [[nobel laureate]] in physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~cpro/event/06Act.11-e.pdf|publisher=Hong Kong Baptist University|title=Diary of Events|date=November 2006|accessdate=2 April 2007|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210949/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~cpro/event/06Act.11-e.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of staff of the Psychology and Religion Research Group at Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prrg.org/p/prrg-staff.html Staff list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226064633/http://www.prrg.org/p/prrg-staff.html |date=26 December 2011 }}, Psychology and Religion Research Group, accessed 25 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Honorary Fellow of [[St Edmund's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/people/revd-dr-john-polkinghorne-kbe-frs|title=St Edmund's College - University of Cambridge|website=www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Polkinghorne said in an interview that he believes his move from science to religion has given him binocular vision, though he understands that it has aroused the kind of suspicion "that might follow the claim to be a vegetarian butcher."&lt;ref name=Reisz/&gt; He describes his position as [[Theological critical realism|critical realism]] and believes that science and religion address aspects of the same reality. It is a consistent theme of his work that when he "turned his collar around" he did not stop seeking truth.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite_book|author=John Polkinhorne|title=[[Exploring Reality|Exploring Reality: the Intertwining of Science and Religion]]|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the philosopher of science who has most helpfully struck the balance between the "critical" and "realism" aspects of this is [[Michael Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Polkinghorne|title=Quantum Physics and Theology: An Unexpected Kinship|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-281-05767-2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there are five points of comparison between the ways in which science and theology pursue truth: moments of enforced radical revision, a period of unresolved confusion, new synthesis and understanding, continued wrestling with unresolved problems, deeper implications.&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Physics &amp; Theology'', pp. 15–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because scientific experiments try to eliminate extraneous influences, he believes they are atypical of what goes on in nature. He suggests that the mechanistic explanations of the world that have continued from [[Laplace]] to [[Richard Dawkins]] should be replaced by an understanding that most of nature is cloud-like rather than clock-like. He regards the mind, soul and body as different aspects of the same underlying reality—"dual aspect monism"—writing that "there is only one stuff in the world (not two—the material and the mental) but it can occur in two contrasting states (material and mental phases, a physicist might say) which explain our perception of the difference between mind and matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Science and Christian Belief |pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that standard physical causation cannot adequately describe the manifold ways in which things and people interact, and uses the phrase "active information" to describe how, when several outcomes are possible, there may be higher levels of causation that choose which one occurs.&lt;ref name="sharpe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharpe|first=Kevin|date=July 2003 |title=Nudging John Polkinghorne|journal=Quodlibet Journal|volume=5|issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes Christianity seems to him to be just too good to be true, but when this sort of doubt arises he says to himself, "All right then, deny it," and writes that he knows this is something he could never do.&lt;ref&gt;''From Physicist to Priest'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the existence of God===
Polkinghorne considers that "the question of the existence of God is the single most important question we face about the nature of reality"&lt;ref&gt;This and (unless noted otherwise) all subsequent quotations are from Chapter 3 of ''Science &amp; Christian Belief'', also known as ''The Faith of a Physicist''.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotes with approval [[Anthony Kenny]]: "After all, if there is no God, then God is incalculably the greatest single creation of the human imagination." He addresses the questions of "Does the concept of God make sense? If so, do we have reason for believing in such a thing?" He is "cautious about our powers to assess coherence," pointing out that in 1900 a "competent ... undergraduate could have demonstrated the 'incoherence'" of quantum ideas. He suggests that "the nearest analogy in the physical world [to God] would be ... the [[Quantum Vacuum]]."&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt;

He suggests that God is the ultimate answer to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s great question "why is there something rather than nothing?" The atheist's "plain assertion of the world's existence" is a "grossly impoverished view of reality ... [arguing that] theism explains more than a reductionist atheism can ever address." He is very doubtful of [[St Anselm]]'s [[Ontological Argument]]. Referring to [[Gödel's incompleteness theory]], he said: "If we cannot prove the consistency of arithmetic it seems a bit much to hope that God's existence is easier to deal with," concluding that God is "ontologically necessary, but not logically necessary." He "does not assert that God's existence can be demonstrated in a logically coercive way (any more than God's non-existence can) but that theism makes more sense of the world, and of human experience, than does atheism."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Theology'', pp. 71–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He cites in particular:

* '''The intelligibility of the universe:''' One would anticipate that evolutionary selection would produce hominid minds apt for coping with everyday experience, but that these minds should also be able to understand the subatomic world and general relativity goes far beyond anything of relevance to survival fitness. The mystery deepens when one recognises the proven fruitfulness of mathematical beauty as a guide to successful theory choice.&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Theology'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The anthropic [[Fine-tuned universe|fine tuning of the universe]]:''' He quotes with approval [[Freeman Dyson]], who said "the more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe in some sense must have known we were coming"&lt;ref&gt;''Science &amp; Christian Belief'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is a wide consensus amongst physicists that either there are a very large number of other universes in the [[Multiverse]] or that "there is just one universe which is the way it is in its anthropic fruitfulness because it is the expression of the purposive design of a Creator, who has endowed it with the finely tuned potentialty for life."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Theology'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A wider humane reality:''' He considers that theism offers a more persuasive account of ethical and aesthetic perceptions. He argues that it is difficult to accommodate the idea that "we have real moral knowledge" and that statements such as 'torturing children is wrong' are more than "simply social conventions of the societies within which they are uttered" within an atheistic or naturalistic world view.  He also believes such a world view finds it hard to explain how "Something of lasting significance is glimpsed in the beauty of the natural world and the beauty of the fruits of human creativity."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Theology'', pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On free will===
Polkinghorne regards the [[problem of evil]] as the most serious intellectual objection to the existence of God.  He believes that "The well-known [[Theodicy#The free will theodicy|free will defence]] in relation to moral evil asserts that a world with a possibility of sinful people is better than one with perfectly programmed machines. The tale of human evil is such that one cannot make that assertion without a quiver, but I believe that it is true nevertheless. I have added to it the [[Theodicy#The free process theodicy|free-process defence]], that a world allowed to make itself is better than a puppet theatre with a Cosmic Tyrant.  I think that these two defences are opposite sides of the same coin, that our nature is inextricably linked with that of the physical world which has given us birth."&lt;ref name='belief in god'&gt;{{cite book | last = Polkinghorne | first = John | title = Belief in God in an Age of Science | publisher = Yale Nota Bene | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-300-09949-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On creationism===
Polkinghorne accepts [[evolution]]. Following the resignation of [[Michael Reiss]], the director of education at the Royal Society—who had controversially argued that school pupils who believed in creationism should be used by science teachers to start discussions, rather than be rejected ''per se''&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/7619670.stm 'Creationism' biologist quits job], BBC News, 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;—Polkinghorne argued in ''The Times'' that there is a distinction between believing in the mind and purpose of a divine creator, and what he calls creationism "in that curious North American sense," with a literal interpretation of Genesis 1 and the belief that evolution is wrong, a position he rejects.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, John. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901144152/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4790446.ece "Shining a light where science and theology meet"], ''The Times'', 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[Nancy Frankenberry]], Professor of Religion at [[Dartmouth College]], has described Polkinghorne as the finest British theologian/scientist of our time, citing his work on the possible relationship between [[chaos theory]] and [[natural theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy K. Frankenberry (ed.), ''The Faith of Scientists in Their Own Words'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gingerich]], an astronomer and former Harvard professor, has called him a leading voice on the relationship between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Gingrich, "review of ''Science and the Trinity''", ''Science and Theology News'', [http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300115307 quoted by the Yale University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] has criticized Polkinghorne for using primitive thinking and rhetorical devices instead of engaging in philosophy. When Polkinghorne argues that the minute adjustments of cosmological constants for life points towards an explanation beyond the scientific realm, Blackburn argues that this relies on a natural preference for explanation in terms of agency. Blackburn writes that he finished Polkinghorne's books in "despair at humanity's capacity for self-deception."&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon. [http://www.powells.com/review/2002_08_01.html An Unbeautiful Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123714/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_08_01.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, a review of John Polkinghorne's ''The God of Hope and the End of the World'', ''The New Republic'', 1 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, [[Freeman J. Dyson]] called Polkinghorne's arguments on theology and natural science "polished and logically coherent."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1998/may/28/is-god-in-the-lab/ "Is God in the Lab?"], ''The New York Review of Books'', 28 May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Simon Ings]], writing in the ''[[New Scientist]]'', said Polkinghorne's argument for the proposition that God is real is cogent and his evidence elegant.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ings, [http://www.polkinghorne.net/godonlyknows.html "God Only Knows"], ''New Scientist'', 4 July 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]], formerly [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science|Professor for Public Understanding of Science]] at Oxford, writes that the same three names of British scientists who are also sincerely religious crop up with the "likable familiarity of senior partners in a firm of Dickensian lawyers": [[Arthur Peacocke]], [[Russell Stannard]], and John Polkinghorne, all of whom have either won the Templeton Prize or are on its board of trustees. Dawkins writes that he is not so much bewildered by their belief in a cosmic lawgiver, but by their beliefs in the minutiae of Christianity, such as the resurrection and forgiveness of sins, and that such scientists, in Britain and in the U.S., are the subject of bemused bafflement among their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion'', Houghton Mifflin Co, 2006, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Polkinghorne responded that "debating with Dawkins is hopeless, because there's no give and take. He doesn't give you an inch. He just says no when you say yes"&lt;ref name=Reisz/&gt; and writes in ''[[Questions of Truth]]'' that he hopes Dawkins will be a bit less baffled once he reads it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_book |first=John|last = Polkinghorne |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=2009 |title=[[Questions of Truth]] |isbn = 978-0-664-23351-8 |pages=29 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A.C. Grayling]] criticized the Royal Society for allowing its premises to be used in connection with the launch of ''Questions of Truth'', describing it as a scandal, and suggesting that Polkinghorne had exploited his fellowship there to publicize a "weak, casuistical and tendentious pamphlet." After implying that the book's publisher, [[Westminster John Knox]], was a [[self-publisher]], Grayling went on to write that Polkinghorne and others were eager to see the credibility accorded to scientific research extended to religious perspectives through association.&lt;ref&gt;Grayling, A. C.

In contrast to Grayling, science historian Edward B. Davis praises ''Questions of Truth'', saying the book provides "the kind of technical information...that scientifically trained readers will appreciate—yet they can be read profitably by anyone interested in science and Christianity." Davis concludes, "It hasn't been easy to steer a middle course between fundamentalism and modernism, particularly on issues involving science. Polkinghorne has done that very successfully for a generation, and for this he ought to be both appreciated and emulated."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Edward B. [http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2009/07/the-motivated-belief-of-john-polkinghorne "The Motivated Belief of John Polkinghorne"], ''First Things'', 17 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sikhism]], '''Karah''' is a type of semolina [[halva]] made with equal portions of [[whole-wheat flour]], [[clarified butter]], and [[sugar]]. It is offered to all visitors to the [[Darbar Sahib Hall|Darbar Sahib]] in a [[Gurdwara]]. It is regarded as a treat for attendees of [[gurmat]] seminars. As it has a very high sugar and oil content, visitors may ask the [[Sewadar]] for a small portion. As a sign of humility and respect, visitors accept the Karah sitting, with hands raised and cupped. The offering and receiving of this food is a vital part of [[hospitality]] protocols. It has the same amount of whole-wheat flour, clarified butter and sugar, to emphasize the equality of men and women.{{clarify|date=July 2012}} The Sewadar serves it out of the same bowl to everyone in equal portions. The Karah is a sacred food; if it is not accepted, it may be interpreted by some Sikhs as an insult. Karah is also taken at the initiation ceremony of [[Amrit Sanchar]] at the very end where it is shared out equally among all. It is a symbol showing that everyone is equal.

The Gurdwara is the place where Sikhs go to worship. Gurdwaras can be any size or shape, but one thing they always have is a kitchen, or [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]]. People can go there for food, and can even rest there for the night. Every day a meal is prepared here for as many people who want to eat, always for free.

'''Ketu''' ([[Sanskrit]]: [[:wikt:केतु#Sanskrit|केतु]], [[IAST]]: {{IAST|Ketú}}) ([[File:U+260B.svg|16px]]) is the descending (i.e 'south') lunar node in [[Vedic]], or [[Hindu astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ganeshaspeaks.com/predictions/astrology/ketu-the-planet-of-detachment/ |title=Rise above the mundane...and material..says Ketu, the planet of detachment! |publisher=ganeshaspeaks.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speakingtree.in/allslides/the-lesser-known-story-of-rahu-and-ketu/266298 |title=The lesser known story of Rahu and Ketu! |publisher=speakingtree.in }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrivinayakaastrology.com/Planets/roleofketu.html |title=Role Of Ketu In Astrology |publisher=shrivinayakaastrology.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heerejawharat.com/astrology/planets-significance/ketu.php |title=Ketu Astrological significance |publisher=heerejawharat.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some accounts in [[Hindu mythology]], Ketu belongs to Jaimini Gotra, whereas Rahu is from Paiteenasa gotra and hence both are totally different entities with distinct characteristics but are two parts of a common body. Ketu is generally referred to as a "shadow" planet. It is believed to have a tremendous impact on human lives and also the whole creation. In some special circumstances it helps someone achieve the zenith of fame. Ketu is often depicted with a gem or star on his head signifying a mystery light.{{cn|date=March 2018}} 

As per Vedic astrology Rahu and Ketu have an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other orbitally (as well as in the birth charts). This coincides with the precessional orbit of moon or the ~18 year rotational cycle of the lunar ascending and descending nodes on the earth’s ecliptic plane. Ketu rules the [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] zodiac sign together with [[Mangala]]

Astronomically, [[Rahu]] and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] as they move on the [[celestial sphere]]. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south [[lunar node]]s. The fact that [[eclipse]]s occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of these points gives rise to the understanding of swallowing of the Sun and the Moon by the snake. 

Often Ketu is misunderstood{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}{{Contradict-inline|date=March 2018}} as Uranus during Sanskrit to English translation, however, Uranus isn’t visible to the naked eye and its discovery is attributed to the use of high resolution telescopes in modern astronomy.

==Astrology==
[[File:Planet ketu.JPG|thumbnail|left|A mural of Ketu. Depicted as the body without head. from Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur]]

In [[Hindu astrology]] Ketu represents karmic collections both good and bad, spirituality and supernatural influences.  Ketu signifies the spiritual process of the refinement of materialization to spirit and is considered both malefic and benefic, as it causes sorrow and loss, and yet at the same time turns the individual to God. In other words, it causes material loss in order to force a more spiritual outlook in the person. Ketu is a ''karaka'' or indicator of intelligence, wisdom, non-attachment, fantasy, penetrating insight, derangement, and psychic abilities. Ketu is believed to bring prosperity to the devotee's family, removes the effects of snakebite and illness arising out of poisons. He grants good health, wealth and cattle to his devotees. Ketu is the lord of three [[nakshatra]]s or lunar mansions: [[Ashvini]], [[Magha (nakshatra)|Magha]] and [[Mula (astrology)|Mula]].

Ketu is considered responsible for ''[[moksha]]'', ''[[sannyasa]]'', self-realization, ''[[Jnana|gnana]]'', a wavering nature, restlessness, the endocrine system and slender physique.

The people who come under the influence of Ketu can achieve great heights, most of them spiritual.

Rahu, being a karmic planet would show the necessity and urge to work on a specific area of life where there had been ignorance in the past life. To balance the apparent dissatisfaction one has to go that extra mile to provide a satisfactory settlement in the present lifetime. 

Ruler of Ketu: According to the most popular astrology text Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, (BPHS) Ketu is related to Matsya.

Exaltation and Debilitation: This has been a debatable point in astrology, as per BPHS Ketu is exalted in the sign of Scorpio and debilitated in Taurus, however, many astrologers have disputed this and most modern astrologers now seem to agree that Ketu is exalted in Sagittarius and debilitated in Gemini {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} . This stands to logic as Ketu is a torso and a prominent part of Sagittarius is big horse torso attached to a male upper body. 

Negative Significations: While Ketu is considered malefic and has been mostly associated with negative things. Most people consider it a difficult planet as it brings lot of troubles on the material plane. It often brings a sense of detachment, losses, mindlessness, wandering, and confusion in one’s life. 

Positive Significations: There is a much deeper side to Ketu and it has been called the most spiritual of all planets. Ketu has been considered the planet of enlightenment and liberation. As the one who has “lost his head (worldly senses)” Being a personification of renunciation (torso without a head who needs nothing). Ketu the ascetic that wants to go beyond the mundane life and achieve the final liberation.

This is a '''list of Christmas carols''' organized by country, language or culture of origin.  Originally, a "[[Christmas carol]]" referred to a piece of vocal music in [[Carol (music)|carol form]] whose [[lyrics]] centre on the theme of [[Christmas]] or the Christmas season.

Many traditional Christmas carols focus on the Christian celebration of the [[nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]], while others celebrate the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] that range from 25 December to 5 January. As a result, many Christmas Carols can be related to [[Saint Stephen's Day|St Stephen's Day]] (26 December), [[John the Apostle|St John's Day]] (27 December), [[Massacre of the Innocents|Feast of Holy Innocents]] (28 December), [[Saint Sylvester's Day|St Sylvester's Day]] (31 December), and the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. Examples of this are ''[[We Three Kings]]'' (an [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] song),  and ''[[Good King Wenceslas]]'' (a carol for [[St. Stephen's Day]]). Nonetheless, some Christmas Carols, both religious and secular, now regarded as Christmas songs have become associated with the Christmas season even though the lyrics may not specifically refer to Christmas – for example, ''[[Deck the Halls]]'' (a [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Yule]]tide drinking song) and ''[[O Come, O Come, Emmanuel]]'' (an [[Advent]] chant). Other [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] focus on more secular Christmas themes, such as winter scenes, family gatherings, and [[Santa Claus]] (''[[Jingle Bells]]'', ''[[O Tannenbaum|O Christmas Tree]], [[Home for the Holidays (song)|Home for the Holidays]]'', ''[[Jolly Old Saint Nicholas|Jolly Old St. Nicholas]]'', etc.).

== Danish ==

The list is based primarily on carols and hymns mentioned in the Song Book for the Danish Folk High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Folkehøjskolens Sangbog|last=|first=|publisher=Foreningen for Folkehøjskolen i Danmark|year=1989|isbn=87-7001-189-3|location=Odense|pages=Numbers 43–69|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where possible, a carol title is linked to its (Danish) Wikipedia entry, where the carol can be heard. Otherwise, a carol title has been linked to its entry at the Danish Hymn Book Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dendanskesalmebogonline.dk/salmeoversigt|title=Den Danske Salmebog Online.|website=www.dendanskesalmebogonline.dk|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolling, i.e. dancing around, is practised - probably unintentionally - in Danish Christmas tradition, when a Christmas party join hands forming a chain around the family Christmas tree and walk, dance or run around the Christmas tree depending on the Christmas carol or song sung.

The '''Shahanshahs of the Sasanian Empire''' ([[Middle Persian]]: {{transl|pal|Šāhān šāh ī Ērān ud Anērān}}, "[[King of Kings]] of [[Iran (word)|Iranians]] and [[Aniran|non-Iranians]]") ruled over a vast territory. At its height, the empire spanned from [[Turkey]] and [[Rhodes]] in the west to [[Pakistan]] in the east, and also included territory in contemporary [[Caucasus]], [[Yemen]], [[UAE]], [[Oman]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]] and [[Central Asia]].

The [[Sasanian Empire]] was recognized as one of the main powers in the world alongside its neighboring arch rival, the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ucls.uchicago.edu/~cjuriss/EarlyWorld/Documents/Early-World-Jurisson-UNIT-7-The-Rise-of-Islam-in-the-World.pdf|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EIr-Sasanian&gt;{{harv|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norman A.

Ashgate Pub Co, 30 sep. 2006 {{ISBN|075465740X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sasanian dynasty began with [[Ardashir I]] in 224, who was a [[Persian people|Persian]] from [[Estakhr]], and was descended from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Kings]], and ended with [[Yazdegerd III]] in 651. The downfall of the Sasanian Empire proved of great significance and effects to [[Zoroastrianism]], the state religion of the Sasanian Empire. The previous Zoroastrian shahanshahs were replaced with Muslim Caliphs who forced the Zoroastrians and [[Zoroastrianism|their faith]] to endure harsh conditions, including the destruction of fire temples throughout the previous Sasanian Empire and marginalization of the faith.{{sfn|Molavi|2002|p=52}}

==Title==

[[Ardashir I]] (''r.'' 224–242), the founder of the [[Sassanian Empire]], introduced the title "[[king of kings|Shahanshah]] of the [[Iran (word)|Iranians]]" ([[Middle Persian]]: {{transl|pal|šāhān šāh ī ērān}}; [[Parthian language|Parthian]]: ''{{transl|xpr|šāhān šāh ī aryān}}''). Ardashir's immediate successor, [[Shapur I]] (''r.'' 240/42–270/72) chooses the titles in a precise manner [[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|in the inscription at Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]]. In that Shapur names four of his Sasanian predecessors with different titles and in "an ascending order of importance" by giving the title (''Xwaday'') "the lord" to Sasan, "[[Shah|the king]]" to Papag, "King of Kings of Iranians" to Ardashir, and "king of kings of Iranians and [[Aniran|non-Iranians]]" ({{lang-pal|MLKAn MLKA 'yr'n W 'nyr'n}} {{transl|pal|šāhān šāh ī ērān ud anērān}};; {{lang-grc|βασιλεύς βασιλέων Αριανών}} {{transl|grc|basileús basiléōn Arianṓn}}) to himself.&lt;ref name=cambridge-iran-3-1-4&gt;{{citation|last=Frye|first=R. N.|title=The political history of Iran under the Sasanians|chapter=Chapter 4|work=[[The Cambridge History of Iran]]|volume=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0-521-20092-9 | issue=1}}, page 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The title "King of Kings of Iranians and non-Iranians" has also seen on a single silver coin of Shapur I, which indicates that the title was introduced after his victory over Romans and incorporation of non-Iranian lands into the Sassanian realms. The title was later used in coins of all later Sassanian kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00210862.2017.1303329 | volume=50 | title=A Unique Drachm Coin of Shapur I | journal=Iranian Studies | pages=331–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shahanshah==
The head of the Sasanian Empire was the ''[[shahanshah]]'' (king of kings), also simply known as the ''shah'' (king). His health and welfare was always important and the phrase “May you be immortal" was used to reply to him with. By looking on the Sasanian coins which appeared from the 6th-century and afterwards, a moon and sun is noticeable. The meaning of the moon and sun, in the words of the Iranian historian [[Touraj Daryaee]], “suggest that the king was at the center of the world and the sun and moon revolved around him. In effect he was the “king of the four corners of the world," which was an old Mesopotamian idea."{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=41}} The king saw all other rulers, such as the Romans, Turks, and Chinese, as being beneath him. The king wore colorful clothes, makeup, a heavy crown, while his beard was decorated with gold. The early Sasanian kings considered themselves of divine descent; they called themselves for “bay" (divine).{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=42}}

When the king went to the publicity, he was hidden behind a curtain,{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=41}} and had some of his men in front of him, whose duty was to keep the masses away from the king and to make his way clear.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=92}} When one came to the king, he/she had to prostrate before him, also known as ''[[proskynesis]]''. The king was guarded by a group of royal guards, known as the ''[[Pushtigban Body Guards|pushtigban]]''. On other occasions, the king was protected by a group of palace guards, known as the ''[[darigan]]''. Both of these groups were enlisted from royal families of the Sasanian Empire,{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=92}} and were under the command of the ''[[hazarbed]]'', who was in charge of the king's safety, controlled the entrance of the kings palace, presented visitors to the king, and was allowed to be given military command or used in negotiations. The ''hazarbed'' was also allowed in some cases to serve as the royal executioner.{{sfn|Morony|2005|p=92}} During [[Nowruz]] (Iranian new year) and [[Mihragan]] ([[Mithra|Mihr's day]]), the king would hold a speech.{{sfn|Daryaee|2008|p=42}}

==Sasanian state organization==
{{main|Sasanian Empire}}
[[File:Sasanian Empire.gif|thumb|300px|Sasanian Empire timeline including important events and territorial evolution.]]

Throughout its existence, the Sassanid Empire was an [[absolute monarchy]]. The Shahenshah was the height of authority, with [[satraps]] ruling over their satrapies underneath them. The shahanshah was the highest form of authority throughout the empire, but often faced rebellions from their satraps. In fact, the Sasanian Empire had been founded when a satrap rebelled against the [[Parthian Empire]].{{sfn|Freedman|2000|p=458}}

The [[Sasanian Empire]] reached its greatest extent under [[Khosrau II]], who reigned for 38 years; the longest reigning king was [[Shapur II]], who reigned for 70 years.

The Sasanian kings regarded themselves as successors of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and many Sasanian kings' goal was to conquer all territory previously held by the Achaemenids.

==List of shahanshahs==
The table below lists Sasanian shahanshahs and titles used by them.

'''Mandaeans''' ({{lang-ar|الصابئة المندائيون|aṣ-Ṣābi'a al-Mandā'iyūn}}) are an [[ethnoreligious group]] [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to the alluvial plain of southern [[Mesopotamia]] and are followers of [[Mandaeism]], a [[Gnostic]] religion. The Mandaeans were originally native speakers of [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], a [[Semitic language]] that evolved from [[Eastern Middle Aramaic]], before many switched to colloquial [[Iraqi Arabic]] and [[Modern Persian]]. Mandaic is mainly preserved as a [[liturgical language]]. In the aftermath of the [[Iraq War|Iraq War of 2003]], the indigenous Mandaic community of [[Iraq]], which used to number 60,000–70,000 persons, collapsed; most of the community relocated to nearby [[Iran]], [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]], or formed diaspora communities beyond the [[Middle East]]. The other indigenous community of Iranian Mandaeans has also been dwindling as a result of religious [[persecution]] over that [[decade]].&lt;ref name="saving" /&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
There are several indications of the ultimate origin of the Mandaeans. Early religious concepts and terminologies recur in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and [[River Jordan|"Jordan"]] has been the name of every baptismal water in Mandaeism.{{sfn|Rudolph|1977|p=5}} The [[Mandaic language]] is a dialect of southeastern Aramaic and is closely related to the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]]. There is archaeological evidence that attests to the Mandaean presence in pre-Islamic Iraq.{{sfn|Deutsch|1999|p=4}}{{sfn|Rudolph|1977|p=4}} Some scholars, including [[Kurt Rudolph]] connect the early Mandaeans with the [[Jewish]] sect of the [[Nasoraeans]].{{sfn|Rudolph|1977|p=4}}

It appears that [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], the founder of [[Manichaeism]], was partly influenced by the Mandaeans.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Early Persian periods===
A number of ancient Aramaic inscriptions dating back to the 2nd century CE were uncovered in [[Elymais]]. Although the letters appear quite similar to the Mandaean ones, it is doubtful whether the inhabitants of [[Elymais]] were Mandaeans.&lt;ref Name=Buckley4&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and early [[Sassanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule, foreign religions were tolerated. The situation changed by the ascension of [[Bahram I]] in 273, who under the influence of the zealous [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] high priest [[Kartir]] persecuted all non-Zoroastrian religions. It is thought that this persecution encouraged the consolidation of Mandaean religious literature.&lt;ref Name=Buckley4/&gt;
The persecutions instigated by Kartir seems to temporarily erase Mandaeans from recorded history. Traces of their presence can still however be found in the so-called Mandaean magical bowls and lead strips which were produced from the 3rd to the 7th centuries.&lt;ref Name=Buckley5&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Caliphates===
The Mandaeans re-appear at the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia]], when their "head of the people" Anush son of Danqa appears before [[Muslim]] authorities showing them a copy of the [[Ginza Rba|Ginza Rabba]], the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be [[John the Baptist]], who is also mentioned in the [[Quran]]. The connection with the Quranic [[Sabians]] provided them acknowledgement as [[People of the Book]], a legal minority religion within the Muslim Empire. They appear to have flourished during the early Islamic period, as attested by the voluminous expansion of Mandaic literature and canons. [[Tib, Mesopotamia|Tib]] near [[Wasit]] is particularly noted as an important scribal centre.&lt;ref Name=Buckley5/&gt; [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] describes Tib as a town inhabited by [[Nabatean]] (i.e. Aramaic speaking) [[Sabians]] who consider themselves to be descendants of [[Seth]] son of [[Adam]].&lt;ref Name=Buckley5/&gt;

The status of the Mandaeans became an issue for the [[Abbasid]] [[al-Qahir Billah]]. To avoid further investigation by the authorities, the Mandaeans paid a bribe of 50,000 [[Islamic gold dinar|dinars]] and were left alone. It appears that the Mandaeans were even exempt from paying the [[Jizya]], otherwise imposed upon non-Muslims.&lt;ref Name=Buckley5/&gt;

===Late Persian and Ottoman periods===
Early contact with [[Europeans]] came about in the mid-16th century, when [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] missionaries encountered Mandaeans in Southern [[Iraq]] and controversially designated them "Christians of St. John". In the next centuries Europeans became more acquainted with the Mandaeans and their religion.&lt;ref Name=Buckley5/&gt;

The Mandaeans suffered persecution under the [[Qajar]] rule in the 1780s. The dwindling community was threatened with complete annihilation, when a [[cholera]] epidemic broke out in [[Shushtar]] and half of its inhabitants died. The entire Mandaean priesthood perished and Mandeism was restored due only to the efforts of few learned men such as Yahia Bihram.&lt;ref Name=Buckley6&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another danger threatened the community in 1870, when the local governor of [[Shushtar]] massacred the Mandaeans against the will of the Shah.&lt;ref Name=Buckley6/&gt; As a result of these events the Mandaeans retired to the more inaccessible [[Central Marshes]] of Iraq.

===Modern Iraq and Iran===
Following the [[First World War]], the Mandaeans were still largely living in rural areas in the lower parts of British protected [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraq]] and [[Iran]]. Owing to the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], Mandaeans were [[Arabisation|Arabised]] at an accelerated rate, especially during the 1950s and '60s. The Mandaeans were also forced to abandon their stands on the cutting of hair and forced military service, which are strictly prohibited in Mandaenism.&lt;ref Name=MHRG5&gt;{{Harvnb|Mandaean Human Rights Group|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 [[Iraq War]] brought more troubles to the Mandaeans, as the security situation deteriorated. Many members of the Mandaean community, who were known as goldsmiths, were targeted by criminal gangs for ransoms. The rise of [[Islamic Extremism]] forced thousands to flee the country, after they were given [[forced conversion|the choice of conversion or death]].&lt;ref name=Zurutuza&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=106580 |title=The Ancient Wither in New Iraq |date=29 January 2012 |agency=IPS |accessdate=June 5, 2012 |author=Zurutuza, Karlos |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131093000/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=106580 |archive-date=31 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that around 90% of Iraqi Mandaeans were either killed or have fled after the American-led invasion.&lt;ref name=Zurutuza/&gt;

The Mandaeans of Iran lived chiefly in [[Ahvaz]], [[Iranian Khuzestan]], but have moved as a result of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] to other cities such as [[Tehran]], [[Karaj]] and [[Shiraz]]. The Mandaeans, who were traditionally considered as [[People of the Book]] (members of a protected religion under Islamic rule) lost this status after the [[Islamic Revolution in Iran|Islamic Revolution]]. Local authorities in Iranian Islamic Republic are known to encourage harassment and persecution of the Mandaeans. However, despite this, Iranian Mandaeans still maintain successful businesses and factories in areas such as Ahwaz. In April 1996, the cause of the Mandaeans' religious status in the Islamic Republic was raised. The parliament came to the conclusion that "Sabaeans" were included in the protected status of People of the Book alongside Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians and specified that, from a legal viewpoint, there is no prohibition against Muslims associating with Mandaeans, who are often regarded as being the Sabaeans mentioned explicitly in the Qur'an. That same year, Ayatollah Sajjadi of Al-Zahra University in Qom posed three questions regarding the Mandaeans' beliefs and seemed satisfied with the answers. These rulings however, did not lead to Mandaeans regaining their more officially recognized status as People of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mandaeans-4 |title=Mandaean Community in Iran |work=Encyclopedia Iranica |accessdate=June 5, 2012 |author=Buckley, Jorunn Jacobsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Iraq War, The Iraqi Mandaean community was centered in [[Baghdad]]. The Mandeans originate, however, from southern Iraq in cities like [[Nasiriyah]].

In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 and 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press.&lt;ref name="saving" /&gt; Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name=alarabiya0612/&gt;

Until the [[Iranian Revolution]], Mandaeans had mainly been concentrated in the [[Khuzestan province]], where the community used to exist by side with the local [[Arab people|Arab]] population. They had mainly been practising the profession of goldsmith, passing it from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=alarabiya0612&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/06/181123.html |title=Iran Mandaeans in exile following persecution |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the shah, its members faced increased religious discrimination, and many sought a new home in Europe and the Americas.

In Iran, the ''[[Gozinesh]]'' Law (passed in 1985) has the effect of prohibiting Mandaeans from fully participating in civil life. This law and other ''gozinesh'' provisions make access to employment, education, and a range of other areas conditional upon a rigorous ideological screening, the principal prerequisite for which is devotion to the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005324.php|title=Ideological Screening (ROOZ :: English)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans, [[Ahl-e Haq]], and [[Baha'i]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2005&amp;c=IRN Annual Report for Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218150237/http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2005&amp;c=IRN |date=2011-02-18 }}, 2005, [[Amnesty International]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the US State Department granted Iranian Mandaeans protective refugee status; since then roughly 1,000 have emigrated to the US,&lt;ref name="saving" /&gt; now residing in cities such as [[San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Updated 33 minutes ago 12/17/2011 8:29:41 AM +00:00|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31680885/ns/us_news-faith/t/ancient-sect-fights-keep-culture-alive-us/ |title=Ancient sect fights to stay alive in U.S. - US news&amp;nbsp;– Faith&amp;nbsp;– msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Mandaean community in Iran has increased over the last decade, because of the exodus from Iraq of the main Mandaean community, which used to be 60,000–70,000 strong.

===Other countries in the Middle East===
Following the Iraq War, the Mandaean community dispersed throughout the Middle East. Living as refugees the Mandaeans in Jordan number 49 families,&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt; while in Syria there are as many as 1,250 families.&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt;

===Diaspora===
There are small Mandaean diaspora populations in Sweden (c. 7,000), Australia (c. 3,500 as of 2006), the USA (c. 2,500), the UK (c. 1,000), and Canada.&lt;ref name="bbc0307" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lt.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lt.se/nyheter/sodertalje/1.2102865-morgondopp-som-ger-gruppen-nytt-hopp|title=Morgondopp som ger gruppen nytt hopp|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmarker"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901687.html|title=Survival of Ancient Faith Threatened by Fighting in Iraq|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|first=Chris |last=Newmarker |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/bolender01082005.html The Plight of Iraq's Mandeans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629115128/http://www.counterpunch.org/bolender01082005.html |date=2011-06-29 }}, John Bolender.

Mandaeism has no provision for conversion, and the religious status of Mandaeans who marry outside the faith and their children is disputed.&lt;ref name="saving" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;

The status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call upon the U.S. government to extend refugee status to the community. In 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an [[op-ed]] piece in which Swarthmore professor [[Nathaniel Deutsch]] called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH"/&gt; Iraqi Mandaeans were given refugee status by the [[US State Department]] in 2007.

==Religion==
{{Main|Mandaeism}}
Mandaeans are a closed ethno-religious community, practicing Mandaeism, which is a Gnostic religion&lt;ref name="Mandaens"&gt;{{citation|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The Mandaeans: ancient texts and modern people|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195153859|url=http://mandaeannetwork.com/Mandaean/books/english/2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf?bcsi_scan_955b0cd764557e80=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Mandaens2"&gt;{{citation|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The Mandaeans: ancient texts and modern people|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195153859|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=I9G-zLZRMLQC}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} (Aramaic ''manda'' means "knowledge," as does Greek ''gnosis'') with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents revere [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Abel]], [[Seth]], [[Enos (Bible)|Enosh]], [[Noah]], [[Shem]], [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]] and especially [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref&gt;Mandaeism – Page 15 Kurt Rudolph – 1978 This tradition can be explained by an anti-Christian concept, which is also found in Mandaeism, but, according to several scholars, it contains scarcely any traditions of historical events. Because of the strong dualism in Mandaeism ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Light and the Dark: Dualism in ancient Iran, India, and China Petrus Franciscus Maria Fontaine - 1990 "Although it shows Jewish and Christian influences, Mandaeism was hostile to Judaism and Christianity. Mandaeans spoke an East-Aramaic language in which 'manda' means 'knowledge'; this already is sufficient proof of the connection of Mandaeism with the Gnosis...&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandaeans group existence into two main categories: light and dark. They have a dualistic view of life, that encompasses both good and evil; all good is thought to have come from the World of Light (i.e. lightworld) and all evil from the World of Darkness. In relation to the [[body–mind dualism]] coined by Descartes, Mandaeans consider the body, and all material, worldly things, to have come from the Dark, while the soul (sometimes referred to as the mind) is a product of the lightworld. Mandaeans believe the World of Light is ruled by a heavenly being, known by many names, such as “Life,” “Lord of Greatness,” “Great Mind,” or “King of Light”.{{sfn|Rudolph|2001}} This being is so great, vast, and incomprehensible that no words can fully depict how awesome Life is. It is believed that an innumerable number of beings, manifested from the light, surround Life and perform cultic acts of worship to praise and honor this great being. They inhabit worlds separate from the lightworld and are commonly referred to as emanations from First Life; their names include Second, Third, and Fourth Life (i.e. Yōšamin, Abathur, and Ptahil ).{{sfn|Rudolph|2001}}

The Lord of Darkness is the ruler of the World of Darkness formed from dark waters representing chaos.{{sfn|Rudolph|2001}} A main defender of the darkworld is a giant monster, or dragon, with the name “Ur;” an evil, female ruler also inhabits the darkworld, known as “Ruha”.{{sfn|Rudolph|2001}} The Mandaeans believe these malevolent rulers created demonic offspring who consider themselves the owners of the Seven (planets) and Twelve (Zodiac signs).{{sfn|Rudolph|2001}}

According to Mandaean beliefs, the world is a mixture of light and dark created by the demiurge (Ptahil) with help from dark powers, such as Ruha, the Seven, and the Twelve.{{sfn|Rudolph|2001}} Adam’s body (i.e. believed to be the first human created by God in Christian tradition) was fashioned by these dark beings; however, his “soul” (or mind) was a direct creation from the Light. Therefore, many Mandaeans believe the human soul is capable of salvation because it originates from the lightworld. The soul, sometimes referred to as the “inner Adam” or “hidden Adam,” is in dire need of being rescued from the Dark, so it may ascend into the heavenly realm of the lightworld.{{sfn|Rudolph|2001}} [[Baptism|Baptisms]] are a central theme in Mandaeanism, believed to be necessary for the redemption of the soul. Mandaeans do not perform a single baptism, as in religions such as Christianity; rather, they view baptisms as a ritualistic act capable of bringing the soul closer to salvation.{{sfn|McGrath|2015}} Therefore, Mandaeans get baptized repeatedly during their lives. John the Baptist is a key figure for the Mandaeans; they consider him to have been a Mandaean (2015). John is referred to as a “disciple” or “priest,” most known for the countless number of baptisms he performed, which helped close the immense gap between the soul and salvation.{{sfn|Rudolf|1983}}

Today, many Mandaeans are refugees and are not willing to accept converts into their religion.{{sfn|McGrath|2015}} Sunday, as in other religious traditions, is their holy day, centered largely on mythical beliefs. Some Mandaeans consider Jesus an “apostate Mandaean”.{{sfn|McGrath|2015}}

'''Mortification of the flesh''' is an act by which an individual or group seeks to mortify, or put to death, their [[Christian views on sin|sinful nature]], as a part of the process of [[sanctification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariancatechist.com/spiritual_reading/seeking_sanctification.html|title=Seeking Sanctification Through the Practice of Mortification|last=Scheckel|first=Roger J.|year=2006|publisher=Marian Catechist Apostolate|language=English|accessdate=14 June 2016|quote=Saint Paul sets forth in the above two passages the fundamental reason why we are in need of mortification. The Christian must continually seek to crucify and put to death that dimension of our self that remains under the influence of the fallen state of the First Adam into which we are conceived and born. After our baptism, the imputed sin of our First Parents is washed from our life, however a residue or stain of the Original Sin remains with us, what is known as concupiscence. The effects of this residue or stain are experienced primarily in our will, tending in the direction of a love of self rather than a love of God. This is what is meant by a “disordered will.” This disorder can be expressed through our external senses as well as the operations of our soul, e.g., the imagination, memory and intellect. Mortification seeks to address these manifestations of the “disordered will.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Christianity]], common forms of mortification that are practiced to this day include [[fasting]], [[abstinence]], as well as pious [[kneeling]].&lt;ref name="WilkinsNadeau2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=John|last2=Nadeau|first2=Robin|title=A Companion to Food in the Ancient World|date=17 August 2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|language=English |isbn=9781405179409|page=83|quote=In this period Clement of Alexandria, St Jerome, and Tertullian make the mortification of the flesh by fasting and abstinence as a way to holiness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also common among Christian religious orders in the past were the wearing of [[sackcloth]], as well as [[Self-flagellation|flagellation]] in imitation of [[Jesus of Nazareth]]'s suffering and death by [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].

==Christianity==
{{further|Mortification (theology)}}

===Etymology===
The term "mortification of the flesh" comes from the [[Book of Romans]] in the [[Christian Bible]]: "For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live."&lt;ref name="bibleref2|Romans|8:13"&gt;{{bibleref2|Romans|8:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same idea is seen in the following verses: "Put to death what is earthly in you: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry";&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Colossians|3:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Galatians|5:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for such behavior in the [[Old Testament]] is found here: "Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Proverbs|20:30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian [[exegesis]], "deeds of the body" "what is earthly", refer to the "wounded nature" of man or his [[concupiscence]] (evil inclinations due to forming part of the [[Fall of Man]]); humanity suffers the consequences of the [[original sin]]. The Apostle Paul, who authored Romans, expected believers to "put to death" the deeds of the flesh.&lt;ref name="bibleref2|Romans|8:13"/&gt; This is because the word in [[Koine Greek]], the language in which the New Testament was originally written, for flesh is sarx (σάρξ).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4561&amp;t=ESV&lt;/ref&gt; This word denotes the fallen or sinful elements, parts, and proclivities of humanity. This word is juxtaposed in Romans 8:13, cited above, with body (σῶμα),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4983&amp;t=ESV&lt;/ref&gt; which more strictly refers to the physical body of a human. Thus in Romans 8:13 Paul is drawing a parallel between fallen people, with proclivities to sin without chance of redemption, and redeemed people who are so changed that mortification of their fleshly sin can turn to bodily life, from σάρξ to σῶμα.

===Forms===
In its simplest form, mortification of the flesh can mean merely denying oneself certain pleasures, such as permanently or temporarily [[abstinence|abstaining]] (i.e. [[fasting]]), from food, [[Christianity and alcohol|alcoholic beverages]], sexual relations, or an area of life that makes the person's spiritual life more difficult or burdensome. It can also be practiced by choosing a simple or even impoverished lifestyle; this is often one reason many [[monasticism|monks of various religions]] take vows of poverty. Among votarists, traditional forms of physical mortification are the [[cilice|cilice and hair-shirts]]. In some of its more severe forms, it can mean using a discipline to flagellate oneself.

===Purposes===
In Christianity, the Rev. Michael Geisler, a Catholic priest of the [[Controversies about Opus Dei|Opus Dei]] Prelature in St. Louis, wrote two articles explaining the theological purpose behind corporal mortification. "Self-denial helps a person overcome both psychological and physical weakness, gives him energy, helps him grow in virtue and ultimately leads to salvation. It conquers the insidious demons of softness, pessimism and lukewarm faith that dominate the lives of so many today" (''Crisis magazine'' July/August 2005). Some theologians explain that the redemptive value of pain makes pain lovable in its effects, even though by itself it is not. Pain is temporal and limited, thus to undergo it is worthwhile to gain the real benefits. For those with this viewpoint, pain is seen as a means to an end. Thus, a modern [[Catholic]] saint, Josemaria Escriva said, while consoling a dying woman who was suffering in a hospital, "Blessed be pain! Glorified be pain! Sanctified be pain!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josemariaescriva.info/article/opus-dei-founder-blessed-be-suffering Josemaria Escriva. Founder of Opus Dei -Blessed be Suffering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the modern-day perplexity over mortification, according to some theologians, is the "practical denial of [[God]]," a refusal to accept any but material realities.

The early Christian evangelist and church-planter Paul wrote, "I chastise my body and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps when I have preached to others I myself should be castaway" ([[1 Corinthians|1 Cor]] 9:27); "In my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, that is the Church." ([[Colossians|Col]] 1:24).

Through the centuries, some Christians have practiced voluntary penances as a way of imitating Jesus who, according to the New Testament, voluntarily accepted the sufferings of his passion and death on the cross at Calvary in order to redeem humankind.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Some Christians note that the cross carried by Jesus is the crossbar or ''patibulum'', a rough tree trunk, which probably weighed between 80 and 110 pounds.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Christ also fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, an example of submission to the first person of the Trinity, God the Father, and as a way of preparing for ministry. 
The early Christians mortified the flesh through martyrdom and through what has been called "confession of the faith": accepting torture in a joyful way.

[[File:Battenti guardia1.jpg|thumb|A Catholic [[Procession#Christian processions|Christian procession]] with ''battenti'' (beaters) in the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Guardia Sanframondi]]]]
Some canonized Catholic saints and founders of Roman Catholic religious organizations practiced mortification in order to imitate Christ.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Another way of self-denial that developed quickly in the early centuries was [[celibacy]], which the Roman Catholic tradition interprets as forsaking sex and procreation for a superior chastity and higher supernatural ends. Women affected by the eating disorder [[anorexia mirabilis]] often engaged in rituals aimed at causing them pain and injury, to remind them of Christ's suffering and make them unattractive to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pleaseholdmagazine.com/elizabeth-harper.html|title=Elizabeth Harper|website=Please Hold Magazine|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lutheranism====
The [[Augsburg Confession]] of the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran Church]] supports the practice of mortification of the flesh, stating:
{{quote|For they [our teachers] have always taught concerning the cross that it behooves Christians to bear afflictions. This is the true, earnest, and unfeigned mortification, to wit, to be exercised with divers afflictions, and to be crucified with Christ. Moreover, they teach that every Christian ought to train and subdue himself with bodily restraints, or bodily exercises and labors that neither satiety nor slothfulness tempt him to sin, but not that we may merit grace or make satisfaction for sins by such exercises. And such external discipline ought to be urged at all times, not only on a few and set days. So Christ commands, Luke 21:34: Take heed lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting; also Matt. 17:21: This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. Paul also says, 1 Cor. 9:27: I keep under my body and bring it into subjection. Here he clearly shows that he was keeping under his body, not to merit forgiveness of sins by that discipline, but to have his body in subjection and fitted for spiritual things, and for the discharge of duty according to his calling.&lt;ref name="Neve1914"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neve|first=Juergen Ludwig|title=The Augsburg Confession: A Brief Review of Its History and an Interpretation of Its Doctrinal Articles, with Introductory Discussions on Confessional Questions|accessdate=1 March 2015|year=1914|publisher=Lutheran Publication Society|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the [[Lutheran]] tradition, mortification of the flesh is not done in order to earn [[Merit (Catholicism)|merit]], but instead to "keep the body in a condition such that it does not hinder one from doing what one has been commanded to do, according to one's calling (Latin: ''juxta vocationem suam'')."&lt;ref name="Weber2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=The Protestant Ethic and the "spirit" of Capitalism and Other Writings|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780140439212|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', [[Martin Luther]] stated that "inner repentance is worthless unless it produces various outward mortification of the flesh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theses, Ninety-five, of Luther.|year=2000|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He practiced mortification of the flesh through [[fasting]] and [[self-flagellation]], even sleeping in a stone cell without a blanket.&lt;ref name="Lindberg1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=Carter|title=Martin Luther: Justified by Grace|year=1988|publisher=Graded Press|language=English|isbn=9780939697557|page=16|quote=Luther subjected himself to long periods of fasting and self-flagellation.

====Methodism====

{{further|Works of Piety}}
[[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley Sr.]] examined the writings of [[Thomas à Kempis]] on the mortification of the flesh and concluded that "mortification is still an indispensable Christian duty."&lt;ref name="Torpy2009"/&gt; His son, [[John Wesley]], the evangelical Christian progenitor of the [[Methodist Church]] continued "to hold à Kempis in high regard".&lt;ref name="Torpy2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Torpy|first=Arthur Alan|title=The Prevenient Piety of Samuel Wesley, Sr.|date=26 October 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English |isbn=9780810870826|page=104|quote=Samuel weighed the pros and cons of Thomas à Kempis on the mortification of the flesh with Samuel taking a moderate position between two extremes. As for T. Kempsis, all the world are apt to strain o' one side or t'other. And 'tis no wonder if contemplative men...when they observed how mad the bulk of the world was for sensual pleasures, should run the matter too far o' the contrary extreme, and attempt to persuade us to have no senses at all ...But for all that, mortification is still an indispensable Christian duty." John, in his later years, would continue to hold à Kempis in high regard, recommending him to Sammie Wesley, Charles's son, for edification and hoped for evangelical conversion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he likewise wrote that "efforts to manifest true faith would be 'quickened' by self mortification and entire obedience".&lt;ref name="Anderson2012"/&gt; Moreover, he "spoke approvingly of 'voluntary instances of mortification' in his journals".&lt;ref name="Anderson2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Misty G.|title=Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth-Century Britain: Enthusiasm, Belief, and the Borders of the Self|date=14 March 2012|publisher=JHU Press|language=English |isbn=9781421404806|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodist [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] were known for practicing the [[spiritual discipline]] of mortifying the flesh as they "arose well before dawn for solitary prayer; they remained on their knees [[Fasting#Methodism|without food or drink]] or physical comforts sometimes for hours on end".&lt;ref name="Bratt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bratt|first=James D.|title=By the Vision of Another World: Worship in American History|year=2012|publisher=Wm.

{{quotation|By using yourselves to consideration, you will come to be aware of the snares that your spiritual enemies lay for you, of the snake under the green grass, and will not be imposed upon so easily as many are by the wiles of Satan; and by habituating yourselves to [[self-denial]] and mortification of the flesh, and a holy contempt of this world, you will wrest the most dangerous weapons of the hand of the strong man armed, and will take from him that part of his armour most trusted, for it is by the world and the flesh that he mostly fights against us: nay, and this sober-mindedness will put you the whole [[armour of God]], that you may be able to stand in the evil day; and so to resist the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]], that he may flee from you.&lt;ref name="WesleyanMethodistMagazine1813"&gt;{{cite book|title=Wesleyan-Methodist Magazine, Volume 36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzJAAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=12 June 2016|year=1813|language=English |page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Western Orthodoxy====
The [[Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate]] states that "mortification of the flesh, or the putting to death of the passions which hinder attainment of the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|kingdom of heaven]], is practiced with three disciplines of [[self-denial]]".&lt;ref name="AWRV"/&gt; These [[spiritual discipline]]s include "unostentatious fasting or self-denial; increased prayer, by attending to worship and various devotions; and the sacrificial giving of [[alms]] (charitable donations)."&lt;ref name="AWRV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiochian.org/node/25432|title=The Holy Season of Lent in the Western Tradition|last=Fenton|first=John W.|publisher=[[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese]]|language=English|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Christian viewpoints====
It became "quite common" for members of the [[Oxford Movement]] within the [[Anglican Communion]] to practice self-flagellation using a [[discipline (mortification)|discipline]].&lt;ref name="Yates1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yates|first=Nigel|title=Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780198269892|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Congregationalist]] writer and leader within the [[evangelical Christian]] movement, [[Sarah Osborn]], practiced self-flagellation in order "to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God".&lt;ref name="Rubin1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Julius H.|title=Religious Melancholy and Protestant Experience in America|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780195083019|page=115|quote=In the many letters to her correspondents, Fish, Anthony, Hopkins, and Noyes, Osborn examined the state of her soul, sought spiritual guidance in the midst of her perplexities, and created a written forum for her continued self-examination. She cultivated an intense and abiding spirit of evangelical humiliation--self-flagellation and self-torture to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other evangelical Christian commentators, using Paul's writings and other passages from the New Testament to justify the practise of mortification of the flesh is a complete misinterpretation. In the verses leading up to Col 1:24 Paul holds a very high view of Christ's redeeming work.  "He understands this redemptive work to be finished, completed, and perfected.  Nothing remains to be done, and the suffering of Christ's followers does not put the finishing touches on the triumph of Calvary.  Paul does not believe that suffering has any atoning benefit for himself or for others.  It does, however, 'serve to increase Paul's living knowledge of Christ.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colossians and Philemon |series=The NIV Application Commentary |author=Darrel E. Garland |publisher=[[Zondervan]] |year=1998 |page=127 |isbn=978-0-310-57098-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suffering Paul refers to comes as one takes on the commission to share the gospel.  Persecution and suffering such as that experienced by Christ will follow and Christians should see this suffering as a divine necessity. In chapter 9 "Paul compares the evangelistic lifestyle of believers to athletes who sacrifice normal pursuits for the sake of strict training and a competitive edge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=1 Corinthians |series=The NIV Application Commentary |author=Craig L. Blomberg |publisher=[[Zondervan]] |year=1994 |page=189 |isbn=978-0-310-48490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Corinth church there were grey areas of lifestyle and behaviors (see 1 Cor 8) not specifically covered by the Mosaic law, and Paul was encouraging them to discipline themselves to abstain from those behaviors and practices for the sake of winning others to Christ.  Mortification of the flesh being [[self-flagellation]] is something that is read into the text and an errant interpretation of it.

==Analogous non-Christian concepts==

===Indigenous practices and shamanism===
Some indigenous cultures' shamans believe that endurance of pain or denial of appetites serves to increase spiritual power. In many indigenous cultures, painful rites are used to mark sexual maturity, marriage, procreation, or other major life stages. In Africa and Australia, indigenous people sometimes use genital mutilation on boys and girls that is intentionally painful, including [[circumcision]], [[subincision]], [[clitoridectomy]], [[genital piercing|piercing]], or [[infibulation]]. In some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes enduring [[scarification]] or the bites of ants are common rituals to mark a boy's transition to adulthood. Human rights organizations in several areas of the world have protested some of these methods, which can be forced upon the participants, although some are voluntary and are a source of pride and status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthro.palomar.edu/social/soc_4.htm Rites of passage in Indigenous cultures, article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamans often use painful rites and self-denial such as fasting or celibacy to attain transformation, or to commune with spirits.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacred Pain-Hurting the Body for the sake of the Soul'', A. Glucklich, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular practices===
[[File:Energypull.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A group of people engaged in a modern secular ritual called ''pulling'']]
It has been speculated that extreme practices of mortification of the flesh may be used to obtain an [[altered state of consciousness]] to achieve spiritual experiences or [[vision (religion)|vision]]s. In modern times, members of the [[Church of Body Modification]] believe that by manipulating and modifying their bodies (by painful processes) they can strengthen the bond between their bodies and spirits, and become more spiritually aware. This group uses rites of passage from many traditions including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[shamanism]], to seek their aims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscobm.com/ Church of Body Modification]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some contexts, modern practices of body modification and plastic surgery overlap with mortification. Often, secular people will undergo painful experiences in order to become more self-aware, to take control of their bodies or "own" them more fully, to bond with a group that is spiritual in its aims, or to overcome the body's limitations in ways that do not refer to any higher power. Many times these rites are intended to empower the participant, rather than humble them. This represents a very different aim than many traditional mortifications.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Flesh: The Cultural Politics of Body Modification,'' Victoria L. Pitts, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roland Loomis]] re-creates [[Sun Dance|Sun dance]] ceremonies and [[Suspension (body modification)|suspensions]] for those who believe these painful procedures expand their consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Gay Body, a Journey through Shadow to Self, ''M. Thompson, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Musafar explains his use of these rites as a way to awaken the spirit to the body's limits, and put it in control of them. Others who have used these experiences to transcend physical limitations report a feeling of mastery over their physical circumstance, along with a widened perspective.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Primitives'', Vale and Juno, RE/Search press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Putuo''' ({{zh|c=普陀山|p=Pǔtúo Shān|l=(from [[Sanskrit]]) [[Mount Potalaka]]}}) is an [[island]] southeast of [[Shanghai]], in [[Zhoushan]] prefecture of [[Zhejiang]] province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It is a renowned site in [[Chinese Buddhism]], and is considered the [[bodhimanda]] of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokitesvara]] ([[Guanyin]]). Mount Putuo is one of the four sacred mountains in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the others being [[Mount Wutai]], [[Mount Jiuhua]], and [[Mount Emei]] (Bodhimandas for [[Manjusri]], [[Ksitigarbha]], and [[Samantabhadra]] respectively).

Mount Putuo lies in the [[East China Sea]] and incorporates the beauty of both mountain and sea. Mountain Putuo is at 29°58′3～30°02′3 north latitude, 122°21′6～122°24′9 east longitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mountain Putuo Tour Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|year=2000|isbn=9787101026894|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its area is approximately {{convert|12.5|km2}} and there are numerous famous temples. Every year on the 19th day of the 2nd lunar month, 19th day of the 6th lunar month, and 19th day of the 9th lunar month of the [[Chinese calendar]], it welcomes millions of people for the celebration of the birth of Guanyin.

== History ==
Mount Putuo has been a pilgrimage site for over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pilgrimage.asiasociety.org/artifacts/the-complete-map-imperially-established-south-sea-mount-putuo-area|title=THE COMPLETE MAP OF THE IMPERIALLY ESTABLISHED SOUTH SEA MOUNT PUTUO AREA|publisher=[[Asia Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Tang dynasty]], Mount Putuo became a center of Guanyin worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/island-of-guanyin-9780190456191?cc=th&amp;lang=en&amp;|title= M.Bingenheimer: Island of Guanyin|publisher=[[OUP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally there were three main temples: The [[Puji Temple|Puji si]] ({{zh|c=普濟寺|labels=no}}, founded 10th cent.), the [[Fayu Temple|Fayu si]] ({{zh|c=法雨寺|labels=no}}, founded 1580 CE), and the Huiji si ({{zh|c=慧濟寺|labels=no}}, founded 1793 CE). The site has received numerous renowned visitors over the ages, including the then 20-year-old future Chan-master [[Yinyuan Longqi]] (Japanese: Ingen), who came to the site in 1612, while looking for his father, who had disappeared fifteen years earlier. The modern scholar-monk [[Taixu]] spent several years in solitary retreat at a small hermitage on Putuo.

== Temples ==
*Putuo is covered with many temples and monasteries, both large and small. All are under the directive of the [[Chinese Buddhist Association]]. Many monks and nuns from all over the country, and abroad, go to great lengths to live and practice there. Today, there are more than 30 major temples located at Mount Putuo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482251/Mount-Putuo-Island mount Putuo Island].

== Other features ==
*{{convert|33|m|adj=on}} tall statue of the [[Guanyin]] at Zizhulin ({{zh|c=紫竹林|labels=no}})

== Transport ==
Many of the [[Zhoushan]] Islands are now linked by bridges. This means that Putuoshan can easily be reached by bus from [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. The bus terminates at Shenjiamen Bus Station. From the Banshengdong Wharf on the Shenjiamen waterfront it is a 10-minute ride by fast ferry (22 [[RMB]]) to Putuoshan. In Shanghai, the Nanpu Bridge Bus Station, Shanghai Stadium Sightseeing Bus Center and Shanghai South Long Distance Bus Station have several departures daily to Shenjiamen (4–5 hours, 138 RMB). In Ningbo, the North and South bus stations both have regular daily departures to Shenjiamen (2–3 hours, 60 RMB).

There are two flights daily from [[Hongqiao Airport]] in Shanghai to Putuo Airport which is only {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} from Shenjiamen. (approx 800 RMB).

The ferry services mentioned below are still{{when|date=April 2017}} available but the bus services now provide a greater level of convenience and comfort. 
Putuoshan can be reached by boat from the major cities of Ningbo and Shanghai. It will take approximately an hour by boat to reach the wharf at Ningbo, from where a bus transports passengers to Ningbo city centre. There are two boats linking Putuoshan and Shanghai. One departs in the evening and travels overnight, arriving in the early morning; the other leaves early in the day from a wharf outside of Shanghai city centre but takes less than two hours.

The transportation system of  Mountain Putuo  is very special. Private cars are not allowed there, and people can only rely on public transport. The reason for this rule is because the area of Putuo Mountain is very small, and only one road runs through the entire island. It is therefore necessary to control the number of cars on the island to avoid traffic congestion. At the same time, excessive vehicle emissions will affect the environment and air quality of Mountain Putuo. In addition, Putuo Mount is mountainous, so buses are not flexible enough for people to travel. And as there are thousands of tourists coming to Mountain Putuo and the number of buses is far from enough, the cable car has become another important means of transportation.

== Weather ==
It is an Asian warm-temperate moist climate (''Cfa'') and has four distinct seasons. It has plenty of rain and fog. The average temperature of whole year is {{convert|16.1|°C|°F|0}}. The coldest month is January, average temperature is {{convert|5.4|°C|°F|0}}. The hottest month is August, temperature is {{convert|27.0|°C|°F|0}}. It has typhoon season on July, August and September. The average speed of wind is {{convert|4.2|to|5.7|m/s|km/h|0}}.

The Mount Putuo has all-year-round travel seasons, but in regard to when and where to get on the island, tourists should be careful and check the weather forecast beforehand.

It is a private [[co-educational]] [[International school|international]] [[Bahá'í school]], drawing students from all over the world and is under the supervision of the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of India.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://www.nehsindia.org/aboutus/background/background.php3 Background statement of the school]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was founded in August 1945, and was one of the first [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] education projects in India.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, the school setup programmes to assist the poor and underdeveloped villages in the region.&lt;ref name="early"&gt;[http://www.nehsindia.org/aboutus/history/1971_1982/1971_1982.php3 History: 1971-1982]&lt;/ref&gt;  It started as a service project for students and evolved into a separate institution known as the New Era Development Institute in 1987.&lt;ref name="second"&gt;[http://www.nehsindia.org/aboutus/history/1982_1998/1982_1998.php3 History: 1982-1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í Faith in Norway|National Spiritual Assembly of Norway]] established an institution - Norwegian Agency for International Development Cooperation - and in 1988 it began a working relationship with the institute, with support for a two-year rural community development program. In 1989, funding was extended to cover a one-year community development facilitators course and short courses on agriculture, rural technology, literacy, and domestic science.

NEHS is one of the top boarding schools in India. It did have a higher secondary school(11th-12th) till 1999, but  discontinued it from 2000. Class 11th and 12th have been reintroduced from 2010 and the school offers Science and Commerce fields. The shooting of the film "Taare Zameen Par" took place here. The school played host to "Amul Junior MasterChef Swaad ke Ustaad" (a cooking reality show) where the contestants prepared food for the students of the school. The show was aired on Star Plus on October 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starplus.in/junior-masterchef-swaad-ke-ustaad/videos.aspx?showid=627&amp;vid=54807&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent students include Twinkle and Rinke Khanna - daughters of the Indian actress Dimple.

'''Nine of Cups''' is a card used in Latin suited playing cards which include [[tarot|tarot decks]]. It is part of what [[tarot reading|tarot card readers]] call the "[[Minor Arcana]]"

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[Tarocchi|Tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

  | date = 1980
  | isbn = 0-7156-1014-7
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==

''Having your wish fulfilled. Achieving what you desire. Obtaining your goal. Getting what you think you want. Having your dream come true.

Feeling satisfied. Indulging in a little smugness. Enjoying the situation just as it is. Feeling pleased as punch. Getting the results you hoped for. Feeling all's well with the world. Being contented.

Enjoying sensual pleasure. Experiencing luxury. Savoring a delicious meal.  Appreciating the arts. [[sexual intercourse|Making love]].''

In its reversed position, this card indicates unrealistic wishes or dreams which are not destined to become reality.

'''Our Lady of Good Counsel''' ({{lang-la|Mater boni consilii}}) is a [[Titles of Mary|title]] given to the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], after a painting said to be miraculous, now found in the thirteenth century [[Hermits of St. Augustine|Augustinian]] church at [[Genazzano]], near Rome, Italy. Measuring 40 by 45 centimeters the image is a fresco executed on a thin layer of plaster no thicker than an egg shell.&lt;ref name=mauriello/&gt; Over the centuries, devotions to Our Lady of the Good Counsel grew among saints and Popes, to the extent that a reference to it was added to the [[Litany of Loreto]] and the devotion spread throughout the world. Her feast day is April 26.
{{RC-Mariology}}

==Background==
In the 5th century, during the reign of Pope [[Sixtus III]], the town of [[Genazzano]], about {{convert|30|mi}} south of Rome, had contributed a large portion of its revenue for the Roman basilica now known as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. In appreciation, a church, called Santa Maria, was built in Genazzano and was later entrusted to the [[Augustinian Order]] in 1356.&lt;ref name=mauriello&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/Fall99.html Mauriello, Matthew R., "Our Lady of Good Counsel", ''Fairfield County Catholic'', January 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Genazzano church became a popular place of pilgrimage. Numerous cures were said took place there. The Augustinian friars were invited to minister to the spiritual needs of the pilgrims. They continue to serve there to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Thomas|title=Our Mother of Good Counsel|url=http://midwestaugustinians.org/our-mother-of-good-counsel|website=Midwest Augustinians|publisher=Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|left|''Our Lady of Good Counsel'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]
According to tradition, over time the old Augustinian church of Santa Maria in Genazzano fell into disrepair. A local widow undertook to renovate the church but ran out of funds, for which she was heartily mocked for her lack of foresight. In the year 1467, in the midst of the festivities for the [[Feast of Saint Mark]], the townfolk suddenly heard "exquisite music." A mysterious cloud was then said to have descended and obliterated an unfinished wall of the parish church. In front of the populace, the cloud dissipated and a beautiful [[fresco]], no thicker than a [[carte-de-visite]] and no more than eighteen inches square, of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child was revealed. It was widely believed that it had been miraculously transported from a church in Scutari, Albania,&lt;ref name=mauriello/&gt; when that area was besieged by the Turks.

The picture of Our Lady was at first called "La Madonna del Paradiso" and now better known as "Madonna del Buon Consiglio" (Our Lady of Good Counsel).&lt;ref name=middleton&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11361a.htm Middleton, Thomas. "Feast of Our Lady of Good Counsel." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Such was the holy image's reputation that [[Pope Urban VIII]] made a "glittering" pilgrimage there in 1630, invoking the protection of the Queen of Heaven, as did [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1864. On November 17, 1682, [[Pope Innocent XI]] had the picture [[canonical coronation|solemnly crowned]].&lt;ref name=frisk/&gt; Among her noted clients have been St [[Aloysius Gonzaga]], St [[Alphonsus Liguori]], St [[John Bosco]], and Blessed [[Stephen Bellesini]].

==History==

Art experts consulted during a restoration conducted between 1957 and 1959 suggest that the image of the Madonna was once part of a larger fresco that covered the wall and was subsequently covered over with plaster. They believe the fresco is likely the work of the early fifteenth century artist [[Gentile da Fabriano]], probably painted around the time of [[Pope Martin V]] (1417-1431).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augustinianfriends.org/saints/goodcounsel.htm|title=Augustinian Friends, An Online Home for Augustinian Spirituality|website=www.augustinianfriends.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a statue in the German town of Essen which depicts this Mary.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Devotions===
On April 22, 1903, [[Pope Leo XIII]] included the invocation "Mater boni consilii" in the [[Litany of Loreto]]. In 1939, Venerable [[Pope Pius XII]] placed his pontificate under the maternal care of Our Lady of Good Counsel and composed a prayer to her.&lt;ref name=frisk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/olgc.html|title=International Marian Research Institute Home : University of Dayton, Ohio|website=campus.udayton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''This Saint's for You'' by Thomas J. Craughwell 2007 {{ISBN|1-59474-184-0}} page 172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The Augustinian Order contributed to the spread of this devotion internationally. In 1753, Pope [[Benedict XIV]] established the Pious Union of Our Lady of Good Counsel. [[Leo XIII]], who was himself a member of the pious union, was deeply attached to this devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 515&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years, various institutions have been named in honor of Mary under the title of Our Lady of Good Counsel. These institutions include a [[college]], [[high school]]s, and [[church (building)|churches]].

Her Feast is celebrated on April 26.

== The White Scapular ==

The small [[Scapular]] of Our Lady of Good Counsel (the White Scapular) was presented by the [[Hermits of St Augustine]] to Pope [[Leo XIII]], who, on December 19-21, 1893, approved it and endowed it with indulgences in a Decree of the Congregation of Rites.

On the front panel of the [[sacramental]] (to be made of white wool) is the image of the fresco of Our Lady of Good Counsel, with the inscription, “Mater boni consilii [ora pro nobis].”  On the second segment is found the papal coat-of-arms, which includes the [[Papal tiara|Triple Tiara]] and the [[Keys of Heaven]], with the words of Leo XIII:  “Fili acquisce consiliis ejus” (Child, listen to her counsels). 

==Patronage==
Our Lady of Good Counsel is the Patroness of the [[Maria Teresia Ledóchowska|Missionary Sisters of Saint Peter Claver]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clavermissionarysisters.org/?page_id=289|title=The Story of Our Lady of Good Counsel - Missionary Sisters of St Peter Claver of North America|website=www.clavermissionarysisters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Council of Catholic Women, and of the Catholic Women's League of Canada.

The [http://www.midwestaugustinians.org "Midwest Augustinians"] headquartered in Chicago have also adopted Our Lady of Good Counsel as their patroness, having named their Augustinian jurisdiction as the "Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel."

The town Essen in the German Ruhr- Area is under the patronage of the Lady. The High church the Münster of Essen as it is called was given to her after the Ruhrbistum was established.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Legacy==
Our Lady of Good Counsel in White Plains, New York is the site of the motherhouse of the [[Sisters of the Divine Compassion]]. The [[Good Counsel Complex]] is on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:9595 - Milano - Museo archeologico - Patera di Parabiago - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 13 Mar 2012.jpg|thumb|Detail: [[Cybele]] and [[Attis]] group.]]

The '''Parabiago plate''', also known as the '''Parabiago patera''',&lt;ref&gt;The plate is actually not a [[patera]], however.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Roman art|ancient Roman]] circular silver plate depicting mythological figures. It was found in an [[Roman funerals and burial|ancient Roman cemetery]] at [[Parabiago]], near [[Milan]], in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth E. Leader-Newby, ''Silver and Society in Late Antiquity: Functions and Meanings of Silver Plate in the Fourth to Seventh Centuries'' (Ashgate, 2004), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The plate depicts [[Cybele]] with her consort [[Attis]] in a "vast cosmic setting"&lt;ref&gt;Giulia Sfameni Gasparro, ''Soteriology and Mystic Aspects in the Cult of Cybele and Attis'' (Brill, 1985), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; amid "sun, moon, earth and sea, time and the seasons."&lt;ref&gt;John Ferguson, ''The Religions of the Roman Empire'' (Cornell University Press, 1970, 1985), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its discovery, it was thought to have been used as a lid for a funerary [[amphora]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus'' (Cambridge University Press, 1940 edition, 2010 reprinting), vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 1127–1128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plate is difficult to date. Earlier scholars tended to date it to the 2nd century AD, because of its classicizing style, but stylistic characteristics also permit a later date. Technical analyses, however, support a provenance in the 4th–5th centuries, even though it bears little stylistic resemblance to other silver pieces from that period.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, ''Silver and Society in Late Antiquity,'' p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The plate weighs 3555 g and measures 390 mm in diameter. It has a foot-ring of 26 mm in height. The surface is worked with figures in high relief.&lt;ref&gt;Leader-Newby, ''Silver and Society in Late Antiquity,'' p. 146. Unless otherwise noted, the following description of the figures on the plate is that of Leader-Newby.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pioneer''' is a volunteer [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] who leaves his or her home to journey to another place (often another country) for the purpose of teaching the [[Bahá'í Faith]].  The act of so moving is termed '''pioneering'''. Bahá'ís refrain from using the term "missionary". The first pioneer to enter a country or region mentioned in [[`Abdu'l-Bahá|`Abdu'l-Bahá's]] [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]] is given the title of [[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh|Knight of Bahá'u'lláh]].

During the [[Ten Year Crusade]] which ran from 1953 to 1963, hundreds of pioneers settled in countries and territories throughout the world, which eventually led to the establishment of 44 new National and Regional [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]] and the increase in the Bahá'í population.

==Teaching work==
The teaching work done by pioneers was done in many different ways including, but not limited to
*Conversation with people who are receptive to the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith.
*Firesides: meetings held in one's home to which those interested in the Bahá’í Faith are invited.
*Public talks: Lectures given about the Bahá’í Faith.
[[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá’í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, has written:

:"An effort, moreover, can and should be made, not only by representative Bahá'í bodies, but also by prospective teachers, as well as by other individual believers, deprived of the privilege of visiting those shores or of settling on that continent, to seize every opportunity that presents itself to make the acquaintance, and awaken the genuine interest, of such people who are either citizens of these countries, or are in any way connected with them, whatever be their interests or profession. Through the kindness shown them, or any literature which may be given them, or any connection which they may establish with them, the American believers can thereby sow such seeds in their hearts as might, in future circumstances, germinate and yield the most unexpected results.&lt;ref name="advent"&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1938 |title = The Advent of Divine Justice |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-195-7 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/ADJ/adj-3.html#pg66 |page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching versus proselytization==
For Bahá'ís, pioneering refers to something similar to missionary work. However, Bahá'ís do not consider pioneering to be [[proselytism]], a word which often implies the use of coercion to convert someone to a different religion.

:"Care, however, should, at all times, be exercised, lest in their eagerness to further the international interests of the Faith they frustrate their purpose, and turn away, through any act that might be misconstrued as an attempt to proselytize and bring undue pressure upon them, those whom they wish to win over to their Cause."&lt;ref name="advent" /&gt;

:"It is true that Bahá'u'lláh lays on every Bahá'í the duty to teach His Faith. At the same time, however, we are forbidden to proselytize, so it is important for all the believers to understand the difference between teaching and proselytizing. It is a significant difference and, in some countries where teaching a religion is permitted, but proselytizing is forbidden, the distinction is made in the law of the land. Proselytizing implies bringing undue pressure to bear upon someone to change his Faith. It is also usually understood to imply the making of threats or the offering of material benefits as an inducement to conversion. In some countries mission schools or hospitals, for all the good they do, are regarded with suspicion and even aversion by the local authorities because they are considered to be material inducements to conversion and hence instruments of proselytization."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the [[Universal House of Justice]], 1982 Jan 03, Teaching vs. Proselytizing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a letter written on behalf of [[Shoghi Effendi]] to an individual:
:"He sees no objection to the word Missionary appearing on your passport as long as it is clearly understood what kind of a ‘missionary’ a Bahá’í pioneer is. In the best and highest sense of the term it certainly could be applied to our teachers. Unfortunately this word has often been associated with a narrow-minded, bigoted type of proselytizing quite alien to the Bahá’í method of spreading our teachings."&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by Shoghi Effendi on February 7, 1945 published in {{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |author2=The Universal House of Justice |editor=Hornby, Helen |year = 1983  |title = Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India  |isbn = 81-85091-46-3 |url = http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widespread effect==
During [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s lifetime (died 1892) he encouraged some of his followers to move to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/encyclopedia_history Bahá'í History] by [[Moojan Momen]] and Peter Smith&lt;/ref&gt; When the religion began to grow in [[Bahá'í Faith in India|India]], other Bahá'ís moved on - for example entering [[Bahá'í Faith in Vietnam|Vietnam]] and other places in 1950s.&lt;ref name="sharin"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.religiousunity.org/BahArt/Shirin%20Fozdar.htm | title = Shirin Fozdar: An Outstanding Pioneer | first = Anil | last = Sarwal | journal = Bahá'í Digest | year = 1989 | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s the Bahá'í Faith spread rapidly in Vietnam, and the nearby countries of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith in the Philippines|Philippines]].&lt;ref name="momem1"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/bahai/intro9.htm | title = A Short Introduction to the Bahá'í Faith | chapter = The Bahá'í Today | first = Moojan | last = Momen|authorlink=Moojan Momen | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1957 to 1963 the Bahá'í community in Vietnam had more than tripled.&lt;ref name="custodians"&gt;{{cite book |author = Rabbani, R.

The [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]] to the followers of the religion in the [[North America]], especially to the [[United States]], in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion until 1921 when he died, asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  Their publication was delayed in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of the [[First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. Following their publication  the first Bahá'í permanent resident in South America, [[Leonora Armstrong]], arrived in Brazil in 1921.&lt;ref name="75th"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bahá'í International Community  | title = Brazilian parliament honors leading Bahá'í dignitary| journal = OneCountry | volume = 8 | issue = 2| year = 1996 | url = http://www.onecountry.org/oc82/oc8201as.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt;  In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear =  |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id = OCLC 5806374 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19th calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb  | first = Artemus  | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises  |date=November 1995  | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937-44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across Latin America. The first pioneer to Chile arrived in 1940 when her ship docked at [[Arica]].&lt;ref name="steward"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Janet | last = Ruhe-Schoen | title = An Enchantment of the Heart - A Portrait of Marcia Steward, Knight of Bahá’u’lláh, First Bahá’í Pioneer to Chile and the Marshall Islands  | work = The Chilean Temple Initiative | year = 2007 | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States | url = http://www.chilean-temple.org/images/stories/Early%20Baha/%27is/an_enchantment_of_the_heart.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Panama in 1940,&lt;ref name="communidad"&gt;{{cite web

'''Redbird Smith''' (1850–1918) was a [[Cherokee]] traditionalist and political activist. He helped found the [[Nighthawk Keetoowah Society]], who revitalized traditional spirituality among Cherokees from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Redbird Smith was born on July 19, 1850 near the current city of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]]. His father was Pig Redbird Smith, whose surname "Smith" was given to him by European-Americans since he worked as a blacksmith. Redbird Smith's mother was Lizzie Hildebrand Smith. His parents were removed from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to [[Indian Territory]]. Both his parents were ardent traditionalists, and at the age of ten, Redbird Smith's "father dedicated him to the services and cause of the Cherokee people in accordance with ancient customs and usages."&lt;ref&gt;Starr 479&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
The late 19th century the [[Dawes Commission]] sought to break up collective tribal land holdings into individual allotments and open up the "surplus" tribal lands to settlement by non-natives. Redbird Smith led a political resistance movement to the [[Dawes Allotment Act]] and sought to return to traditional Cherokee religion and values.&lt;ref name=c197&gt;Conley 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 and 1889, Redbird Smith served as a [[tribal council]]or from the Illinois District of the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;Starr 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Redbird Smith stated in the early 1900s: 
{{cquote|"I have always believed that the Great Creator had a great design for my people, the Cherokees. I have been taught that from my childhood up and now in my mature manhood I recognize it as a great truth. Our forces have been dissipated by the external forces, perhaps it has been just a training, but we must now get together as a race and render our contribution to mankind. We are endowed with intelligence, we are industrious, we are loyal and we are spiritual but we are overlooking the Cherokee mission on earth, for no man nor race is endowed with these qualifications without a designed purpose... Our pride in our ancestral heritage is our great incentive for handing something worthwhile to our posterity. It is this pride in ancestry that makes men strong and loyal for their principal in life. It is this same pride that makes men give up their all for their Government.&lt;ref&gt;Starr 481&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Redbird Smith repatriated [[wampum]] belts belonging to his tribe.&lt;ref name=c197/&gt; In 1910 he was selected as chief of the Nighthawk Keetoowahs.&lt;ref&gt;Conley 202&lt;/ref&gt; Previously he had served as their chairman.&lt;ref name=s480&gt;Starr 480&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1910, Smith and fellow Nighthawks traveled to [[Mexico]] with an 1820 document supporting Cherokee lands claims but the Mexican government did not support their claims. In 1914, he petitioned President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to create a Keetoowah reservation but this was seen as a backward step in the US federal government's [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policy. In 1921, a hundred Cherokees from 35 families moved together to the southeastern corner of [[Cherokee County, Oklahoma]], to create a traditional community — "the brainchild of Redbird Smith."&lt;ref&gt;Conley 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Redbird Smith married Lucy Fields Smith, born in [[Braggs, Oklahoma|Braggs, Indian Territory]] in 1852. She was the daughter Richard Fields and Eliza Brewer Fields. Together the Smiths had ten children who survived into adulthood, including eight sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name=s483/&gt;

Redbird Smith is the great-grandfather of former [[Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation]] [[Chad "Corntassel" Smith|Chad Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Conley 226&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
After falling ill for 48 hours, Redbird Smith died on November 8, 1918.&lt;ref name=s480/&gt; He is buried in the Redbird Smith Cemetery in [[Sequoyah County, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~oksequo2/redbird.html "Sequoyah County."] ''Rootsweb.'' (retrieved 24 Aug 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as chief of the Nighthawk Keetoowahs until his death and was succeeded by Levi Gritts.&lt;ref&gt;Starr 482&lt;/ref&gt; His son Sam Smith became chief of the Nighthawk Keetowahs on April 7, 1919.&lt;ref name=s483&gt;Starr 483&lt;/ref&gt;

The Redbirth Smith ground is an active ceremonial ground in Redbird Smith, Oklahoma, Sequoyah county, near Vian, where Smith's July 19 birthday is celebrated annually.

'''Religion''' in [[Papua New Guinea]] is predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], with traditional [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] often occurring less openly as another layer underneath or more openly side by side Christianity. The courts and government in both theory and practice uphold a constitutional right to freedom of speech, thought, and belief. A large majority of Papua New Guineans identify themselves as members of a Christian church (96% in the 2000 census); however, many combine their Christian faith with traditional indigenous beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24317.htm | accessdate = 2006-03-23 | title = US Department of State ''International Religious Freedom Report 2003''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other religions represented in the country include the [[Bahá'í faith]] and [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Papua New Guinea.

The 2010 [[Report on International Religious Freedom]] by the [[United States Department of State]] states that religious participations in the country are relatively peaceful and no reports of conflict are being reported. Public schools host a religious subject once per week and representatives of Christian churches teach the lessons, and the students attend the class operated by the church of their parents' choice. Children whose parents do not wish them to attend the classes are excused. Members of non-Christian religious groups are not numerous, and they use family and group gatherings before and after school for religious lessons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,COI,,,PNG,4cf2d074c,0.html 2010 Report on International Religious Freedom - Refworld]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
The 2000 census percentages were as follows:

*[[Roman Catholicism in Papua New Guinea|Roman Catholic Church]] (27.0%)
*[[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea]] (19.5%)
*[[United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands|United Church]] (11.5%)
*[[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (10.0%)

[[Iglesia Ni Cristo]], a Philippine base Christian church had already sets its foot in the country.

In 2010, emerging Christian denominations include the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and the [[Members Church of God International]].

The [[Papua New Guinea Council of Churches]] members are:
*Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea
*Gutnius Lutheran Church (associated with the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]])
*Union Baptist
*Roman Catholic Church
*Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea
*United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands
*Salvation Army

There are also a number of parachurch organizations:

*The [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] is a missionary institution drawing its support from conservative evangelical Protestant churches in the United States and to a lesser extent Australia; it translates the Bible into local languages and conducts extensive linguistic research.
*[[Young Women's Christian Association]]

==Bahá'í Faith==

{{main article|Bahá'í Faith in Papua New Guinea}}

The Bahá'í Faith in Papua New Guinea begins after 1916 with a mention by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the religion, that Bahá'ís should take the religion there.&lt;ref name="tab1"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan|edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-7.html.iso8859-1#pg41 | pages = 40–42 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'ís move there (what Bahá'ís mean by "[[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneering]]",) in Papua New Guinea arrived there in 1954.&lt;ref name="BWN"&gt;{{cite news | title =A life in pursuit of noble endeavors | newspaper =Bahá'í World News Service | publisher =Bahá’í International Community | date =29 June 2004 | url =http://news.bahai.org/story/307 | accessdate = December 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With local converts the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in 1958.&lt;ref name="BWN50th"&gt;{{cite news | title =Celebrations held throughout the land |newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | publisher = Bahá’í International Community | date =8 May 2004 | url =http://news.bahai.org/story/312 | accessdate = December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first National Spiritual Assembly was then elected in 1969.&lt;ref name="sum"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham | author2 = Universal House of Justice |title = National Spiritual Assemblies statistics 1923-1999 | work = Assorted Resource Tools | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation | accessdate = 2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the census of 2000 the number of Bahá'ís does not exceed 21000.&lt;ref name="CIARef"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =East &amp; Southeast Asia - Papua New Guinea | encyclopedia = CIA World Factbook | url =https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pp.html | date =November 13, 2012 | accessdate = December 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'')  estimated three times more Bahá'ís at 60000 or 0.9% of the nation in 2005&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way it is the largest minority religion in Papua New Guinea, if a small one. Among its more well known members are Margaret Elias and Sirus Naraqi.

Elias is the daughter of the first Papuan woman on the national assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Baha'is in PNG| work =| publisher =NSA of Baha'is of PNG| year =2012| url =http://www.bahai.org.pg/PNGBahais/| accessdate =December 11, 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130507155802/http://www.bahai.org.pg/PNGBahais/| archivedate =May 7, 2013| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country's first woman lawyer (in the 1970s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =From around the world, Bahá'í women converge on Beijing| journal =One Country|volume =7| issue =2| publisher =Bahá'í International Community| date =September 1995| url =http://www.onecountry.org/oc72/oc7208as.html | accessdate = December 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who attended the 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] and was awarded in 1995 and 2002 for her many years in the public service, particularly as in the national government and went on to support various initiatives for education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Elder, Papua New Guinea, Global University for Lifelong Learning| work =| publisher =Global University for Lifelong Learning| year =2012| url =http://www.gullonline.org/officers/elders/margaret-elias/index.html| accessdate =December 11, 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130622162813/http://www.gullonline.org/officers/elders/margaret-elias/index.html| archivedate =June 22, 2013| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naraqi lived and worked in Papua New Guinea from 1977–79 and 1983–98, partially doing clinical medical work as well as teaching at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]], where he was awarded in 1999 and had served as a member of the [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Board of Counsellors]] in Australasia since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =A special place in the rose garden | newspaper =Bahá'í World News Service | publisher =Bahá’í International Community | date =18 August 2004 | url =http://news.bahai.org/story/324 | accessdate = December 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam in Papua New Guinea]] counts for more than 5,000 followers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Growing numbers convert to Islam in PNG - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |url=https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-17/growing-numbers-convert-to-islam-in-png/209456 |website=mobile.abc.net.au |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4134125/The_Growing_Muslim_Minority_Community_in_Papua_New_Guinea|title=The growing muslim minority community in Papua New Guinea|publisher=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (most of whom are [[Sunni]]) mainly as a result of a recent spike in conversions. Despite being a dominant religion in neighbouring [[Indonesia]], adherents of [[Islam]] make up a small segment of the population. 

==Traditional religions==
Traditional religions are often [[Animism|animist]] and many have elements of [[ancestor worship]], synchronized with [[Shiva]] as well as tamam witches.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Zelenietz, Shirley Lindenbaum -Sorcery and Social Change in Melanesia  1981- Page 66  The body shadow or reflection of the tamam cannot fuse with &amp; finiik in the ancestral underworld, for a "witch's" finiik spirit entirely disintegrates at death. There are no tamam in the idyllic abode of the ancestors.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cargo cults==
Some [[cargo cults]] sprang up in PNG during the 20th century, including the Taro Cult and the events known as the [[Vailala Madness]].

'''Religious socialism''' is any form of [[socialism]] based on [[religious values]]. Members of several major [[religion]]s have found that their beliefs about [[human society]] fit with socialist principles and ideas. As a result, religious socialist movements have developed within these religions. Such movements include:
* [[Buddhist socialism]]
* [[Christian socialism]]
* [[Islamic socialism]]
* [[Jewish left|Jewish socialism]]

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sens and Auxerre''' ([[Latin]]: ''Archidioecesis Senonensis et Antissiodorensis''; [[French language|French]]: ''Archidiocèse de Sens et Auxerre'') is a [[Latin Rite]] [[Archdiocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in France. The Archdiocese comprises the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Yonne]], which is in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Bourgogne]]. Traditionally established in sub-apostolic times, the diocese as metropolis of Quarta Lugdunensis subsequently achieved metropolitical status. For a time, the Archbishop of Sens held the title "[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of the Gauls and Germania". Until 1622, it numbered seven [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan]] (subordinate) dioceses: the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chartres|Chartres]], [[Ancient Diocese of Auxerre|Auxerre]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Meaux|Meaux]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Paris]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orléans|Orléans]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nevers|Nevers]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Troyes|Troyes]], which inspired the acronym CAMPONT. The [[Titular see of Bethlehem#In Burgundy|Diocese of Bethléem]] at [[Clamecy, Nièvre|Clamecy]] was also dependent on the metropolitan see of Sens. The archdiocese is a suffragan of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dijon|Dijon]] and consequently no longer wears the pallium. The archbishop is Yves François Patenôtre, whose [[cathedra]] (seat) is at [[Sens Cathedral]] but who resides in Auxerre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dsens|Archdiocese of Sens (-Auxerre)|23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until the French Revolution, the Archbishop of Sens was also Viscount of Sens. In 1622, Paris had been elevated to a metropolitan see and the Sees of Chartres, Orléans and Meaux were separated from the Archdiocese of Sens. In return, the abbey of Mont Saint-Martin in the [[Diocese of Cambrai]] was united to the archiepiscopate. It was suppressed by the [[Napoleonic Concordat]] of 1802, which annexed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Troyes]] the Dioceses of Sens and [[Auxerre]]. The somewhat complex agreement gave the title of [[Bishop of Auxerre]] to the bishops of Troyes, and the purely honorary title of Archbishop of Sens to the Archbishop of Paris (otherwise deprived of all jurisdiction over Sens). The Concordat of 1817 reestablished the Archdiocese of Sens and the Diocese of Auxerre, but this arrangement did not last. The law of July 1821, the pontifical brief of 4 September 1821 and the royal ordinance of 19 October 1821 suppressed the Diocese of Auxerre and gave to the Archdiocese of Sens the Department of the Yonne and the Dioceses of Troyes, Nevers and Moulins. A [[papal brief]] of 3 June 1823 gave to the Archbishop of Sens the title of Bishop of Auxerre. The Archbishop of Sens continued to reside at Sens until the 1920s, but is now resident at Auxerre. In 2002 Sens-Auxerre lost its metropolitan functions with the creation of an archbishopric for the Burgundy administrative region at Dijon.

The history of the religious beginnings of the church at Sens dates from [[Savinian and Potentian]], and through legend to the Dioceses of Chartres, Troyes and Orléans. [[Gregory of Tours]] is silent regarding Savinian and Potentian, founders of the See of Sens; the [[Hieronymian Martyrology]], which was revised before 600 at Auxerre (or Autun) ignores them. The cities of [[Chartres]] and [[Troyes]] have nothing about these men in their local liturgy prior to the 12th century, and that of Orléans nothing prior to the 15th, pertaining to the preaching of Altinus, Eodaldus and Serotinus (companions of Savinian and Potentian). Before the ninth century there was (in the cemetery near the [[monastery of Pierre le Vif]] at Sens) a group of tombs, among which are those of the first bishops of Sens. In 847, the transfer of their remains to the church of St-Pierre le Vif inspired popular devotion towards Savinian and Potentian. In 848, [[Wandelbert of Prüm]] named them the first patrons of the church of Sens. [[Ado (archbishop)|Ado]], in his [[martyrology]] published shortly afterwards, speaks of them as envoys of the apostles and as martyrs. The ''[[Martyrology of Usuard]]'' (around 875) depicts them as envoys of the "Roman pontiff" and martyrs. In the middle of the 10th century the relics of these two saints were hidden in a subterranean vault of the Abbey of St-Pierre le Vif to escape the pillage of the Hungarians, but in 1031 they were placed in a [[reliquary]] established by the monk Odoranne. This monk (in a chronicle published about 1045) speaks of Altinus, Eodaldus, and Serotinus as apostolic companions of Savinian and Potentian, but does not view them as legitimate.

In a document which (according to the Abbé Bouvier) dates from the end of the sixth century or the beginning of the seventh—but according to [[Louis Duchesne]], who labels the Gerbertine legend as written in 1046 and 1079 under the inspiration of Gerbert, Abbot of St-Pierre le Vif—is first described a legend tracing to Savinian and Potentian (and their companions) the evangelization of the churches of Orléans, Chartres and Troyes. After some uncertainty, the legend became fixed in the chronicle of Clarius, compiled about 1120. The Christian faith could not have been preached at Sens in the second century, but we know from [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] that in 475 the Church of Sens had its 13th bishop; the list of bishops does not indicate that the episcopal see existed prior to the second half of the third century or the beginning of the fourth.

==Bishops and archbishops==

==={{anchor|To 1000}}Before 1000 AD===
Among the bishops of Sens in the '''fourth century''' were:
*[[St. Severinus]], present at the [[Council of Sardica]] in 344
*[[St. Ursicinus (356–387)|St. Ursicinus]] (356–387), exiled to [[Phrygia]] under [[Constantius II|Constantius]] through the influence of the [[Arianism|Arians]]. Visited by [[Hilary of Poitiers|St. Hilary]] on his return to Sens after three years of exile, around 386 he founded at Sens the monastery of Sts. [[Gervasius and Protasius]].

;Fifth century:
*St. Ambrose (died c. 460)
*St. [[Agroecius (Bishop of Sens)|Agroecius]] (Agrice), bishop around 475
*St. Heraclius (487–515), founder of the monastery of St. John the Evangelist at Sens

;Sixth century:
*St. Paul (515–525)
*St. Leo (530–541), who sent St. Aspais to evangelize Melun
*[[Constitutus of Sens]] attended [[Fifth Council of Orléans ]] in 549
*St. Arthemius, present at the councils of 581 and 585, who admitted to public penance the Spaniard St. Bond and made a holy hermit from a criminal

;Seventh century:
*[[Lupus of Sens|St. Lupus]] (Lou, or Leu, born c. 573): bishop between around 609 and 623, son of [[Blessed Betto]] of the royal house of Burgundy and St Austregilde (founder of the monastery of Ste-Colombe and perhaps the [[Ferrières Abbey|monastery of Ferrières]] in the [[Gâtinais]]. Some historians believe it to have been founded under [[Clovis I|Clovis]]. He received from the king authorization to coin money in his diocese.
*St. Annobertus (c. 639)
*[[St. Gondelbertus]] (c. 642–643), whose episcopate is documented only by traditions of [[Senones Abbey]] dating from the 11th century
*St. Arnoul (654–657)
*St. Emmon (658–675), who around late 668 received the monk Hadrian, sent to England with Archbishop Theodore
*(Perhaps) St. Amé (c. 676), exiled to Péronne by Ebroin; his name is suppressed by Duchesne as having been introduced to the episcopal lists in the 10th century
*[[Wulfram of Sens|St. Vulfran]] (692–695), a monk of Fontenelle, who soon left the See of Sens to evangelize [[Frisia]] and died at Fontenelle before 704
*St. Gerie, bishop c. 696

;Eighth century:
*St. Ebbo, at first Abbot of St-Pierre le Vif; bishop before 711, in 731 he placed himself at the head of his people to compel the Saracens to lift the siege of Sens
*His successor, St. Merulf
*Hartbert, named in the acts of the Council of Soissons (March 744)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Marios |last=Costambeys |title=Abel (''fl''. 744–747) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=Sep 2004 |edition=Jan 2010, online  |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29 |accessdate=28 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ninth century:
*Magnus, former [[court chaplain]] of [[Charlemagne]]; bishop before 802 and author of a handbook of legislation he used when traveling as [[missus dominicus]] (royal agent for Charlemagne); died after 817
*Jeremias, ambassador at Rome of [[Louis the Pious]] in the affair of the Iconoclasts; died in 828
*St. Alderic (829–836), former Abbot of Ferrières; consecrated Abbot of St. Maur des Fosses at Paris in 832
*[[Wenilo (archbishop of Sens)|Vénilon]] (837–865) anointed [[Charles the Bald]] on 6 June 843 at the cathedral of Orléans, to the detriment of the  [[archbishopric of Reims]]; his [[chorepiscopus]] ([[auxiliary bishop]]) was [[Audradus Modicus]], author of theological writings including the poem "De Fonte Vitae" (dedicated to Hincmar) and the ''Book of Revelations'', in which he sought to end the rift between Louis the Pious' sons. In 859 Charles the Bald accused Vénilon at the Council of Savonnières of having betrayed him; the matter resolved itself, but Vénilon was still considered guilty; the name of the traitor [[Ganelon]] (in the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'') is a corruption of Vénilon.
*[[Ansegisus of Sens|Ansegisus]] (871–883), at the death of [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis II]], negotiated at Rome for Charles the Bald, bringing the letter of [[Pope John VIII]] inviting Charles to receive the imperial crown. Ansegisus was named by John VIII primate of the Gauls and Germania and vicar of the Holy See for France and Germany, and at the [[Council of Ponthion]], was installed above the other [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s despite the [[Hincmar]]'s opposition. In 880, he anointed [[Louis the Younger]] and [[Carloman II]] in the abbey of Ferrières. During the time of archbishop Ansegisus, while the See of Sens exercised primacy, a cleric compiled the ''Ecclesiastical Annals of Sens'' ({{lang-fr|Gestes des Archevêques de Sens|links=no}}), a history of the first two French dynasties.

;Tenth century:
[[Walter (archbishop of Sens)|Walter]] (Vaulter) (887–923): anointed [[Odo, Count of Paris|Eudes]] in 888, [[Robert I of France|Robert I]] in July 922, and [[Rudolph of France]] on 13 July 923 in the Church of St-Médard at [[Soissons]]; he inherited from his uncle Vaultier ([[Bishop of Orléans]]) a [[sacramentary]] composed between 855 and 873 for the Abbey of St-Amand at Puelle. This document (which he gave to the church of Sens) is an example of Carolingian art and is now in the [[National Library of Sweden]].
*St. Anastasius (967–976)
*Sevinus (976–999): presided at the Council of St-Basle and incurred the disfavour of [[Hugh Capet]] by his opposition to the deposition of Arnoul.

===1000–1200===

Gelduinus (1032–1049) was deposed for [[simony]] by [[Pope Leo IX]] at the [[Council of Reims]]. The second half of the 11th century saw a decline in prestige for the Diocese of Sens. Under the episcopate of Richerius (1062–96), [[Pope Urban II]] withdrew primatial authority from the See of Sens to confer it on the [[Archdiocese of Lyon|archbishopric of Lyon]], and Richerius died without having accepted this decision; his successor [[Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens|Daimbert]] (1098–1122) was consecrated at Rome in March 1098 after giving assurance that he recognized the primacy of Lyons. Bishop [[Henri Sanglier]] (1122–42) caused the condemnation by a council in 1140 of certain propositions of [[Abelard]].

Hugues de Toucy (1142–1168).  The see regained some prestige under  who at Orléans in 1152 crowned Constance (wife of King [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]]) despite protests by the Archbishop of Reims, and during whose episcopate [[Pope Alexander III]] (driven from Rome) installed the pontifical court at Sens for 18 months, on the advice of the bishops.


*[[Guillaume aux Blanches Mains]] (1168–1176), son of [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne|Thibaud II]], Count of Champagne, uncle of king [[Philip Augustus]] and first cousin of [[Henry II of France]], who in 1172 in the name of [[Pope Alexander III]] placed the Kingdom of England under an [[interdict]] and in 1176 became Archbishop of Reims

===Councils of Sens===
{{main|Councils of Sens}}

A large number of church councils were held at Sens between 600 and 1485. The first involved a controversy over the [[Easter controversy|date of Easter]] which meant that [[St. Columbanus]] refused to attend. The council of 1140 condemned the writings of [[Abelard]].  The council of 1198 was concerned with the [[Manichaean]] sect of [[Poplicani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Sens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shahbaz''' ({{lang-fa|شاه‌باز}}) is the name of a [[fable|fabled]] [[bird]]. It is like an [[eagle]], bigger than a [[Accipitrinae|hawk]] or [[falcon]]. The shahbaz lived in the [[Zagros]], [[Alborz]], and [[Ghafghaz]] mountains of [[Iran]]. In old [[Persian mythology]], Shahbaz was a god who helped the [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] and guided [[Faravahar]] to [[Iran|Iran zamin]].
During the Achaemenid era, especially at the time of Cyrus the Great, the Persian imperial flag was rectangular in shape, divided kite-like into four equal triangles alternating between two colors.
In the excavations at Persepolis archaeologists found a standard depicting a Shahbaz or golden eagle (Derafsh-e Shahbaz-e-Talayi) with open wings. The current belief is that this was the official symbol of Iran under Cyrus the Great and his heirs.

Shahbaz literally means "royal falcon".&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton]]|first=Sir Richard Francis|title=Falconry in the valley of the Indus|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brill|first=E. J.|title=First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913-1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton considered it to refer to the Goshawk, ''[[Northern goshawk|Accipiter gentilis]].''&lt;ref name="Burton"/&gt; "shahbaz" may also refer to the [[eastern imperial eagle]] which is known as imperial eagle   ({{lang-fa|عقاب شاهی}}) which is the second largest (after the golden eagle) eagle in Iran.

'''Sindhi Hindus''' are [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] people that follow the [[Hindu]] religion and traditions, and originate from the [[Sindh|Sindh region]] of modern [[Pakistan]], which was previously a part of pre-partition British India.

==Hinduism in Sindh==
[[Hinduism]], as in other areas of the [[Indian Subcontinent]], was the earliest religion predominantly practiced in the [[Sindh]] region in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. The region of Sindh has historically been, and still is, home to the largest community of [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindus in Pakistan]]. Following the [[Arab conquest of South Asia|Arab Muslim conquest]] in the 8th century, [[Islam]] spread throughout the region and over the period of time Islam became the faith practiced by the majority of [[Sindhi people]]. The Islamic religion, coupled with traditional influences and exposure to and interaction with Hinduism, has shaped the diverse [[Sindhi culture]].&lt;ref name="Kothari"&gt;{{cite book|title=Decentering Translation Studies: India and Beyond|year=2009|first=Judy|last=Wakabayashi|first2=Rita|last2=Kothari|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-9027224309|pages=122-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] and [[Habbari dynasty]], the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later the [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. After the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the majority of Sindhi Hindus migrated to [[India]], and settled primarily in neighboring [[Gujarat]] and the city of [[Mumbai]], where their population is estimated to be 3 million. There are also sizable Sindhi Hindu communities elsewhere in the world, sometimes termed, the '[[Sindhi diaspora]]'.

==Partition of India==
{{Main|Sindhis in India}}
Following the [[partition of India]], a significant number of Sindhi Hindus left [[Sindh]] following [[Persecution of Hindus#Pakistan|religious-based persecution]] against Hindus in the province.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Many initially settled in [[Rajasthan]] and in the neighbouring [[Kutch district]] of [[Gujarat]], which bears linguistic and cultural similarities to Sindh. As per Census of India 2011, there are around 2,772,264 Sindhi speakers living in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-1.pdf|title=Census of India 2011|last=|first=|date=Language|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming conventions==

Most Sindhi Hindu family names are a modified form of a [[patronymic]] and typically end with the suffix '''''"-ani"''''', which is used to denote descent from a common male ancestor. One explanation states that the -ani suffix is a [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] variant of 'anshi', derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word 'ansh', which means 'descended from' (see: [[Devanshi]]). The first part of a Sindhi Hindu surname is usually derived from the name or location of an ancestor. In northern Sindh, surnames ending in 'ja' (meaning 'of') are also common. A person's surname would consist of the name of his or her native village, followed by 'ja'. Sindhi Hindus generally add the suffix ‘-ani’ to the name of a great grandfather and adopt the name as a family name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sindhishaan.com/article/history/hist_01_02c.html|title=Sindhishaan - Whats in Name|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sindhisms.blogspot.sg/p/sindhi-surnames.html|title=Sindhi Surnames|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=January 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tarun-sakhrani/the-sindhis-of-sindh_b_8894284.html|title=The Sindhis of Sindh And Beyond|work=Huffington Post|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=9 August 2016|first=Tarun|last=Sakhrani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 363.&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, he is the first [[Newar]] merchant of [[Kathmandu]] to travel to [[Tibet]], and his story is one of the most loved legends in Newar society. Singha Sartha is also considered to be a previous [[incarnation]] of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Hira (2009) ''The Past Lives of the Buddha.''

''Tales of Kathmandu: Folktales from the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal.'' House of Kathmandu. Page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The legend==

Singha Sartha led a merchant caravan to Tibet. They arrived at a place where there were many beautiful women, and the traders fell under their spell. Each one of them got a mistress and they spent the days partying, forgetting that they were on a business trip. One night, Karunamaya, the [[Bodhisattva]] of Compassion, appeared to Singha Sartha in the flame of an oil lamp, and warned him that their gorgeous lovers were actually demonesses who were waiting for an opportunity to eat them. He told Singha Sartha to check his lover's feet if he was unconvinced, and he would find that the heel pointed to the front and the toes to the back.

Karunamaya then told him that he would help him and his friends to escape. He instructed them to get up before the women and hurry to the river bank where they would find a winged horse. They were to climb on the horse and it would fly them across the river to safety. He also warned them that they should not look back whatever happened, otherwise the demonesses would drag them off the horse and kill them. 

Singha Sartha spread the word among his companions, and they all agreed that they had to flee. The next day before dawn, they slipped out of their rooms and reached the river bank. There was a horse as promised, and they all got on its back. The Bodhisattva had taken the form of the horse to help the merchants escape. As the horse took off for the other bank, the women came running after them, pleading not to be left behind. Their sorrowful cries made the men look back, and they were dragged off the horse. Singha Sartha was the only one who maintained his self-control, and he returned to Nepal safely.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Kamal Ratna (2011) ''[[Caravan to Lhasa]]: A Merchant of Kathmandu in Traditional Tibet.'' Kathmandu: Lijala &amp; Tisa. {{ISBN|99946-58-91-3}}. Pages 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lall, Kesar (1966). ''Lore and legend of Nepal.'' [[Ratna Pustak Bhandar]]. Page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Ferry boats on the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in Tibet are decorated with a wooden horse's head symbolizing the horse Shyam Karna that carried Singha Sartha to safety. A stupa dedicated to Singha Sartha once stood on the Barkhor in Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Kamal Ratna (2011) ''[[Caravan to Lhasa]]: A Merchant of Kathmandu in Traditional Tibet.'' Kathmandu: Lijala &amp; Tisa. {{ISBN|99946-58-91-3}}. Page 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional trade fair held in Jampaling, Tibet is associated with Singha Sartha, who is known as Norbu Sangya in Tibetan. There was a shrine dedicated to him near the great stupa of Jampaling which was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Shakya|first= Harsamuni|title= Jampaling Festival: Newar Buddhist Festival in Tibet|url= http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117513.htm|publisher= |accessdate=14 July 2012|newspaper= Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods |year= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kathmandu]], Singha Sartha has been deified as Chakan Dyah (चकं द्य:), an incarnation of the Buddha, and his statue is carried through the city in a procession on the full moon day of March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Yoshizaki|first= Kazumi |title= The Kathmandu Valley as a Water Pot: Abstracts of research papers on Newar Buddhism in Nepal |url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/30857088/Yoshizaki-Kazumi-NewarBuddhism|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper= |year= 25 November 2006}} Page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Singha Sartha is credited as the founder of the Buddhist courtyard named Thambahil (alternative names Vikramshila Mahavihar, Bhagwan Bahal) situated in [[Thamel]], Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Pradhan |first= Damodar |title= Prajñāpāramitā |url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/93301641/Prajn%C4%81p%C4%81ramit%C4%81-May-2012-7-210|publisher= |accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper= |year= May 2012}} Pages 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">'''Singleness of [[Heart (symbol)|heart]]''' (also called '''singleheartedness''') is the ideal of having sole devotion to a task or endeavour.  It is normally employed in a religious or spiritual context.  In antiquity it was thought of as a counteraction to the divisive effects of civilization on the soul.  It is especially associated with the practices of [[Christian monasticism]].

Referring to the desert landscape inhabited by the earliest Christian monks, [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], in ''A History of Private Life'', explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The bleak, asocial landscape of the desert was a distant image of Paradise -- the first, the true home of humankind, where Adam and Eve had dwelt in full majesty, before the subtle and overpowering onset of the doublehearted cares of human life in settled society, before marriage, physical greed, the labor of the earth, and the grinding cares of present human society robbed them of their original serenity.  Totally singlehearted, therefore joined with the angelic hosts in unfailing and undivided praise of God, the life of the monk mirrored on earth the life of the angels.  &lt;small&gt;(''Paul Veyne, editor. Harvard: 1987. Volume I, p. 289'')&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Søren Kierkegaard expressed a similar concept in his maxim "Purity of heart is to will one thing" and his sermon-form essay bearing that title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/topics/purity-heart-will-one-thing&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1975 to his death, he was Distinguished University Professor at [[Seton Hall University]], in [[South Orange]], [[New Jersey]]. He held doctorates in theology and in physics and was a leading contributor to the [[philosophy of science]] and the [[history of science]], particularly to their relationship to [[Christianity]].

==Studies==
After completing undergraduate training in philosophy, theology and mathematics, Jaki did graduate work in theology and physics and gained doctorates in theology from the [[Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm]] in [[Rome]] (1950) and in physics from [[Fordham University]] (1958), where he studied under the Nobel laureate [[Victor Hess]], the co-discoverer of cosmic rays. He also did post-doctoral research in [[Philosophy of Science]] at [[Stanford University]], [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[Princeton University]] and [[Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]].

==Research==
Jaki authored more than two dozen books on the relation between modern science and [[orthodox Christianity]]. He was Fremantle Lecturer at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] (1977), Hoyt Fellow at [[Yale University]] (1980) and Farmington Institute Lecturer at [[Oxford University]] (1988–1989). He was the [[Gifford Lectures|Gifford Lecturer]] at [[Edinburgh University]] in 1974–1975 and 1975–1976. In 1987, he was awarded the [[Templeton Prize]] for furthering understanding of science and religion.

He was among the first to claim that [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] is relevant for [[theory of everything|theories of everything (TOE)]] in theoretical physics.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jaki's "[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/misc/A%20Late%20Awakening%20to%20G%c3%b6del%20in%20Physics.pdf A Late Awakening to Gödel in Physics]"&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel's theorem states that any [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] that includes certain basic facts of number theory and is [[recursively enumerable set|computably enumerable]] will be either incomplete or [[inconsistent]]. Since any 'theory of everything' must be consistent, it also must be incomplete.

{{quote|It is on the ultimate success of such a quest [for a TOE] that Gödel's theorem casts the shadow of judicious doubt. It seems on the strength of Gödel's theorem that the ultimate foundations of the bold symbolic constructions of mathematical physics will remain embedded forever in that deeper level of thinking characterized both by the wisdom and by the haziness of analogies and intuitions. For the speculative physicist this implies that there are limits to the precision of certainty, that even in the pure thinking of theoretical physics there is a boundary present, as in all other fields of speculations.||Jaki, S.L.|(1966). The Relevance of Physics. Chicago Press. p. 129.}}

==Death==
Jaki died in Madrid following a heart attack. He was in Spain visiting friends, on his way back to the United States after delivering lectures in Rome, for the Master in Faith and Science of the Pontificio Ateneo Regina Apostolorum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shu.edu/news/article/152011 Death of Rev.

'''Yogi Swatmarama''' ({{lang-sa|स्वात्माराम}}; [[IAST]]: svātmārāma) was a 15th and 16th century [[Yoga|yogic]] sage in [[India]]. He is best known for compiling the yoga manual [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika|Hatha Pradipika]] or ''Light on Hatha Yoga''. This manual describes the use of [[Shatkarma]], [[Asanas]], [[Pranayama]], [[Mudras]], and [[Bandha (Yoga)|Bandhas]], and their practice as the means to awaken the [[Kundalini]], leading to deeper and deeper states of [[Samadhi]]. Swatmarama maitains throughout the text that [[Hatha Yoga]]'s true purpose is the arousal of the Kundalini, until perfection in [[Raja Yoga]] is achieved, i.e. liberation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodhitree.com/lectures/Georg_Feuerstein_Yoga_Tradition_interview_by_Richard_Miller.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Hatha Yoga Pradipika, e-book translated by Pancham Sinh, www.sacredtexts.com &lt;/ref&gt;

Very little is known about the actual Swatmarama, but the fourth line of the text attributes its lineage to the [[Nath|Nath Sampraday]]:
:"Matsyendra, Goraksa, etc., knew Hatha Vidyā, and by their favour Yogī Swātmārāma also learnt it from them."&lt;ref&gt; Hatha Yoga Pradipika, e-book translated by Pancham Sinh, www.sacredtexts.com &lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Three Books of Occult Philosophy''''' (''De Occulta Philosophia libri III'') is [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s study of [[occult]] philosophy, acknowledged as a significant contribution to the [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance philosophical]] discussion concerning the powers of [[ritual magic]], and its relationship with religion. The first book was printed in 1531 in Paris, Cologne, and Antwerp, while the full three volumes first appeared in Cologne in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Der Poel|first1=Marc|title=Cornelius Agrippa: The Humanist Theologian and His Declamations|date=1997|publisher=Brill|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three books deal with [[Natural_magic|Elemental]], Celestial and [[Ceremonial_magic|Intellectual]] magic. The books outline the [[Classical element|four elements]], [[astrology]], [[kabbalah]], [[numerology|numbers]], [[angel]]s, [[Names of God|God's names]], the virtues and relationships with each other as well as methods of utilizing these relationships and laws in medicine, [[scrying]], [[alchemy]], [[Ceremonial magic|ceremonies]], origins of what are from the [[Hebrew]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Chaldea]]n context.

These arguments were common amongst other [[Hermeticism|hermetic philosophers]] at the time and before. In fact, Agrippa's interpretation of magic is similar to the authors [[Marsilio Ficino]], [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Johann Reuchlin]]'s synthesis of magic and religion, and emphasize an exploration of nature. Unlike many [[grimoire]]s of the time, these books are more scholarly and intellectual than mysterious and foreboding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Vishnumaya''', also known as '''Chathan''', is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god often associated with sorcery, popularly known in [[Kerala]]. He is the son of [[Shiva]] and Kulivaka – a tribal woman, while in some versions [[Parvati]] disguises herself as Kulivaka.

According to Hindu mythology [[Shiva]]  while on a hunt happened to hear a sweet voice in the jungle. He was surprised to find that it belonged to a tribal girl, "Kulivaka" (Pronounced as Koolivaaka) - a girl of immense beauty. The solitude in that forest area called Kuli van, and the wild beauty of the forest girl, made the Lord lustful. He informed Kulivaka of his wish and told her to wait for him until he returned from his hunt{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2012}}

Kulivaka, who was a devotee of Parvati realized that mating with lord would bring forth the wrath of the goddess upon her; but she feared the wrath of Shiva also in case she refused him. She prayed to her Goddess to save her from the predicament. Parvati, pleased with her innocence appeared before her and revealed her true identity. In her previous birth Kulivaka was Manaswini, a servant in the retinue of Parvati. One day she happened to breast-feed Ganesha who was a baby at that time. Parvati didn't appreciate the fact of a servant breast-feeding her baby. She cursed Manaswini that she would be born in a chandala(outcaste)family. When Parvati's anger subdued, she took pity on Manaswini. Devi Parvati blessed her that although she be born as a chandala she would get the opportunity to breast-feed the son of Shiva.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2012}}

Devi disclosed that it was the pre-ordained fate that made possible her meeting with Lord Shiva and his passion for Koolivaka. She told the girl that she herself would take on the form of Koolivaka and deceive the Lord Shiva. She also informed Koolivaka that the son born from such a union would be the killer of [[Jalandhara]], a powerful [[Asura]]. Thus revealing the course of fate, she sent the innocent girl away.

The pseudo Koolivaka started swinging on a creeper attached to a jackfruit tree and waited for the arrival of Lord Shiva. A child with divine power was born through their union. Lord Shiva arranged a buffalo for the protection of the child. This divine child who came to be known as Chathan was given to Koolivaka for rearing. Koolivaka thus became the mother of Chathan, son of Lord Shiva fulfilling the boon of Parvati.

Chathan lived with Koolivaka for about seven years. The tribals loved the boy who saved them from many dangers. He roamed the jungle riding his buffalo and playing a musical instrument known as "Ezhara".{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2012}}

On his seventh birthday, the tribals held a feast in his honour. During the feast the sage, Narada manifested himself. He revealed to Chathan the secret of his birth. Moreover, Narada advised Chathan to visit his true parents in Kailasa. He also told Chathan the true purpose of his birth.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2012}}

Chathan started his journey to Kailasam with the permission of his foster mother and friends. He rode on his buffalo to Kailasam. When he was about to reach Kailasam he realized that Nandikeshwara would not allow him to enter Kailash in his present form. So he took the form of Lord Vishnu. On seeing their son, Shiva and Parvati were very happy and hugged their son. Lord Shiva blessed him, saying, "You invoked the form of Vishnu by Maya (magic). So you will be known as Vishnu Maya". Moreover, he taught him the art of warfare and the secrets to kill Jalandhara (an asura who had been harassing the Devas).{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2012}}

[[Jalandhara]] was an asura who had got a boon from [[Indra]] and he was terrorizing the three worlds (Heaven, [[Pathala]] ([[Underworld|Nether World]]) and Earth). Chathan challenged him to battle. After a fierce battle, Chathan took the form of [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarsana Chakra]] with his Maya to behead Jalandhara. Sensing danger, he escaped and hid himself in the seas. Chathan as Chakra followed him. Due to the heat of the fiercely revolving Chakra the water where Jalandhara was hiding started to boil. Unable to bear the heat, Jalndhara came out and he was promptly beheaded. Thus came the end of Jalandhara. With the killing of Jalandhara, the power of Chathan was recognized by the Devas. Indra invited him to Heaven. But Chathan declined the offer saying that his place was among the poor people who needed his protection. Chathan returned to his own people.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2012}}

Another powerful Asura called Briga saw Koolivaka in the forest and wanted to take her as his wife. He came with a large force and tried to capture her. Chathan along with his elder brother, "Karinkutty" resisted the attack. Chathan was injured in the conflict. From the blood that fell on the ground, there arose 400 "Kuttichathan"s. Sensing his immediate defeat, Briga used ten Brahmastras against Chathan, ten Kuttichathans valiantly swallowed the weapon and gave up their life. The remaining 390 Kuttichathans defeated the army while Chathan killed Briga with his Kuruvadi (short Stick). Some of the famous Ancient Traditional Vishnumaya Temples in Kerala are '''Avanangattil Kalari''' first vishnumaya temple ('''moolasthanam''')kizhakkumuri,  Vishnumaya temple peringottukara, thrissur district kerala state india. Other important temples include, Karumanthra Shree Vishnumaya Temple Meloor, Kannanchira Shree Vishnumaya Temple, Perigottukara Devasthanam, Kanadikavu Kuttichathan Kavu situated in Thrissur district of Kerala.  Most of this temple built by few years back most of them bring idols from avanangattilkalri sree vishnumaya temple. Particularly thrissur district most of family temples have a vishnumaya idol with the main deity. &lt;ref&gt;http://avanangattilkalari.com/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2012}} In addition to these famous temples, Lord Vishumaya is one of the main deity in Pakkalippallam Temple (situated in the valley of Chembra peak, in the midst of forest) in Wayanad district of Kerala. Lord Vishnumaya is also the main deity of Hindus in central Kerala.

According to the old history Puchanellur Battathiri first prayed to  god Shiva and goddess Parvati. Through his prayer Shiva and Parvati were satisfied but they instructed him to pray to the god Sree Vishnumaya. He prayed (upasana) to the god Sree Vishnumaya. With Continuous prayer god Sree Vishnumaya and 390 brother blessed him. He built a pooja room at his own house (punchanellur mana). God Vishnumaya's blessing achieved goals. After a few years of time Bhattathiri started thinking about maintaining family line and status. He had only one daughter called Ettinarayani. She could not follow the rule of vishnumaya upasana (pooja )  to god sree vishnumaya. Same time  at Avanangattil kalari there were two brothers unnithaman and kelluuni. They were maintaining kalari. They were praying to god Ganesha. But they desired to do Upasana to a (uggra moorthi) powerful god who can help win over enemy's. When they  set about searching for that, they heard about Punchanellur Battathiri and god sree vishnumaya. Unnithamman panicker and kellunni panicker visited puchanellur and they requested for help.Puchanellur battathiri agreed to give hand of his daughter to them and provide manthra's to propitiate God Vishnumaya. In exchange battathiri requested Ganesha moolamathra's. Avanangattilkalari unnithaman panicker and kellunni panicker agreed for exchange. When they returned to avanangattilkalari they started upasana(continues prayer). After 41 days god sree vishnumaya blessed them with his 390 brothers.After that unnithaman panicker requested god sree vishnumaya, that until his return god need to protect his family and give blessings in avanangattilkalari. He went to a well near to avanangattil kalari, which had no water but steps and started praying and sacrificed life for family. Before he started praying he instructed his brother kellunni to close well opening. He never returned. As per given word god sree vishnumaya continues to bless avanangattilkalari vishnumaya temple.

'''Zeno of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]]''' ({{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ζήνων|Ζήνων]] ὁ Ταρσεύς}}, ''Zenon ho Tarseus''; fl. 200 BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher and the son of [[Dioscorides (Stoic)|Dioscorides]].

==Biography==
Zeno was a pupil of [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref name="Diog1"&gt;{{cite LotEP|chapter=Book VII |§= 35 Cf. 41, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when Chrysippus died c. 206 BC, he succeeded him to become the fourth [[scholarch]] of the Stoic school in [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="Euseb1"&gt;Eusebius, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15.htm ''Praeparatio Evangelica,''] 15. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], he wrote very few books, but left a great number of disciples.&lt;ref name="Diog1"/&gt; From what little is known about his philosophical views, he was an orthodox Stoic, but doubted the doctrine of the [[Ekpyrosis|conflagration of the universe]].&lt;ref name="Euseb1"/&gt;  This was a considerable modification of the physical theory of the Stoics, who held that the universe periodically dissolved into fire.

It is not known when he died.  He was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by [[Diogenes of Babylon]].
