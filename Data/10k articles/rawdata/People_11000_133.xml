[[File:AdamRita.jpg|thumb|Toronto Argonauts GM Adam Rita at the Argos' practice facility on June 14, 2009]]

'''Adam Rita''' (Born September 21, 1947) is a [[Canadian Football League]] executive who has served as the head coach of [[Toronto Argonauts]], [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], and [[BC Lions]] and as general manager of the Lions and Argonauts.

Rita first began his CFL coaching career in 1983 as the offensive co-ordinator for the [[B.C. Lions]].&lt;ref&gt;http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/Toronto/2007/12/19/4732056-sun.html&lt;/ref&gt; He first became a CFL Head Coach in 1991 with the Toronto Argonauts with whom he won his first and only [[Grey Cup]] championship as a Head Coach [[79th Grey Cup|in that same year]].

Rita grew up on Kaua'i, Hawai'i and as a young boy, he was a member of a canoe club and appeared paddling a canoe in the wedding scene of the [[Elvis Presley]] movie ''[[Blue Hawaii]]''.

Rita has two sons, Kevin and Harrison and two grandchildren Seth and Jennifer.&lt;ref&gt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/793774-former-cfl-gm-and-head-coach-adam-rita-joins-ksmg-football-team&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Rita was named General Manager and Vice President of Football Operations of the Toronto Argonauts. Toronto won the [[92nd Grey Cup]] in his first year on the job, but managed only a 48–60 record after that. Rita's contract was not renewed following the 2010 season and he was replaced by head coach [[Jim Barker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=345565 |title=Argos' Coach Barker Adds General Manager Role; Rita Out |accessdate=2010-12-15 |quote= |publisher=TSN.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Strehler''' (born 1971 in [[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss [[watchmaker]] and designer of watch movements.

== Life ==

Andreas Strehler did his apprenticeship at a watchmaker's shop in [[Frauenfeld]] and graduated as Watchmaker-Rhabilleur with a Swiss Federal Diploma in 1991. At the same time, he attended the Watchmakers' School in [[Solothurn]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Strehler, Engineer for the Brands-Watchmaker for the Few, {{ISBN|978-3-941539-89-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, he began his first job in [[Le Locle]] at Renaud &amp; Papi SA which today belongs to [[Audemars Piguet]] as Audemars Piguet Renaud &amp; Papi SA. There, he was the first watchmaker the owners had hired. Strehler is appointed as head of prototyping and in charge of implementing the firm's technical innovations. At the end of 1994, he leaves Renaud &amp; Papi and moves back to his native [[Wülflingen]] near Winterthur.

On January first 1995, Strehler opens his own workshop. Initially, like many of his peers, he concentrates on repairing and restoring old watches and clocks.

In 2000 is appointed as member of the [[Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants]] (AHCI)

In 2005, he incorporates UhrTeil AG, a company under whose name he works for the watch industry. The name UhrTeil plays with the German words Uhr Teil (watch part) and Urteil (verdict).
Besides the engineering of components, complications and complete movements, Strehler's company also manufactures the components which have been developed in house on machines, some of which have been developed by Strehler. The portfolio includes the manufacturing of prototypes and small and large series for many well-known watch brands.

In 2007 Andreas Strehler moves his domicile and the company to [[Sirnach]] in the canton [[Thurgau]] near [[Lake Constance]].

== Work ==

In 1998, Strehler presents the "Tischkalender" (table calendar), his first clock.&lt;ref&gt;Magazin: ArmbandUhren, Ausgabe 4/98, Seite 54&lt;/ref&gt; The table clock with [[perpetual calendar]] incorporates a removable pocket watch. If the pocket watch is inserted into the desk unit, the lattes perpetual calendar is synchronized. Several safety features prevent maloperation. Each "Tischkalender" works according to the principle of lock and key only with a specific matching pocket watch. The desktop calendar has its own spring to switch the calendar display but does not work independently. If the owner and his pocket watch are away, time stands still. Upon return of the owner and after reinserting the pocket watch, the desktop calendar detects how many days have passed and moves the date indication to the correct date.

In 1999, Strehler presents a second pocket watch, the "Zwei" (German: Two).&lt;ref&gt;Magazine: Jewellery Time, June 1999, Page 34&lt;/ref&gt; This features a switchable indication. At the push of a button, the hands of the watch indicate the date (minute hand) and the month (hour hand). The hands move independently and will always reach their position in the shortest way. For this mechanism, Strehler receives his first patent.In 2001 Strehler implements the mechanism of the "Zwei" in a [[wristwatch]]. For this, he miniaturised the mechanism designed for a pocket watch to fit into a wristwatch.&lt;ref&gt;Uhrenkatalog: Watches International 2001, Seite 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years from 2003 to 2011, Strehler developed the movements for the newly founded brand H. Moser &amp; Cie. in Schaffhausen.&lt;ref&gt;QP Magazine, Issue forty five 2007, Page 105, "A young watchmaker in strong demand"&lt;/ref&gt; Among these movements are the Perpetual Moon ([[phase of the moon]]) with a deviation of only one day in 1,000 years and the Perpetual One, a perpetual calendar with a large date indication on the three o'clock position. A further particular feature of this movement is called Flash-Calendar, the instantaneous switching from the last day of the month to the first day of the next month, i.e. from 29 February to 1 March [5].

In 2007, Strehler in collaboration with [[Harry Winston]] designs the movement for the Opus 7 [6]. The Opus 7 is a further development of the "Zwei".&lt;ref&gt;Uhrenmagazin, Ausgabe 6/2007, Seite 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Strehler presents the "Papillon" (French: Butterfly), a new wristwatch incorporating many of his trademark construction principles to achieve an open, living movement and allowing an insight deep into the movement's workings.&lt;ref&gt;Timecraft Magazine, Special report of the watchshows 2008, Page 134 "Float like a Butterfly"&lt;/ref&gt; With the "Cocon" (French: Cocoon), presented in 2012, a new line of watches is launched. The "Cocon" case is used as a basis for further developments and new models.&lt;ref&gt;Thurgauer Zeitung, 22.Mai 2012, Seite 35, "Uhrmacher, eine seltene Spezies"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the "Sauterelle" (French: Grashopper) is presented.&lt;ref&gt;QP Magazine, Issue Sixty Four, 2014, Page 72&lt;/ref&gt; It features Strehler's own constant force device, a so-called rémontoir d’égalité, which supplies the [[escapement]] with constant energy.&lt;ref&gt;Magazine: ArmbandUhren, Ausgabe 3/13, Seite 30&lt;/ref&gt; By this device, irregularities which are inherent to any movement are virtually eliminated and a linear amplitude of the [[balance wheel]] is achieved for the whole duration of the mainspring's capacity of 78 hours. The remontoir d’égalité is patented.[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&amp;date=20141031&amp;DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;locale=en_CH&amp;CC=CH&amp;NR=707938A2&amp;KC=A2&amp;ND=4 CH707938 (A2) ]

On SalonQP in London in November 2014, the "Sauterelle à lune perpétuélle" is being launched. It is the most precise phase of the moon indication with a deviation of one day in 2'060'757 years. The "Sauterelle à lune" is awarded a [[Guinness World Record]]: "Sauterelle à lune perpétuelle by Andreas Strehler (Switzerland), with a deviation of 1 day in 2'060'757 years, as validated in November 2014".&lt;ref&gt;Paris Capitale, No. 192 Février 2015, Page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

2015 Strehler presents the "Papillon d’Or"" (French: golden butterfly). Under a butterfly bridge made of 18k gold, the movement's delicate mechanism is completely visible. On the back of the movement, the [[power reserve]] is indicated by a mechanism incorporating a micro differential gear.&lt;ref&gt;La revue des Montres, N.206 Juin 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Strehler is a highly recognised specialist for the construction and manufacturing of differential gears and true conical gear wheels.

== Awards ==

In 2013 Strehler was awarded the [[Prix Gaïa]] of the [[International Museum of Horology]] (MIH) in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] in the category artesanat-création for his technical and artistic creations.&lt;ref&gt;Chronos China 2015/2, Page 166&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Željko Ražnatović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Жељко Ражнатовић}}, {{IPA-sh|ʐêːʎko raʐnâːtoʋit͡ɕ|pron}}; 17 April 1952 – 15 January 2000), better known as '''Arkan''' (Аркан), was a Serbian [[career criminal]] and commander of a paramilitary force in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], called the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]]. He was on [[Interpol]]'s most wanted list in the 1970s and 1980s for robberies and murders committed in a number of countries across Europe, and was later indicted by the UN for [[crimes against humanity]] for his role during the wars. Ražnatović was up until his death the most powerful crime boss in the Balkans. He was assassinated in January 2000, before his trial could take place.

==Early life==
Željko Ražnatović was born in [[Brežice]], a small border town in [[Styria (Slovenia)|Slovenian Styria]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]. His father, [[Veljko Ražnatović]], served as a decorated officer in the [[SFR Yugoslav Air Force]], earning high rank for his notable [[World War II]] involvement on the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] side, and was stationed in Slovenian Styria at the time of Željko's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Miloš Milikić Mido – ''Za naše nebo — Monografija prve klase letača Vazduhoplovnog učilišta 1945-1947''. Belgrade 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent part of his childhood in [[Zagreb]] (SR Croatia) and [[Pančevo]] (SR Serbia), before his father's job eventually took the family to the Yugoslav capital of [[Belgrade]] (SR Serbia), which Ražnatović considered his hometown. His father was born in [[Cetinje]] (SR Montenegro), a descendant of the Ražnatović brotherhood, and had taken part in the Yugoslav liberation of [[Priština]] in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Željko Ražnatović Arkan - život u trileru (16) Crna Gora moja otadžbina|date=31 January 2000|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/02/01/srpski/F00013101.shtm|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ražnatović grew up in Belgrade&lt;ref name=svedok70322&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=70322|title=Internet Svedok - 916 |publisher=Svedok.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three older sisters in a strict, militaristic household with regular beatings administered by his father. In a 1991 interview he recalled: "He didn't really hit me in a classical sense, he'd basically grab me and slam me against the floor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dada Vujasinovic|url=http://www.dadavujasinovic.com/Arkan.htm|title=Ratnik ogrezao u svetosavlju|publisher=duga|date=8 April 1994|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, Ražnatović aspired to become a pilot, as his father had been. Due to the highly demanding and significant positions of his parents, there appeared to be very little time in which a bond was able to be established between parents and children. His parents eventually divorced during his teenage years.&lt;ref name=svedok70322/&gt;

Ražnatović was arrested for the first time in 1966 after snatching women's purses around [[Tašmajdan]],&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"&gt;{{cite web|author=Filip Svarm|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=906970|title=Arkanova ostavština|publisher=Vreme.com|date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending a year at a juvenile detention center not far from Belgrade. His father then sent him to the seaside town of [[Kotor|Kotor (in Montenegro)]] to join the [[Yugoslav Navy]], but Ražnatović had other plans, ending up in Paris at the age of 15. In 1969 he was arrested by French police and shipped home, where he was sentenced to three years at the detention center in [[Valjevo]] for several burglaries. During this time he organized his own gang in the prison.&lt;ref name=svedok70322/&gt;

In his youth, Ražnatović was a [[ward (legal)|ward]] of his father's friend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=La3sAAAAMAAJ|title=Danas - Google Boeken|publisher=Books.google.com|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2014}} the Slovenian politician and Federal Minister of the Interior, [[Stane Dolanc]].&lt;ref name=PIC/&gt; Dolanc was chief of the secret police and a close associate of the Yugoslav president, [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]].

Whenever Ražnatović was in trouble, Dolanc helped him, allegedly as a reward for his services to the Yugoslav secret state police ([[UDBA]]), as seen in the escape from the Lugano prison in 1981. Dolanc is quoted as having said: "One Arkan is worth more than the whole UDBA."&lt;ref name=PIC&gt;{{cite book|title=Partners in Crime: The Risks of Symbiosis Between the Security Sector and Organized Crime in Southeast Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMGxXQpfvWUC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2004|publisher=CSD|isbn=978-954-477-115-7|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal career==
===Western Europe===
In 1972, aged 20, he migrated to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt; Abroad, he was introduced to and kept contact with many well-known criminals from Yugoslavia such as [[Ljubomir Magaš|Ljuba Zemunac]], [[Ranko Rubežić]], [[Đorđe Božović|Đorđe "Giška" Božović]], [[Goran Vuković]], et al., all of whom were also occasionally contracted by the Yugoslav secret service, and all of whom were since assassinated or otherwise killed. He took the nickname "Arkan" from one of his forged passports. On 28 December 1973 he was arrested in Belgium following a bank robbery, and was sentenced to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt;

He managed to escape from the [[Verviers]] prison on 4 July 1979.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt; Although Ražnatović was apprehended in the Netherlands on 24 October 1979, the few months he was free were enough for at least two more armed robberies in Sweden and three more in the Netherlands. Serving a seven-year sentence at a prison in [[Amsterdam]], he pulled off another escape on 8 May 1981 after someone slipped him a gun. Wasting no time, more robberies followed, this time in Germany, where after less than a month of freedom he was arrested in Frankfurt on 5 June 1981 following a jewellery store stickup. In the ensuing shootout with police he was lightly wounded, resulting in his placement in the prison hospital ward, where looser security allowed him to escape again only four days later, on 9 June, supposedly by jumping from the window, beating up the first bystander and stealing his clothing before disappearing.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt;

His final European arrest occurred in [[Basel]], Switzerland during a routine traffic check on 15 February 1983. However he managed to escape again within months, this time from [[Thorberg Castle|Thorberg]] prison on 27 April. It is widely speculated that Ražnatović was closely affiliated with the Yugoslav security service [[UDBA]] throughout his criminal career abroad.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština"/&gt;

He had convictions or warrants in Belgium (bank robberies, prison escape), the Netherlands (armed robberies, prison escape), Sweden (20 burglaries, 7 bank robberies, prison escape, attempted murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9903/31/kosovo5.html|title=Aftonbladet nyheter: Kriget om Kosovo|publisher=aftonbladet.se|date=31 March 1999|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[West Germany|Germany]] (armed robberies, prison escape), Austria, Switzerland (armed robberies, prison escape), and Italy.

===Return to Yugoslavia===
Ražnatović returned to Belgrade in May 1983, continuing his criminal career by opening a number of illegal businesses. In November 1983, six months after his return, a bank in Zagreb was robbed with the robbers leaving a rose on the counter – allegedly Ražnatović's signature from his Western European robberies.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt; As a result, two federal policemen, members of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs' (SUP) Tenth department, showed up in civilian clothing looking for Arkan at his mother's apartment on 27 March Street in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt;

Ražnatović was not there, so his mother called him and said that two unknown males waited for him.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt; He showed up with a revolver and proceeded to shoot and wound both policemen – he shot the first one on the spot and the other while trying to flee the scene. Arkan was detained immediately, however, barely 48 hours later he was released. The occurrence made it clear to all observers that he enjoyed protection from the political elite. He spent the mid-1980s running a disco club, "Amadeus", together with Žika Živac and Tapi Malešević. Located in the [[Tašmajdan]] neighbourhood, the club was reportedly another perk of their contractual work for the security service.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt;

Furthermore, Arkan could be seen riding around Belgrade in his pink [[Cadillac]] and gambling on [[roulette]] in casinos all over the country, from Belgrade and nearby [[Pančevo]] to [[Sveti Stefan]] and [[Portorož]].&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt; Following a game of poker in a private apartment at Ive Lole Ribara Street, [[Bečići]], an elevator altercation started with a tenant from the apartment building. Arkan reportedly broke the man's arm after beating him with a gun. He couldn't avoid being charged this time and the trial saw an interesting exchange between him and the judge – during the pre-session identification Arkan stated he was employed by the Secretariat of Internal Affairs. When this was challenged by the prosecutor, Arkan produced a document about a mortgage loan that he obtained from the Federal State Security for his house at Ljutice Bogdana Street. He ended up receiving a six-month sentence, which he served at the Belgrade Central Prison.&lt;ref name="Arkanova ostavština" /&gt;

==Yugoslav Wars==
===Early===
Only days after the Croatian elections in 1990, Ražnatović, who was the leader of the ''[[Delije]]'' (football club [[Red Star Belgrade]]'s Ultras), was present at the away game against Croatian side [[Dinamo Zagreb]] at [[Stadion Maksimir]] on 13 May 1990, a match that ended in the infamous [[Dinamo–Red Star riot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791 |title=VIDEO: Day When Maksimir Stadium Went up in Flames |publisher=Dalje.com |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301221046/http://dalje.com/en-sports/video--day-when-maksimir-stadium-went-up-in-flames/257791 |archivedate=1 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ražnatović and the Delije, consisting of 1,500 people, were involved in a huge fight with the [[Bad Blue Boys|home team's football hooligans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/5707-football-is-war.html|title=Football is War|publisher=Tol.org|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1990, as the political situation in Yugoslavia became tense (see [[Log Revolution]]), Ražnatović created a paramilitary group named the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]]. Ražnatović was the supreme commander of the unit, which was primarily made up of members of the ''Delije'' and his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Football Hooligans, and War|author=Ivan Čolović|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2017}}

In late October 1990, Ražnatović traveled to [[Knin]] (in Croatia) to meet representatives of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], a Serb break-away region that sought to remain in [[FR Yugoslavia]], as opposed to the Croatian government that seceded. On 29 November 1990, Croatian police arrested him at the Croatian-Bosnian border crossing [[Dvor na Uni]], along with local Dušan Carić, and Belgraders Dušan Bandić and Zoran Stevanović. His entourage was sent to [[Sisak]], and was charged with conspiracy to overthrow the newly-formed Croatian state. Ražnatović was sentenced to 20 months in jail. He was released from Zagreb's [[Remetinec prison]] on 14 June 1991. It has been claimed that the Croatian and Serbian governments agreed on a 1,000,000 [[Deutsche Mark]] settlement for his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hrvatska za Arkana dobila milion maraka|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/01/18/srpski/H00011704.shtm|work=Glas-javnosti|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}} (in Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1991, Ražnatović stayed for some time at the [[Cetinje monastery]], with Metropolitan [[Amfilohije Radović]]. His group of men, fully armed, were allowed to enter the monastery, where they served as security.&lt;ref name=ENOVINE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-novine.com/srbija/srbija-licnosti/32577-Zvijer-bezdana.html|title=Zvijer iz bezdana |publisher=e-novine.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/74645/Kozaci-ne-obezbedjuju-manastir|title=Kozaci ne obezbeđuju manastir|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His group traveled from Cetinje to the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]]. On his return from Dubrovnik, he was again a guest at Cetinje.&lt;ref name=ENOVINE/&gt;

===War===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
The Serb Volunteer Guard, commonly known as "Arkan's Tigers", was organized as a paramilitary force supporting the Serb armies, set up in a former military facility in [[Erdut]]. The force, led by Arkan and [[Milorad Ulemek|Legija]], consisted of a core of 200 men and perhaps totaled no more than 500 to 1,000, but was much feared.&lt;ref&gt;Vasic, "Yugoslav Army" p. 134; UN experts ''Final Report'' par. 92, 139&lt;/ref&gt; It saw action from mid-1991 until late 1995, and was supplied and equipped privately, by the reserves of the Serbian police force, and through capturing enemy arms.

When war in Croatia broke out, the unit was active in the [[Vukovar]] region. After the Bosnian War broke out in April 1992 the unit moved between the Croatian and Bosnian fronts. In Croatia, it fought in various areas in [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] (Serbian Krajina). Arkan reportedly had a dispute over military operations with Krajina leader [[Milan Martić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/108/t108-4.htm|title=Vreme News Digest Agency No 108|publisher=Scc.rutgers.edu|date=18 October 1993|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bosnia, the unit notably fought in battles in and around [[Zvornik]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Brčko (city)|Brčko]], mostly against Bosniak and Bosnian Croat paramilitary groups.

In late 1995 his troops fought in the area of [[Banja Luka]], [[Sanski Most]] and [[Prijedor]]. In October 1995 he left Sanski Most, as the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Army]] reclaimed the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/vt2/sanskimost/u_spomen_/u_spomen_na_ubijene_sanjane.htm|title=U spomen na ubijene Sanjane|publisher=Angelfire.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ražnatović personally led most of the operations, and rewarded his most efficient officers and soldiers with ranks, medals and eventually products of lootings. Several younger soldiers were rewarded for their actions in and around [[Kopački Rit]] and [[Bijelo Brdo, Croatia|Bijelo Brdo]]. Ražnatović reportedly sent one of his most trusted men, Radovan Stanišić, to Italy to start a relationship with [[Camorra]] boss [[Francesco Schiavone]]. According to [[Roberto Saviano]], Schiavone eased arms smuggling to Serbia by stopping the Albanian mobsters' blocking of weapons routes, and helped money transfer into Serbia in the form of humanitarian aid [[Sanctions against Serbia|amid the international sanctions]]. In exchange the Camorra acquired companies, enterprises, shops and farms in Serbia at optimal prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giugenna.com/2003/07/13/roberto-saviano-scampia-erzegovina|title=Roberto Saviano. "Scampia-Erzegovina"|author=Giuseppe Genna|publisher=Giugenna.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war fame==
Ražnatović came to serve as a popular icon for both Serbs and their enemies. For some Serbs he was a patriot and folk hero, while serving as a target of hatred and fear to their enemies.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Arkan became an untouchable criminal figure in Belgrade and all of the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but it was very hard to prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the postwar period after the [[Dayton agreement]] was signed, Ražnatović returned to his interests in sport and private business. The Serb Volunteer Guard was officially disbanded in April 1996 with the threat to be reactivated in case of war emergency. In June of that year he took over a second division soccer team [[FK Obilić Belgrade|FK Obilić]] which he soon turned into a top caliber club, even winning the [[First League of FR Yugoslavia 1997-98|1997/98]] [[Serbian Superliga|Yugoslav league]] championship. According to a book by [[Franklin Foer]], ''[[How Soccer Explains the World|How Football Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization]]'', Ražnatović threatened players on opposing teams if they scored against [[FK Obilić Belgrade|Obilić]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This threat was underlined by the thousands of veterans from his army that filled their home field, chanting threats, and on occasion pointing pistols at opposition players during matches. One player told the British football magazine ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' that he was locked in a garage when his team played [[FK Obilić Belgrade|Obilić]]. Europe's football governing body, [[UEFA]], considered prohibiting Obilić from participation in continental competitions because of its connections to Ražnatović. In response to this, Ražnatović stepped away from the position of president and gave his seat to his wife [[Svetlana Ceca Ražnatović|Ceca]]. In a 2006 interview, [[Dragoslav Šekularac]] (who was coach of Obilić while Arkan was with the club) said claims that Arkan verbally and physically assaulted Obilić players were false.&lt;ref name="Get out of here, I am Sekularac by Prvoslav Vujcic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanbookcircle.com/get-out-of-here-i-am-sekularac-by-prvoslav-vujcic.html|author=[[Prvoslav Vujčić]], ''[[Urban Book Circle]]''|title=Get out of here, I am Šekularac|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ražnatović was a chairman of the Yugoslav Kickboxing Association. 

==Kosovo War and NATO bombing==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
According to chief judge [[Richard May (judge)|Richard May]] from the United Kingdom, the [[ICTY]] issued an indictment against Ražnatović on 30 September 1997 for war crimes of [[genocide]] against the Muslim population, [[crimes against humanity]] and grave breaches of the [[Geneva convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ark-ii970930e.htm|title=Tpiy|publisher=Un.org|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was not made public until 31 March 1999, a week after the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] had begun, as intervention in the [[Kosovo War]] (1998–99). Ražnatović's indictment was made public by the UN court's chief prosecutor [[Louise Arbour]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the week before the start of NATO bombing – as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] collapsed – Ražnatović appeared at the Hyatt hotel in Belgrade, where most Western journalists were staying, and ordered all of them to leave Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karon|first=Tony|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,22121,00.html|title=Serbs Unplug CNN|publisher=TIME|date=25 March 1999|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the NATO bombing, Ražnatović denied the war crime charges against him in interviews he gave to foreign reporters. Ražnatović accused NATO of bombing civilians and creating refugees of all ethnicities, and stated that he would deploy his troops only in the case of a direct NATO ground invasion. After the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]], which killed three journalists and led to a diplomatic row between the United States and the [[People’s Republic of China]], the [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade#Observer.2FPolitiken investigation|British ''Observer'' and Danish ''Politiken'' newspapers claimed]] the building might have been targeted because the office of the Chinese [[military attaché]] was being used by Ražnatović to communicate and transmit messages to his paramilitary group, the Tigers, in Kosovo. As neither paper offered any proof for this claim it was largely ignored by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/koSovo/press/b990508a.htm|title=Morning Briefing|accessdate=25 October 2009|date=8 May 1999|publisher=NATO Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkan showed a small rubber part of the [[1999 F-117A shootdown|downed F-117A]], which he had as "a souvenir", to Western journalists during the NATO bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOGU DA POLOMIM F-117A: Evo kako je ARKAN uništio ponos Amerike i "nevidljivi" bombarder!

==ICTY indictment==
In March 1999, the Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) announced that Ražnatović had been indicted by the Tribunal, although the indictment was only made public after his assassination. According to the indictment Ražnatović was to have been prosecuted on 24 charges of [[crimes against humanity]] (Art. 5 ICTY Statute), grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]] (Art. 2 ICTY Statute) and violations of the [[laws of war]] (Art. 3 ICTY Statute), for the following acts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/zeljko_raznjatovic/ind/en/ark-ii970930e.pdf|title=Ražnatović: Initial Indictment|format=PDF|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Forcibly detaining approximately thirty Muslim Bosniak men, in an inadequately ventilated room of approximately five square metres in size.
*Transporting twelve non-Serb men from [[Sanski Most]] to an isolated location in the village of [[Trnova, Ugljevik|Trnova]] and shooting them, killing eleven of the men and critically wounding the twelfth.
*Transporting approximately sixty-seven Bosniak Muslim men from Sanski Most, Sehovci, and Pobrijeze to an isolated location in the village of Sasina, and shooting them, killing sixty-five of the captives and wounding two survivors.
*Forcibly detaining approximately thirty-five Muslim Bosnian men in an inadequately ventilated room of about five square metres in size, withholding from them food and water, resulting in the deaths of two men.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Assassination==
[[File:Continental Hotel Belgrade.jpg|thumb|left|Hotel Intercontinental]]
Ražnatović was assassinated, on Saturday, 15 January 2000, 17:05 [[GMT]], in the lobby of Belgrade's elite [[Hotel Beograd InterContinental|InterContinental Hotel]], a location where he was surrounded by other hotel guests. The killer, Dobrosav Gavrić, a 23-year-old junior police mobile brigade member, had ties to the underworld and was on sick leave at the time. He walked up alone toward his target from behind. Ražnatović was sitting and chatting with two  friends and, according to BBC Radio, was filling out a betting slip. Gavrić waited for a few minutes, calmly walked up behind the party, and rapidly fired a succession of bullets from his [[CZ-99]] pistol. Ražnatović was shot in his left eye and lapsed into a coma on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/01/17/arkan.killing|title=Breaking, World, Business, Sports, Entertainment and Video News|publisher=Archives.cnn.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/605172.stm|title=Serbian warlord shot dead|publisher=BBC News|date=15 January 2000|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bodyguard Zvonko Mateović put him into a car, and rushed him to a hospital, but he died on the way.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1069219|title=Arkan Dead|publisher=NPR|date=15 January 2000|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his widow, [[Ceca (singer)|Svetlana]], Ražnatović died in her arms as they were driving to the hospital. His companions Milenko Mandić, a business manager, and Dragan Garić, a police inspector, were also shot to death by Gavrić, who in turn was shot and wounded by Mateović. A female bystander was seriously wounded in the shootout as well. After complicated surgery, Gavrić survived, but was disabled and confined to a wheelchair as the result of a spinal wound.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Arkanov grob.jpg|thumb|right|Arkan's grave]]
A memorial ceremony in Ražnatović's honour was held on 19 January 2000 with writer [[Branislav Crnčević]], [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL) official [[Aleksandar Vulin]], singers [[Oliver Mandić]], [[Toni Montano]], and [[Zoran Kalezić]], along with the entire first team of [[FK Obilić]] with club director Dragoslav Šekularac in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1188784 Šta je ostalo od Arkanove garde]; Vreme.com, 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Željko Ražnatović was buried at the [[Novo groblje, Belgrade|Novo groblje (New Cemetery)]] in Belgrade with military honours by his volunteers and with [[funeral rite]]s on 20 January 2000. Around 10,000 people attended the funeral.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Trials===
Dobrosav Gavrić pleaded innocent but was convicted and sentenced to 19 years in prison. His accomplices received from 3 to 15 years each, after a year-long trial in 2002. However the district court verdict was overturned by the Supreme Court because of "lack of evidence and vagueness of the first trial process". A new trial was conducted in 2006, ending on 9 October 2006 with guilty verdicts upheld for Gavrić as well as his accomplices, Milan Đuričić and Dragan Nikolić. Each man was sentenced to 30 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mondo.rs/a47127/Info/Srbija/Sedam-godina-od-ubistva-Arkana.html Sedam godina od ubistva Arkana]; mondo.rs, 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
{{speculation|section|date=May 2016}}
[[National Public Radio (United States)|NPR]] reported that Arkan simply knew too much when war crimes trials were becoming a reality for the Milošević regime.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Former French Intelligence Officer Pierre-Henri Bunel suggested that "the executors of the political dirty work for the White House", who may have used Ražnatović as a puppet, were fearful of the disclosure of revelations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politiquedevie.net/Etats-Unis/AlQuaidaPHBunel.htm|title=La naissance d'Al Quaïda - Pierre-Henri Bunel|publisher=Politiquedevie.net|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunel corroborates his claim by indicating that "...&amp;nbsp;c'est justement parce qu'on ne le cherche pas où il faudrait qu'on ne trouve pas l'ennemi public numéro 1 du moment". Ražnatović was, as stated above, on Interpol's Most Wanted list for nearly two decades.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Personal life==
Željko Ražnatović fathered nine children by five different women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tomislav Nikolić|url=http://www.kurir-info.rs/clanak/crna-hronika/kurir-29-06-2008/ameri|title=Ameri - Kurir|publisher=Kurir-info.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207131354/http://kurir-info.rs/clanak/crna-hronika/kurir-29-06-2008/ameri|archive-date=7 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His eldest son Mihajlo was born in [[Gothenburg]], in 1975, from a relationship with a Swedish woman. In 1992, 17-year-old Mihajlo decided to move to Serbia to live with his father. During this time the teenager was photographed wearing the uniform of his father's paramilitary unit during the Yugoslav Wars and according to a Swedish tabloid report the youngster participated in combat operations in [[Srebrenica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/de-skulle-avratta-srebrenica-fangar|title=De skulle avrätta Srebrenica-fångar|publisher=Expressen.se|date=11 July 2005|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihajlo has since lived in Belgrade where he played for the [[KHK Crvena zvezda|Red Star Belgrade ice-hockey club]] off and on between 2000 and 2009, also representing Serbia-Montenegro on the national team level between 2002 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?statsleague=NLA&amp;player=69700&amp;team=&amp;year=&amp;status=&amp;leagueid=&amp;season=|title=Mihajlo Raznatovic|publisher=Eliteprospects.com|date=10 March 1975|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also ran a sushi restaurant in Belgrade called Iki Bar and dated Macedonian pop singer [[Karolina Gočeva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/zabava/57157/Srecan-sam-sa-Karolinom|title=Stara arhiva|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Serbia after that.

In 2013 he was in the news in Serbia again following the conclusion of a court case that had dragged on since 2005 over Ražnatović's failure to meet the repayment terms on a [[Serbian dinar|RSD]]1.1 million [[car loan]] he took out in 2002 from [[Komercijalna banka|Komercijalna Banka]]. After continually failing to meet his monthly payments, the bank wanted the loan paid off in full in August 2005, and two years later took him to court. In June 2010 he was ordered to pay RSD3.3 million based upon the interest on the original loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alo.rs/vesti/51754/Sud_jurio_Arkanovog_sina_u_Cecinoj_vili |title=Stari ALO! - Sud jurio Arkanovog sina u Cecinoj vili! |publisher=Alo.rs |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825222656/http://www.alo.rs/vesti/51754/Sud_jurio_Arkanovog_sina_u_Cecinoj_vili |archivedate=25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the verdict stated he owed the bank RSD2.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alo.rs/vesti/aktuelno/arkanov-sin-mora-da-vrati-tri-miliona-dinara/15286|title=Arkanov sin mora da vrati tri miliona dinara!|publisher=Alo.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkan also fathered two other children out of wedlock.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Ražnatović's first wife was Natalija Martinović, a Spanish language professor, with whom he had four children. Their divorce became official in December 1994. All four children decided to carry their mother's surname.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
[[File:Ceca2006.png|thumb|Arkan's best known wife [[Svetlana Ražnatović|Ceca]], famous Serbian [[turbo-folk]] singer]]
Since 1993, Ražnatović had been involved with folk singer [[Svetlana Ceca Ražnatović|"Ceca"]], 21 years his junior. Their lavish wedding ceremony on 19 February 1995 occurred as a day-long media production carried live on [[RTV Pink|TV Pink]] with different locations and changes of clothing (at different points of the ceremony Ražnatović alternated between [[World War I]] Serb military uniform and traditional Montenegrin attire). Ceca bore him two more children.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In June 1994, sometime after her separation from Ražnatović, Natalija Martinović and their four children left Yugoslavia and moved to [[Athens, Greece]], where Ražnatović bought them an apartment in the suburb of [[Glyfada]]. After Ražnatović's death, Martinović disputed his [[Will (law)|will]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/11/30/srpski/R00112702.shtm|title=Glas-javnosti (30 November 2000), a|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/12/02/srpski/R00120101.shtm|title=Glas-javnosti (2 December 2000)|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that Ceca, his second wife, doctored it. In May 2000, she sued Ceca over Ražnatović's assets, including the villa at Ljutice Bogdana Street in which he and Ceca lived (and where Ceca continues to reside), claiming it was built with funds from a bank loan Martinović and Ražnatović took out in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/11/30/srpski/R00112701.shtm|title=Glas-javnosti (30 November 2000), b|publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court eventually ruled against Martinović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=416198|title=Portret savremenika - Svetlana Ceca Raznatovic: Zitije sa pevanjem i pucanjem|publisher=Vreme.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court agreed with her assertions that the villa was built with money from a 1985 bank loan taken out by her and Ražnatović, but ruled she had forfeited any rights in future division of that asset when she signed the property over to Ražnatović in 1994 before moving to Greece.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2012, Ražnatović's son by his first wife, Vojin Martinović, again accused Ceca of falsifying Ražnatović's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alo.rs/vesti/44988/Ceca_je_lazirala_Arkanov_testament |title=Stari ALO! - Ceca je lažirala Arkanov testament! |publisher=Alo.rs |accessdate=1 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622075756/http://www.alo.rs/vesti/44988/Ceca_je_lazirala_Arkanov_testament |archivedate=22 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Ražnatović's former associate [[Borislav Pelević]] said that the villa at Ljutice Bogdana Street was not mentioned in Ražnatović's will as he had already signed it over to his second wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Hronika/192456/Cecine-vile-nema-u-Arkanovom-testamentu|title=Cecine vile nema u Arkanovom testamentu!|publisher=Vesti-online.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unit's commander (played by [[Sergej Trifunović]]) is obviously based on Ražnatović.
* In the 2014 Serbian docu-drama series ''Dosije: Beogradski klanovi'', one of the episodes tells the story of Ražnatović.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Audrey Pellew Hylton-Foster, Baroness Hylton-Foster''' [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (née Brown; 19 May 1908 &amp;ndash; 31 October 2002),  was the daughter of [[Viscount Ruffside|Douglas Clifton Brown, 1st Viscount Ruffside]], and Violet Cicely Kathleen Wollaston. She married [[Harry Hylton-Foster|Sir Harry Braustyn Hylton-Foster]], who had started a distinguished career at the Bar in 1931; they had no children.

Born in [[Shimla|Simla]], [[India]], she was educated at St George’s, Ascot, and Ivy House, Wimbledon. Both her father and husband served as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]].

==Red Cross work==
Audrey Hylton-Foster first lived at Speaker’s House during her father’s time there, when she went to recover from [[measles]]. While she was convalescing she started working for the [[British Red Cross]], and this, apart from politics, became her life’s work.

During [[World War II]] she was a nurse at St Luke’s Hospital, Chelsea. She cycled thousands of miles around London on her Red Cross duties. In 1950 she became director of the [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] division of the British Red Cross. She was at various times president, chairman and patron of the London branch. In late 1980 she was acting as consultant at the national headquarters.

==Politics==
Her husband began his political career after World War II. He lost his first try at a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the [[Shipley (UK Parliament constituency)|Shipley]] constituency in 1945. By 1950 he was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for York. In 1951 and 1955 his majorities were slim; however, in 1959, after changing constituencies, his majority was a very healthy 17,000.

After her husband's death in office in 1965, she was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baroness Hylton-Foster''', of the [[City of Westminster]] on 7 December 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43834 |date=7 December 1965 |page=11451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her prior objections to women politicians, she became an active member of the [[House of Lords]], and for many years served as Convenor of the [[Crossbench]] peers. She was appointed a Dame of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in the 1990 [[Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52173 |date=16 June 1990 |page=7 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-politics==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Audrey Hylton-Foster lived in a converted Coach House on Leith Hill in [[Surrey]]. Each year she decided to open her gardens to the public, in order to raise money for various charities. One year, with help from actress [[Virginia McKenna]], a substantial amount was raised for the [[Born Free Foundation]].

She was a passionate gardener in her later years and would be out in her garden in all weathers right up until her death. The Garden Open Day raised funds for a number of good causes including the British Red Cross, Cancer Research, local schools etc. All supported by her loyal staff Mr and Mrs Pinchin.

==Death==
She died on 31 October 2002, at her home, aged 94.

'''Bhagwat Subramanya Chandrasekhar''' (informally '''Chandra'''; born 17 May 1945) is a former [[Indian cricketer]] who played as a [[leg spin]]ner. Considered among the top echelon of leg spinners, Chandrasekhar along with [[E.A.S. Prasanna]], [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] and [[Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan]] constituted the [[Indian spin quartet]] that dominated spin bowling during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=rajesh&gt;{{cite web|title=When spin was king|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/531827.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=8 February 2014|author=S Rajesh|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a very young age, [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] left his right arm withered. Chandrasekhar played 58 Test matches, capturing 242 wickets at an average of 29.74 in a career that spanned sixteen years.&lt;ref name=rajesh/&gt;

Chandrasekhar was named as a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketer of the Year]] in 1972; in 2002 he won Wisden's award for "Best bowling performance of the century" for India, for his six wickets for 38 runs against England at the Oval in 1971.&lt;ref name=WisdenICoC&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2531/25310120.htm | title=This is my finest hour: Kapil Dev | work=[[The Sportstar]] Vol. 25 No. 31 | date=8 March 2002 | accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Chandrasekhar was born in 1945 in [[Mysore]], where he had his primary education.&lt;ref name=raggie&gt;{{cite web|last=Muddie|first=Raggi|title=The Spin Wizard – B S Chandrashekhar|url=http://www.karnataka.com/personalities/bs-chandrashekhar/|publisher=Karnataka.com|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an early interest in cricket watching the playing styles of Australian leg spinner [[Richie Benaud]]. An attack of polio at the age of six left his right arm withered. At the age of 10, his hand had recovered and Chandrasekhar started playing cricket.&lt;ref name=raggie/&gt;

By that time his family relocated to [[Bangalore]] and he got an opportunity to play for "City Cricketers".&lt;ref name=raggie/&gt; In an interview, Chandrasekhar stated that he joined up mainly to get a chance to play with the leather ball.&lt;ref name=raggie/&gt; While playing on the streets of Bangalore, he had mainly used a rubber ball. While playing for the club, Chandrasekhar tried different bowling styles that also included fast bowling.&lt;ref name=raggie/&gt; It was in 1963 that he decided to play as a leg spin bowler. His idea proved to be right as he was soon selected for the national side.&lt;ref name=raggie/&gt;

Making his Test debut for India against England at Bombay in 1964, he collected four wickets in the match. He was named the ''[[Indian Cricket (annual)|Indian Cricket]]'' Cricketer of the Year the same year. Chandrasekhar was influential in setting up India's first victory in England when he picked up six wickets for 38 runs at [[The Oval]] in 1971; the bowling was named the "Indian Bowling performance of the century" by ''Wisden'' in 2002.&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Players / India / Bhagwath Chandrasekhar|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/27591.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=14 April 2013|author=H Natarajan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' noted that, "[Chandrasekhar] was wonderfully accurate for a bowler of his type, and his extra pace made him a formidable proposition even on the sluggish Oval pitch."&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=India's day of glory|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/527248.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His consistent bowling performances in 1971 earned him being named one of the five ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

In a Test against New Zealand in 1976, Chandrasekhar and Prasanna took 19 wickets and were crucial in setting up India's win. Attributed to him is a famous umpire-directed quote, made during a day of bad decisions in New Zealand after several of his [[leg before wicket|lbw]] appeals were given not out: "I know he is bowled, but is he out?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=129115 |title=India's Aussie tour: Sissy Australians and dumb umpires | periodical=Merinews | date=6 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/1999/oct/23dilip.htm | title=Nothing to Crowe about | author=Dilip Vengsarkar | periodical=Rediff | date=23 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chandrasekhar also played a major role in India's victory in Australia in 1977–78.&lt;ref name=rajesh/&gt;During that series he became the first bowler in test history to register the identical figures in a same test(6/52 in both innings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/steve-okeefe-turns-india-australia-test-into-a-cricket-statisticians-delight-580461|title=Steve O’Keefe turns India-Australia Test into a cricket statistician’s delight|last=Kumar|first=Abhishek|date=2017-02-25|work=Cricket Country|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bezmiara Kadın''' {{lang-ota|بزمِ آرا قادین}}) was a consort of Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Life==
Bezmiara's parentage is not mentioned in any of the contemporary chronicles. Her personal name is unknown. She was a [[Circassians|Circassian]], born 1845, and was the adoptive daughter of Fatimat-uz Zahra Galin Hanım, daughter of Muhammad Arif Pasha and former wife of Prince Ismail Iskander Ali Kamil Pasha, son of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. Fatimat-uz Zahra Galin Hanım named her Bezmara and later she moved to Istanbul. Bezmiara was delivered at the court of the Sultan Abdülmecid, where she was renamed Bezmican and was given private education in the harem department of the [[Topkapı Palace]]. Having gone one day to pay a visit to Misirli Hanım, he perceived a women whose beauty  made so lively an impression on his heart, that he  had only one desire to gain possession of her. She, informed of the passion with which her charms had inspired him, refused to become the Sultan's wife. His passion and his character coming to his aid, Abdülmedcid consented to marry the object of his affections. Their nuptials were celebrated with dazzling magnificence, and a rare thing with an Ottoman sovereign he proved faithful. He not only loved his wife but esteemed her.

In 1862 she married secondly to Lieutenant general, Tevfik Pasha, a painter and went to [[Bursa]]. In 1872 she gave birth to her and Tevlik's Pasha's only daughter, Emine Cavidan Hanım who became one of the well known artists of [[Istanbul]]. Emine Cavidan Hanım married [[Serfiraz Hanım]]'s son, Şehzade Suleiman Selim Efendi and became her daughter-in-law. Bezmara was divorced for a second time and returned to Istanbul. She was married thirdly to the director of Awqaf, Ahmed Pasha. Before Fatimat uz-Zahra Galin Hanım's death in 1858, she also paid a visit to her. She died in [[Istanbul]] on 25 January 1909 and is buried near the mausoleum of Sultan [[Mahmud II]], located at Divan Yolu street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4dw.net/royalark/|title=The Royal Ark – Royal and Ruling Houses of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas|publisher=4dw.net|author=Christopher Buyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3169">'''Robert Arthur (Bob) Roseveare''' (May 23, 1923 – December 8, 2004) was a codebreaker at [[Bletchley Park]] during World War II and later a schoolteacher.

He was born at [[Repton]], [[Derbyshire]] where his father, Sir Martin Roseveare, taught at [[Repton School]]. He won a scholarship to [[Marlborough College]], Wiltshire, where he studied from 1936 to 1941. 

In 1942 Roseveare and fellow Marlborough student Nigel Forward were recruited by [[Gordon Welchman]]  (who also went to Marlborough College) for [[Hut 6]] at [[Bletchley Park]] where they worked on German Air Force (Luftwaffe) [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages. Roseveare started in the ''Watch'', then moved to the ''Quatch'', a small backroom group that decoded non-current messages. When Germany surrendered, Bob moved to the Japanese section, until August 1945.

Roseveare met his future wife in Hut 6, [[Ione Roseveare|Ione Jay]], full name Katherine Ione Jay. They married on August 7, 1947, with [[Derek Taunt]] as best man. His friend from Marlborough, Nigel Forward, [[Denis Babbage]] and three others in Hut 6 also met their wives there. 

After leaving Bletchley Park, Roseveare took up a scholarship he had won in 1941 to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and was awarded a degree in mathematics in 1947. In 1948 while touring [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]] with a mixed Oxford and Cambridge hockey team he accepted a teaching post at [[Hilton College (South Africa)|Hilton College]], Natal. He moved to [[Michaelhouse]], Natal, then St Martin’s School, [[Johannesburg]], then to a multiracial school at Waterford, [[Swaziland]]. He was licensed by the Archbishop of [[Cape Town]] as a [[lay reader]]. 

He returned to England in 1965, where he taught at Epsom College, then (1970–1983) at [[Uppingham School]], [[Rutland]], becoming the head of the Mathematics department in 1980. After retiring in 1983 he taught at the Haberdashers’ Monmouth School for Girls for a year.

He was keen on the operas of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and on the history of the Rosevear (also spelled Roseveare or Rosevere) family from [[Cornwall]], England, starting about AD 1500 in the hamlet of [[Rescorla, Cornwall|Rescorla]] near [[Luxulyan]]. Between 1985 and 1990 Bob published seven booklets on the Roseveare family, which have been updated and reissued as one book, with information on 14,779 descendants throughout the world. His sister [[Helen Roseveare]] was a medical missionary in the Congo for 20 years. 

He died aged 81 at [[Uppingham]] on 8 December 2004.

His name literally means "Cloth Sack",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and refers to the bag that he is conventionally depicted as carrying as he wanders aimlessly. His jolly nature, humorous personality, and eccentric lifestyle distinguishes him from most Buddhist masters or figures. He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the "Laughing Buddha" ({{lang-zh|c=笑佛|p=Xiào Fó|links=no}}).&lt;ref name="laughing" /&gt; The main textual evidence pointing to Budai resides in a collection of [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] monks’ biographies known as the "Ching te chuan teng lu", also known as [[Transmission of the Lamp|The Transmission of the Lamp]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chan Master Pu-tai |last=Chapin |first=H. B. |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society|year=1933|volume=53|issue =1|jstor=593188 |doi=10.2307/593188 |pages=47-52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography==

Budai has origins centered around cult worship and local legend.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is traditionally depicted as a fat, bald monk wearing a simple robe. He carries his few possessions in a cloth sack, being poor but content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legend of the Laughing Buddha|last=Seow|first=|publisher=Asiapac Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would excitingly entertain the adoring children that followed him and was known for patting his large belly happily. His figure appears throughout Chinese culture as a representation of both contentment and abundance. Budai attracted the townspeople around him as he was able to predict people’s fortunes and even weather patterns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wandering monk was often inclined to sleep anywhere he came to, even outside, for his mystical powers could ward off the bitter colds of snow and his body was left unaffected. A recovered death note dated to 916 A.D., which the monk himself wrote, claims that he is an incarnation of the [[Maitreya]], The Buddha of the Future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

==Chan/Zen Buddhism== 
Budai was one of several "uncommitted saints" (C: sansheng) that became incorporated into the Zen Pantheon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Similar "eccentric" figures from the lamp histories were never officially inducted or appropriated into the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] patriarchal line. Instead, these obscure figures represented the "special transmission" that occurred during the early to mid 12th century. This transmission did not rely on patriarchal lineage for legitimacy, but instead used the peculiar personalities and qualities of various folkloric figures to illustrate the Chan tradition's new commitment to the idea of "awakening" and the propagation of Chan to a larger congregation. The Chan Masters, [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089&amp;ndash;1163) and [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (dates{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2018}}), were both leaders in the initial merging of local legend and Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They hoped the induction of likeable and odd figures would attract all types of people to the Chan tradition, no matter their gender, social background, or complete understanding of the dharma and patriarchal lineage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bernard Faure summarizes this merging of local legend and Chan tradition by explaining, "One strategy in Chan for domesticating the occult was to transform thaumaturges into tricksters by playing down their occult powers and stressing their thus world aspect..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The movement allocated the figures as religious props and channeled their extraordinary charismas into the lens of the Chan pantheon in order to appeal to a larger population. Ultimately, Budai was revered from both a folkloric standpoint as a strange, wandering vagabond of the people as well as from his newfound personage within the context of the Chan tradition as a 'mendicant priest'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who brought abundance, fortune, and joy to all he encountered with the help of his mystical "cloth sack" bag.

As Zen Buddhism was transmitted to Japan around the 13th century, the devout monastics and laymen of the area utilized figure painting to portray the characters central to this "awakening" period of Zen art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the eccentric personalities that were inducted into the Zen tradition like Budai were previously wrapped up in the established culture and folklore of the Japanese people. The assimilation and reapplication of these wondrous charismas to the Zen pantheon assisted in the expansion of the Zen tradition.
Budai is almost always depicted with his "cloth sack" that looks like a large bag. The bag serves as a prominent motif within the context of Zen Buddhism as it represents abundance, prosperity, and contentment. Ink paintings such as these attributed to Budai often had an inscription and seal that signaled to high ranking officials. For example, ''Budai and Jiang Mohe'' was inscribed by Chusi Fanqi, who was closely related to [[Song Lian]] (1310–1381) and Wei Su (1295–1372).

As the images demonstrate, Budai is most jubilant when in the presence of others, especially children. When depicted with other gods in "[[Seven Lucky Gods|the Seven Lucky Gods]]", Budai maintains a solemn or even depressed countenance. Budai's round figure comes into practical use through the sculpting of the incense box (18th century) that splits the monk's body into two halves. The newer images such as ''Hotei and Children Carrying Lanterns'' (19th century) employs much more color, dramatization of physical features, and detail than the older pieces such as ''Hotei'' from [[Mokuan Reien|Mokuan Rein]] (1336) that employs much more wispy and heavily contrasting outlines of his figure with no color or assumed setting.

==Conflation with other religious figures==

===Angida Arhat===
[[File:Wang Zhen Budai under a pine tree 1921 RCH 1027 img02.jpg|200|thumbnail|right|Budai under a pine tree, [[Museum Rietberg]], Zurich]]

Angida was one of the original [[Eighteen Arhats]]. According to legend, Angida was a talented Indian snake catcher whose aim was to catch venomous snakes to prevent them from biting passers-by. Angida would also remove the snake's venomous fangs and release them. Due to his kindness, he was able to attain [[bodhi]].

In Chinese art, Angida is sometimes portrayed as Budai, being rotund, laughing, and carrying a bag.&lt;ref name="sound"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sound of One Hand: Paintings and Calligraphy by Zen Master Hakuin|last1=Seo|first1=Audrey Yoshiko|last2=Addiss|first2=Stephen|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2010|ISBN=9781590305782|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gautama Buddha===
In the [[Western World]], Budai is often mistaken for [[Gautama Buddha]], and thus is nicknamed the "Fat Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Christopher|title=When Did the Buddha Become Fat?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-good-life/201207/when-did-the-buddha-become-fat|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phra Sangkajai/Phra Sangkachai===
In [[Thailand]], Budai is sometimes confused with another similar monk widely respected in Thailand, ''Phra Sangkajai'' or ''Sangkachai'' ({{lang-th|พระสังกัจจายน์}}). Phra Sangkajai ({{lang-th|มหากัจจายนเถระ}}), a Thai rendering of [[Katyayana (Buddhist)|Kaccayana]], was an arhat during the time of the Buddha. Buddha praised Phra Sangkachai for his excellence in explaining sophisticated [[dharma]] (or [[dhamma]]) in an easily and correctly understandable manner. Phra Sangkajai (Maha Kaccana) also composed the Madhupinadika Sutra (Madhupindika Sutta MN 18).

One tale of the [[Thai folklore]] relates that he was so handsome that once even a man wanted him for a wife. To avoid a similar situation, Phra Sangkadchai decided to transform himself into a fat monk. Another tale says he was so attractive that angels and men often compared him with the Buddha. He considered this inappropriate, so disguised himself in an unpleasantly fat body.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Although both Budai and Phra Sangkachai may be found in both Thai and Chinese temples, Phra Sangkachai is found more often in Thai temples, and Budai in Chinese temples. Two points to distinguish them from one another are:
# Phra Sangkajai has a trace of hair on his head (looking similar to the Buddha's) while Budai is clearly bald.
# Phra Sangkajai wears the robes in [[Theravada]] fashion, with the robes folded across one shoulder, leaving the other uncovered. Budai wears the robes in Chinese style, covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered.

'''Cary Anthony Stayner''' (born August 13, 1961) is an American [[serial killer]]. Stayner's early life was marked by the abduction of his younger brother, [[Steven Stayner|Steven]] by [[sex offender]] [[Kenneth Parnell]]. 

He was convicted of the murders of four women between February and July 1999: Carole Sund, her teenage daughter Juli Sund and their teenage traveling companion Silvina Pelosso, and [[NatureBridge|Yosemite Institute]] naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong. The murders occurred in [[Mariposa County, California]], near [[Yosemite National Park]]. Cary Stayner was sentenced to death for the four murders, and as of September 2018 remains on death row at [[San Quentin|San Quentin Penitentiary]] in California.&lt;ref name=T75166&gt;{{cite web |title=Stayner, Cary Anthony |website=Inmate Locator |url=https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Details.aspx?ID=T75166 |publisher=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation |accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Prof.--&gt;

Stayner was born and raised Mormon in [[Merced, California]]. His younger brother, [[Steven Stayner|Steven]], was kidnapped by [[Child molestation|child molester]] [[Kenneth Parnell]] in 1972, when Cary was 11, and held captive for more than seven years before escaping and being reunited with his family.&lt;ref name=spokesmen&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19890918&amp;id=bVxWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CvADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3385,5272950&amp;hl=en|title=Crash ends life scarred by childhood abduction|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=[[Cowles Company]]|location=Spokane, Washington|agency=[[Associated Press]]|pages=A1-A2|date=September 18, 1989|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cary Stayner later said that he felt neglected while his parents grieved over the loss of Steven.&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Susan|last1=Sward|first2=Stacy|last2=Finz|first3=Meredith|last3=May|first4=Torri|last4=Minton|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Overshadowed-All-His-Life-Low-key-Cary-Stayner-2915936.php|title=Overshadowed All His Life|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=July 30, 1999|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Steven escaped from Parnell and returned home in 1980, he received massive [[Mass media|media]] attention; a [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] book and [[TV movie]], both titled ''[[I Know My First Name is Steven]]'', were made about the ordeal. Steven died in a motorcycle accident in 1989. The following year Stayner's uncle Jesse, with whom he was living at the time, was murdered; Stayner later claimed that his uncle molested him when he was 11.&lt;ref name="finz"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stacy|last=Finz|title=The case of a lifetime|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-case-of-a-lifetime-For-Cary-Stayner-there-2710937.php|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=December 15, 2002|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stayner is reported to have attempted suicide in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Orrin|last=Gray|url=https://the-line-up.com/yosemite-killer|title=The Yosemite Killer: Cary Stayner's Twisted Mind|website=[[The Lineup (TV program)|The Lineup]]|date=11 September 2017|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was arrested in 1997 for possession of marijuana&lt;ref name="bg" /&gt; and [[methamphetamine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Eric|last1=Bailey|first2=Mark|last2=Arax|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/26/news/mn-59682|title=Man Is Suspect in Both Yosemite Murder Cases|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=July 26, 1999|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although these charges were eventually dropped.&lt;ref name="bg" /&gt;

==Crimes==
In 1997, Stayner was hired as a handyman at the Cedar Lodge motel in [[El Portal, California|El Portal]], just outside the Highway 140 Arch Rock entrance to Yosemite National Park.&lt;ref name="bg" /&gt; Between February and July 1999, he murdered two women and two teenagers: Carole Sund; her daughter, 15-year-old Juli Sund; their travel companion, 16-year-old Argentine exchange student Silvina Pelosso; and [[NatureBridge|Yosemite Institute]] employee Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, a naturalist.&lt;ref name="finz" /&gt; The first two victims, Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso, were found in the trunk of the charred remains of Carole's [[Pontiac]] rental car.&lt;ref name="finz" /&gt; The bodies were burned beyond recognition and were identified using dental records. A note was sent to police with a hand-drawn map indicating the location of the third victim, Juli Sund.&lt;ref name="finz" /&gt; The top of the note read, "We had fun with this one." Investigators went to the location depicted on the map and found the remains of Juli, whose throat had been cut.

Detectives began interviewing employees of the Cedar Lodge motel where the first three victims had been staying just before their deaths. One of those employees was Cary Stayner, but he was not considered a suspect at that point because he had no criminal history and remained calm during the police interview.&lt;ref name=Finz&gt;{{cite news |first=Stacy |last=Finz |date=December 14, 2002 |title=The Case of a Lifetime, Part Two |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/s/p/2002/stayner/STAYNER15PART2.DTL |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628032140/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fs%2Fp%2F2002%2Fstayner%2FSTAYNER15PART2.DTL |archivedate=June 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |access-date=August 13, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the decapitated body of the fourth victim Joie Ruth Armstrong was found, eyewitnesses said they saw a blue 1979 [[International Scout]] parked outside the cabin where Armstrong was staying. Detectives traced this vehicle to Stayner.&lt;ref name="finz" /&gt; This caused Stayner to become the prime suspect in the case. [[FBI]] agents John Boles and Jeff Rinek found Stayner staying at Laguna del Sol nudist resort in [[Wilton, California|Wilton]], where he was arrested. His vehicle yielded evidence linking him to Joie Armstrong. During his interrogation, Stayner confessed to the four murders as well as to sending the map for finding Juli Sund's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/US/9907/27/yosemite.murder.01/index.html|title=Yosemite suspect confesses to 4 killings|work=[[CNN]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=July 27, 1999|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stayner claimed after his arrest that he had fantasized about murdering women since he was seven years old, long before the abduction of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joshua|last=Hammer|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1889286/yosemite-horror|title=The Yosemite Horror|website=Outside|date=November 1, 1999|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and conviction==

Stayner pleaded [[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. His lawyers claimed that the Stayner family had a history of sexual abuse and mental illness, manifesting itself not only in the murders, but also his [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and request to be provided with [[child pornography]] in return for his confession.&lt;ref name="crimelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Joseph |last=Geringer |title=Cary Stayner and the Yosemite Murders |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stayner/index_1.html |work=truTV Crime Library |date=February 12, 1999 |accessdate=April 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085708/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/stayner/index_1.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jose Arturo Silva testified that Stayner had mild [[autism]], obsessive-compulsive disorder, and [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="SF Gate"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stacy|last=Finz|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Stayner-called-mentally-impaired-Psychiatrist-2789309.php|title=Stayner called mentally impaired / Psychiatrist testifies for defense |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=July 30, 2002 |accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stayner was nevertheless found sane and convicted of four counts of [[first degree murder]] by a jury on August 27, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stacy|last=Finz|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Stayner-guilty-of-1st-degree-murder-Former-2778047.php|title=Stayner guilty of 1st-degree murder / Former handyman could now face death penalty|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst corporation]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=August 27, 2002|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communist Romania}}

'''Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968''' was a public address by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party|General Secretary]] of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and [[President of Romania|President]] of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]] of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], strongly condemning the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. On the night of 20–21 August 1968, five [[Warsaw Pact]] nations - the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[East Germany]], and [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] - invaded [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in an effort to quell the [[Socialism with a human face|reformist ideology]] of [[Alexander Dubček]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].

On 21 August, in what became his most famous speech,&lt;ref&gt;Conflicted Memories: Europeanizing Contemporary Histories, edited by Konrad H. Jarausch, Thomas Lindenberger, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu boldly denounced the invasion in a public address before 100,000 people in [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Palace Square]] in [[Bucharest]], and declared that it was a "grave error and constituted a serious danger to peace in Europe and for the prospects of world socialism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/apoteoza-ceausescu-21-august-1968-1_50dc9b51596d72009141826b/index.html Apoteoza lui Ceaușescu – 21 august 1968]&lt;/ref&gt; His address was perceived as a bold gesture of disobedience to the Soviet Union both at home and abroad. The speech was part of the post-1956 efforts of the communist elite in Bucharest to emancipate their Party from [[Moscow]].

Ceaușescu's response consolidated Romania's independent voice in the next two decades, especially after Ceaușescu encouraged the population to take up arms in order to meet any similar maneuver in the country: he received an enthusiastic initial response, with many people, who were by no means communist, willing to enroll in the newly formed paramilitary [[Patriotic Guards (Romania)|Patriotic Guards]].

'''Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle''' ({{IPA-fr|klod ʒɔzɛf ʁuʒɛ d(ə) lil|lang}}), sometimes spelled '''de l'Isle''' or '''de Lile'''&lt;ref&gt;Brian N. Morton, Donald C. Spinelli, ''Beaumarchais and the American Revolution,''Lexington Books, 2003, p. 303. {{ISBN|9780739104682}}&lt;/ref&gt; (10 May 1760 – 26 June 1836), was a [[France|French]] army officer of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. He is known for writing the words and music of the ''Chant de guerre pour l'armée du Rhin'' in 1792, which would later be known as ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and become the French [[national anthem]].

==Early life==
Rouget de Lisle was born at [[Lons-le-Saunier]], reputedly on a market day. His parents lived in the neighbouring village of [[Montaigu, Jura|Montaigu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laterredecheznous.com/news/archivestory.php/aid/942/Lons,_une__petite__ville_en_lettres_capitales.html Lons, une "petite" ville en lettres capitales] at La Terre de chez nous (in French) 10 April 2004. Retrieved 7 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque was placed at the precise spot of his birth and a statue erected in the town's center in 1882. He was the eldest son of Claude Ignace Rouget (5 April 1735 &amp;ndash; 6 August 1792) at [[Orgelet]] and Jeanne Madeleine Gaillande (2 July 1734 &amp;ndash; 20 March 1811).&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[http://www.geneall.net/F/per_page.php?id=475543 Family Tree Rouget]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Rouget de Lisle1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Rouget de Lisle in 1792.]]
He enlisted into the army as an [[engineer]] and attained the rank of captain. A royalist, like his father, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new constitution.&lt;ref name=Masterpieces&gt;Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Richard Stockton, Nathan Haskell Dole, Julian Hawthorne, Caroline Ticknor, ''The World's Great Masterpieces.'' American literary society, 1901, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JxiGAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9577&amp;dq=Claude_Joseph_Rouget_de_Lisle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-nIZVcOEKoOqgwS9voCQAw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAzhG#v=onepage&amp;q=Claude_Joseph_Rouget_de_Lisle&amp;f=false p. 9577].&lt;/ref&gt; Rouget de Lisle  was cashiered and thrown into prison in 1793, narrowly escaping the guillotine. He was freed during the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] and retired to Montague.&lt;ref name=Masterpieces/&gt;

===La Marseillaise===
The [[song]] that has immortalized him, ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', was composed at [[Strasbourg]], where Rouget de Lisle was garrisoned in April 1792. France had just declared war on Austria, and the mayor of Strasbourg, [[baron]] [[Philippe Friedrich Dietrich|Philippe-Frédéric de Dietrich]], held a dinner for the officers of the garrison, at which he lamented that France had no national anthem.  Rouget de Lisle returned to his quarters and wrote the words in a fit of patriotic excitement. The piece was at first called ''Chant de guerre pour l'armée du Rhin'' ("War Song for the [[Army of the Rhine]]") and only received its name of ''Marseillaise'' from its adoption by the [[Provence|Provençal]] volunteers whom [[Charles Jean Marie Barbaroux|Barbaroux]] introduced into [[Paris]] and who were prominent in the storming of the [[Tuileries Palace]] on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August 1792]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;''The New York Times Current History: The European War'', Volume 16, 1918. [https://books.google.com/books?id=au19AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Claude_Joseph_Rouget_de_Lisle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-nIZVcOEKoOqgwS9voCQAw&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBzhG#v=onepage&amp;q=Claude_Joseph_Rouget_de_Lisle&amp;f=false p. 200].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Rouget de Lisle wrote a few other songs of the same kind as the ''Marseillaise'' and in 1825 he published ''Chants français'' (''French Songs'') in which he set to music fifty songs by various authors. His ''Essais en vers et en prose'' (''Essays in Verse and Prose'', 1797) contains the ''Marseillaise''; a [[prose]] tale ''Adelaide et Monville'' of the sentimental kind; and some occasional [[poem]]s.  He returned to public life after the [[July Revolution]]; [[Louis Philippe]] awarded him the Legion of Honour.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Death==
Rouget de Lisle died in poverty in [[Choisy-le-Roi]], [[Val de Marne]].&lt;ref name=davies&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p. 718&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were transferred from [[Choisy-le-Roi]] cemetery to the [[Invalides]] on 14 July 1915, during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=davies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=HNS19151026.2.9 The Marsellaise.

'''David de Coninck''' or '''David de Koninck''', also known as '''Rammelaer''' (ca. 1644, [[Antwerp]] – after 1701, probably [[City of Brussels|Brussels]]) was a [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] painter who specialised in [[still life]]s and [[Landscape painting|landscapes]] with animals and hunting scenes.  Recognised as a leading animal painter, de Coninck was able to develop an international career which caused him to work for extended periods in Paris, Rome and Vienna.

==Life==
He was apprenticed to [[Pieter Boel]] in 1659.  Pieter Boel was an accomplished animal painter who had been trained by [[Jan Fyt]], the leading Flemish animal painter of the mid 17th century.&lt;ref name=dor&gt;[https://www.dorotheum.com/en/auctions/current-auctions/kataloge/list-lots-detail/auktion/11131-old-master-paintings/lotID/86/lot/1861446-david-de-coninck.html David de Coninck (Antwerp c. 1645 – after 1701 Brussels), ''A landscape with a buzzard attacking ducks''], at Dorotheum&lt;/ref&gt;  De Coninck became a master in the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in 1663.
[[File:Ajaccio de Coninck fruits fleurs animaux.JPG|thumb|left|''Still life of fruit and flowers with animals'']]

He moved to Paris where he worked with the prominent Flemish animal painter [[Nicasius Bernaerts]] for several years, probably until 1669.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;  Nicasius Bernaerts was an influential Flemish animal painter who worked for the royal court and was a member of the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=con&gt;[http://www.connaissancesdeversailles.org/t2746-nicasius-bernaerts-peintre-de-la-menagerie-de-versailles Nicasius (ou Nicaise) Bernaerts] (Anvers 1620 - Paris 1678) {{link language|fr|French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Coninck subsequently travelled to [[Rome]] where he lived from 1671 to 1694.  Here he became a member of the [[Bentvueghels]], an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome, and took the nickname (the so-called 'bent name') 'Rammelaer' (which means 'rattle').  His name was inscribed in a niche in the [[Santa Costanza]] church in Rome where the Bentvueghels used to congregate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadrianus.it/people/david-de-coninck David de Coninck] at Hadrianus&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to the north he stayed for a time in [[Vienna]]. He returned to Antwerp in 1687. He moved to Brussels at some time between 1699 and 1701.  The last record of de Coninck is his registration as a became a member of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1701.  It is not known when or when he died.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/17943 David de Coninck] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:David de Coninck - River Scene with Ducks and Geese Being Attacked by Hawks.jpg|thumb|''River Scene with Ducks and Geese Being Attacked by Hawks'']]
De Coninck painted still lifes, including fruit still lifes and hunting still lifes, landscapes with hunting scenes and architectural paintings.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;  De Coninck's stylistic development is unclear and it is difficult to date his paintings with any precision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/david-de-coninck-dead-birds-and-game-with-gun-dogs-and-a-little-owl Dead Birds and Game with Gun Dogs and a Little Owl], probably about 1672-94, David de Coninck at the [[National Gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that early in his career he painted fruit still lifes, since there is a record that in 1668 two fruit still lifes made by a 'Koninck' were exported to Vienna.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

De Coninck's teacher Pieter Boel was a pupil of Jan Fyt, the leading Flemish animal painter of the mid 17th century. This explains the influence of Jan Fyt's style on de Coninck's work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Koninck,_David_de David de Koninck in Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon] Band XX, 1998, Seite 518 {{link language|de|German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some works of David de Coninck and Pieter Boel are still attributed to Fyt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T030296 Arnout Balis. "Fyt , Jan."] Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 Apr. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  As David de Coninck rarely signed his works, which are generally of a high quality and similar style they have often been confused with the works of Boel, Fyt and even Frans Snijders, the leading Flemish animal painter of the first half of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=dor/&gt;

His fruit still lifes of fruits and flowers painted on large canvases are complex Baroque compositions, which often include animals in an outdoor setting. Large, Italianate fruit still lifes in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes]] can likely also be attributed to de Coninck.  An example of his fruit still lifes is the ''Still life of fruit and flowers with animals'' ([[Musée Fesch]]), which shows a still life with fruits and flowers near an outdoor fountain and a landscape in the distance.  A monkey, two rabbits and a parrot enliven the painting.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;
[[File:David de Coninck - Poultry and Cat.jpg|thumb|''Poultry and cat'']]

De Coninck was an accomplished painter of scenes with animals, mainly birds, in a garden or against a landscape background. He painted lively action scenes of fighting cats and dogs, packs of dogs attacking game and birds of prey or cats attacking birds or poultry.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erfgoedplus.be/collectie/24062A51 |title=Attacking dogs|website=erfgoedplus.be}} {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Coninck's work influenced other artists in Italy such as [[Baldassare De Caro]], Giovanni Crivelli (named 'il Crivellino'), [[Nicola Malinconico]], [[Franz Werner von Tamm]] and [[Jacob Xavier Vermoelen]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Erysichthon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|r|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|θ|ɒ|n}} Ἐρυσίχθων ὁ Θεσσαλός 'earth-tearer') (also anglicised as Erisichthon), son of [[Triopas]], was a King of [[Thessaly]]. He was sometimes called [[Aethon]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Ziogas, ''Ovid and Hesiod'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Erysichthon once ordered all trees in the sacred grove of [[Demeter]] to be cut down. One huge oak was covered with votive wreaths, a symbol of every prayer Demeter had granted, and so the men refused to cut it down. Erysichthon grabbed an axe and cut it down himself, killing a [[dryad nymph]] in the process. The nymph's dying words were a curse on Erysichthon.

Demeter responded to the nymph's curse and punished him by entreating [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]], the spirit of unrelenting and insatiable hunger, to place herself in his stomach. Food acted like fuel on a fire: The more he ate, the hungrier he got. Erysichthon sold all his possessions to buy food, but was still hungry. At last he sold his own daughter [[Mestra]] into slavery. Mestra was freed from slavery by her former lover [[Poseidon]], who gave her the gift of shape-shifting into any creature at will to escape her bonds.  Erysichthon used her shape-shifting ability to sell her numerous times to make money to feed himself, but no amount of food was enough. Eventually, Erysichthon [[self-cannibalism|ate himself]] in hunger.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]]. ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VIII, 738-878&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to [[Demeter]], 34 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Zakaria is the author of ''From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role'' (Princeton, 1998), ''[[The Future of Freedom]]'' (Norton, 2003), ''[[The Post-American World]]'' (2008), and ''In Defense of a Liberal Education'' (Norton, 2015).

In 2011 an updated and expanded edition of ''The Post-American World'' ("Release 2.0") was published.

Zakaria was a news analyst with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with George Stephanopoulos]]'' (2002–2007) where he was a member of the Sunday morning roundtable. He hosted the weekly TV news show, ''[[Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria]]'' on [[PBS]] (2005–08). His weekly show, ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]]'' (''Global Public Square''), premiered on [[CNN]] in June 2008.&lt;ref name="zcom" /&gt; It airs twice weekly in the United States and four times weekly on CNN International, reaching over 200 million homes.

==Political views==
Zakaria self-identifies as a "[[Centrism|centrist]]",&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-08-09/news/the-interpreter/2|title=The Interpreter|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=9 August 2005|author=Press, Joy}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he has been described variously as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]],&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/22/influential-media-obama-oped-cx_tv_ee_hra_0122liberal_slide_16.html?thisSpeed=15000 In Depth: The 25 Most Influential Liberals In The U.S. Media].

I can't be sure whenever I turn to him where he's going to be coming from or what he's going to say."&lt;ref name=world /&gt; Zakaria wrote in February 2008 that "Conservatism grew powerful in the 1970s and 1980s because it proposed solutions appropriate to the problems of the age", adding that "a new world requires new thinking".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/112770 The End of Conservatism].&lt;/ref&gt; He supported Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign and also for president. In January 2009 ''[[Forbes]]'' referred to Zakaria as one of the 25 most influential liberals in the [[American media]].&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Zakaria has stated that he tries not to be devoted to any type of ideology, saying "I feel that's part of my job... which is not to pick sides but to explain what I think is happening on the ground. I can't say, 'This is my team and I'm going to root for them no matter what they do.'"&lt;ref name=voice/&gt;

As a student at [[Yale University]] in the mid 1980s, Zakaria opposed anti-apartheid divestment and argued that Yale should not divest from its holdings in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBAQuxbXYAAkEus.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Zakaria "may have more intellectual range and insights than any other public thinker in the West," wrote David Shribman in ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shribman |first=David M. |title=Globalization, its discontents, and its upside |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/06/01/globalization_its_discontents_and_its_upside/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=1 June 2008 |access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, former Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' that Zakaria “has a first-class mind and likes to say things that run against conventional wisdom.”&lt;ref name=world /&gt; However, in 2011, the editors of ''[[The New Republic]]'' included him in a list of "over-rated thinkers" and commented, "There's something suspicious about a thinker always so perfectly in tune with the moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Over-Rated Thinkers |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/96141/over-rated-thinkers |work=The New Republic |date=3 November 2011 |access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zakaria's books include ''[[The Future of Freedom]]'' and ''[[The Post-American World]]''. ''The Future of Freedom'' argues that what is defined as democracy in the Western world is actually "[[liberal democracy]]", a combination of [[constitutional liberalism]] and participatory politics. Zakaria points out that protection of liberty and the rule of law actually preceded popular elections by centuries in Western Europe, and that when countries only adopt elections without the protection of liberty, they create "illiberal democracy". ''The Post-American World'', published in 2008 before the financial crisis, argued that the most important trend of modern times is the "rise of the rest," the economic emergence of China, India, Brazil, and other countries.&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/15/AR2008051504202.html|title=The Rise of Non-Americanism|last=Khanna|first=Parag|date=18 May 2008|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006, Zakaria has also criticized what he views as "fear-based" American policies employed not only in combating terrorism, but also in enforcing immigration and drug smuggling laws, and has argued in favor of decriminalization of drugs and citizenship for presently illegal immigrants to the United States of all backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence 2 Ltd., ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720062937/http://www.intelligencesquared.com/events/america-is-to-blame-for-mexicos-drug-war America is to blame for Mexico's drug war]'', 1 December 2009, retrieved 24 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zakaria |first=Fareed |date=3 May 2008 |title=Excerpt: Zakaria’s ‘The Post-American World’ |url=http://www.newsweek.com/excerpt-zakarias-post-american-world-89645 |work=Newsweek |access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cc.com/video-clips/4h35c9/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-fareed-zakaria-pt--1 Interview with Fareed Zakaria, Part 1]'', [[The Daily Show]] with Jon Stewart, 28 March 2006: "We are not going to deport them (illegal immigrants)—no democracy would..."Most of these [illegal immigrants], almost all of them, couldn't do anything...that would break the law. The minute they do that, they would be deported."&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to his views on [[Iran]], [[Leon Wieseltier]] described Zakaria as a "consummate spokesman for the [[shibboleths]] of the [[White House]] and for the smooth new worldliness, the at-the-highest-levels impatience with democracy and human rights as central objectives of our foreign policy, that now characterize advanced liberal thinking about America's role in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wieseltier |first=Leon |date=25 June 2010 |title=The realism of seeking democracy in Iran |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/24/AR2010062404875.html |work=The Washington Post |access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 9/11 attacks, in a ''Newsweek ''cover essay, "Why They Hate Us," Zakaria argued that Islamic extremism was not fundamentally rooted in Islam, nor could it be claimed a reaction to American foreign policy. He located the problem in the political-social-economic stagnation of Arab societies, which then bred an extreme, religious opposition. He portrayed Osama bin Laden as one in a long line of extremists who used religion to justify mass murder. Zakaria argued for an intergenerational effort to create more open and dynamic societies in Arab countries, and thereby helping Islam enter the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2001/10/14/the-politics-of-rage-why-do-they-hate-us.html|title=The Politics of Rage: Why Do They Hate Us?|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|date=2001-10-14|work=Newsweek|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zakaria initially supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=world/&gt; He said at the time, "The place is so dysfunctional ... any stirring of the pot is good. America's involvement in the region is for the good."&lt;ref name=world/&gt; He argued for a United Nations–sanctioned operation with a much larger force—approximately 400,000 troops—than was actually employed by the administration of President [[George W. Bush]]. However, he soon became a critic. In addition to objecting to the war plan, he frequently criticized the way the Bush administration was running the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="newsweeksurge" /&gt; He argued against the disbanding of the army and bureaucracy yet supported the [[de-Baathification]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fareed Zakaria |url=http://www.newsweek.com/giving-peace-real-chance-137835|title=Giving Peace a Real Chance |publisher=Newsweek |date=1 June 2003 |accessdate=10 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to argue that a functioning democracy in Iraq would be a powerful new model for Arab politics but suggested that an honest accounting would have to say that the costs of the invasion had been much higher than the benefits. He opposed the Iraq [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]] in March 2007, writing that it would work militarily but not politically, still leaving Iraq divided among its three communities. Instead he advocated that Washington push hard for a political settlement between the Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, and begin a reduction in forces to only 60,000 troops.&lt;ref name="newsweeksurge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/03/04/the-surge-that-might-work.html|title=The Surge That Might Work|last=Zakaria|first=Fareed|date=3 April 2007|work=Newsweek|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote that the surge "succeeded" militarily but that it did not produce a political compact and that Iraq remains divided along sectarian lines, undermining its unity, democracy, and legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/fareed_zakaria/2008/11/mccains_downfall_republican_fo.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 | work=The Washington Post | title=McCain's Downfall: Republican Foreign Policy | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fareed Zakaria|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/200858 |title=Zakaria: How to End in Iraq |publisher=Newsweek |date=6 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zakaria supported the April 2017 [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|U.S. missile strike]] against a Syrian government–controlled airbase. Zakaria praised [[President Trump]]'s strike and said it was the moment "[he] became president of the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/7/fareed-zakaria-donald-trump-became-president-last-/| work=The Washington Times | title=CNN’s Fareed Zakaria: ‘Donald Trump became president’ last night | accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq===
In his 2006 book ''[[State of Denial]]'', journalist [[Bob Woodward]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described a 29 November 2001, meeting of Middle East analysts, including Zakaria, that was convened at the request of the then Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Paul D. Wolfowitz|Paul Wolfowitz]]. According to a story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on Woodward's book, the Wolfowitz meeting ultimately produced a report for [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] that supported the subsequent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Zakaria, however, later told ''The New York Times'' that he had briefly attended what he thought was "a brainstorming session".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Secret Iraq Meeting Included Journalists|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 October 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/business/media/09zakaria.html?ex=1318046400&amp;en=ab43603ab31201e7&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not told that a report would be prepared for the President, and in fact, the report did not have his name on it. The ''Times'' issued a correction.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: "An article in Business Day on Oct. 9 about journalists who attended a secret meeting in November 2001 called by Paul D. Wolfowitz, then the deputy secretary of defense, referred incorrectly to the participation of Fareed Zakaria, the editor of ''Newsweek International'' and a ''Newsweek'' columnist. Mr. Zakaria was not told that the meeting would produce a report for the Bush administration, nor did his name appear on the report."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate on the Park51 Islamic Center===
In 2010, in protest at the [[Anti-Defamation League]]'s opposition to the building of the [[Park51]] mosque and Islamic cultural center two blocks from the [[World Trade Center site]], Zakaria returned the Hubert H. Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize awarded to him by the ADL in 2005. He declared that the ADL's opposition to the mosque meant that he could not "in good conscience keep [the award] anymore". In support of his decision, he stated that the larger issue in the controversy is freedom of religion in America, even while acknowledging that he is not a religious person. He also wrote that a "moderate, mainstream version of Islam" is essential to winning the war on terror, and that moves like the ADL's make it harder for such a moderate version of Islam to emerge and thrive.&lt;ref name="returnaward1"&gt;{{Cite news

===Plagiarism allegations===
[[File:Fareed Zakaria World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|thumb|Fareed Zakaria in 2013]]
Zakaria was suspended for a week in August 2012 while ''Time'' and CNN investigated an allegation of plagiarism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amira|first=Dan|title=Fareed Zakaria sure looks like he stole from The New Yorker|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/fareed-zakaria-plagiarism-time-new-yorker.html|newspaper=New York|date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving an August 20 column on gun control with similarities to a ''New Yorker'' article by [[Jill Lepore]].

The controversy was reignited in September 2014, when ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' and ''[[The Week]]'' magazines reported on allegations made in [[pseudonym]]ous blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN Does Not Get to Cherrypick the Rules of Journalism|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/news/cnn-rules-of-journalism|newspaper=Esquire|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Ryan|title=Why does Fareed Zakaria still have a job?|url=https://theweek.com/article/index/268453/why-does-fareed-zakaria-still-have-a-job|newspaper=The Week|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FareedStatement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fareed Zakaria's statement responding to the charges by two anonymous bloggers|url=http://fareedzakaria.com/2014/08/19/fareed-zakarias-statement-responding-to-the-charges-by-two-anonymous-bloggers/|date=19 August 2014|access-date=20 August 2014|publisher=Fareed Zakaria.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Newsweek'' initially added a blanket warning to its archive of articles penned by Zakaria, but after an investigation of his several hundred columns for the magazine, found improper citation in only seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/09/newsweek-adds-plagiarism-warning-to-fareed-zakaria-196287.html|title=Newsweek adds plagiarism warning to Fareed Zakaria articles|publisher=Politico|date=29 September 2014|author=Dylan Byers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/interview-anonymous-media-watchdogs-who-accused-fareed-zakaria-plagiarism-282839|title=An Interview With the Anonymous Media Watchdogs Who Accused Fareed Zakaria of Plagiarism|work=Newsweek|date=7 November 2014|author=Taylor Wofford and Zach Schonfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, after allegations surfaced on Twitter regarding the originality of one of Zakaria's columns for ''Slate'',  the online magazine appended a notice to the article indicating that, "This piece does not meet Slate’s editorial standards, having failed to properly attribute quotations and information...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editor’s note|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/wines_world/1998/02/toward_the_wet_martini.html|newspaper=Slate|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Slate'' Editor-in-Chief [[Jacob Weisberg]], who had, months before, exchanged barbs with one of the aforementioned anonymous bloggers on [[Twitter]] in defense of Zakaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/newsweek-warns-readers-about-fareed-zakaria-s-plagiaris-1640433014 |title=Newsweek Warns Readers About Fareed Zakaria’s Plagiarism |date=29 September 2014 |website=Gawker |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101041101/http://gawker.com/newsweek-warns-readers-about-fareed-zakaria-s-plagiaris-1640433014 |archive-date=1 November 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained his original position that what Zakaria did was not plagiarism.&lt;ref name="firestorm"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grove |first=Lloyd |date=12 November 2014 |title=Can Fareed Zakaria Survive A Plagiarism Firestorm? |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/can-fareed-zakaria-survive-a-plagiarism-firestorm |website=The Daily Beast |access-date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrections to selected Zakaria columns were also issued by ''The Washington Post'', which had responded to the initial allegations by telling the ''[[Poynter Institute|Poynter]]'' media industry news site that it would investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6 of Zakaria’s Washington Post pieces have originality issues, critics say|url=http://www.poynter.org/mediawire/top-stories/280651/6-of-zakarias-washington-post-pieces-have-originality-issues-critics-say/|newspaper=Poynter.org|date=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111044137/http://www.poynter.org/mediawire/top-stories/280651/6-of-zakarias-washington-post-pieces-have-originality-issues-critics-say/|archivedate=11 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on the same day, November 10, the ''Post'' said that it had found "problematic" sourcing in five Zakaria columns, "and will likely note the lack of attribution in archived editions of the articles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Post finds problematic sourcing in some Zakaria columns|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/post-finds-problematic-sourcing-in-some-zakaria-columns/2014/11/10/32086280-692a-11e4-9fb4-a622dae742a2_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, editors at ''The Washington Post'' and ''Newsweek ''denied that Zakaria's errors constituted plagiarism.&lt;ref name="firestorm" /&gt;

==Personal life==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Flower Backhouse''' (died 17 July 1700) was an 18th-century English noblewoman, notable as [[First Lady of the Bedchamber]] to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. She was Countess of Clarendon from 1670 until her death.

[[File:The house at Swallowfield Park (geograph 4365319).jpg|thumb|Swallowfield Park House]]
She was the daughter of the philosopher [[William Backhouse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB |first=Thompson |last=Cooper |wstitle=Backhouse, William |volume=2 |pages=320&amp;ndash;321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berkshire History: Biographies: William Backhouse (1593-1662) |url= http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/wbackhouse.html |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |year=2002 |accessdate=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, the former Ann Richards. (Other sources say she was the daughter of Sir John Backhouse by his wife, the former Flower Henshaw.)&lt;ref&gt; George Edward Cokayne, editor, The Complete Baronetage, 5 volumes (no date (c. 1900); reprint, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 1983), volume III, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was married three times, her first marriage being to William Bishop of [[South Warnborough]], sometime prior to 1662. Following Bishop's death, she married secondly her father's cousin, [[Backhouse baronets|Sir William Backhouse, Bart.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Backhouse, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[St Andrew Holborn (church)|St Andrew Holborn]] on 23 November 1662; Backhouse died in 1669. From her second husband she inherited nine shares in the [[New River Company]].&lt;ref name="Bio Brit"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographia Britannica: Or, The Lives of the Most Eminent Persons ... |year=1757 |volume=4 |publisher=W. Innys |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4lDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA2267 2267]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She married her third husband, [[Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon|Henry Hyde, Lord Cornbury]], on 19 October 1670,&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Hammond, editor, The Complete Peerage or a History of the House of Lords and All its Members From the Earliest Times, Volume XIV: Addenda &amp; Corrigenda (Stroud, Gloucestershire, U.K.: Sutton Publishing, 1998), page 185. &lt;/ref&gt; as his second wife. This gained Clarendon the manor and house of [[Swallowfield Park]], [[Berkshire]]. Hyde became Earl of Clarendon in 1676.&lt;ref name="Bio Brit"/&gt;

Clarendon was brother to Queen Anne's mother [[Anne Hyde]] and sometime after her third marriage Backhouse became Anne's [[First Lady of the Bedchamber]]. However, Backhouse was hated by Anne's best friend [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]], who called her "the madwoman" and may have brought about Anne's later dislike of Backhouse.

The '''Four Lords of the Warring States''' were four powerful aristocrats of the late [[Warring States period]] of [[History of China|Chinese history]] who exerted a strong influence on the politics of their respective states in the third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://san.beck.org/EC13-Chou.html#9 Period of the Warring States]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king was a mere figurehead, and [[Seven Warring States|seven states]] led by aristocratic families competed for real power. Although they were not themselves monarchs, four aristocrats stood out because of their tremendous military power and wealth: [[Lord Mengchang]] (d. 279{{nbsp}}{{sc|BCE}}) of [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Lord Pingyuan]] (d. 251{{nbsp}}{{sc|BCE}}) of [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Lord Xinling]] (d. 243{{nbsp}}{{sc|BCE}}) of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] and [[Lord Chunshen]] (d. 238{{nbsp}}{{sc|BCE}}) of [[Chu (state)|Chu]].{{sfn|Lewis|1999|p=639 ("these men dominated the governments of their states, accumulated large fortunes, assembled armies of personal followers, and rivaled the monarch's authority")}}

All four were renowned for their activity in the politics of their era as well as being the persona of their state respectively at the time; they also wielded influence via the cultivation and housing of many talented house-guests, who often included learned men and tacticians. As such, they came to be the most prominent patrons of the ''shi'' ({{lang|zh-hans|士}}) or scholar-knights, stimulating the intellectual life of the time. Their prestige became the inspiration for [[Lü Buwei]] when he created [[Lüshi Chunqiu|his academic analogue]] in [[Qin (state)|Qin]].

== References in the Records of the Grand Historian ==

These four lords are paralleled in some books of ''the [[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', the first of the [[Twenty-Four Histories]] of China.

In ''the Biographies of Lord Pingyuan and Yu Qing,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/shiji/ping-yuan-jun-yu-qing-lie-zhuan Biographies of Lord Pingyuan and Yu Qing] 是時齊有孟嘗，魏有信陵，楚有春申，故爭相傾以待士。&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At this time, [in addition to Lord Pingyuan in Zhao,] in Qi lived Mengchang, in Wei Xinling, and in Chu Chunshen. They competed to invite ''shi'' (talents).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''the Biography of Lord Chunshen,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/shiji/chun-shen-jun-lie-zhuan Biography of Lord Chunshen] 春申君既相楚，是時齊有孟嘗君，趙有平原君，魏有信陵君，方爭下士，招致賓客，以相傾奪，輔國持權。&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lord Chunshen now stood as the prime minister of the Kingdom of Chu. At this time, in Qi lived Lord Mengchang, in Zhao Lord Pingyuan, and in Wei Lord Xinling. They competed to humble themselves before ''shi'' (talents) [to hire them], invited brilliant guests, and tried to defeat each other. They sustained their states and held the real power.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Lord Mengchang ==
{{main|Lord Mengchang}}

[[Lord Mengchang]] was an aristocrat of the [[State of Qi]]. He was born Tian Wen, son of Tian Ying and the grandson of King Wei of Qi. He succeeded his father's fief in [[Xue]].

== Lord Pingyuan ==
{{main|Lord Pingyuan}}

Born Zhao Sheng, he was a son of [[King Wuling of Zhao]], brother of [[King Huiwen of Zhao|King Huiwen]] and uncle to [[King Xiaocheng of Zhao|King Xiaocheng]]. During his life, he was thrice appointed the Prime Minister of the [[State of Zhao]].

Zhao Sheng's fief was the City of Dongwu. Lord Pingyuan was his title, and some of his famous retainers included the philosophers [[Xun Kuang]] and [[Gongsun Long]], the [[Yin and Yang]] master [[Zou Yan]], and the diplomat [[Mao Sui]].

== Lord Xinling ==
{{main|Lord Xinling}}

Born as Wei Wuji, he was the son of King Zhao of the [[State of Wei]] and younger half-brother to [[King Anxi of Wei]]. In 277{{nbsp}}{{sc|BCE}}, King Anxi assigned Wei Wuji the fief of Xinling.

At the height of his career, he was the supreme commander of the armed forces of the [[State of Wei|Kingdom of Wei]]. After stepping down, Lord Xinling became dispirited and died in 243{{nbsp}}{{sc|BCE}}.

== Lord Chunshen ==
{{main|Lord Chunshen}}

Born Huang Xie, he was originally a government official working for [[King Qingxiang of Chu]], and later followed Crown Prince Wan when he spent ten years as a hostage in the [[State of Qin|Kingdom of Qin]].

After the death of King Qingxiang, Prince Wan and Huang Xie returned to the [[State of Chu|Kingdom of Chu]]. Prince Wan was enthroned as [[King Kaolie of Chu]], while Huang Xie was appointed Prime Minister and received the title of Lord Chunshen. For the next 25 years, Lord Chunshen remained Prime Minister of Chu, until his assassination by Li Yuan in 238{{nbsp}}{{sc|BCE}}.

'''Hermenegildus Felix Victor Maria "Herman" Finkers''' [ɦɛrmeːnə'ɣɪɫdəs 'feːlɪks 'vɪktɔr ma'riaː "'ɦɛrmɑn" 'fɪŋkərs] (born December 9, 1954 in [[Almelo]], [[Overijssel]]) is a Dutch [[comedian]], who is well known in the Netherlands for his friendly, dry-witted humour and his ambiguous style of storytelling. In his way of telling a story the moral should never be in the way of a good joke or pun. His humour is never at the expense of others, except his brother [[Wilfried Finkers]], who is frequently the target of jokes. Wilfried Finkers co-wrote material and occasionally appeared in his brother's shows. Herman Finkers temporarily stopped performing in 2000, and soon afterwards he was diagnosed with [[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia|a form of leukaemia]]. He was given an estimate of 10 to 15 years of life left. On August 5, 2006 a [[Fuchsia]] was named after him. In 2007 he started playing in theatres again, with a new show called "Na de Pauze" (After the Break). On 31 December 2015 he gave the traditional New Year's Eve performance ("Oudejaarsconference") on Dutch television, in which he remarked that the chance that he would become 90 years old was statistically larger than the chance that he died three years ago.

Finkers is a [[Catholic]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Tweants==
Finkers has a strong love for the [[Tweants dialect]]. He has translated a number of his shows into Tweants [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]], which is his mother tongue. He also wrote and directed two short animation films, which were completely in Tweants: ''Kroamschudd'n in [[Mariaparochie]]'' (''[[Baby shower]] in Mary's Parish'', which tells the story of the birth of [[Christ]] in a setting of [[Twente]]) and his comic interpretation of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[Macbeth]]'', the former of which is shown annually around [[Christmas]] on regional television. After his retirement from theatre, Finkers played a role in the first [[Soap opera|soap series]] in Tweants: "Van Jonge Leu en Oale Groond" (Of Young People and Old Ground).
For his efforts to promote the Tweants [[dialect]] he received the [[Johanna van Buuren]] prize.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">'''Hugh Feeney''' (born 1951) was a [[volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteer]] of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] who, together with [[Dolours Price]] and [[Marian Price]], organised the [[car bomb]]ings of the [[Old Bailey]] and [[Scotland Yard]] on March 8, 1973. He and ten members of his 11-man [[Active Service Unit|active service unit]] (ASU) were apprehended attempting to board a flight to Ireland shortly after the bombs were discovered.

==Arrest, conviction, and imprisonment==
Feeney was convicted on 14 November 1973&lt;ref name="BBCreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/14/newsid_4724000/4724181.stm|title=IRA gang convicted of London bombings|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|work=On This Day|date=14 November 1973|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for each of the four bombing charges against him, which were to run concurrently. 

The other members of his group were sentenced to life imprisonment as well as an additional twenty years.  Feeney and other members of the group were incarcerated in [[Brixton Prison]], and participated in a 205-day [[hunger strike]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=5 March 1995|last=O'Malley|first=Michael|title=Sinn Féin Builds Image as Force for Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of being transferred closer to their homes in [[Ulster]].&lt;ref name=8june74&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=8 June 1974|page=7|title=Irish Call Off Fast in British Jails}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeney and the other hunger strikers were force-fed by British authorities for 167 days&lt;ref name=10jun74&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Irish Times|date=10 June 2010|last=Joyce|first=Joe|title=Hostages teach IRA kidnappers all about racing}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Irish Times]]|date=16 May 2011|last=Moriarty|first=Gerry|title=Old Bailey bomber charged over dissident threats to police}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 1974, Feeney was one of a group of four prisoners whose transfer out of Brixton was demanded anonymously in exchange for the return of $19.2 million in stolen art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=New York Times|date=4 May 1974|title=Irish Prisoners' Transfer Demanded for Stolen Art|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 1974, the IRA kidnapped [[John Hely-Hutchinson, 7th Earl of Donoughmore]] and his wife in an unsuccessful attempt to exchange them for the release of Feeney, the Prices, and [[Gerry Kelly]].&lt;ref name=10jun74/&gt; The prisoners ended their hunger strike on 7 June 1974.&lt;ref name=8june74/&gt; Feeney was transferred to [[Long Kesh]] prison soon after the hunger strike ended.&lt;ref name="Moloney2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moloney|first=Ed|title=Voices from the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTWepzmb8H4C&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=27 September 2011|date=1 June 2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-932-8|page=199ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period he and [[Brendan Hughes]] wrote IRA [[communiqué]]s and articles for ''[[Republican News]]'' under the pen name "Brownie", although most material published under this pseudonym was written by [[Gerry Adams]].&lt;ref name="Moloney2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moloney|first=Ed|authorlink=Ed Moloney|title=A Secret History of the IRA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PNAtCeYpgYC&amp;pg=PA170|accessdate=27 September 2011|date=November 2003|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-32502-7|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Adams's release, Feeney began writing under the pseudonym "Salon".&lt;ref name="Moloney2010"/&gt;

==Release and later deportation==
Feeney was released from custody in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Times]]|date=2 August 1991|title=Three in IRA bomb raids lose jail plea - 1973 car bombing campaign|last=Tendler|first=Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 1991, he was arrested in [[New York City]] and [[Deportation|deported]] the next day for having illegally entered the [[United States]].  

Feeney was arrested in the offices of ''The Irish People'', an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] newspaper published by [[Martin Galvin]] in New York City. The arrest was controversial because it involved a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agent posing as a journalism student in order to gain access to the paper's editorial offices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]|date=31 August 1991|title=Pseudo journalist|last=Wolper|first=Allan|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE%7CA11258924&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=whit75390&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w}}{{registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a violation of FBI policy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Editor &amp; Publisher|date=21 September 1991|title=FBI criticized for posing as journalism student: Catholic college, archdiocese are upset|last=Wolper|first=Allan|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE%7CA11350245&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=whit75390&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w}}{{registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Klasnić''' ({{IPA-sh|ˈiʋan ˈklasnitɕ|hr}}; born 29 January 1980) is a Croatian retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]].

He began his career with local side [[FC St. Pauli|St. Pauli]], and moved to [[Werder Bremen]] in 2001 after helping his previous team to promotion to the Bundesliga. He scored 49 league goals in 151 appearances with Werder Bremen, winning a league and cup double in 2004. After a season in France with [[FC Nantes|Nantes]], he moved to English [[Premier League]] team [[Bolton Wanderers]] in 2009, initially on loan. After their relegation in 2012, he spent a season back in Germany with Mainz.

Klasnić played also for the [[Croatia national football team|Croatian national football team]]. In 2007, Klasnić underwent a kidney transplant, and became the first player to participate in a major tournament ([[UEFA Euro 2008]]) after a transplant. He also represented Croatia at [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==

===St. Pauli===
Born in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]], Klasnić started his professional career with local side [[FC St. Pauli|St. Pauli]], and impressed as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] in the three-and-a-half seasons that he played for the club in the [[2. Bundesliga]] since becoming a professional in January 1998. Prior to his spell at St. Pauli, he played for less known amateur sides Union 03 Hamburg and TSV Stellingen.

===Werder Bremen===
[[File:Ivan Klasnic 5dec2006.jpg|200px|thumb|left|upright|Klasnić with Werder Bremen in December 2006.]]
After helping St. Pauli to gain promotion to the first division with 10 goals scored for the club in the second division during the 2000–01 season, he made the switch to [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the summer of 2001 and finally made his mark in the first team in 2003 with some powerful performances in the [[Bundesliga]]. His first two seasons at the club had been marked by erratic form (he scored only three goals in 36 Bundesliga appearances) and two serious knee injuries, but he laid old ghosts to rest as he emerged a key figure in Werder Bremen's march to the Bundesliga title in the 2003–04 season, when he also won the [[DFB-Pokal]] with the club. He scored 13 goals and made another 11 for his [[Brazil]]ian strike partner [[Aílton Gonçalves da Silva|Ailton]]. His expiring contract caused a scramble for his signature at the beginning of the year before he eventually decided to stay at Bremen.

Participating in the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League]] season, Klasnić scored five goals in the two group matches against [[Belgium|Belgian]] side [[RSC Anderlecht]], including a [[hat-trick]] in the 5–1 home victory for Werder Bremen, helping the team to advance to the first knock-out stage of the competition before losing to strong French side [[Olympique Lyonnais]], who crushed them 10–2 on aggregate.

His start in the 2006–07 season was not very successful either and he had to make seven Bundesliga appearances before finally scoring his first league goal of the season in Werder Bremen's quite disappointing 1–1 draw against underdogs [[Energie Cottbus]] at home. However, Klasnić suffered a kidney failure in early 2007 (''see [[#Illness and kidney transplant|Illness and kidney transplant]]'') and was out for more than ten months. In April 2008 he claimed that Werder's club physicians could have already detected the illness in 2002 and thus sued them in Landgericht Bremen. He also stated that he would not prolong his expiring contract with Werder since it would mean to be treated by the same medical personnel who had not detected his illness in time.

On 14 May 2008, Werder Bremen confirmed that Klasnić was leaving the club.

===Nantes===
On 8 July 2008, Klasnić moved to [[FC Nantes]] where he was loaned, then he signed a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stimme.de/sport/ueberregional/sportwelt/fussball/international/Fussball-Klasnic-Klasnic-will-nach-Abstieg-wieder-in-die-Bundesliga;art432,1546080 | title = Klasnic will nach Abstieg wieder in die Bundesliga | language = German | work=stimme.de | date=4 June 2009 | accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one very difficult season with just six goals in 28 games for him, Nantes was relegated in French [[Ligue 2]]. The next season, he scored four goals in just five games.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Klasnić signed for Bolton Wanderers on transfer deadline day of the 2009–10 season on a year-long loan deal, becoming [[Gary Megson]]'s last signing for the club.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Ivan is a player who we have been tracking for quite a while. His goalscoring record is very good and he has an excellent pedigree at international level with Croatia and domestically in Europe." – Gary Megson.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On 12 September 2009, Klasnić made his debut for Bolton in their 3–2 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] after coming on as a substitute for [[Sam Ricketts]]. One of his first contributions was to be involved in the move which led to the winning goal by [[Gary Cahill]]. His first goal for the club came in the 3–2 win against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 25 October. He finished the season with eight [[Premier League]] goals.

On 4 August 2010, Klasnić signed permanently for Bolton on a two-year contract following his loan spell with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2110323,00.html| title = Klas Act Returns to the Reebok| publisher = Bolton Wanderers| accessdate = 4 August 2010| date = 4 August 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100805062744/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2110323,00.html| archivedate = 5 August 2010| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored the first goal of his second spell in the 1–0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 24 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/8936599.stm| title = Southampton 0–1 Bolton | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | accessdate = 25 August 2010| date = 24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first Premier league goal after signing permanently was the winner in the 2–1 home win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], although he was also sent off in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1321101/Bolton-2-Stoke-1-Klasnic-target-sent-Coyles-claim-home-win.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Myles | last=Hodgson | title=Bolton 2 Stoke 1: Klasnic on target and sent off as Coyle's side claim first home win | date = 17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klasnić scored a late winner against Aston Villa on 5 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9410923.stm | work=BBC News | title = Bolton 3–2 Aston Villa | date = 5 March 2011 | accessdate = 4 March 2012 | first = Paul | last = Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, Klasnić scored a late goal after coming on as a substitute against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] to make the score 1–1, only for Sunderland to grab a winner in stoppage time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9475021.stm | work=BBC News | first=Ian | last=Hughes | title=Bolton 1–2 Sunderland | date=7 May 2011 | accessdate = 4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klasnić did not start a single Premier League game the whole season, but still managed seven goals in all competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/9073031.Klasnic_after_a_fresh_start/ | title = Klasnic after a fresh start | first = Liam | last = Chronnell | date = 9 June 2011 | accessdate = 4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klasnić began the 2011–12 season with a place in the starting line up, and a goal, as Bolton beat [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] 4–0 on the opening day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3750821/QPR-0-Bolton-4.html | location=London | work = The Sun | first = Paul | last = Jiggins | title = QPR 0 Bolton 4 | date = 15 August 2011 | accessdate = 4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with another goal the following week in a 3–2 defeat to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14520274.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bolton 2–3 Man City | date = 21 August 2011 | first = Alistair | last = Magowan | accessdate = 4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a late consolation in a 3–1 away loss to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. At this point of the season he was the Premier League's leading goalscorer. He was sent off in a 2–1 loss against Norwich for a headbutt on [[Marc Tierney]] on 18 September 2011, forcing him to fall out of the team. His first start after his red card was in a 5–0 win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 6 November in which he scored two goals and gave assists for two others. He then scored a penalty in the following game against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] but Bolton lost 2–1. His next goal, his seventh of the season, came a few weeks later at home to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], but Bolton again lost 2–1. After losing his place in the team to fellow forward [[David Ngog]], he came back as a late substitute at home to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 10 March, where he scored the winner in the 86th minute as Bolton won the match 2–1. After Bolton's relegation from the [[Premier League]], on 16 May, Klasnić confirmed on his official website that he had left the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ivanklasnic.com/news.php?objId=24&amp;lang=en&amp;action=showSingle&amp;id=48 | work=ivanklasnic.com | title=Stoke – Bolton | date=16 May 2012 | accessdate=16 May 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221023/http://www.ivanklasnic.com/news.php?objId=24&amp;lang=en&amp;action=showSingle&amp;id=48 | archivedate=3 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainz 05===
In September 2012, Klasnić joined German side [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]] as a free player and signed a one-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/446255/nogomet-njemacka/ivan-klasnic-se-vratio-u-bundesligu-i-potpisao-za-mainz/ |title=Ivan Klasnić se vratio u Bundesligu i potpisao za Mainz |last=Korać |first=Branimir |date=4 September 2012 |work=Sportnet.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Klasnić turned down an invitation from [[Rudi Völler]] to play for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and chose to play for [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] instead as he had already won three caps and scored one goal for their [[Croatia national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] in the spring of 2001. He also played five times and scored one goal for the Croatian under-19 team in 1998 and 1999. By a quirk of fate, his international debut came against Germany in February 2004 in a friendly match where the Germans claimed a 2–1 victory.

===Euro 2004===
He was selected to play for Croatia in the [[UEFA Euro 2004]]. However, he was left on the substitutes bench throughout the tournament. Croatia did not advance past the group stage and the media often attributed that to the lack of inclusion of Klasnić, among other things.

===2006 World Cup===

====Qualifying====
In the Croatian national team, however, his performances during 2004–05 were rather modest as he only netted one goal in eight qualifying matches for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], being on target in the team's opening qualifier against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in September 2004, which they easily won 3–0. In February 2005, he gave a good performance for the national team in a friendly match against [[Israel national football team|Israel]], scoring twice in a 3–3 draw. On the first day of March 2006, he was on target for Croatia once again as he netted their first goal in a 3–2 win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in another friendly match.

====Tournament====
In May 2006, he was expectedly named to the Croatian 23-man squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals in Germany and displayed really good shape throughout the month as he first scored four goals in three Bundesliga matches for Werder Bremen, ending the 2005–06 Bundesliga season with a total of 15 goals scored, and then netted a brace for the national team in a World Cup preparation friendly against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] on 23 May, where they easily won 4–1. However, as the World Cup approached his good shape started to fade and he did not manage to score any further goals in the remaining three preparation matches as well as in all three group matches at the tournament, where Croatia exited the competition in the first round with two draws and a defeat.

===Euro 2008===

====Qualifying====
In the 2006–07 season, he lost his place in Croatia's starting XI after giving two modest performances in the opening two qualifying matches for the [[UEFA Euro 2008]], where he nevertheless managed to score one goal in the 7–0 crushing of minnows [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]]. In the following two matches, against [[England national football team|England]] and [[Israel national football team|Israel]], he was left an unused substitute.

====Tournament====
At Euro 2008, Klasnić was an unused substitute in Croatia's [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group B|Group B]] opening two games; however he started the final group match on 16 June vs. [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and scored a goal in 53rd minute thus, sending his side with a perfect group stage score into the next round. In the quarter-finals match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], Klasnić was again on the bench but was given the chance to play at the start of the first extra time in substitution of teammate [[Ivica Olić]]. In the 118th (with just two minutes to play plus injury time), Klasnić headed an elevated pass provided by [[Luka Modrić]] and scored a crucial goal for Croatia. However, Croatia was to be eliminated from the tournament as [[Semih Şentürk]] equalised with a goal just two minutes later and Turkey won the subsequent penalty shoot-out. Ivan was remembered for his efforts which saw him become the only player to ever participate at a major tournament after a kidney transplant, also scoring two goals during his campaign.

==Illness and kidney transplant==
In January 2007, it was reported that Klasnić suffered kidney failure. On 25 January 2007, he received a kidney [[Organ transplant|transplant]] from his mother Šima, but soon it was reported that his body rejected the new organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=501725.html | publisher = UEFA.com | title = Klasnic awaits second transplant | date = 29 January 2007 | accessdate =10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2007, he underwent surgery to replace the rejected kidney, this time receiving a kidney from his father. The second transplant was a success, and Klasnić stated that his doctors told him that he "would be able to continue playing football."

However, in August 2007, the doctors at [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] forbade him to train due to inability of his body to withstand heavy physical strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/21/ivan-klasnic-bolton-wanderers-kidney-transplant|title=Ivan Klasnic reveals the fear of undergoing two kidney transplants|date=21 November 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, doctors finally allowed Ivan Klasnić to attend full training after he was absent for about six months. He then joined the team and made a couple of appearances in the club's cup activities and also appeared in a few matches for the second team.

Finally, on 24 November 2007, he was selected to start for Werder for the first time since December 2006, and played 65 minutes for his team in a Bundesliga match against [[FC Energie Cottbus|Energie Cottbus]]. Klasnić completed his comeback on 15 December 2007, scoring twice in Bremen's 5–2 victory over [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], playing 85 minutes.

In March 2008, Klasnić  was recalled to the [[Croatia national football team|national team]] after a year of absence. He became the first player ever to participate at a major tournament after a kidney transplant when he played at [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] and scored against both Poland in the group stage and against Turkey in the quarter-finals.

In September 2016, Klasnić's transplanted kidney failed and he was deemed critically ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/wanderers/14775418.Ex_Wanderers_striker_critically_ill_after_kidney_failure/ | title = Ex-Bolton Wanderers striker Ivan Klasnic critically ill after kidney failure | website = The Bolton News | date = 30 September 2016 | access-date = 30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ex-bolton-wanderers-striker-ivan-8948290?ICID=FB_mirror_main | title = Ex-Bolton Wanderers striker Ivan Klasnic critically ill after transplanted kidney fails | website = Daily Mirror | date = 30 September 2016 | access-date = 30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a third transplant in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41680461 | title = Ivan Klasnic: Ex-Bolton Wanderers striker has third kidney transplant operation | website = BBC News | date = 19 October 2017 | access-date = 26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John R.''' "'''Jack'''" '''Horner''' (born June 15, 1946) is an American [[paleontology|paleontologist]] most famous for discovering and naming ''[[Maiasaura]]'', providing the first clear evidence that some [[dinosaur]]s cared for their young. In addition to his paleontological discoveries, Horner served as the technical advisor for all the ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' films,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/2718/science-on-screen-interview-with-jack-horner-jurassic-world|title=Sloan Science &amp; Film|website=scienceandfilm.org|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a cameo appearance in ''[[Jurassic World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= June 13, 2015|url= http://screenrant.com/jurassic-world-easter-eggs-trivia-references/|access-date= April 25, 2016|title= 'Jurassic World' Easter Eggs, Trivia &amp; 'Jurassic Park' References|website= Screenrant|first= Andrew |last= Dyce}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a partial inspiration for one of the lead characters of the franchise, Dr. [[Alan Grant (Jurassic Park character)|Alan Grant]].&lt;ref name=factmonster /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= December 2, 2014|url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientist-behind-jurassic-world-breaks-down-trailer-180953505/?no-ist  |access-date= April 25, 2016|title= The Scientist Behind "Jurassic World", Jack Horner, Breaks Down the Movie's Thrilling Trailer

Jack retired from the Museum of the Rockies and is now Regent's Professor of Paleontology Emeritus at Montana State University and teaches as a Presidential Fellow at Chapman University in Orange, California.

==Life and career==
Horner was born and raised in [[Shelby, Montana|Shelby]], [[Montana]]. He was eight years old when he found his first [[dinosaur]] bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Veronique |title=A talk with paleontologist Jack Horner |url=http://vivamost.com/2012/04/a-talk-with-paleontologist-jack-horner/ |publisher=Vivamost.com |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Montana]] for seven years, majoring in [[geology]] and [[zoology]]. He also spent two years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], serving during the [[Vietnam War]] in the [[Special Forces]]. Horner did not complete his bachelor's degree due to severe [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horner |first1=John R. |year=2004 |title=Jack Horner: An Intellectual Autobiography |journal=The Montana Professor |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages= |publisher=Montana State University–Northern |url=http://mtprof.msun.edu/Spr2004/horner.html |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did complete a senior thesis on the fauna of the [[Bear Gulch Limestone]], one of the most famous Mississippian [[lagerstätte]]n (exceptionally preserved fossil sites) in the world, located in Montana. The [[University of Montana-Missoula|University of Montana]] awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Science in 1986. In 1986, he was also awarded the prestigious [[MacArthur Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=horner2&gt;{{cite web |title=125 Montana Newsmakers: Jack Horner |url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers5/horner.html |work=Great Falls Tribune |author=Tribune Staff |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Montana during the mid-1970s, Horner and his research partner Bob Makela discovered a colonial nesting site of a new dinosaur [[genus]] which they named ''[[Maiasaura]]'', or "Good Mother Lizard". The dinosaur bones, originating from a juvenile, were first discovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baby dino bones finally back in state|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/baby-dino-bones-finally-back-in-state/article_b61e74ba-1cb0-50b1-aa78-9ef78dc8be2b.html|work=The Billings Gazette|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Marion Brandvold. Horner then studied the bones, and at first, there was a refusal to return the bones to Brandvold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Missoulian|first1=DARYL GADBOW of the|title=Dino hunter|url=http://missoulian.com/uncategorized/dino-hunter/article_7059011a-1db0-5810-9b7c-6fc73e504bdc.html|work=missoulian.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Writer|first1=SCOTT McMILLION Chronicle Staff|title=Missing bones|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/missing-bones/article_ed0522b7-7f4c-5bae-b414-f77b65d7a2db.html|work=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained the first [[dinosaur egg]]s in the Western hemisphere, the first dinosaur embryos, and settled questions of whether some dinosaurs were sociable, built nests and cared for their young. The discovery established Horner's career. He has named several other species of dinosaur (including ''[[Orodromeus]] makelai,'' in memory of his late friend Bob Makela) and has had three named after himself: ''[[Achelousaurus]] horneri'', ''[[Anasazisaurus]] horneri'', and ''[[Daspletosaurus]] horneri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Thomas D.|first2=David J.|last2=Varricchio|first3=Jayc C.|last3=Sedlmayr|first4=Eric M.|last4=Roberts|first5=Jason R.|last5=Moore|year=2017|title=A new tyrannosaur with evidence for anagenesis and crocodile-like facial sensory system |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue= |page= 44942|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44942|accessdate=30 March 2017 |doi=10.1038/srep44942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jack Horner with bird.jpg|thumb|left|Horner with a bird skeleton at an event in the [[Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano]]]]
Within the paleontological community, Horner is best known for his work on dinosaur growth research. He has published numerous articles in collaboration with Berkeley paleontologist [[Kevin Padian]], and French dinosaur histologist [[Armand de Ricqlès]], on the growth of dinosaurs using growth series. This usually involves leg bones in graduated sizes from different individuals ranging in age from embryos to adults. Horner also revitalized the contested theory that ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was an obligate [[scavenger]], rather than a predatory killer. While this theory has been widely discussed by the popular press, it has never been a major research focus for Horner. He claimed that he never published the scavenger hypothesis in the peer reviewed scientific literature, stating that it was mainly a tool for him to teach a popular audience, particularly children, of the dangers of making assumptions in science (such as assuming ''T.&amp;nbsp;rex'' was a hunter) without using evidence.&lt;ref name="skepticsguideinterview"&gt;Novella, S. "Interview with Jack Horner." The Skeptics Guide to the Universe. 14-OCT-2011. Accessed 24-OCT-2011, http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepticsguide/skepticast2009-10-14.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, teams led by Horner discovered five specimens of ''T. rex'' and three more the following summer, including one larger than the specimen nicknamed [[Sue (dinosaur)|"Sue"]]. The new fossil was 10–13 tons in weight and 10% larger than other specimens.&lt;ref name=factmonster&gt;{{cite web |last=Sogard |first=Melissa |title=John R.

Currently, Horner is working on the developmental biology of dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayes |first=Jacqui |title=Large flock of parrot-like dinosaurs uncovered |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/668 |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |newspaper=Cosmos Online |date=September 20, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407155650/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/668 |archivedate=April 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horner has published over 100 professional papers, eight books including ''Dinosaurs Under the Big Sky'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horner |first=John R. |title=Dinosaurs under the Big Sky |year=2001 |publisher=Mountain Press Pub.

He was also a part of a 2005 discovery of soft tissue in a ''T. rex'' fossil. Currently, Horner is the Curator of Paleontology at the [[Museum of the Rockies]], the Regent's Professor of Paleontology, adjunct curator at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], and teaches with the Honors Program at [[Montana State University – Bozeman|Montana State University]] in Bozeman, Montana. Over the years he has advised people who have gone on to be leading experts in paleontology, such as [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]], Greg Erickson, [[Scott Sampson]], [[Kristi Curry-Rogers]], and David J. Varricchio. Horner was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 2006 in recognition of his work.

In 2003, Horner discovered a fossilized tyrannosaur leg bone from which paleontologist Mary Higby Schweitzer was able to retrieve proteins in 2007.&lt;ref name="wilford"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilfor |first=John Noble |title=Scientists Retrieve Proteins From Dinosaur Bone |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/science/12cnd-dino.html |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] released a documentary entitled "Dinosaurs Decoded", which reviews Horner's research into juvenile dinosaurs. He suggests that juvenile dinosaurs looked sufficiently different from adults, and that they have sometimes been mistaken for separate species. The program examines specific changes that occurred as dinosaurs aged and speculates on why the changes were necessary. Horner's research on the topic has gone as far as eliminating several "sub-species" of ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', and ''Tyrannosaurus''. Horner also believes that if his research were to continue as much as a third of known dinosaurs would be classified under an existing species.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Dan. ''Dinosaurs Decoded''. National Geographic. 11 Oct. 2009. Television.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2013, Horner was awarded the Romer-Simpson Prize, the highest honor a paleontologist can receive from the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montana.edu/news/12241/horner-wins-lifetime-achievement-award-from-society-of-vertebrate-paleontology&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 he was awarded the Blue &amp; Gold Award from Montana State University.

On his retirement from Montana State University on July 1, 2016, the MacMillan Foundation honored Horner for his work with a $3 million endowment for the John R. Horner Curator of Paleontology Chair for the Museum of the Rockies/ Montana State University - funding the work of his Paleontology successors in perpetuity.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Such research may ultimately lead to new treatments for people suffering from spinal disorders. Research into the [[mesenchyme]] tissue of chicken embryos, which direct the growth of teeth, may also aid in the treatment of human [[Sarcoma|sarcomas]]. [[George Lucas]] had funded most of the project's costs up to that point, while an additional $5 million was needed.

[[File:James Albert.jpg|right|thumb|250px|James Albery]]'''James Albery''' (4 May 1838 &amp;ndash; 15 August 1889) was an English [[dramatist]].

==Life and career==
Albery was born in London. On leaving school Albery entered an architect's office, and started to write plays. His [[farce]] ''A Pretty Piece of Chiselling'' was given its first production by the Ingoldsby Club in 1864. After some failures, his adaptation, ''Dr Davy'', was produced at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] (1866). His most successful piece, ''Two Roses'', a comedy, was produced at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in 1870, in which [[Sir Henry Irving]] made one of his earliest London successes as Digby Grant.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The production ran for 300 performances.

Albery was the author of a large number of other plays and adaptations, including ''Coquettes'' (1870); ''Pickwick'', a four-act drama (based on [[Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1871); ''Pink Dominos'' (1877), a [[farce]] that ran for an extremely successful 555 performances and was one of a series of adaptations from the French which he made for the [[Criterion Theatre]], where his wife, the actress Mary Moore (who after his death became Lady [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] (1861—1931)), played the leading parts; ''Jingle'' (a farcical version of ''Pickwick''), produced at the Lyceum in 1878;&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Albery, James|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Oriana'' (with music by [[Frederic Clay]]).

His one-act [[operetta]], ''[[The Spectre Knight]]'', with music by [[Alfred Cellier]], ran as a companion piece to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' and then ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]] in 1878 and on tour.  He also wrote the farce ''Brighton'' (1888) among other later plays. Albery also wrote a book called ''Where's the Cat?'' in 1880.

Albery's and Moore's son was [[Bronson Albery]] (1881-1971), a theatre director, after whom the Albery Theatre is named.  He wrote this epitaph for himself:  "He slept beneath the moon/He basked beneath the sun;/He lived a life of going-to-do,/And died with nothing done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Osmania Veterinarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LpYAAAAYAAJ|year=1954|publisher=Osmania University|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jenaro Pérez de Villaamil y d'Huguet''' (3 February 1807 &amp;ndash; 5 June 1854) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] painter in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style who specialized in landscapes with figures and architectural scenes. He often inflated the scale of the buildings relative to the figures to make them more impressive.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Ferrol, Galicia]]. In 1812, he was enrolled at the military academy in [[Santiago de Compostela]], where he assisted his father, who was a professor there.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.arteespana.com/genaroperezvillaamil.htm Briuef biography and works] @ Arte España.&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Madrid in 1820 to study at the "Reales Estudios de San Isidro" (now part of the [[Colegio Imperial de Madrid]]). Three years later, he went to [[Cádiz]] to enlist in the army fighting the "[[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis]]" sent by the [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Duke of Angoulême]]. He was wounded and briefly held as a prisoner of war.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/perez-villaamil-y-duguet-jenaro/ Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he remained there to study at the "Escuela de Bellas Artes".

In 1830, he went to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], with his brother Juan (died 1863), who was also a painter, where they decorated the [[Teatro Tapia]] and remained there for a few more years, working as [[scenographer]]s.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.mcnbiografias.com/app-bio/do/show?key=perez-villaamil-jenaro Biography] @ MCN Biografías.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Spain in 1833, he made the acquaintance of the Scottish painter [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]],&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; who had a decisive influence on his style. He settled in Madrid in 1834 and became a member of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] the following year. In 1840, he was named honorary [[court painter]] to Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. During the regime of [[Baldomero Espartero]], from 1840 to 1844, he left his wife and young child and lived in self-imposed exile in France and Belgium, using artistic affairs as an excuse for his absence.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; After travelling through Europe, he returned in 1845 and obtained the chair of landscape painting at the Academia, where he later became the director.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

He returned to Galicia for an extended stay in 1849 and made extensive travels throughout Spain until 1852, when he began to suffer from liver disease.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He died in Madrid two years later, aged only forty-seven.

'''John Godolphin Bennett''' (8 June 1897 – 13 December 1974) was a British mathematician, scientist, technologist, industrial research director, and author. He is best known for his books on psychology and spirituality, particularly on the teachings of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]. Bennett met Gurdjieff in [[Istanbul]] in October 1920 and later helped to co-ordinate [[The Fourth Way|the work of Gurdjieff]] in England after the guru had moved to Paris. He also was active in starting the British section of the [[Subud]] movement, and co-founded its British headquarters.

Bennett was born in London, England; educated at [[King's College School]], London; [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]], [[Woolwich]]; [[School of Military Engineering, Chatham]]; and the [[School of Oriental Studies]], London.

He was a Fellow of the Institute of Fuel, London, from 1938 onwards; Chairman, Conference of Research Associations, 1943–1945; Chairman, Solid Fuel Industry, [[British Standards Institution]], 1937–1942; Chairman and Director, Institute for the comparative study of History, Philosophy, and the Sciences, [[Kingston upon Thames]], 1946–1959.

==Early life, World War I, marriage==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Bennett's parents met in [[Florence, Italy]]; they later married. His mother was American and his father was British. In Bennett's infancy, his family were moderately wealthy and traveled frequently in Europe. In 1912, his father, who was a noted traveller, adventurer and [[linguist]], lost all of his money and his wife's in an investment that failed. Bennett later displayed an extraordinary talent for languages, which enabled him to talk with many spiritual teachers in their native tongues. He studied Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic and Christian sacred texts in their original languages. 

Bennett makes little reference to his childhood in his autobiography, ''Witness''. Elsewhere he credits his mother with instilling in him the virtues of hard work and tolerance.

At school, he excelled in sports and captained the school [[Rugby union|rugby]] football team. He won a scholarship in mathematics from [[Oxford University]], but never had the chance to take advantage of this because of the outbreak of the Great War. He continued to play rugby football for the army (against such opponents as the New Zealand national team), breaking his arm once and his collar bone twice.

In the [[First World War]], at the age of nineteen, Bennett served as a subaltern in the Royal Engineers, with responsibility for signals and telegraphy.

In France in March 1918, he was blown off his motorcycle by an exploding shell. Taken to a military hospital, operated upon, and apparently in a coma for six days, Bennett had an [[out-of-body experience]]. He became convinced that there is something in man which can exist independently of the body.
:"It was perfectly clear to me that being dead is quite unlike being very ill or very weak or helpless. So far as I was concerned, there was no fear at all. And yet I have never been a brave man and was certainly still afraid of heavy gun fire. I was cognizant of my complete indifference toward my own body."&lt;ref name="Autobiography"&gt;{{cite book|title=Witness: The Story of a Search (Autobiography)|edition=1974: [[Omen Press]], Tucson, Arizona; First U.S.|year=1962|publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]|isbn=0-912358-48-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This experience set his life on a new course. He described the return to normal consciousness as the return to a body that was now in some sense a stranger.

In the closing months of the [[First World War]], Bennett undertook an intensive course in the Turkish language at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], London, and was posted to [[Constantinople]]. He was assigned to a sensitive position in Anglo-Turkish relations, at the time of the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and rise in Turkish nationalism. His fluency made him the confidant of many high-ranking Turkish political figures; it also helped him to develop his knowledge of Turkey and to gain insights into non-European ways of thinking. A notable piece of initiative drew the attention of General [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]], and a mention in C-in-C's dispatches.&lt;!-- What is this? --&gt; Bennett was recruited to be the head of Military Intelligence "B" Division, with responsibility for the entire Middle Eastern region.

:"All day long I was dealing with different races: English, French, Italian, Greek, Armenian, Turkish, Kurdish, Russian, Arab, Jews and people so mixed up as to be no race at all. Each and every one was convinced of the superiority of his own people. How could everyone be right and all the rest wrong? It was nonsense."{{Verify source|date=April 2013}}

Bennett's eighteen months' tenure in this position were so eventful, that he is still regarded as a major figure in the political life of Turkey in that period. Bennett's success resulted in some animosities among his superiors and he was recalled to London in January 1921. He resigned his commission with the rank of Captain and a pension for life. He kept an abiding love for Turkey for the rest of his life.

After the war, Bennett had married Evelyn, with whom he had a daughter, Ann, born August 1920. Evelyn had stayed in England when he was posted to Turkey. Bennett's immersion in Turkish affairs and his relationship with Winifred Beaumont, an English woman living in Turkey, placed increasing strain on the marriage. In 1924, Evelyn Bennett sued for divorce. Bennett later married Beaumont, who was twenty years his senior; they were together until her death in 1958. (He married a third time in 1958, to Elizabeth Mayall.)

==Gurdjieff and Ouspensky==
After the First World War and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], many displaced people passed through Constantinople en route to the West. Part of Bennett's job was to monitor their movements. Among them were [[G.I. Gurdjieff]] and [[P. D. Ouspensky|P.D. Ouspensky]], whom Bennett met through [[Prince Sabahaddin]].  This reformist thinker had introduced him to a wide range of religious and occultist systems, including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Anthroposophy]]. Bennett became determined to pursue the search for a deeper reality. He had been profoundly impressed with Gurdjieff's ideas about the arrangement of the human organism and the possibility of a man's transformation to a higher state of being, and would later dedicate much of his life to the elaboration and dissemination of those ideas.

Gurdjieff and Ouspensky moved on to Europe, and Bennett remained in Turkey, committed to his work and fascinated by the political and social developments in Turkey. The sultanate fell and on October 29, 1923, the Turkish republic was proclaimed. Bennett approved permission for [[M. Kemal Atatürk]] to enter [[Samsun]], where he started the Turkish Independence struggle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Permission_for_Ataturk.jpg Certificate Photo]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurdjieff founded his [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]] at the Château Le Prieuré in Fontainebleau-Avon, south of [[Paris]], in October 1922. Bennett visited in the summer of 1923, spending three months at the institute. This experience further convinced him that Gurdjieff had profound knowledge and understanding of techniques by which man can achieve transformation. Gurdjieff encouraged Bennett to stay longer, but Bennett was short of money and so felt obliged to return to work in England. Though Bennett expected to return to the group soon, he would not meet Gurdjieff again until 1948.

Bennett served the British government as a consultant on the Middle East, and interpreter at the 1924 conference in London intended to settle disputes between Greece and Turkey. He was invited to stand for parliament, but he chose instead to give his personal studies precedence over his public life.

He joined Ouspensky's groups, and continued to study Gurdjieff's system with them for fifteen years. Ouspensky broke off all contact with Gurdjieff himself in the early 1920s.

==Coal industry==
During this time, Bennett became involved with various coal mining ventures in Greece and Turkey. These were ultimately unsuccessful, but in the process he acquired expertise in mining and coal chemistry. He worked for four years in Greece, where he was also involved in protracted negotiations involving land claims by members of the deposed Turkish royal family.

In 1938, Bennett was asked to head Britain's newest industrial research organisation, the [http://www.bcura.org/index.html British Coal Utilisation Research Association] ([[BCURA]]). With the outbreak of [[Second World War|World War II]], BCURA's research was focused on developing fuel-efficient fireplaces and finding alternatives to oil. BCURA developed cars powered by coal-gas and a coal-based plastic.

==Group work==

In 1941, Ouspensky left England to live in the United States. By now, Bennett was running his own study groups and giving talks on the subject of [[Fourth Way|Gurdjieff's system]]. The groups continued and expanded in London throughout the Second World War. Bennett began writing and developing his own ideas in addition to Gurdjieff's. Ouspensky repudiated him in 1945, which proved very painful for Bennett. He had lost touch with Gurdjieff during the war, and believed him to be dead.

:"Ouspensky fell under the impression that Bennett was setting himself up as a teacher and plagiarising his lecture material. Instructions were sent to all members of Ouspensky's groups to disassociate themselves from Bennett, who found himself vilified and ostracised, but still supported by a small loyal following. He decided to go ahead with his work of communicating his understanding of the System to people, and to create a society or institute to serve as its vehicle".&lt;ref name=DUVERSITY&gt;[http://www.duversity.org/institute_2.htm HISTORY OF THE INSTITUTE FOR THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCIENCES, LTD.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coombe Springs==

In 1946, Bennett and his wife founded the non-profit Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences:

:"To promote research and other scientific work in connection with the factors which influence development and retrogression in man and their operation in individuals and communities; to investigate the origin and elaboration of scientific hypotheses and secular and religious philosophies and their bearing on general theories of Man and his place in the universe; and to study comparative methodology in history, philosophy and natural science".&lt;ref name=DUVERSITY /&gt;

The Institute bought Coombe Springs, a seven-acre estate in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Surrey]], which had housed research laboratories used by BCURA. The Bennetts moved in with ten of Bennett's closest pupils, with the intention of starting a small research community. Coombe Springs became a centre for group work. In addition to the small community who lived there permanently, hundreds of people visited Coombe Springs for meetings and summer schools.

The old laboratories were used as dormitory space; they were known as the "fishbowl" because of the large amount of glass they had. A "new building" was later built for superior accommodation. The main house was used for meetings as well as accommodation. Coombe Springs took its name from an original Elizabethan spring house in the grounds. Until the mid-19th century, it had provided water to the palace at [[Hampton Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrp.org.uk/history/default.asp?sectID=4&amp;id=4 Hampton Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403105955/http://www.hrp.org.uk/history/default.asp?sectID=4&amp;id=4 |date=2015-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett believed that Gurdjieff's system could be reconciled with modern science. He started work on a five-dimensional geometry which included "eternity" as a second time-like dimension, introducing this in his first published book, ''The Crisis in Human Affairs'' (1948).

==Reunion with Gurdjieff==
Ouspensky died in 1947. In 1948, Bennett went to the United States and met Ouspensky's wife, through whom he learned that Gurdjieff had survived the Nazi occupation of France and was living in Paris. Though it was 25 years since they had last met (due mainly to Ouspensky's longstanding veto against Gurdjieff to members of his groups), Bennett quickly decided to renew contact. In the 18 months before Gurdjieff's death (in October 1949), Bennett visited him frequently. He also continued his crowded professional schedule (he was now working for the [[Powell Duffryn]] coal company) and his responsibilities towards the group work at Coombe Springs.

A month spent working very intensively with Gurdjieff's group in the summer of 1949 laid the foundation for a significant transformation in his life and spiritual work. At that time, Gurdjieff's apartment in Paris had become a '[[Mecca]]' to the followers of his ideas, who converged from many different countries. Bennett learnt of Gurdjieff's writings, and read ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]]'' for the first time. At the beginning of 1949, Gurdjieff named Bennett as his 'Representative for England'. Bennett later gave public lectures in London on Gurdjieff and his ideas.

This period was described by Bennett's third wife, Elizabeth Bennett (1918-1991), who was part of the study group, in her book ''Idiots in Paris: Diaries of J.G. Bennett and Elizabeth Bennett, 1949''. Her memoir was based on J.G. Bennett's diaries and on her own memories. A third paperback edition was published posthumously in 2017.

Gurdjieff's death in 1949 was a serious blow for all his followers. Disagreements arose within the group, partly as a result of Gurdjieff's having allocated his closest associates with conflicting areas of authority. In Bennett's case, the conflict was exacerbated by his own interpretation and development of Gurdieff's ideas.

After Gurdjieff's death, the various groups looked to [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] to give them direction and hold them together, but there was little inherent harmony among them. At this time Bennett was a member of a small group headed by Madame de Salzmann, and he put his work at Coombe Springs under her overall guidance. 

In 1950, Bennett was falsely accused of harbouring communists on his staff, during a communist scare in Great Britain, and he was forced to resign from Powell Dufryn. (He later resisted several attractive offers to return to a career in industrial research and administration). He began to concentrate more fully on the group work at Coombe Springs. He lectured frequently, trying to fulfill a promise he had made to Gurdjieff to do everything in his power to propagate his ideas. Friendly relations continued with Madame de Salzmann and her groups throughout 1951 and 1952, but by then Bennett was convinced that his more senior students were not making progress. He believed that he had to learn firsthand whether there still existed an ancient tradition or source from which Gurdjieff had derived his teaching.

==Travels in the Middle East==

In 1953, Bennett undertook a long journey to the Middle East (West Asia), visiting Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Persia. His search, chronicled in his book ''Journeys in Islamic Countries'' (reprinted in paperback in 2001), brought him into contact with [[Sufi]]s of extraordinary spiritual accomplishment, such as [[Mohammad Amin Sheikho|Emin Chikou]] (1890-1964) (known in Syria as Mohammad Amin Sheikho) and Farhâd Dede&lt;ref&gt;Other forms of his name are: (1) Ferhâd Dede (2) Ferhât Dede.&lt;/ref&gt; (1882-1977), the former of whom led Bennett indirectly to a profound meeting with Shaykh [[Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani]]&lt;ref&gt;Shaykh Abdullah al-Fa'izi ad-Daghestani Alayhi Rahma (December 14, 1891 - September 30, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; (1891-1973). Bennett described him as "a true saint in whom one feels an immediate complete trust. With him there were no lengthy arguments or quotations from the scriptures."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Their chance meeting on a mountaintop in Damascus is chronicled, albeit briefly, in his book ''Subud.'' Bennett concludes that Shaykh Daghestani was in possession of "powers of a kind that I had already seen in Gurdjieff and one or two others, and prepared me to take very seriously anything that he might [have to] say."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

During 1954, differences of opinion became more obvious between Bennett and Madame de Salzmann regarding the promulgation of Gurdjieff's teachings. Bennett decided that an effectual working relationship with her groups was not possible. He wanted to execute Gurdjieff's last directives literally, by disseminating his ideas and writings as widely as possible, especially ''Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson'', which Madame de Salzmann wanted to keep away from the public eye.

In 1955, Bennett initiated a project to build an unusual nine-sided meeting hall at Coombe Springs for the performance of Gurdjieff's sacred dance movements. This, together with his public lectures in London, completed the rift with Madame de Salzmann. The project took two years to complete. At the opening in 1957, Bennett commented that the real value of such a project was in building a community rather than the building itself.

==Subud==

In 1956, Bennett was introduced to [[Subud]], a spiritual movement originating in [[Java]] (an island in the [[Republic of Indonesia]]). For a number of reasons, Bennett felt that Gurdjieff had expected the arrival of a very important teaching from Indonesia. In spite of deep reservations, in November 1956 Bennett allowed himself to be 'opened' by Husein Rofé, a native Englishman &lt;ref&gt;Husein Rofé (May 3, 1922 - February 2008) - His name originally was Peter Rofé. He was born in [[Manchester, England]], and he died in Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; (1922-2008) who had studied in the East.  Rofé used the [[latihan]] (the primary spiritual exercise used in Subud).

Bennett regarded the latihan as being akin to what the mystics call diffuse contemplation. He also felt that the latihan has the power to awaken a person's conscience, the spiritual faculty that Gurdjieff regarded as necessary for salvation. Bennett sent an invitation to Subud's founder, [[Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo]] (1901-1987) (aka [[Pak Subuh]]), to come to England. Pak Subuh came to Coombe Springs, where all Bennett's pupils were given the opportunity to be 'opened'. 

It was a highly controversial event. It included the apparently miraculous cure of film star [[Eva Bartok]], but also the violent death of one of Bennett's pupils. The death of Bennett's pupil is described on pages 345–347 of the original edition of Bennett's auto-biography titled ''Witness: The Story of a Search'' (1962). The section on the death was excised from later editions of the autobiography, along with some fifty additional pages.&lt;!-- If an editor knows what happened, it should be included. Was this reported in media? --&gt; Although Bennett admits writing this section from a subjective and self-serving perspective, the incident still showed the dangers of Subud and of putting one's trust blindly in any spiritual teacher or spiritual path.

Soon Bennett was instrumental in spreading Subud practice all over the world. He travelled extensively to spread the Subud exercise, sometimes in the company of Pak Subuh. Bennett translated Pak Subuh's lectures into various languages. His introductory book on Subud, titled ''Concerning Subud'' (1959), sold thousands of copies worldwide.

Bennett's deep involvement in Subud meant less participation in the work-group activities and exercises that had been practised until he began this work. The meeting hall was left unfinished without its intended viewers' balcony and its striking pentagonal floor was filled in to allow for latihans. Its original purpose was not to be fulfilled for many years.

Some of Bennett's pupils were dismayed. Subud's spontaneous exercise seemed to some to be the antithesis of Gurdjieff's methods for spiritual awakening, and Bennett's enthusiasm for it served to deepen the divisions within the Gurdjieff groups. Many people left the Coombe Springs groups, but others came in large numbers. For several years Coombe Springs was the headquarters of the Subud movement in Europe, attracting both serious seekers and sensation seekers.

In 1958, monks from the [[Benedictine Abbey of St. Wandrille]],&lt;ref&gt;Abbey of St. Wandrille (aka Fontenelle Abbey) - This is a Benedictine monastery located in the ''commune'' of Saint-Wandrille-Rançon, near Caudebec-en-Caux, in Seine-Maritime, Normandy, France.&lt;/ref&gt;  interested in Subud, contacted Bennett. The following year he made the first of many visits to the abbey to teach the monks. These visits brought him into close contact with the Catholic Church. Dom Albert-Jacques Bescond, OSB (1920-1986) was the first monk from the abbey to be 'opened', followed by many others. At St. Wandrille, Bennett first had a deep experience of what he believed was the destined unification of Islam and Christianity. He had given this possibility philosophical expression through his concept of 'essential will', as detailed in his ''The Dramatic Universe'' (4 vols). Soon after, he formally entered the Catholic Church.

By 1960, Bennett had concluded that the practice of 'latihan' alone was inadequate, and he resumed the work that he had learned from Gurdjieff. By 1962, Bennett left the Subud organization, feeling that a return to the Gurdjieff method was necessary.

Although he always said that he had derived great benefit from Subud, his departure aroused animosity and dismay from Subud members, and many turned against him.

Meanwhile, the Institute had been largely given over to Subud to the extent, at one time, of instigating a move to forbid the sale of Gurdjieff's books at Coombe Springs. In spite of this, Bennett reinstated lecture courses on psychokinetics, an action that led to increasing conflict among the membership.

A battle of power ensued in 1962 that resulted in Subud acquiring its own organization and Bennett resigning from the Subud brotherhood and his role as leader of the Coombe Springs Community and Director of Research of the Institute.

From 1963, the pattern of exercises that were subsequently followed at Coombe Springs combined the latihan with different techniques such as the Gurdjieff movements. The meeting hall was completed with the fitting of a balcony for viewers and an external access through stairs for spectators. Lectures were held on topics ranging from Sufism to Synchronicity, and Bennett resumed work on the final volumes of his "personal whim", the epic 'The Dramatic Universe', which he had been working on for more than ten years, constantly writing, revising and re-writing.

==Shivapuri Baba==
Meanwhile, Bennett had made contact with the [[Shivapuri Baba]], a Hindu sage living in Nepal. He had first heard of the Shivapuri Baba in the early 1940s, and now learned from Hugh Ripman (a fellow student of Ouspensky) that the yogi was still alive.&lt;ref name=DUVERSITY /&gt;

Bennett visited the Shivapuri Baba twice between 1961 and 1963, by which time the Shivapuri Baba was reportedly 137 years old. Bennett was impressed with the vitality and simplicity of the Shivapuri Baba's teaching, and later referred to him as his teacher. Bennett undertook to propagate the Shivapuri Baba's teaching, and made various attempts to incorporate it into his own work.

The Shivapuri Baba died in 1963, shortly after he had approved the draft for his biography, Bennett's ''Long Pilgrimage - The Life and Teaching of the Shivapuri Baba''.

==ISERG==
In 1962, Bennett gave a seminar on spiritual psychology in which the various elements he had received (particularly from Gurdjieff, Subud and the Shivapuri Baba) were integrated into a coherent psycho-cosmology. This marked a major step in his understanding of a comprehensive methodology which combined both active and receptive "lines of work".

By this time Bennett was also working with a group of young scientists called ISERG (Integral Science Research Group) headed by Dr. Anthony Hodgson and soon joined by [[A. G. E. Blake|Anthony George Edward Blake]], Kenneth Pledge, [[Henri Bortoft]] and others. This group investigated educational methods, the nature of science, and similar subjects. The group maintained a contact with physicist and philosopher [[David Bohm]].

Research fellowships were created to enable Hodgson and Blake to concentrate their time on educational work. Out of this came the idea of [[structural communication]] which led the Institute into co-operative work with [[G.E.C.]] in the field of teaching machines.

In 1963, Bennett launched the institute's journal, ''Systematics''. The journal was designed to spread the ideas of the discipline of [[Systematics - study of multi-term systems|Systematics]], a practical analytical method based on his own researches into the laws governing processes in the natural world. The journal ran for 11 years with major contributions from all disciplines.

==Idries Shah==
While the educational work was progressing, Bennett learned of [[Idries Shah]], an exponent of [[Sufism]]. When they met, Shah presented Bennett with a document supporting his claim to represent the 'Guardians of the Tradition'. Bennett and other followers of Gurdjieff's ideas were astonished to meet a man claiming to represent what Gurdjieff had called 'The Inner Circle of Humanity', something they had discussed for so long without hope of its concrete manifestation.

Bennett introduced "teaching stories" to his groups on Shah's instructions. These are now widely published and recognized as important teaching materials containing the essence of Sufi knowledge and insight.

It remained unclear as to what the future relationship between the Institute, Bennett and Shah could become. Eventually Bennett decided to put Coombe Springs at Shah's disposal to do with as he saw fit. In October 1965 at an extraordinary General Meeting of the Institute, Bennett persuaded the membership to take this step.

Shah originally indicated that he would take Bennett's psychological groups under his own wing. Bennett welcomed this, as it would allow him to concentrate on research and writing. However, he again found himself unpopular - not only with conservatives within the Institute, but also with other followers of Idries Shah and members of his organisation SUFI (Society for the Understanding of the Foundation of Ideas).

In the spring of 1966, The Institute for Comparative Study donated Coombe Springs to Shah, who promptly sold it for a housing development. The Djamee was destroyed. About half the people who had studied under Bennett were integrated into his groups while the rest were left 'in the air'. The Institute was left with the educational research work as its main focus. The work with the Hirst Research Laboratories of G.E.C. bore fruit in the new teaching machine, the 'Systemaster', and Bennett organised various young people around him to write and develop teaching materials that followed the structural communication method.

Bennett and some of the Coombe Springs residents had moved into a nearby house in Kingston upon Thames, where the family (the Bennetts now had two sons and two young daughters) would live quietly for four years before Bennett embarked on his last great project - an experimental school for passing on techniques for spiritual transformation.

==International Academy for Continuous Education==

By 1969 the company which had been formed to explore structural communication – Structural Communication Systems Ltd. – was floundering and Bennett's health, too, was in a dangerous state. After his recovery, Bennett looked afresh at the situation and the conviction came to him that he should take up the work that Gurdjieff had started at the Prieuré in 1923 and been forced to abandon. He would start a School of the Fourth Way.

Bennett became very interested in young people, especially those who surfaced from the social and cultural turmoil of the 1960s with serious questions about the significance of life but with few satisfactory answers. As part of his research, Bennett attended the rock music festival on the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1970. The outcome was the establishment of an "academy" to teach some of what he had learned in trying to discover the "sense and aim of life, and of human life in particular."

{{anchor|Sherborne_House}}
On the twenty fifth anniversary of the Institute, in April 1971, a jubilee celebration on the theme of The Whole Man was held. In a very short time, primarily in the USA, Bennett recruited many students and in October 1971 the International Academy for Continuous Education was inaugurated in Sherborne, Gloucestershire.

Bennett had begun this enterprise with no programme in mind and with only a handful of helpers. Initially, his ideas had involved running a school in the midst of 'life-conditions' in Kingston with two dozen students, but contact with a young representative of the New Age Movement in the USA persuaded him to think in terms of larger numbers and a relatively isolated locale in the countryside. Bennett realized that work on the land (which he considered to be an essential part of teaching the proper relationship between mankind and the rest of creation) would require a larger number. Both Hasan Shushud and Idries Shah made recommendations that, for the most part, he disregarded.

He quickly attracted one hundred pupils, and in 1971, with the support of the Institute for Comparative Study, he inaugurated the International Academy for Continuous Education, in the village of Sherborne, [[Gloucestershire]], England.

The name was chosen "to indicate on the one hand its Platonic inspiration and on the other to emphasise that it was to offer a teaching for the whole life of the men and women who came to it."

As he tells the story in his autobiography, although various spiritual leaders had urged him at various points in his life to strike out on his own path, it was not until near the end of his years that he felt fully confident to assume the mantle of the teacher. Bennett relates how Gurdjieff had told him in 1923 that one day Bennett would "follow in his footsteps and take up the work he had started at Fontainebleau." In 1970, following the promptings of a still, small voice from within that said, "You are to found a school",

Bennett proposed that there should be five experimental courses each of ten months duration. The courses proved fruitful, and many people have continued, as he had hoped, to work with the ideas and methods he presented.

In April 1972, the Sufi Hasan Lutfi Shushud (1901-1988)&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Lütfi Şuşud (Hasan Lutfi Shushud) (June 8, 1901 - January 1, 1988). His year of birth is given in many sources as 1902, which is incorrect. Also, his middle name Lütfi (Lutfi) is misspelled "Lufti" in many sources. See: (1) http://www.readingrumi.com/hasan-shushud (2) https://www.odakitap.com/hasan-lutfi-susud&lt;/ref&gt; came to stay for a few months at the Academy. Shushud and Bennett had met in Turkey ten years previously, and Shushud had visited Bennett's Surrey home in 1968, at which time he initiated Bennett into his wordless, universal zikr. Bennett concluded that Shushud's wordless universal zikr produced results similar to those of the latihan, while omitting many of the risks attendant on 'opening' people through Subud. Bennett observed that occasionally there are people 'opened' through Subud who experience some harsh and/or dangerous effects (for which they are unprepared) during the operation of the latihan. This observation led him to have reservations about the supposed absolute safety of the latihan for the general public. As a result of these reservations, Bennett became increasingly attracted to the [[Khwajagan]]  (Masters of Wisdom of Central Asia) as presented in the teachings of Shushud. In 1973 Bennett’s publisher Alick Bartholomew commissioned Bennett and Shushud to co-write a book whose tentative title was ''Gurdjieff and the Masters of Wisdom''. Before the book was ready for publication Shushud pulled out of the project, telling Bennett that he did not trust the publisher, apparently on the grounds that Bartholomew had deducted state income tax from the advance payment for the book. However, eventually it became known that what Shushud was really objecting to was Bennett's contention in the book that Gurdjieff had established personal contact with the Khwajagan, and that therefore it is very likely that at least some of Gurdjieff's major teachings are based directly on what he had learned from the Khwajagan. Due to Shushud's disagreements with Bennett over this issue, Bennett ended up dividing the proposed book into two separate books, titled respectively ''Gurdjieff: Making a New World'' (1973) and ''The Masters of Wisdom'' (1975) (not published until after Bennett's death). However, in spite of Shushud's disagreements with Bennett over this issue, it appears that Bennett nevertheless (in the end) borrowed heavily from Shushud's teachings on the Khwajagan (probably against Shushud's wishes), in order to bring his book on that subject (''The Masters of Wisdom'') to a successful conclusion.

There are a number of mysterious things about Shushud, who certainly had unusual powers. Bennett makes a brief reference to these in his book ''Witness'', and many others have attested to them. While criticising Bennett's methods, Shushud impressed on him that "Your only home is the Absolute Void". However, Shushud eventually agreed that what Bennett was doing for young Western seekers was more suitable for them than his own strict methods of fasting and zikr.

In the same year (1973), Bennett began editing Gurdjieff's Third Series of writings, ''Life is Real Only Then When I Am'', undertaking its publication on behalf of the Gurdjieff family (who were having difficulties in dealing with the Gurdjieff Foundation). He also revisited Turkey, meeting with Hajji [[Muzaffer Özak]] al-Jerrahi&lt;ref&gt;His name is also spelled: Hajji (Hadji) Muzaffer Özak Ashki al-Jerrahi (1916 - February 12, 1985). Some sources give his year of death as 1986, which is incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; (1916-1985), the Grand Shaykh of the Halveti-Jerrahi Sufi Order.

During the period of the second course at the Academy, a Theravada Buddhist monk and teacher from Cambodia named [[Bhante Dharmawara]]&lt;ref&gt;Bhante Dharmawara (February 12, 1889 - June 26, 1999) - Other forms of his name are: (1) Bellong Mahathera (2) Mahathera Vira Dharmawara (3) Samdach Vira Dharmawara Bellong Mahathera.&lt;/ref&gt; (1889-1999) came to Sherborne at Bennett's invitation. During his visit Dharmawara introduced meditation techniques that continue to be practised by many people.

Other visitors to the Academy were Süleyman Dede&lt;ref&gt;Süleyman (Suleiman) Dede (1904 - January 19, 1985) - A more complete form of his name is Süleyman Hayati Loras Dede.&lt;/ref&gt; (1904-1985), head of the [[Mevlevi]] Order in Konya, as well as Süleyman Dede's disciple [[Reshad Feild]] (1934-2016). Idries Shah paid a brief visit during the first year, but soon left, with harsh views on the attitudes and disposition of the students.

Throughout the period of the Institute's existence, Bennett had been toying with the idea of founding a spiritual community. He saw the [[Sermon on the Mount]] as a document describing the true community.
His contact with Idries Shah combined this in his mind with the possibility of establishing a Power House where 'enabling energies' could be concentrated. He set his sights on some kind of self-sufficient community, populated by Sherborne graduates, to evolve out of the school. He was profoundly influenced by contemporary ideas, such as those of [[Schumacher]], about the need for alternative technology and by the argument of conservationists for intelligent, ecologically sound agriculture. He was also greatly impressed that his spiritual hero and inner teacher, [[Khwaja Ubaidallah Ahrar]] (15th century) had turned to farming after his period of training.

The soaring price of land in the UK led to Bennett's interest in starting something in the USA. In 1974, he signed an agreement whereby the Institute loaned $100,000 to a newly formed society for the foundation of a psychokinetic community. He signed this document shortly before his death on December 13, 1974.

The [[Claymont Society]] was founded to attempt to carry out Bennett's vision, but without the help of his guidance.

In the summer of 1974, he visited the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in Rome to question him about Transcendental Meditation and his interpretation of the [[Bhagavad Gita]]. Bennett had been initiated into TM several years before and first met the Maharishi in 1959. He disputed Maharishi's presentation of the Gita in which he eliminated the need for sacrifice and suffering.

In the last year of his life, he gradually made it known to those working with him, that his own personal task centred on the creation of a way of religious worship that would be accessible to men and women of the West who were lacking in religious formation. During this period he made experiments with the Islamic [[namaz]] and Sufi [[Dhikr#Sufi_view|zikr]].

The teachings he developed in his last years were recorded and published in a series of books put together by Anthony Blake. He showed that at last he was independent of Gurdjieff and had his own understanding of the spiritual world, based on a radical questioning of all current assumptions.

Bennett died on Friday, December 13, 1974, shortly after the start of the fourth course. That course, and the fifth, were completed by his wife, working with a few of his most experienced pupils.

With his death the Institute was faced with the typical problems of a body which had been led almost single-handedly by one man since its inception. The decision was taken to continue the Academy's work until the five-year period, originally specified by Bennett, had been completed. The setting up of the USA community at Claymont Court, West Virginia, went ahead.

In the months before he died, Bennett worked to establish an experimental "ideal human society" embodying the methods and ideas that he had developed and derived from Gurdjieff. He made substantial efforts to overcome the rifts that had grown between different groups of Gurdjieff's followers, and was beginning to talk about the development of new forms of worship appropriate for the modern world.

'''Josephine Clofullia''' (1829–1875) was a famous [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born [[bearded lady]] who toured with [[P. T. Barnum]]'s "[[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]]".

==Early life ==
Madame Clofullia, as she was often billed was born '''Josephine Boisdechêne''' in Switzerland. She was born hairy and reputedly had a two-inch beard at the age of eight. At the age of fourteen she began to tour Europe, first accompanied by her father and an agent and then with her father alone. In Paris she met painter Fortune Clofullia and eventually married him. She also gained extra fame when she fashioned her beard in the imitation of that of [[Napoleon III]]. In return, the ruler gave her a large [[diamond]].

==Personal life ==
Josephine gave birth to two children; the first, a daughter who was born in 1851, died in infancy. Her son Albert, who was born the next year, was as hirsute as his mother had been.

==Sideshow career ==
All four — Clofullia, her husband, son and father — moved to the [[United States]] where they joined forces with [[P. T. Barnum]]. Barnum had her beard officially measured as 6 inches, gave Albert a new name — "Infant [[Esau]]", after the biblical character — and took them to his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]].

==Law suit ==
In July 1853 [[William Charr]] took Clofullia to court, claiming that she was actually a man and an impostor. During the case doctors examined her and verified that she was a female and the case was eventually dismissed. By hearsay it has been suspected that Barnum arranged the whole matter himself as a [[publicity stunt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2908">'''Khalid Habib''' ({{lang-ar| خالد حبيب}})  (died October 16, 2008), born '''Shawqi Marzuq Abd al-Alam Dabbas''',&lt;ref&gt;http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2011/04/27/19/us9ly-010017dp.source.prod_affiliate.91.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was an ascending member of [[al-Qaeda]]'s central structure in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. His nationality was reported as Egyptian (by CBS News) and as Moroccan (by ''The New York Times'').

Habib was the operations commander for the region. He was one of several al-Qaeda members who were more battle-hardened by combat experience in [[Iraq]], [[Chechnya]], and elsewhere. This experience rendered them more capable than their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/02/world/middleeast/02qaeda.html|title=Qaeda Is Seen as Restoring Leadership|last=Mazzetti|first=Mark|date=2007-04-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', this cadre was more radical than the previous generation of al-Qaeda leadership. The [[FBI]] described Habib as "one of the five or six most capable, most experienced terrorists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-al-qaeda-leaders-more-radicalized/|title=New Al Qaeda Leaders More Radicalized|last=McNamara|first=Melissa|date=2007-03-15|website=cbsnews.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Habib relocated from [[Wana (Pakistan)|Wana]] to Taparghai, Pakistan to avoid missile strikes launched from US-operated [[MQ-1 Predator]] aircraft which targeted al Qaeda and Taliban personnel.  Khalid Habib was killed by a Predator strike near Taparghai on October 16, 2008. Habib was reportedly sitting in a Toyota station wagon which was struck by the missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/world/asia/18pstan.html|title=U.S. Strike Is Said to Kill Qaeda Figure in Pakistan|last=Shah|first=Pir Zubair|date=2008-10-17|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 28, militants confirmed to the Asia Times that Habib was killed in the [[Drone attacks on Pakistan by the United States of America|drone attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JJ29Df01.html|title=US, Pakistan mission on target|last=Shahzad|first=Syed Saleem|date=2008-10-29|website=[[Asian Times]]|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIM began rapping in 1990 at the age of 10 with the group ''Mo'vez Lang'', made up of his neighborhood friends Boulox Force (Djibi Diop) and Cens Nino (Houcene Marega).

In 2005, LIM released his debut solo album entitled ''Enfant Du Ghetto'', which featured Mo'vez Lang, Cheb Yahya, Cici and Mala.

On October 22, 2007, LIM released his second solo album entitled ''Délinquant''. In its first week, the album finished as the top selling album in all categories in [[France]] with 12,000 copies sold and would later go on to achieve gold status{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

==Tous Illicites Productions==
Originally signed with the [[45 Scientific]] label, LIM left it after some internal problems and made his own label called ''Tous Illicites Productions''.

==Career==
===Curator and academic===
Dr. Worsley began her career as an historic house curator at [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton Manor]],&lt;ref&gt;SPAB News, Vol. 18., no. 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], in the summer of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucyworsley.com/tag/milton-manor/|title=Milton Manor - Lucy Worsley|publisher=LucyWorsley.com|access-date=13 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514140233/http://www.lucyworsley.com/tag/milton-manor/#|archive-date=14 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 to 2002, she was an Inspector of Historic Buildings for [[English Heritage]] in the East Midlands region. During that time she studied the life of [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle]] and wrote the English Heritage guide to his home, [[Bolsover Castle]].  In 2001 she was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree from the [[University of Sussex]] for a thesis on ''The Architectural Patronage of William Cavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, 1593–1676''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=D.Phil. |chapter= |title=The Architectural Patronage of William Cavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, 1593–1676 |url=http://www.opengrey.eu/item/display/10068/529218 |last=Worsley  |first=Lucy |year=2001 |publisher= |accessdate=1 April 2013 |docket= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was later developed into Worsley's book ''Cavalier: A Tale of Chivalry, Passion and Great Houses''.&lt;ref name=Inde&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Charles|title=Cavalier: a tale of chivalry, passion and great houses, by Lucy Worsley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/cavalier-a-tale-of-chivalry-passion-and-great-houses-by-lucy-worsley-462737.html|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=The Independent on Sunday|date=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2002–2003, she was Major Projects and Research Manager for Glasgow Museums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/589z5my60mYb1L9bMWllzp8/dr-lucy-worsley|title=BBC Four - A Very British Murder with Lucy Worsley - Dr Lucy Worsley|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berksandbucks.greatbritishlife.co.uk/people/lucy_worsley_on_her_passion_for_the_past_1_3238665|title=Lucy Worsley on her passion for the past|work=Berkshire and Buckinghamshire Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming Chief Curator at [[Historic Royal Palaces]], the independent charity responsible for maintaining the [[Tower of London]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], [[Kensington Palace|Kensington Palace State Apartments]], the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in Whitehall and [[Kew Palace]] in [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]].

In 2005 she was elected a senior research fellow at the [[Institute of Historical Research]], [[University of London]]; she was also appointed visiting professor at [[Kingston University]].&lt;ref name=Kingston&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fada.kingston.ac.uk/staff/lucy_worsley/lucy_worsley.php | title=Kingston University – Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television programmes===
In 2011 she presented the four-part television series ''{{Citation/make link|http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/history_of_home.shtml |If Walls Could Talk}}'' exploring the history of British homes, from peasants' cottages to palaces; and the three-part series ''{{Citation/make link|http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0140vb9 |Elegance and Decadence: The Age of the Regency}}''.

In 2012 she co-presented the three-part television series ''Antiques Uncovered'', with antiques and collectibles expert [[Mark Hill (antiques expert)|Mark Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01hbmsp |title=Antiques Uncovered |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (broadcast at the same time) ''Harlots, Housewives and Heroines'', a three-part series on the lives of women after the Civil War and the [[Restoration of Charles II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01j2fcq |title=Harlots, Housewives and Heroines: A 17th Century History for Girls at BBC4.com |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year she presented a documentary on [[Dorothy Hartley]]'s ''Food in England'' as part of the BBC Four "Food and Drink" strand.

Her BBC series ''A Very British Murder'' examined the "morbid national obsession" with murder. The series looked at a number of cases from the 19th century, beginning with the [[Ratcliff Highway murders]] which gained national attention in 1811, the [[Red Barn Murder]] of 1826 and the "Bermondsey Horror" case of Frederick and [[Maria Manning]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Worsley |first=Lucy|title=How murder became a very British obsession: It was our bloodthirsty ancestors who turned us into a nation hooked on killers|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2426693/How-murder-British-obsession-It-bloodthirsty-ancestors-turned-nation-hooked-killers.html|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Pamela|title=A Very British Murder: How we became hooked on morbid mysteries |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/very-british-murder-how-became-2291022|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=The Mirror|date=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the three-part series ''The First Georgians: The German Kings Who Made Britain'' explored the contributions of the German-born kings [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and  [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. The series explained why the Hanoverian George I came to be chosen as a British monarch, how he was succeeded by his very different son George II and why, without either, the current United Kingdom would likely be a very different place. The series emphasises the positive influence of these kings whilst showing the flaws in each. ''A Very British Romance'', a three-part series for BBC Four, was based on the romantic novels to uncover the forces shaping our very British happily ever after and how our feelings have been affected by social, political and cultural ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06h1fys | title=A Very British Romance | publisher=BBC | accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 she presented a three-part series entitled ''British History's Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley'', debunking historical views of the [[Wars of the Roses]], the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the [[British occupation of India]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08bqdzl|title=British History's Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley|accessdate=10 April 2017|work=BBC Four}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a TV presenter, she is known for having a [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]], a minor speech impediment&lt;ref name="telegraph_april2011" /&gt; which affects her pronunciation of ''"r"''. When she made the move from BBC Four to BBC Two for the series ''Fit to Rule: How Royal Illness Changed History'', she worked with a [[Speech-language pathology|speech and language therapist]] to help with her pronunciation, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucyworsley.com/in-which-my-speech-impediment-in-criticised-but-all-ends-happily/|title=In which my speech impediment is criticised, but all ends happily|publisher=LucyWorsley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''László Tőkés''' ({{small|Hungarian pronunciation:}} {{IPAc-hu|ˈ|l|á|sz|l|ó|-|ˈ|t|ő|k|é|s}}; born 1 April 1952) is a Romanian-born [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] pastor and politician. He is a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) for [[Hungary]]. He served as [[Vice President of the European Parliament]] from 2010 to 2012.

A bishop of the [[Királyhágómellék Reformed Church District]] of the [[Reformed Church in Romania]], he is also a former honorary president of the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]]. He is the head of the [[Hungarian National Council of Transylvania]], a civic organisation for Transylvanian Hungarians. Tőkés is closely associated with the [[Hungarian People's Party of Transylvania]].

An effort to transfer him from his post as an assistant pastor in [[Timișoara]] and to evict him from his church flat helped trigger the [[Romanian Revolution]], which overthrew [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] and spelled the end of the [[Communist Romania|communist era]] in Romania.

He is a member of the [[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]],&lt;ref name="REH"&gt;{{cite web|title= About Us – Reconciliation of European Histories Group|url=http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/about/|publisher=[[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]]|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-sponsored the [[European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism]].&lt;ref name="EP-Joint-Motion"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=P6-RC-2009-0165&amp;language=EN |title= Joint motion for a resolution: European Parliament resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism |author= |date= 30 March 2009 |work= |publisher= [[Europa.eu]] |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
A native of [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], László Tőkés is the son of István Tőkés, professor of theology and former deputy bishop of the largely Hungarian Reformed Church. He was married to Edit Joó, with whom he has three children: sons Máté and Márton, and daughter Ilona. [[Máté Tőkés]], who was only three years old during the Revolution of 1989, later collected the memories of the friends, relatives, and other participants of the events, and in 2005 wrote ''Egymás tükrében'' ("In Each Other's Mirror"), a book about his parents and the hardships of the family.

In March 2010, his wife filed for divorce. Edit Tőkés accused the bishop of "numerous affairs" and "absurd habits".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineoclock.ro/index.php?issue=4651&amp;page=detalii&amp;categorie=homenews&amp;id=20100330-12778] {{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of infidelity and mistreatment were confirmed by a former counsellor of the pastor&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/Infidelitatile_pastorului_Laszlo_Tokes_0_416958904.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the divorce sentence was issued in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adevarul.ro/locale/oradea/color800517Divortul-Tokes-Laszlo-Casatoria-Edith_0_432557233.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opiniatimisoarei.ro/pastorul-laszlo-tokes-facut-praf-de-fosta-sotie-edith-intr-o-carte-cand-i-s-a-nascut-fiica-n-a-trecut-pe-la-spital-se-uita-la-tv-la-mineriade/06/11/2012]"Pastorul Laszlo Tokes facut praf de fosta sotie Edith intr-o carte"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissident Pastor==
Like his father, Tőkés was a persistent critic of the totalitarian Ceauşescu regime. While a pastor in the Transylvanian town of [[Dej]], he contributed to the clandestine [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] journal ''Ellenpontok'' ("Counterpoints"; 1981–82). An article there on human rights abuses in Romania appears to have been the occasion of his first harassment by the secret police, the [[Securitate]]. He was reassigned to the village of [[Sânpetru de Câmpie]], but refused to go and instead spent two years living in his parents' house in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]].&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, online, p.49‒50&lt;/ref&gt;

His situation was discussed in the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], which led indirectly to his appointment to be assistant pastor in Timișoara, where he gave sermons that opposed the Romanian national government's program of [[Systematization (Romania)|systematisation]], which proposed radical restructuring of the infrastructure of Romanian towns and villages. Smaller villages were deemed "irrational" and listed for reduction of services or forced removal of the population and physical destruction. This included the destruction of historic churches and monasteries. The programme was seen by Hungarians and human rights activists as a particular threat to Hungarian villages, although Tőkés' sermons did not single this out, calling for solidarity between Hungarians and Romanians.&lt;ref name="Deletant, online, p. 50"&gt;Deletant, online, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of Hungary and West Germany, concerned for their national minorities in Transylvania, protested against systematization.

In the summer of 1988, Tőkés organized opposition to systematisation among Hungarian Reformed Church pastors, again drawing the attention of the Securitate. After the Securitate objected to a cultural festival organized on 31 October 1988 ([[Reformation Day]]), jointly with the amateur Hungarian-language theatre group "Thalia", Bishop László Papp banned all youth activities in the [[Banat of Temeswar|Banat]] (the region Timișoara is part of). Tőkés nonetheless worked together with the bishop of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] on another festival in spring 1989.&lt;ref name="Deletant, online, p. 50"/&gt;

On March 20, 1989, Tőkés gave a secretly taped TV interview to two Canadians - former politician Michel Clair and Radio-Canada journalist Réjean Roy (released as ''[[Dracula's Shadow – The Real Story Behind the Romanian Revolution]]''). The two were helped by a small group from Székesfehérvár in Hungary who smuggled in videotapes and video cameras. The secret mission would have dire consequences. (''Timisoara'' by Árpád Szőczi.)

On 31 March 1989, Papp ordered Tőkés to stop preaching in Timișoara and move to the isolated parish of [[Mineu]]. Tőkés refused the order, and his congregation supported him. 

On July 24, 1989, the Hungarian State TV investigative show ''Panorama'' broadcast the secretly-taped TV interview with Tőkés. Two days later Bishop Papp sent Tőkés a letter, accusing him of slandering the state and saying lies in the interview, and ordered his expulsion.

The bishop began civil proceedings to evict him from his church flat. His power was cut off and his ration book taken away, but his parishioners continued to support and provide for him. The state had some arrested and beaten. At least one, Ernő  Ujvárossy, was found murdered in the woods outside Timișoara on 14 September, and Tőkés's father was briefly arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, online, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interview in July 1989, to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] television, Tőkés complained that the Romanians do not even know their human rights. Tőkés explained the message and effect of this interview in a German TV series on the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 2008:&lt;ref&gt;Der Grenzer am Eisernen Vorhang. Part 4. A film by Sylvia Nagel. LE Vision GmbH. Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDT), 2008. Broadcast by [[YLE]] Teema, 3 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The message of this interview was that we do not have to support the dictatorship and the dictator [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]]. This message of my interview was very much needed in order to demasque Ceauşescu.

It had a shock effect upon the Romanians, [[Securitate]] as well, on the people of Romania. The programme could be seen mostly here along the borders, because at that time it was forbidden to watch foreign TV channels. And those who saw it were very much shocked, and copies of the interview were spread all over Romania, especially in [[Transilvania]], and it had an unexpected effect upon the public atmosphere in Romania.}}
A court ordered Tőkés' eviction on 20 October. He appealed. On 2 November, four attackers armed with knives broke into his flat; Securitate agents looked on while he and his friends fought off the assailants. The Romanian ambassador was summoned to the Hungarian Foreign Ministry and told of the Hungarian government's concern for his safety. His appeal was turned down, and his eviction set for Friday 15 December.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, online, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign broadcasters also began showing the secretly-taped TV interview, such as ABC's ''Nightline'' in the U.S.

==December 1989==
As 15 December approached, Tőkés’ parishioners began something of a vigil outside his flat, refusing two guards’ orders to move along. On 15 December, a human chain was formed around the block; the militia were unable to gain access. Tőkés thanked the crowd but advised them to leave, but several hundred stayed in groups close to the flat. His wife, Edit, who was pregnant at the time, fell ill. On 16 December, the family doctor appeared to see Edit. Within half an hour, the mayor of Timișoara appeared with three more doctors, hoping to persuade Edit to head to a hospital. On the advice of their family doctor, she refused.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, online, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward, workmen arrived to repair the damaged windows and door to the flat; presumably the mayor was hoping to defuse matters, but the crowds actually grew, with some young Romanians joining the Hungarian parishioners. Tőkés spoke with the mayor and again urged the crowd to disperse. The crowd remained; the mayor stormed away, returned at noon, and promised that Tőkés would not be evicted. The crowd remained; some of them accused Tőkés of collaborating with the authorities and demanded a written retraction of Tőkés’ transfer and eviction. The mayor promised to produce this within an hour; if he actually intended to do so, it proved impossible on a Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, online, p. 52‒53&lt;/ref&gt;

After various negotiations with the mayor and the deputy mayor and the involvement of various delegations, the mayor gave an ultimatum for the crowd to disperse by 5&amp;nbsp;pm or face fire-brigade water cannons. Tőkés again pleaded with the crowd to disperse, but, possibly convinced that he was acting under threats from the Securitate, they refused. The crowd beckoned him to leave his apartment and come down to the street. He refused, presumably fearful of being seen as the leader of this resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, online, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

5 pm came and went without water cannons. By 7&amp;nbsp;pm the crowds extended for several blocks and included many students from the local polytechnic and university, Hungarians and Romanians in a human chain, first singing hymns, but about 7:30 launching into the patriotic song [[Deşteaptă-te, române!]] ("Wake up, O, Romanian!"), banned in 1947 at the beginning of the communist dictatorship and sung during the November 1987 protests in [[Braşov]].&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, online, p. 53‒54&lt;/ref&gt;

In Deletant's words, "The Hungarian protest had now become a Romanian revolt." Cries were raised, "Down with Ceauşescu!" "Down with the regime!" and "Down with Communism!" The crowd moved out from around Tőkés' flat and church, crossed a bridge, and headed for the city centre and Communist Party headquarters, where they threw stones before militia drove them back toward the church around 10&amp;nbsp;pm and the water cannons finally came into play. However, the crowd seized the cannons, broke them up, and threw the parts into the river [[Bega River, Romania and Serbia|Bega]]. A general spirit of roving riot ensued.&lt;ref name="Deletant, online, p. 54"&gt;Deletant, online, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstrations continued the next two days. On Sunday, 17 December, the army fired into the crowd. The number of casualties has been a matter of dispute; early reports were undoubtedly exaggerated. The number of deaths was 73 for the period 16–22 December 1989, and another 20 for the period after Ceauşescu fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timisoara.com/newmioc/69.htm |title=Martirii revolutiei timisorene |work=CyberTim Timisoara's Homepage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330200317/http://www.timisoara.com/newmioc/69.htm |archivedate=30 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Elena Ceauşescu]]'s orders, 40 of the dead were transported by truck  to Bucharest and cremated to make identification impossible.&lt;ref name="Deletant, online, p. 54"/&gt;

On 18 December, tens of thousands of industrial workers in Timișoara peacefully took up the protest; by 20 December the city was effectively in insurrection.&lt;ref name="Deletant, online, p. 54"/&gt;

The news of the protests and the violent government crackdown spread quickly across Romania and triggered many more protests. They quickly escalated into the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] that overthrew Ceauşescu and the Communist government.

== Bishop of Oradea ==

After the dispossession of the discredited Communist bishop of Oradea, [[László Papp (clergyman)|László Papp]] in 1989, Tőkés was elected as a bishop of the [[Királyhágómellék Reformed Church District]]. He was re-elected most recently in 2004 for another six-year term. During his tenure, he worked hard for the reorganization of the disintegrated church and the renewal of spiritual life. He emphasized the importance of Hungarian-language education, social responsibility, and missionary work. It was his top priority to win back the properties and schools of the church that had been confiscated by the Communist government, but ownership-restoration in Romania is proved to be an extremely difficult, slow and—so far—unsuccessful process{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}.

In spite of financial difficulties, he established new social and educational institutions instead of the old ones. The [[Christian University of Partium]] in Oradea was one of the bishop's favorite projects as the first Hungarian-language private university in Romania (opened in 1999). His other notable initiatives are the child-care center in Oradea, an orphanage in [[Aleşd]], Bethesda Health-Care Centre in [[Arduzel]], Peter Reformed Elementary School in [[Salonta]], and a nursing home in [[Tinca]]. The Lórántffy Zsuzsanna Ecclesiastical Centre of the Hungarian Reformed Church with a museum, auditorium, and social care centre was inaugurated in 1996.

==Political career==

In 2007 Tőkés decided to run for the [[European Parliament]] as an independent, receiving the backing of Hungary's [[Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [https://archive.is/20120714110115/http://stiri.acasa.ro/stiri/FIDESZ-il-va-sustine-pe-T-kes-pentru-PE_--s63624.html "FIDESZ îl va susţine pe Tökes pentru PE" ("FIDESZ Will Support Tőkés for EP")], acasa.ro, 21 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[European Parliament election, 2007 (Romania)|November election]], he gained enough votes to win a seat. In competition with the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]], the main party of Romania's Hungarians, Tőkés was accused, for instance by a leading politician of that party, [[György Frunda]], of splitting the Hungarian vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://ziua.net/display.php?data=2007-11-26&amp;id=229922 "Maghiarimea divizată" ("Hungarian Community Divided")] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401232301/http://ziua.net/display.php?data=2007-11-26&amp;id=229922 |date=1 April 2008 }}, ''[[Ziua]]'', 26 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Frunda also claimed that Tőkés was helped by President Băsescu and noted that he received 18,000 votes from the historically-named [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] regions of Romania, places where few Hungarians live.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070715104127/http://www.gandul.info/politica/frunda-ii-numara-moldovenii-si-muntenii-lui-t-k-s.html?3928;1080516 "Frunda îi numără moldovenii şi muntenii lui Tökés"], in ''[[Gândul]]'', 10 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An unbowed Tőkés commented on election night, "I knocked out the Greater Romania Party", referring to the fact that while he had won a seat, the far right, anti-Hungarian [[Greater Romania Party]] had lost all five of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tóth-Szenesi | first = Attila | title = Index | publisher = [[Index.hu]] |date=November 2007 | url = http://index.hu/politika/kulfold/tl071125/ | accessdate = 2007-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Saideman and R. William Ayres, ''For Kin or Country: Xenophobia, Nationalism, and War'', p.163. Columbia University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-231-14478-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, in Washington, D.C., he was awarded the [[Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom]] for his role in the struggles against Romanian communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= |url=http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2788569 |title=Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom Ceremony |year=2009 |accessdate=16 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701065349/http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2788569 |archivedate=1 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, he became one of the 14 vice-presidents of the [[European Parliament]]. He was elected by 334 votes in favour and 287 abstentions, replacing [[Pál Schmitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-76039-165-06-25-901-20100614IPR76038-14-06-2010-2010-false/default_en.htm |title=Parliament elects László Tőkés as new Vice-President |author= |date=15 June 2010 |work= |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618153059/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-76039-165-06-25-901-20100614IPR76038-14-06-2010-2010-false/default_en.htm |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a signatory of the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]].&lt;ref name="moresignatures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praguedeclaration.org/vipsig |title=Prague Declaration: Selected signatories |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825012931/http://praguedeclaration.org/vipsig |archivedate=25 August 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 he was the third on the list of [[Fidesz]] for the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Hungary)|European Parliament election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dailynewshungary.com/ep-elections-pelcz-to-head-fidesz-list/ |title= EP elections – Pelcz to head Fidesz list |author= |date= 2014-04-11 |publisher= Dailynews Hungary |accessdate= 2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Klaus Iohannis]] announced in 2016 that he decided to withdraw the [[Order of the Star of Romania]] distinction from László Tőkés. “The matter reached my table and I have to make a decision. In my opinion, we should consider certain issues when analysing such questions. The one who grants a distinction wishes to reward the person distinguished, the one who receives and accepts the distinction must recognise Romania and the Constitution of Romania, to appreciate the values that stay at the grounds of the Constitution of Romania. Considering all this, I have decided to withdraw the “Romania Star” Order from mister László Tőkés,” the head of state said at the [[Cotroceni Palace]].

==Awards and honors==
In 1990 he received the Four Freedom Award for the Freedom of Worship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325223647/http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |archivedate=25 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Miriam Rothschild was born in 1908 in [[Ashton, East Northamptonshire|Ashton Wold]], near [[Oundle]] in [[Northamptonshire]], the daughter of [[Charles Rothschild]] of the [[Rothschild family]] of [[Jew]]ish [[banker]]s and [[Rozsika Edle von Wertheimstein|Rozsika Edle Rothschild]] (''née'' von Wertheimstein), a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] sportswoman.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Gryn, [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rothschild-dame-miriam Rothschild, Dame Miriam], Jewish Women Encyclopedia, retrieved 3 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother was [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild]] and one of her sisters (Kathleen Annie) Pannonica Rothschild (Baroness [[Nica de Koenigswarter]]) would later be a [[bebop]] [[jazz]] enthusiast and patroness of [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charlie Parker]].

Her father had described about 500 new [[species]] of [[flea]], and her uncle [[Lionel Walter Rothschild]] had built a private natural history museum at [[Tring]]. By the age of four she had started collecting [[ladybird]] beetles and caterpillars and taking a tame [[quail]] to bed with her. [[World War I]] broke on the eve of Miriam's sixth birthday in 1914, while the Rothschilds were holidaying in [[Austro-Hungary]]. They hurried home on the first westward train but, unable to pay, had to borrow money from a Hungarian passenger who commented "This is the proudest moment of my life. Never did I think that I should be asked to lend money to a Rothschild!" Her father died when she was 15 and she became closer to her uncle. She was educated at home until the age of 17, when she demanded to go to school. She thence attended evening classes in [[zoology]] at [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==1930s–1940s==
During the 1930s she made a name for herself at the Marine Biological Station in [[Plymouth]], studying the [[mollusc]] ''[[Nucula]]'' and its [[trematode]] parasites (Rothschild 1936, 1938a, 1938b). Because of her inherited wealth, she never had to apply for any grants or funding. As a result of this and her lack of formal education—all her doctorates were honorary—she would always be an "[[amateur]]".

Prior to [[World War II]], she pressed the UK Government to admit more [[Germany|German]] [[Jew]]s as refugees from [[Nazi Germany]]. During the war, she worked at [[Bletchley Park]] on [[codebreaking]].&lt;ref name=mccullough&gt;{{cite book |author=[[David McCullough]] |title=Brave Companions: Portraits in History |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992| page=166ff |isbn=978-0-671-79276-3|title-link=Brave Companions: Portraits in History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1943, she married Captain [[George Henry Lane|George Lane]], MC.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/7528727/Colonel-George-Lane.html |title=Colonel George Lane |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=6 April 2010 | location=London | date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a WW2 commando, who was a non-practicing Hungarian Jew whose surname had been changed from Lanyi for security reasons.&lt;ref name=Gryn&gt;{{Cite web|last= Naomi |first= Gryn |authorlink= |title= Dame Miriam Rothschild 1908 – 2005 |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|date= |url= https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/rothschild-dame-miriam |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;They had seven children, four of which survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Gryn /&gt; The marriage was dissolved in 1957 and in 1963 Lane married Elizabeth Heald, daughter of Sir [[Lionel Heald]].&lt;ref name=Gryn /&gt;

==Science and entomology==
[[File:Miriam Rothschild 2003.jpg|thumb|Clay bust of Dame Miriam Rothschild, by Marcus Cornish (2003), at the Royal Society, London]]
Rothschild was a leading authority on [[flea]]s. She was the first person to work out the flea's jumping mechanism. She also studied the flea's reproductive cycle and linked this, in [[rabbit]]s, to the hormonal changes within the host. Her New Naturalist book on parasitism (''Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos'') was a huge success. Its title can be explained as: external parasites (e.g. fleas), internal parasites (e.g. flukes) and others (the cuckoo is a 'brood parasite'). The Rothschild Collection of Fleas (founded by Charles Rothschild) is now part of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] collection, and her catalogue of the collection (in collaboration with [[George Henry Evans Hopkins|G. H. E. Hopkins]]) is a master-work. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Rothschild was a member of the Oxford genetics school during the 1960s, where she met the [[ecological genetics|ecological geneticist]] [[E.B. Ford]]. She was one of the few women with whom Ford was on good terms and she campaigned with Ford for the legalisation of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oundlechronicle.com/articles/features/197 |title=Dame Miriam Rothschild, obituary |publisher=The Oundle Chronicle (blog) |accessdate=6 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008215721/http://www.oundlechronicle.com/articles/features/197/ |archivedate=8 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothschild authored books about her father (''Rothschild's Reserves &amp;ndash; time and fragile nature'') and her uncle (''Dear Lord Rothschild''). She wrote about 350 papers on entomology, zoology and other subjects.

==Funding for schizophrenia research and art therapy==
Rothschild founded the 'Schizophrenia Research Fund' in 1962, an independent registered charity formed “to advance the better understanding, prevention, treatment and cure of all forms of mental illness and in particular of the illness known as Schizophrenia”. In March 2006, following her death, the name of the Fund was changed in her memory to the 'Miriam Rothschild Schizophrenia Research Fund'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf-uk.com/|title=Schizophrenia Research Fund|website=www.srf-uk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneer of British [[Art Therapy]], [[Edward Adamson]] and his partner and collaborator, John Timlin, were regular visitors to [[Ashton Wold]].&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, E. (1984). 'Art as Healing'. London, Coventure&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1983 and 1997, the influential Adamson Collection of 6000 paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics by people living with major mental disorder at [[Netherne Hospital]], created with Adamson’s encouragement in his progressive art studios at the hospital, was housed and displayed to the public in a medieval barn at Ashton. Rothschild was both a Trustee and, subsequently, Patron of the Adamson Collection Trust.&lt;ref&gt;O'Flynn, D. (2011). 'Art as Healing: Edward Adamson'. [[Raw Vision]], 72, Spring 2011, pp. 46–53.&lt;/ref&gt; "All my life," she said, "I have tilted against hopeless windmills".&lt;ref&gt;Marren, P. (2005). "Obituary: Dame Miriam Rothschild. Expert on fleas and energetic campaigner for nature conservation." ''The Independent'', 22 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Adamson Collection is now almost all re-located to the [[Wellcome Library]]. All Adamson's papers, correspondence, photographs and other material are currently being organised as the 'Edward Adamson Archive', also at the Wellcome Library.

==Awards/honours==
Rothschild was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1985 and was made a [[Dame (title)|Dame]] in 2000. In 1973 she was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received honorary doctorates from eight universities, including [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. She gave the [[Romanes Lecture]] for 1984–5 in Oxford.

In 1986 the John Galway Foster Human Rights Trust was established; in 2006 the name of the trust was expanded to The Miriam Rothschild &amp; John Foster Human Rights Trust. This funds an annual lecture on human rights.

'''Modron''' ("mother") is a figure in [[Welsh mythology|Welsh tradition]], known as the mother of the hero [[Mabon ap Modron]]. Both characters may have derived from earlier divine figures, in her case the [[Gaul]]ish goddess [[Dea Matrona|Matrona]]. She may have been a prototype for [[Morgan le Fay]] from the [[Arthurian legend]].

==Origin==
Modron largely features in the Welsh tradition as a supernatural mother figure. She likely derives from the Celtic goddess [[Dea Matrona|Matrona]], known to have been worshiped in [[Gaul]]. Similarly, Modron's son, [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon]] ("youth"), appears to derive from the youth god [[Maponos]].&lt;ref name=Koch1299&gt;Koch, p. 1299.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both Matrona and Maponos were worshiped in the area around [[Hadrian's Wall]], which may account for the prominence of Modron and Mabon in literature connected to the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'' (Old North) of Britain.&lt;ref name=Koch1209&gt;Koch, p. 1209.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Certain elements of Modron's story – specifically that her son Mabon was stolen from her in the night as a baby – suggest a connection with [[Rhiannon]] in the [[First Branch of the Mabinogi]], whose son [[Pryderi]] was similarly stolen; [[William John Gruffydd]] suggested that Modron and Rhiannon were the same in origin.&lt;ref name=Koch1299/&gt;

[[John T. Koch]] suggests that Saint [[Madrun]], a daughter of [[Vortimer]], may also be connected, based on the similarity of the names and some elements of their stories.&lt;ref name=Koch1299/&gt; Other scholars believe the names ''Modron'' and ''Madrun'' are likely to be etymologically distinct; Madrun comes from the Vulgar Latin name Matrōna (also a common noun ''matrōna'' "matron", from Classical Latin ''mātrōna''), while Modron is from the Gallo-Brittonic theonym ''*Mātronā'' "Mother (goddess)".&lt;ref&gt;Haycock, Marged, Legendary poems from the Book of Taliesin, CMCS, 2007, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruffydd, William John, Rhiannon: An Inquiry Into the Origin of the First and Third Branches of the Mabinogi, University of Wales Press, 1953, p. 98 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruffydd, William John, "Mabon vab Modron", in: Y Cymmrodor, Volume 42, 1931, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
The first reference to the name Modron may be in the poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa Gur yv y Porthaur]]'', in which "Mabon am Mydron", a "servant of [[Uther Pendragon|Uthr Bendragon]]", is listed as one of [[King Arthur]]'s warriors. 

A "Mabon am Melld" or "Mabon fab Mellt" (Mabon son of Lightning) also appears in ''Pa Gur'' and elsewhere; this may be a different character, but it is also possible that "Mellt" is Mabon's father (perhaps related to "Meldos", an epithet of the lightning god [[Loucetios]]).&lt;ref name=Koch1209/&gt; 

Modron's most substantial appearance in Welsh literature is in the prose tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]''. The text states that Mabon was stolen from between her and the wall by unknown forces when he was only three days old, and no one had seen him since. Recovering Mabon from his mysterious captors is one of the various challenges faced by [[King Arthur]] and his men in the story, and the adventure comprises a significant portion of the text. Arthur's men locate Mabon with the assistance of a series of wise and ancient animals, and liberate him in battle. Subsequently, he joins Arthur and assists in the hunt for the great boar [[Twrch Trwyth]].&lt;ref name=Koch1299/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Mabinogion/Kilhwch and Olwen|''Culhwch and Olwen'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, Urien investigates a mysterious ford in [[Denbighshire]] where dogs went to bark. He find a washer woman, and has his way with her. She reveals that she had been condemned to wash at the ford until she conceived a son by "a Christian", and bids Urien to return at the end of the year to receive the child. On returning, Urien finds the twins Owain and Morfudd.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modron is connected with ''Euron'' in the poem ''[[Cad Goddeu]]'' (''The Battle of the Trees''), which associates her with characters known from the [[Third Branch of the Mabinogi]]. Euron may an error for ''Gwron''; [[John T. Koch]] suggests the name may ultimately derive from an older form *''Uironos'', meaning "divine man, husband, hero", implying he is Modron's spouse.&lt;ref name=Koch1299/&gt; Modron's name (connected to Mabon) also appears in ''[[Englynion y Beddau]]'' (''Stanzas of the Graves'').&lt;ref name=Koch1209/&gt;

'''Morgause''' {{IPAc-en|m|ɔr|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|z}}, also known as '''Morgawse''' and other spellings and names, is a character in later [[Arthurian mythology|Arthurian]] traditions. In some versions of the legend, including [[Thomas Malory]]'s 15th-century text ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', she is the mother of [[Gawain]] and [[Mordred]], both key players in the story of [[King Arthur]] and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's [[Accidental incest|inadvertent incest]] with Morgause, the king's estranged [[King Arthur's family|half-sister]].{{#tag:ref|Dr Caitlin R. Green of www.Arthuriana.co.uk notes: "In the later Vulgate ''Mort Artu'', Morguase -- Arthur's supposed half-sister -- is made to be Medraut [Mordred]'s mother and this incest motif is preserved in the romances based upon the ''Mort Artu'' (for example, Malory's ''Morte Darthur''). Both this parentage and the incest motif are, however, clearly inventions of the ''Mort Artu'', despite their modern popularity, and in all unrelated accounts the portrayal of Medraut is solidly Galfridian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/n&amp;q/figures.htm |title=Pre-Galfridian Arthurian Characters |last=Green |first=Caitlin |accessdate=29 November 2012 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Notes"}} She is also a sister of [[Morgan le Fay]] and the wife of [[King Lot]] of [[Orkney]], as well as the mother of [[Gareth]], [[Agravain]], and [[Gaheris]].

==Earlier counterparts==
The corresponding character of Arthur's sister in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century Latin chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' is named '''Anna'''. In [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'', Anna is replaced by '''Sangive''' (whom [[Der Pleier]] calls '''Seife'''), while her parallel in ''Arthour and Merlin'' (late 14th century) is '''Belisent''' ('''Bellicent''') and the mother of [[Gawain]]'s Welsh forerunner, Gwalchmei ap Gwyar, is thought to be '''Gwyar''' (a name meaning "gore").{{#tag:ref|In later Welsh Arthurian literature, Gawain is considered synonymous with the native champion Gwalchmei; ''Gwyar'' (meaning "gore"&lt;ref&gt;Pughe, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; or "spilled blood/bloodshed"&lt;ref&gt;Rhys, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;) is likely the name of Gwalchmei's mother, rather than his father as is the standard in the [[Welsh Triads]].&lt;ref name="Bromwich369"&gt;Bromwich, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matronymics|Matronyms]] were sometimes used in Wales, as in the case of [[Math fab Mathonwy]] and [[Gwydion|Gwydion fab Dôn]], and were also fairly common in early Ireland.&lt;ref name="Bromwich369"/&gt; Gwyar is named as a female, a daughter of [[Amlawdd Wledig]], in one version of the hagiographical genealogy ''[[Bonedd y Saint]]'', while the fourteenth-century ''Birth of Arthur'' substitutes Gwyar for Geoffrey's Anna as Gwalchmei/Gawain's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources do not follow this substitution, however, indicating that Gwyar and Anna/Morgause originated independently.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Notes"}}

==Medieval literature==
The earliest known form of Morgause's name is '''Orcades''', given in the [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#First Continuation|First Continuation]] of [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]'' (the former of which was once attributed to [[Wauchier de Denain]] and dated c. 1200), in which she is the mother of her sons Gawain, [[Agravain]], [[Gaheris]], [[Gareth]] and [[Mordred]], and her daughters Clarissant and Soredamor. As '''Morcades''' she also appears in ''Les Enfances Gauvain'' (early 13th century) and again in Heinrich von dem Türlin's ''[[Diu Crône]]'' (c. 1230). It appears her name was originally a place name, as "Orcades" coincides with the Latin name for the [[Orkney]] [[Scottish island names|Islands]], the land traditionally ruled by Gawain's parents. Medievalist [[Roger Sherman Loomis]] suggests that this toponym was corrupted into "Morcades" (or ''Morchades'', ''Morcads'') and finally "Morgause" due to the influence of the name "Morgan".&lt;ref name=Loomis&gt;R. S. Loomis, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070611104038/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_089/89_001_021.pdf ''Scotland and the Arthurian Legend'']. Retrieved January 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Le Morte d'Arthur''===
Her character is fully developed in [[Thomas Malory]]'s 1485 compilation of Arthurian legends ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', in which Morgause ('''Margawse''') is one of three daughters born to [[Gorlois]] of [[Tintagel]], [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], and the Lady [[Igraine]]. According to Malory, her mother is widowed and then remarried to [[Uther Pendragon]], after which she and her sisters, [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine]] and [[Morgan le Fay|Morgan]] ("le Fay", later the mother of [[Ywain]]), are married off to allies or [[Vassal kingdom|vassals]] of their stepfather. Morgause is wed to the Orcadian [[King Lot]] and bears him four sons, all of whom go on to serve Arthur as [[Knights of the Round Table]]: Gawain, one of his greatest knights; Agravain, a wretched and twisted traitor; Gaheris; and Gareth, a gentle and loving knight.

Years later, her spouse joins the failed rebellions against Arthur that follow in the wake of King Uther's death and the subsequent coronation of his heir. Shortly after her husband's defeat, Morgause visits the young King Arthur in his bedchamber, ignorant of their familial relationship, and they conceive Mordred. Her husband, who has unsuspectingly raised Mordred as his own son, is slain in battle by King [[Pellinore]]. Her sons depart their father's [[Court (royal)|court]] to take service at [[Camelot]], where Gawain and Gaheris avenge Lot's death by killing Pellinore, thereby launching a [[blood feud]] between the two families. 

Nevertheless, Morgause has an affair with Sir [[Lamorak]], a son of Pellinore and one of Arthur's best knights. Her son Gaheris discovers them ''[[In flagrante delicto|in flagrante]]'' and swiftly beheads Morgause in bed, but spares her unarmed lover. Gaheris is consequently banished from court of Arthur (though he reappears later in the narrative). 

==Modern fiction==
[[File:Gareth and Queen Bellicent.jpg|thumb|upright|Young [[Gareth]] appealing to his mother Morgause (Queen Bellicent) to let him go serve [[King Arthur]] in ''Tales from Tennyson'', 1902]]

In modern [[List of works based on Arthurian legends|Arthuriana]], the character of Morgause is often [[Composite character|conflated]] with that of Morgan le Fay; in [[John Boorman]]'s film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981), for instance, Morgause's role as the mother of Mordred is transferred to "Morgana". According to E. R. Huber, "What becomes clear on reading ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' and its medieval predecessors is that Morgause was not a villain until the modern period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/Mrgsmenu.htm |title=Morgause: Background |publisher=''The Camelot Project'' at The [[University of Rochester]] |last=Huber |first=Emily Rebekah |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Morgause is the title character of [[T.H. White]]'s novel ''[[The Queen of Air and Darkness]]'' (1939), the second of four books in his series ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. She hates Arthur due to his father killing her father and raping her mother and raises her children, known as the Orkney clan, to hate the Pendragons. She seduces Arthur through magic, siring Mordred. As in Malory, she is found in bed with Lamorak, but here it is Agravaine who kills her. Due to Mordred being raised by her alone, he is left damaged and hateful, blaming Arthur for his mother's death.
* In her ''[[Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy|Merlin]]'' novels, [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]] characterises Morgause unflatteringly as an ambitious and resentful young princess who wants to learn magic from [[Merlin]], but he refuses her. She seduces Arthur in the hope that she can later use it against him.
* A sorceress with authority over dark powers, Morgawse is a central figure in ''[[Hawk of May]]'' (1980) and its sequel, ''[[Kingdom of Summer]]'' (1982), the first two novels in [[Gillian Bradshaw]]'s ''Down the Long Wind'' series. In ''Kingdom of Summer'', she and her husband ("King Lot of The Orcades") intrigue with [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|King Maelgwn]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], whom she takes as a lover.
* [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] in her influential novel ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' (1983) makes Morgause a younger sister of Igraine and [[Viviane (Arthurian legend)|Viviane]] and aunt of Morgaine. After her niece gives birth to Mordred, Morgause adopts the newborn and rears him for Morgaine, the birth mother. In the novel's [[The Mists of Avalon (TV miniseries)|film adaptation]] (2001), Morgause tricks Morgaine into revealing her son's paternity, then decides to raise him as her own, thus assuming her traditional role of mother to Mordred.
* She appears in ''[[The Keltiad]]'' series of novels by American [[Celtic Neopaganism|neopagan]] [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]] as the evil Marguessan, would-be usurper of the Throne of Scone and an [[evil twin]] sister of Morgan.
* A main antagonist in the BBC television series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' (2008-2012), [[List of Merlin characters#Morgause|Morgause]] is portrayed by actress [[Emilia Fox]] as a powerful, [[Lady Macbeth]]-like sorceress. She is fiercely loyal to her half-sister [[Morgana (Merlin character)|Morgana]], whom she seeks to make queen of Camelot.
* A character based on Morgause appears in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' novel series, [[Morgase Trakand]], the queen of Andor, whose daughter [[Elayne Trakand|Elayne]] takes the throne after her apparent death. Morgase has two sons: Gawyn and Galad.

[[File:Tchaikovsky and the Figners 1890.jpg|thumb|right|Tchaikovsky (centre) and the Figners, 1890s]]
'''Nikolay Figner''' (1857–1918), [[Tenor#Lyric tenor|lyric tenor]], and '''Medea Figner''' (1859–1952), [[mezzo-soprano]], later [[soprano]], were a husband-and-wife team of opera singers active in Russia between 1889 and 1904. Medea was Italian-born (her original surname was '''Mei''') but she became completely Russianized after marrying Nikolay. They had separate careers before their wedding, and again after their divorce in 1904, but during the 15 years of their marriage they almost always sang in the same performances. They created the main tenor and soprano roles in two operas by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] – ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' and ''[[Iolanta]]'' – and appeared in a number of other important Russian musical premieres.

==Nikolay Figner==
'''Nikolay Nikolayevich Figner''' was born in Nikiforovka, near [[Kazan]], on 9/21 February 1857.&lt;ref name=TRN&gt;[http://en.tchaikovsky-research.net/pages/Nikolay_Figner Tchaikovsky Research]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brother of the famous [[Narodnaya Volya|"People's Will"]] revolutionary, [[Vera Figner]] (1852–1942). He joined the Russian Navy as a midshipman, and rose to the rank of lieutenant, retiring in 1881 to study voice with Vassily Samus, I. P. Pryanishnikova and [[Camille Everardi]] at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]].&lt;ref name=Histen&gt;[http://historyofthetenor.com/page.php?12 History of the Tenor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Figner then travelled to Italy, where he made his debut at [[Naples]] in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Philémon et Baucis]]'' in 1882.&lt;ref name=histopera/&gt; He sang at the [[San Carlo Theatre]] and appeared at other Italian venues for a number of years. While in Italy, Figner took the opportunity to study with the prominent singing teacher [[Francesco Lamperti]] and also received instruction from E. de Roxas. Figner performed, too, in [[Madrid]], [[Bucharest]] and London (at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]]).&lt;ref name=ROSNIK&gt;Michael Scott. ''The Record of Singing: To 1914''. 1977: p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled to South America as well during this period.&lt;ref name=histopera/&gt; On 4 November 1886, in [[Turin]], he sang the principal tenor role in the world premiere of the revised version of [[Alfredo Catalani]]'s ''Edmea'';&lt;ref name=ROSNIK/&gt; this was also the occasion of [[Arturo Toscanini]]'s first appearance as a conductor in Italy after his initial triumph in South America.&lt;ref name=histopera/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Mason Greene. ''Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers'': p. 819&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer H. Frank. ''Arturo Toscanini: The NBC Years'': p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels, he sang roles such as Arnold in [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]'', the Duke in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'', and Carlo in [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Linda di Chamounix]]''. He also happened to appear on stage with Medea Mei in a production of Donizetti's ''[[La favorite]]''; they formed a liaison, and he brought her back to Russia in 1887. Two years later, they wed. Figner soon established himself as the leading tenor at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]], retaining this status until 1903.

Other Russian composers whose operas he sang were [[Alexander Borodin]] (Vladimir in ''[[Prince Igor]]''), [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]] (the Prince in ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]''), and [[Anton Rubinstein]] (Sinodal in ''[[The Demon (opera)|The Demon]]''). A good-looking man, he projected a memorable stage presence and sang with sensitivity and style.

==Medea Mei-Figner==
'''Medea Mei''' was born in [[Florence]], Italy, on 4 March 1859.  She studied there with Bianchi, Carozzi-Zucchi and [[Heinrich Panofka|Panofka]].  She sang the mezzo-soprano role in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' at the young age of 16, and made her operatic debut soon afterwards, as Azucena in ''[[Il trovatore]]'', at [[Sinaluga]].&lt;ref name=histopera&gt;[http://www.historicopera.com/jearly_other_page1.htm Historic Opera]&lt;/ref&gt; She became well known throughout Italy, and also toured Spain, South America and Russia and visited London.  Her repertoire then included Ulrica in ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'', Amneris in ''[[Aida]]'', Gertrude in [[Ambroise Thomas]]'s ''[[Hamlet (opera)|Hamlet]]'', Leonora in [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[La favorite]]'', and the title role in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''.  She latter added soprano roles such as Charlotte in [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]'s ''[[Werther]]'', and Margherita in [[Arrigo Boito|Boito]]'s ''[[Mefistofele]]''.&lt;ref name=ROSMEI/&gt;

[[File:Medeja figner.jpg|thumb|right|Medea Mei-Figner]]
Medea went to Russia with Nikolay Figner in 1887, making her debut there on 8 May at the St Petersburg Imperial Opera (the Mariinsky Theatre) as Valentine in [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]''. The soprano knew no Russian at that time, and sang in Italian during the first two St Petersburg seasons. Subsequently, she was received into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and married Figner on 20 February 1889. Thereafter, Nikolay made it his practice to sing only in operas in which Medea was also singing.

She was referred to after marriage as either '''Medea Mei-Figner''' (the form of her name used in most Western reference books) or simply Medea Figner. Furthermore, she was given the patronymic of Ivanovna, and is sometimes designated as Medea (or Medeya) Ivanovna (Mei-)Figner. She eventually mastered Russian to such an extent that native speakers could not tell she had learned it only from the age of 30.

Notably, Medea appeared as Mimi in the first performance of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'' in Russia; she was coached by Puccini himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruvr.ru/main.php?lng=eng&amp;q=25567&amp;cid=134&amp;p=26.03.2008 The Voice of Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medea Mei-Figner is the great-great-grandmother of the Italian soprano [[Amarilli Nizza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtglirica.blogspot.it/2012/09/do-re-mipresento-intervista-amarilli.html MTG Lirica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerca.unita.it/ARCHIVE/xml/250000/248265.xml?key=elisabetta+torselli&amp;first=181&amp;orderby=0&amp;f=fir L'Unità]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Figners perform as a team==
Both the Figners were considered to be outstanding actors: their first appearance together in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', as Carmen and Don José, produced an ovation said to be unprecedented in the history of Russian opera.

They were highly regarded by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], who wrote the roles of Hermann and Liza in ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' for them.  They created the roles in the world premiere of this opera, on 19 December 1890, after rehearsing under Tchaikovsky's personal supervision. Medea was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicdoo.com/encyclopedie/Librettos/damedepiqeHist.htm musicdoo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, when she was unable to continue to appear in ''The Queen of Spades'' due to her condition, Nikolay refused to sing with a substitute soprano, and so the opera was removed from the program until Medea was able to return.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Poznansky, ''Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man'', p. 524&lt;/ref&gt;

The Figners also created the title soprano role and that of the tenor part of Count Vaudémont in Tchaikovsky's opera ''[[Iolanta]]'' in 1892. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Six Romances, Op. 73 (1893) to Nikolay Figner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.tchaikovsky-research.net/pages/Six_Romances,_Op._73 Tchaikovsky Research]&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolay spent time with Tchaikovsky in the days following the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6 ''Pathetique'']].&lt;ref&gt;Poznansky, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he visited [[Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Modest Tchaikovsky]]'s apartment during the composer's final illness. He returned there immediately after Tchaikovsky's death, helping [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] to lay out the body.

By no means, however, did the Figners confine their joint operatic activities to the compositions of Tchaikovsky. For example, they created the main roles in [[Eduard Nápravník]]'s ''[[Dubrovsky (opera)|Dubrovsky]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Nápravník)|Francesca da Rimini]]''.&lt;ref name=Histen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ROSMEI&gt;Michael Scott: p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Other operas in which the Figners performed as a team included: Tchaikovsky's ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (Nikolay's Lensky was said to have been surpassed only by [[Leonid Sobinov]]'s interpretation) and ''[[The Oprichnik (opera)|The Oprichnik]]'';&lt;ref name=TRN/&gt; [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'', ''[[La traviata]]'' and ''[[Otello]]'' (singing in the latter work's 1889 Russian premiere);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operatoday.com/content/2008/01/die_walkure_at.php Opera Today]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]''; [[Daniel Auber|Auber]]'s ''[[Fra Diavolo]]''; and the Russian premieres of [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Tosca]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.ru/English/MTales/tales_067.html Russia’s Golden Tenors]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tickitnow.com/?p=theatre&amp;a=sp&amp;theatre=2&amp;id=944 Tick now.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Oddly, they never appeared in works written by Rimsky-Korsakov, who was the most prolific operatic composer in Tsarist Russia. It has been suggested that the reason for this gap in their repertoire was personal: they had asked Rimsky-Korsakov to write an opera for them, or to make some changes to his existing work ''[[May Night]]'', but the composer apparently refused to oblige and this may have offended the Figners.

The Figners divorced in 1904.&lt;ref name=histopera/&gt; Medea made a tour of South America and returned to continue a solo career at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg.

Medea left Soviet Russia in 1930 and settled in Paris, where she died on 8 July 1952, at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantabile-subito.de/Sopranos/Mei-Figner__Medea/hauptteil_mei-figner__medea.html Cantabile-subito]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of their voices can be heard on the LP anthology ''[[The Record of Singing]]'', while a comprehensive selection of their recordings was released on compact disc by the Symposium label in 2000. This double set of CDs bears the catalogue numbers 1255/1256.

Importantly, Medea Mei-Figner recorded "Lisa's aria" from ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' with the alternative low ending sanctioned by the composer.&lt;ref name=ROSMEI/&gt; She also made discs of "Vissi d'arte" from ''[[Tosca]]'' and arias from ''[[Werther]]'' and ''Carmen'', as well as recording a number of songs, including "Penso" by [[Paolo Tosti]]. Her voice was considered by contemporary critics to be more beautiful and more impressive than that of her husband. He was already past his vocal prime when he and his wife cut their first series of 78-rpm records in St Petersburg in 1901–02 for [[EMI]]'s predecessor, the [[Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company]].

The Danish journalist Knut de Hageman-Lindenkrone conducted a long recorded interview with Medea Mei at her Parisian apartment in 1949, when the singer was 90 years old.  The interview is in French, although Medea Mei may be heard to speak as well in Italian and Russian with her daughter, who was also present.  She even sings a few bars of music here and there, including both the first phrase and the last from Liza's aria, 'Midnight is Approaching', from Tchaikovsky's ''The Queen of Spades'', which she had created 59 years before.

This fascinating hour-long interview, with unique memories of Tchaikovsky and other fabled events of Mme Mei's Saint-Petersburg career, was included in a Rubini Records set of two long-playing records, c. 1975, that also featured Medea Mei-Figner's complete commercially recorded output from the beginning of the 20th century.

==Club career==
===Early years in Nigeria===
Onazi began playing football in the streets of Jos in 1998. His football skills and abilities drew a lot of attention to him and afforded him the opportunity to play in some academies in the city.

His footballing abilities came to prominence when he moved to the city of [[Lagos]] to play for [[My People FC|My People]].&lt;ref name=af2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Audu|first1=Samm|title=Eaglet Onazi soars to fly with the Super Eagles|url=http://africanfootball.com/news/201278/Eaglet-Onazi-soars-to-fly-with-the-Super-Eagles|website=African Football|accessdate=26 January 2016|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onazi was first promoted to the Lazio first team during the [[Serie A 2011–12|2011–12]] season after appearing at youth level.&lt;ref name=gazetta2016&gt;{{cite news|title=Lazio midfielder attracts Swansea City interest|url=http://gazzettaworld.gazzetta.it/news/transfer-market/lazio-swansea-city-onazi/|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport|Gazetta World]]|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[Serie A]] debut as a substitute in the penultimate match of the season, replacing [[Senad Lulić]] in the 90th minute. Lazio recorded a 2–0 victory over [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] at the [[Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia]] in [[Bergamo]].&lt;ref name=guardian2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Enyadike|first1=Emeka|title=World Cup 2014: Nigeria profile – Ogenyi Onazi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/04/world-cup-2014-nigeria-ogenyi-onazi|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Audu|first1=Samm|title=Onazi Ogenyi finally debuts for Lazio|url=http://africanfootball.com/news/233134/Onazi-Ogenyi-finally-debuts-for-Lazio|website=African Football|accessdate=26 January 2016|date=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following 2012–2013 season, Onazi was granted more playing time Under coach [[Vladimir Petković]] featuring in a defensive midfielder role alongside [[Cristian Daniel Ledesma|Cristian Ledesma]].

On 22 September 2014, Onazi signed a two-year contract extension with Lazio until 2018. Lazio had previously received transfer enquiries in the summer transfer window by three Premier League clubs [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] with interest from German, French, Spanish and Russian clubs also being reported.&lt;ref name=bbc2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okeleji|first1=Oluwashina|title=Nigeria's Ogenyi Onazi signs new improved Lazio deal|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29311289|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2015, his 88th-minute goal for the final score of 3–2 in Lazio's win over Napoli helped secure the last Champions League place for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lazio Ogenyi Onazi winner vs Napoli ensures Champions League|url=http://www.espnfc.com/italian-serie-a/match/403464/napoli-lazio/report|website=ESPNFC|accessdate=26 January 2016|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Iran and Nigeria match at the FIFA World Cup 2014-06-12 06.jpg|thumb|left|Onazi with Nigeria at 2014 FIFA World Cup against Iran]]
As a 16-year-old, Onazi represented his country at the [[2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup]], where Nigeria finished runners-up.&lt;ref name=af2012/&gt; However, he was overlooked for selection at the [[2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] two years later, despite participating in the training camps in Portugal and Panama.&lt;ref name=af2012/&gt;

He made his debut for the senior [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria national team]] in an [[2013 African Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations]] qualification match against [[Liberia national football team|Liberia]]. His first goal came in his second international match, a 3–1 friendly win over [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]] in Florida.&lt;ref name=guardian2014/&gt;

Onazi was called up to Nigeria's 23-man squad for the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20970786|title=Nations Cup 2013: Nigeria pick six locally-based players|author=Oluwashina Okeleji|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=10 January 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came on as a substitute in Nigeria's first match of the tournament against [[Burkina Faso national football team|Burkina Faso]], whom they would eventually face again in the final, before going to on to play every minute of all Nigeria's games in the knockout phase, including the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations Final|final]].

He was selected for Nigeria's squad at the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22827902|title=Nigeria to take new-look squad to Confederations Cup|date=9 June 2013|accessdate=10 June 2013|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; but missed out of the tournament as he suffered a slight knee knock a few weeks before the competition.

Onazi was named in Nigeria's final squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and started in all four games as Nigeria were eliminated by France in the round of 16.&lt;ref name=bbc2014/&gt; He was also part of the squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goal.com/en-gb/amp/news/revealed-every-world-cup-2018-squad-23-man-preliminary-lists/oa0atsduflsv1nsf6oqk576rb&lt;/ref&gt;, although he did not figure in any of the team's three matches.

'''Abraham Ozjasz Thon''' (also '''Osias''', anglicized spelling; 13 February 1870 in [[Lviv]] – 11 November 1936 in [[Kraków]]) was a [[rabbi]], early [[Zionism|Zionist]], and leader of the [[Jewish people|Jewish]] community in [[Poland]].

==Biography==
===Academic background and activities===
Thon studied [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]] under [[George Simmel]]. As a student, he assisted [[Theodor Herzl]] in the ideological preparations for the [[First Zionist Congress]], and in 1897 published a groundbreaking philosophical study of Zionism, ''Zur geschichtsphilosophischen Begrendung des Zionismus''. Thon wrote literary and scientific academic works and journalistic essays, and a 1910 work on the philosophical and sociological methods of [[Herbert Spencer]].

===Rabbinic appointment===
In 1897, Ozjasz Thon was appointed to the rabbinate of [[Krakow]], a position he held until his death. He was the rabbi of the [[Tempel Synagogue]] of the more religiously-liberal constituency within the Jewish community. He promoted a [[Zionist]] program despite the overall assimilationist trends prevalent in the Jewish community at that time, and was an adherent of [[Asher Hirsch Ginsberg|Ahad Ha'Am]]'s school of Jewish identity.

===Political career===
In 1906, Thon made an unsuccessful bid to represent the Jewish National Party in [[Kolomyya]], [[Eastern Galicia]], in the elections to the Austrian parliament. He continued his political activities and expanded them after the [[First World War]]. He represented the Western Galician Jewish National Council at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]]. In 1919, Thon was elected to the first [[Sejm]] and served in the Polish parliament until 1931, where his oratory received a hearing even among [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] MPs.

===Death===
Thon died on 11 November 1936 and is buried in Krakow's [[New Jewish Cemetery, Krakow|New Jewish Cemetery]].

'''Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours''' ({{IPAc-en|dj|uː|ˈ|p|ɒ|n|t|,_|ˈ|dj|uː|p|ɒ|n|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dupont "DuPont"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|dypɔ̃|lang}}; 14 December 1739 – 7 August 1817) was a French writer, economist, publisher and government official.  During the [[French Revolution]], he, his two sons and their families emigrated to the United States.

His son [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]] was the founder of [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. He was the patriarch and progenitor of one of the United States' most successful and wealthiest business dynasties of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Early life and family==
Pierre du Pont was born December 14, 1739, the son of Samuel du Pont and Anne Alexandrine de Montchanin. His father was a watchmaker and French Protestant, or [[Huguenot]]. His mother was a descendant of an impoverished minor [[French nobility|noble family]] from [[Burgundy]].

Du Pont married Nicole-Charlotte Marie-Louise le Dée de Rencourt in 1766, also of a minor noble family. They had three sons: [[Victor Marie du Pont|Victor Marie]] (1767&amp;ndash;1827), a manufacturer and politician; Paul François (December 1769–January 1770); and [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont|Éleuthère Irénée]] (1771–1834), the founder of [[DuPont|E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company]] in the United States. Nicole-Charlotte died 3 September 1784 of [[typhoid]].&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Frederick Converse|last2=Rines|first2=George Edwin|title=The Americana: A Universal Reference Library ...|date=1911|publisher=Americana Company|pages=121–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cC0EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA121|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ancien Régime''==
With a lively intelligence and high ambition, Pierre became estranged from his father, who wanted him to be a watchmaker. The younger man developed a wide range of acquaintances with access to the French court during the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' period. Eventually he became the protégé of Dr. [[François Quesnay]], the personal physician of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s mistress, [[Madame de Pompadour]]. Quesnay was the leader of a faction known as the ''[[économistes]],'' a group of liberals at the court dedicated to economic and agricultural reforms. By the early 1760s du Pont's writings on the national economy had drawn the attention of intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]. His 1768 book on [[physiocracy]] (''Physiocratie, Ou Constitution Naturelle du Gouvernement le Plus Avantageux au Genre Humain'') advocated low [[tariffs]] and [[free trade]] among nations, deeply influenced [[Adam Smith]] of Scotland.

In 1768, he took over from [[Nicolas Baudeau]], editor of ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonnée des sciences morales et politiques.'' He published ''Observations sur l'Esclavage des Negres'' in Volume 6.

In 1774, he was invited by King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] to help organize that country's educational system.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-164"/&gt; The appointment to the [[Commission of National Education]], with which he worked for several months, helped push his career forward, bringing him an appointment within the French government.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-164"/&gt;

He served as Inspector General of Commerce under Louis XVI.  He helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|treaty of 1783]], by which Great Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States, and arranged the terms of a commercial treaty signed by France and England in 1786.

In 1784, he was ennobled by ''lettres patentes'' (letters patent) from the king [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (a process known as ''noblesse de lettres''), which added the ''de Nemours'' ("of [[Nemours]]") suffix to his name to reflect his residence.

==French Revolution==
Du Pont initially supported the [[French Revolution]] and served as president of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]].

He and his son Eleuthère were among those who physically defended [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] from a mob besieging the [[Tuileries]] Palace in Paris during [[10 August (French Revolution)|the insurrection]] of 10 August 1792. Condemned to the [[guillotine]] during the [[Reign of Terror]], du Pont's execution was pending when [[Robespierre]] fell on [[thermidor|9 thermidor]] an IV (27 July 1794), and he was spared.

He married Françoise Robin on [[vendémiaire|5 vendémiaire]]  an IV (27 September 1795). Robin was the daughter of Antoine Robin de Livet, a French aristocrat who lived in Lyon, and the widow of [[Pierre Poivre]], the noted French administrator. After du Pont's house was sacked by a mob during the events of [[18 Fructidor|18 Fructidor V]] (4 September 1797), he, his sons and their families immigrated to the United States in 1799.

They hoped (but failed) to found a model community of French exiles.  In the United States, du Pont developed strong ties with industry and government, in particular with [[Thomas Jefferson]], with whom he had been acquainted since at least 1787 and who had referred to him as "one of the very great men of the age" and "the ablest man in France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haggard|title=The Politics of Friendship: Du Pont, Jefferson, Madison, and the Physiocratic Dream for the New World|journal=Proc. Am. Philos. Soc.|date=December 2009|volume=153|url=https://amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/DDHaggard1530403.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Pont engaged in informal diplomacy between the United States and France during the reign of [[Napoleon]].  He was the originator of an idea that eventually became the [[Louisiana Purchase]], as a way to avoid French troops landing in [[New Orleans]], and possibly sparking armed conflict with U.S. forces.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Eventually, he would settle in the U.S. permanently; he died there in 1817.

His son Éleuthère, who had studied chemistry in France with [[Antoine Lavoisier]], founded a [[gunpowder]] manufacturing plant, based on his experience in France as a chemist.  It would become one of the largest and most successful American corporations, known today as [[DuPont]].

In United States education, a '''senior''' is a [[student]] in the fourth year of study (generally high school or college/university study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==High school==
In the United States, the [[twelfth grade]] is usually the fourth and final year of a student's high school period and is referred to as his/her senior year. In [[England]] and [[Wales]], students in their tenth year and above in Secondary School are seniors{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; in [[Scotland]], students in their fifth year and above are seniors. In the  province of [[Ontario]], high school students in their third year and above are considered to be seniors, while in the province of [[Alberta]], only grade twelves are counted as seniors  even though both provinces are Canadian (due to the fact that high school is only grades ten-twelve in Alberta). In the state of [[Queensland]] in [[Australia]], senior refers to the final two years of high school.

==Higher education==
In the United States, the fourth year that a student has been at a higher institution, is known as the senior year.

===Intercollegiate athletics===
In [[college athletics]], a student in their final year of eligibility is known as a senior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D116.pdf|title = 2015-2016 NCAA Division I Manual - AUGUST VERSION - Available August 2015|publisher = [[NCAA]]|accessdate = 8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Super Senior==
The term super senior is used in the United States to refer to a fifth-year student who has not completed the graduation requirements by the end of the fourth year, and thus is required to stay an additional year to complete said requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northernstar.info/campus/news/article_e168216a-5137-11e1-acdb-0019bb30f31a.html|title=Super seniors find educational reasons to stay past four years|first=Felix|last=Sarver|date=|website=northernstar.info|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*October 15, 1950: Meets with President Truman on [[Wake Island]] after heavy disagreements develop regarding the conduct of the [[Korean War]]. When meeting Truman, it is very noticeable that MacArthur does not salute his Commander-in-Chief but rather offers a handshake.  Truman awards MacArthur a fourth oak leaf cluster on his Distinguished Service Medal.
*November &amp;ndash; December 1950: With China committed to all-out war against the US on the Korean peninsula, MacArthur advocates for the same in return against China but is prohibited. He is outraged when military leaders in Washington restrict the war to only the Korean theater, meaning that he cannot bomb even the bridges of the Yalu river over which Chinese troops, supplies, and material are streaming across. He is further restricted from bombing their bases in Manchuria. MacArthur expressed his outrage later, saying that "The order not to bomb the Yalu bridges was the most indefensible and ill-conceived decision ever forced on a field commander in our nation's history."
*April 11, 1951: After several public criticisms of White House policy in Korea, which were seen as undercutting the [[Commander-in-Chief]]'s position, [[Harry Truman]] removes MacArthur from command and orders him to return to the United States. Some suggest Truman may have exchanged MacArthur for a sound nuclear policy in Korea since he did not trust "Brass Hat MacArthur" with nuclear weapons.  Some disagree with this, however, since (as [[David Horowitz]] noted in ''The Free World Colossus'') MacArthur later came out against Truman's use of the bomb against Japan and there seems to be no concrete evidence of a major change in his views.
*April 19, 1951: At a farewell address before the [[United States Congress]], MacArthur gives his famous [[q:Douglas MacArthur#Farewell address to Congress (1951)|"Old Soldiers Never Die"]] speech [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/douglasmacarthurfarewelladdress.htm].
*May 1951: Retires a second time from the U.S. Army, but is listed as permanently on active duty due to the regulations regarding those who hold the rank of General of the Army. For administrative reasons, he is assigned ''in absentee'' to the office of the Army Chief of Staff.

===Later life===
*1952: Allows name to be placed on primary ballots for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination, but does not campaign or announce as a candidate. Senator Robert Taft promises supporters to name MacArthur as candidate for Vice President, but Taft loses nomination to Eisenhower.
*1955: Is considered for promotion to the rank of [[General of the Armies]]. The promotion does not take place, various difficulties having arisen.
*May 12, 1962: Gives famous [[Wikisource:Duty, Honor, Country|''Duty, Honor, Country'']] speech at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] upon accepting the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] granted by the West Point Association of Graduates.
*Active in U.S. Olympic affairs.

In 1955, legislation was in the early stages of consideration by the United States Congress which would have authorized the [[President of the United States]] to promote Douglas MacArthur to the rank of [[General of the Armies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digest of Public General Bills and Resolutions|volume=84|author=[[Congressional Research Service]]|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=1955|p=dccc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULePKE4NBKIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States|volume=84|issue=1|author=[[United States Congress]]|publisher=[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]|year=1955|p=141, 1276, 1312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYpcETNvWbUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar measure had also been proposed unsuccessfully by [[Stuart Symington]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJavIyHYVwwC|p=408|title=Stuart Symington: A Life|first=James C.|last=Olson|publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]|year=2003|isbn=9780826264596}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of several complications which would arise if such a promotion were to take place, the bill was withdrawn.

==Awards and decorations==
&lt;!--this section links to Infobox at main article, please update if you move or rename.---- Per Army regulations, the Army DSM would go before the Navy DSM.  For all services, a person's "own" service DSM goes before the others and then goes Navy, Army, Air Force, Coast Guard in that order if you're not in that service. --&gt;
During his military career, General MacArthur was awarded the following decorations from the United States and other allied nations. The list below is of those medals worn on a military uniform, and does not include commemorative medals, unofficial decorations, and non-portable awards.

'''The Stig''' is a character on the [[United Kingdom|British]] motoring television show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. The character is a play on the anonymity of racing drivers' full-face [[helmet]]s, with the [[running joke]] that nobody knows who or what is inside the Stig's racing suit. The Stig's primary role is setting [[List of Top Gear test track Power Lap Times|lap times]] for cars tested on the show. Previously, he would also instruct celebrity guests, off-camera, for the show's "[[Star in a Reasonably Priced Car]]" segment.

The identity of the original "Black" Stig, [[Perry McCarthy]], was exposed by a Sunday newspaper in January 2003, and confirmed by McCarthy later that year. The black-suited Stig was subsequently "killed off" that October in the series 3 premiere, and replaced in the following episode by a new White Stig who lasted through to the end of series 15.

In [[Top Gear (series 13)#ep1|series 13 episode 1]], the show jokingly unmasked the Stig as seven-time world champion F1 driver [[Michael Schumacher]]. In the hiatus following series 15, racing driver [[Ben Collins (racing driver)|Ben Collins]] was revealed to be the Stig in a court battle over Collins' impending autobiography, titled ''The Man in the White Suit''. In series 16, debuting in December 2010, Collins was replaced by a second White Stig, whose identity has so far remained secret.

==Creation and name==
The idea for the character was part of former host [[Jeremy Clarkson]]'s and producer [[Andy Wilman]]'s concept for the relaunched ''Top Gear'' show, bringing a new format to the [[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|original version of ''Top Gear'']] which ceased production in 2001. The relaunched show introduced a live studio audience, the Stig, a racetrack, and madcap stunts.&lt;ref name=Ti&gt;{{Cite news

Clarkson and Wilman wanted to have a professional racing driver as part of the show's cast, but ran into difficulty finding a driver sufficiently adept at speaking on-camera. Clarkson then asked Wilman why the driver needed to speak at all, and they decided that the Stig's role would be silent.

The name Stig derives from Wilman and Clarkson's time at [[Repton School]], where new boys had always been called "Stig".&lt;ref name=Ti/&gt;&lt;ref name=o6&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the original Stig, Perry McCarthy, speaking in 2006, the producers had wanted the anonymous driver to be called "The Gimp", referring to the use of [[Bondage suit|gimp suits]] in [[BDSM]] sexual role-playing. After McCarthy objected, they settled upon the name Stig.&lt;ref name=ATO&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy had said of the idea at the time that "I don't want to be forever remembered as the Gimp".&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Anonymity and silence===
When introducing the Stig in the ''Top Gear'' premiere, Clarkson said, "We don't know its name, we really don't know its name, nobody knows its name, and we don't wanna know, 'cause it's a racing driver."&lt;ref group="ep" name="1.1"/&gt; According to the ''Daily Mail'' in 2010, his face is never revealed on set, and not even the celebrity guests being trained on the reasonably priced car are allowed to learn his identity. He stays suited and with his helmet on throughout the show, arriving early and leaving late, having his own dressing room and eating privately. The studio audience has no access to him at any time.&lt;ref name=Dag&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 article in ''The Sunday Times'', most of the ''Top Gear'' crew did not know the Stig's identity; one camera assistant reportedly observed the Stig eating his lunch in the back of an ambulance to avoid being spotted.&lt;ref name=o6/&gt; In 2009, another ''Times'' article reiterated that only a few production staff, the show's presenters and other BBC journalists knew the Stig's true identity.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

Former Stig [[Perry McCarthy]] described in 2009 how, to maintain his anonymity, he would put on the Stig's helmet while going through the ''Top Gear'' security gates, and then change into his racing overalls in a special room behind the gatehouse before driving into the studio areas. He would speak as little as possible in the backstage areas, and put on an accent which some mistook as French.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; McCarthy also explained that hiding his identity while coaching the celebrities for ''Star in a Reasonably Priced Car'' proved difficult. He said that he did reveal his true identity while coaching [[Ross Kemp]] and [[David Soul]], as he had previously known them and they promised that they would be silent about his role. For other drives, if celebrities asked if he was a particular person, he would just say "How did you know?", adding that more often than not, the suggestion was [[Michael Schumacher]].&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

The Stig is never shown talking on screen, although he does talk with celebrities off-camera while training them to drive around the track. Clarkson has joked that he is "not a very talkative chap".&lt;ref name=o6/&gt; When asked about his identity in a rare spoken interview for the show ''Veronica Vibes'' of a Dutch channel, the Stig reportedly said, "I don't remember; my memory was erased when I got the job."&lt;ref name=S8&gt;{{Cite news

|accessdate=31 Aug 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stig's muteness has extended to appearances in other media, such as the "Brain Stig" video released by the BBC on [[YouTube]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmdnudxCd5s |title= Brain Stig – TopGear.com viral – BBC Top Gear |publisher= YouTube |work= Top Gear's channel |date= 12 Jan 2009 |accessdate= 29 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarkson has written in his newspaper column that the Stig is not permitted to talk or comment on the cars he is given to drive because "the opinions of all racing drivers are completely worthless," going on to explain that, because of their familiarity with cars equipped for track racing, racing drivers believe any and all road cars are on low-scale compared to racing cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving ability===
The show has often compared the Stig's driving ability to others, particularly [[Formula One]] drivers. When Jeremy Clarkson said that the Stig believed that the [[Suzuki Liana]], the show's Reasonably Priced Car at the time, could do a lap time of 1:44, former F1 driver [[Nigel Mansell]], appearing as a guest on the programme, duly obliged by posting a time of 1:44.6; the Stig then posted a time of 1:44.4.&lt;ref group="ep" name="7.5"/&gt; After [[Rubens Barrichello]] became the first person to beat the Stig's time (coming in at 1:44.3), the show repeatedly referred to a jealous rivalry between the Stig and Barrichello. [[Sebastian Vettel]] then further beat this time by posting a time of 1:44 flat (Season 17: Ep 3). Clarkson has often mentioned that F1 drivers seem to take a different racing line on the test track than the Stig, such as on [[Jenson Button]]'s drive;&lt;ref group="ep" name="8.8"/&gt; however, during Barrichello's and [[Lewis Hamilton]]'s visits to the show, Clarkson observed that they took the same line around the track as The Stig.&lt;ref group="ep" name="10.8"&gt;{{cite episode |series=Top Gear (2002 TV series) |seriesno=10 |number=8 |serieslink=Top Gear (series 10) |airdate=7 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; F1 driver [[Mark Webber]]'s appearance on the show was marked at the conclusion of his lap with Clarkson presenting him with an "I AM THE STIG" T-shirt.&lt;ref group="ep" name="6.10"/&gt;

===Introductions===
The Stig's introductions on the show have underlined his oddness. Initially the presenters heralded his appearance with simple humorous introductions, such as "[[His Holiness]], the Stig!"&lt;ref group="ep" name="2.1"/&gt; Beginning in series 6, the introductions began to follow a format of, "Some say that [two bizarre characteristics]. All we know is, he's called the Stig." Characteristics described in this format include:

* He has no face
* He is terrified of [[Scouts]]
* The drinks cabinet in his car contains 14 different types of [[custard]]&lt;ref group="ep" name="14.4"/&gt;
* His favourite T-shirt has a picture of a T-shirt
* He is afraid of bells
* He is confused by stairs
* He never blinks&lt;ref name="ST" /&gt;
* He naturally faces [[magnetic north]]&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/05/26/the-20-best-things-the-top-gear-team-have-said-about-the-stig/top-gear-the-stig-introductions/ |title=The 20 best things the Top Gear team have said about The Stig|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=27 May 2016 |accessdate=25 Dec 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He has a [[digital data|digital]] face&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;
* He will charge you if you attempt to remove his helmet

Some introductions have referred to current events, such as:

===Other characteristics===
In the Stig's debut, he was described by Clarkson as having a very small brain, worthless opinions, and a disorder called "[[Nigel Mansell|Mansell]] Syndrome".&lt;ref group="ep" name="1.1"/&gt; Richard Porter, Top Gear's script editor, described the Stig as "single minded, stubborn and hilariously petulant; specifically, a mix of [[Kimi Räikkönen#Public persona and reaction|Kimi Räikkönen]], [[Chris Lowe|the keyboard player from Pet Shop Boys]], and a 15-year-old boy forced to go on holiday with his parents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Richard|title=Some say…|url=http://sniffpetrol.com/2015/06/05/some-say/|website=[[Sniff Petrol]]|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been depicted as a piece of cargo, being collected by Clarkson from the baggage conveyor at the airport;&lt;ref group="ep" name="7.1"/&gt; he has also been shown stored in a cupboard when not in use.

It has been said that the Stig "has no understanding of money" and during challenges he has been shown using an [[Oyster card]] to access London public transportation, and a credit card in the name of "The Stig" issued by the "Bank of Money" to obtain petrol.

The show has also featured the Stig's listening habits, as heard on the car stereo as he drives laps. Often a specific genre is chosen for one or more series. The Stig has been shown listening to:

* [[Power ballad]]s
* [[One-hit wonder]]s
* [[Easy listening]]
* [[Country and western]]
* [[Morse code]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.web-translations.com/blog/top-gear-morse-code-translation/] "I Like Gary Numan", "I Love cheese", "I like Mr Sulu", "I voted for Ross Perot", "Strictly Come Dancing is crap", "Too Many gears"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Progressive rock]]
* [[Whale sound]]s
* [[Baroque music]]
* Advertising jingles
* Foreign language learning tapes
* Romantic audio novels
* Salesman techniques
* [[ABBA]] (in French and Spanish)
* [[Elton John]]
* [[Bee Gees]] (including, in one episode, the Bee Gees in [[German language|German]])
* [[The Bangles]] (in [[German language|German]])
* Speeches of [[Margaret Thatcher]]
* [[Self-help]] tapes
* [[Pipe band]] music
* [[Chas &amp; Dave]]
* [[Vuvuzela]]s
* [[National anthem]]s
* [[The Archers]]
* [[Tuvan throat singing]]
* [[The Carpenters]]

In 2009, the Stig appeared at the [[National Television Awards]], where he silently accepted an award and handed host [[Griff Rhys Jones]] a letter from the ''Top Gear'' hosts, which instructed Jones to give the Stig the award in his left hand, as his right one is magnetic, and cautioning organisers that he wasn't to be seated near the cast of ''[[Coronation Street]]'', as "he's decided all [[Northern England|northerners]] are edible".&lt;ref name=TGB&gt;{{cite web

==Role==
In the ''Top Gear'' end credits, the Stig is credited alongside Clarkson, [[Richard Hammond]], and [[James May]] as a presenter. The Stig's primary role on the show is at the [[Top Gear test track|''Top Gear'' test track]] at the show's base at [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], Surrey. His two main functions are to post lap times for featured performance cars in the "Power Laps" segment, and to train celebrity guests to set lap times in the "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment.&lt;ref name=Dag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;{{Cite news

The ''Top Gear'' website describes the Stig's test-driving role as follows:

When first introduced, the Stig was described as the resident test driver, as the presenters could not consistently post fast times themselves. His stated mission was to "just go out there and drive fast".&lt;ref group="ep" name="1.1"/&gt; The original Stig, Perry McCarthy, described in 2006 how a racing driver was intended to be used as part of the presenting team in order to produce definitive fastest lap times for tested cars.&lt;ref name=ATO/&gt;

McCarthy responded at the time, "I do know who the Stig is but I cannot comment any further."&lt;ref name=Sd/&gt; After the [[Top Gear (series 6)|second series]] ended, McCarthy published the second edition of his autobiography, in which he confirmed that he was the Stig.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} McCarthy was then "killed off" in the first episode of the [[Top Gear (series 7)|third series]].

The scene which saw Black Stig "killed off," nicknamed "Top Gun vs Top Gear," was an attempt to race to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and then come to a halt on the {{convert|200|m|ft}} long flight deck of [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']], a Royal Navy aircraft carrier on which [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]] jump jets reach {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} before take-off.

The Stig accelerated along the deck, and an on-screen speedometer indicated {{convert|109|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} before a cutaway shot saw the car flying off the end of the runway ramp and into the sea. Clarkson then revealed in the last scene of the episode that a glove floating on the sea was all that divers had found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The explanations for McCarthy's exit vary.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; While McCarthy described the parting as amiable in 2008, ''The Times'' claimed in 2009 that he had fallen out with producers.&lt;ref name=TIIS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aw/&gt; In 2010, McCarthy said he had become tired of the job, which he claimed paid £700 a week, and that part of his annoyance stemmed from an attempt by a car owner to sue him for ruining his car and the BBC's refusal to defend him due to his anonymity. He said the BBC chose not to renew his contract and had him written out of the show.&lt;ref name=Dl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2722786/But-is-it-art.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=But is it art? | first=Doug | last=Nye | date=14 Jun 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although McCarthy said in 2006 that, following his exit from ''Top Gear,'' he harboured ambitions of re-entering racing in the [[Grand Prix Masters]] series, he went on to run an investment company and appear as an [[public speaking|after-dinner speaker]].&lt;ref name=ATO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dl/&gt;

According to the ''Sunday Times,'' writing in 2009, McCarthy revealed in his book that there had always been more than one Stig, and that then 47-year-old [[Julian Bailey]], a former Formula One driver, had acted as a stand-in for McCarthy.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt; In a June 2009 interview with the ''Daily Mail'', Bailey, who was selling his home in [[Effingham, Surrey]], said "I was one of the Stigs ... which was pretty handy as filming was done just down the road. ...

The first White Stig was introduced in November 2003, following the Black Stig's exit in the prior episode. His identity remained secret until it was revealed as [[Ben Collins (racing driver)|Ben Collins]] in August 2010. During this Stig's time on the show, the character's role expanded from Power Lap times and "Reasonably Priced Car" training to include appearances in other show segments, such as producing timed runs in the [[Isle of Man]] road test;&lt;ref group="ep" name="7.1"/&gt; driving a [[Caterham Seven]] from [[Caterham]] to [[Knockhill Racing Circuit|Knockhill]];&lt;ref group="ep" name="8.7"/&gt; riding a [[London Bus]], the [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]] and [[London Underground|the Tube]] across London;&lt;ref group="ep" name="10.5"&gt;{{cite episode |series=Top Gear (2002 TV series) |seriesno=10 |number=5 |serieslink=Top Gear (series 10) |airdate=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; jumping a snowmobile off a ski-jump in [[Lillehammer]], Norway;&lt;ref group="ep" name="Winter Olympics Special"/&gt; and playing a police pursuit driver in the [[White Van Man]] challenge.&lt;ref group="ep" name="8.8"/&gt;&lt;ref name=o6/&gt;

====Speculation====

Since the White Stig's debut, there was widespread speculation over his identity. Various sources claimed him to be a number of different racing drivers, including Collins, [[Damon Hill]], [[Julian Bailey]], [[Russ Swift]], [[Darren Turner]] and [[Tim Schrick]], as well as former ''Top Gear'' presenter [[Tiff Needell]].&lt;ref name=S8/&gt; Several people, including Hill and musician [[Jay Kay]], claimed to be the Stig themselves. It was also speculated that the Stig was played by multiple drivers, a theory hinted at by original Stig Perry McCarthy.&lt;ref name=ATO/&gt; After observing the Stig's charity drive around the [[Silverstone Circuit]] just before the July [[2008 British Grand Prix]], former Formula One World Champion [[Fernando Alonso]] remarked, "Whoever's in that car is a seriously good driver. ... I've no idea who he is, but he's definitely ex-F1."&lt;ref name=StigF1&gt;{{cite web

When Richard Hammond crashed a jet-powered car, the accident report into the crash described Ben Collins as someone "who worked closely with Top Gear as a high performance driver and consultant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/releases/richardhammond.pdf |title= Investigation into the accident of Richard Hammond |publisher= HSE |accessdate= 26 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Michael Schumacher====

On 20 June 2009, Clarkson announced in his newspaper column that the Stig would show his face in ''Top Gear'''s [[Top Gear (series 13)|series thirteen]] premiere, airing the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clarkson, the Stig was "fed up with newspapers speculating that he's a photocopier salesman from Bolton, or lives in a pebble-dashed house in Bristol."&lt;ref name=TIIS/&gt;

The episode showed the Stig driving a black [[Ferrari FXX]] around the test track for a record-setting time of 1:10.7, before walking into the studio and sitting down.&lt;ref name=TIIS/&gt; As the audience shouted "Off! Off!" the Stig removed his helmet to reveal himself as seven-time world champion F1 driver [[Michael Schumacher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent interview, Schumacher exhibited some of the Stig's supposedly defining character traits, such as knowing only two facts about ducks (both "facts" being wrong).&lt;ref name=TIIS/&gt;

Following the revelation, the Stig alleged to be Schumacher was shown driving the [[Suzuki Liana]] but did not set a lap time; instead, video clips showed the Stig exhibiting very poor car control, striking a camera tripod, and eventually getting lost. Clarkson closed the segment by observing that possibly, Schumacher was not truly the Stig after all. While the BBC initially would not confirm whether Schumacher's revelation was a stunt, ''The Telegraph'' reported the next day that a ''Top Gear'' spokesman confirmed Schumacher had played the Stig, due to Ferrari only allowing Schumacher to drive the FXX, but that "the identity of the driver at other times would remain 'a mystery'."&lt;ref name=WR/&gt;

====''The Man in the White Suit''====

{{further information|BBC v Harper Collins}}
On 19 August 2010, it was reported that a legal dispute was developing between the BBC and publishers representing the Stig, over plans by the Stig to release an autobiography revealing his identity.&lt;ref name=Dag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gd/&gt; A BBC spokesman said, "The BBC is in a legal dispute over the publication of a book relating to ''Top Gear'' as this breaches agreed contractual and confidentiality obligations relating to the show."&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; The Stig was reportedly unhappy that he had been unable to profit from his ''Top Gear'' role to the same degree as the other presenters.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;

Around the same time, the ''Sunday Times'' claimed that financial documents for Ben Collins' company, Collins Autosport, provided evidence that he was the Stig. The ''Times'' stated that beginning a month after the White Stig's first appearance, the company had experienced an increase in profits ascribed to "driving services provided for the BBC, mainly in the ''Top Gear'' programme."&lt;ref name=PB&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2010, the BBC and the Stig's publisher, [[HarperCollins]], appeared in court. HarperCollins confirmed that it was being sued by the BBC over the autobiography's publication, stating, "We are disappointed that the BBC has chosen to spend licence fee payers' money to suppress this book and will vigorously defend the perfectly legitimate right of this individual to tell his story."&lt;ref name=GTC/&gt; The BBC said, "This situation has come about as a result of an attempt by an external party to profit from unauthorised use of the ''Top Gear'' brand, one of the BBC's biggest and most watched shows in the UK and around the world. As a result, it is important that the BBC does all it can to uphold confidentiality clauses that have been agreed to in relation to the show."&lt;ref name=GTC/&gt;

In a 27 August 2010 entry on the ''Top Gear'' blog, executive producer [[Andy Wilman]] attacked HarperCollins for attempting to reveal the Stig's identity: "The whole point of the Stig is the mystique – the bizarre characteristics he has, the wonderment created about what he might think, feel, do or look like. ... HarperCollins have decided none of that is as important as their profits." He also clarified that half of the BBC's legal costs were being funded by BBC Worldwide, their commercial arm.&lt;ref name=PB2&gt;{{Cite news

On 29 August, the ''Daily Mirror'' claimed that photos of Collins at his England home on the same day that the Stig had appeared at a ''Top Gear'' event in Germany proved that Collins had already been fired from the Stig role. When asked about the ongoing High Court action, Collins stated, "I am not allowed to talk about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The legal hearings continued in private on 31 August.&lt;ref name=PB/&gt; On 1 September 2010, the case was decided against the BBC, as the High Court refused to grant an injunction blocking the publication of the autobiography now acknowledged to be authored by Collins. Collins was in court for part of that day's hearing, but neither he nor the BBC confirmed afterward that he was the Stig; a BBC spokesman said, "The BBC brought this action as we believe it is vital to protect the character of The Stig, which ultimately belongs to the licence-fee payer. Today's judgment does not prevent the BBC from pursuing this matter to trial and it will not be deterred from protecting such information from attack no matter when or by whom it should arise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Collins' book, ''The Man in the White Suit,'' was published 16 September 2010.

====Aftermath====

Immediately following the High Court's decision, ''Top Gear'' presenter James May commented, "Obviously I'm now going to have to take some legal action of my own, because I have been the Stig for the past seven years, and I don't know who this bloke is, who's mincing around in the High Court pretending it's him."&lt;ref name=BBCl/&gt; He expounded on the pretence in a newspaper column the next day, describing his dual life as the Stig and "Captain Slow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On 1 October 2010, it was announced that Collins would join [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]]'s ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' motoring show, where he was introduced by [[Vicki Butler-Henderson]] as someone whose name "rhymes with The Twig." Collins appeared unmasked, saying "Yes, I can speak. It's  a massive pleasure to do so."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m3WzOG44aTwC&amp;pg=PT158&amp;lpg=PT158&amp;dq=%22the+twig%22+stig+fifth+gear&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qp-KweGVvA&amp;sig=2GgBfi1ZcH-lny_3rywZqGy2rkI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHoeO9rsHbAhXJTcAKHbMgBOMQ6AEINjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20twig%22%20stig%20fifth%20gear&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2010, the ''Top Gear'' website released a video clip about its "Stig Farm," the end of which introduced a new Stig for the travelling stage show ''[[Top Gear Live]].'' The video also featured a Stig attempting to write a book on a computer, and correcting one of its many mistakes with [[Tippex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/stig-farm-exclusive-2010-11-5|title=video clip "Stig Farm" video clip|author=Top Gear (2002 TV series)|work=BBC Top Gear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "USA Road Trip" special (debuting 21 December 2010), the presenters branded the Stig a traitor; May declared his true name to be [[Judas Iscariot]]. In a challenge mimicking a [[drive-by shooting]], the targets used were cardboard representations of the Stig (with Hammond taking special care to shoot the Stig in the back).

During Collins' appearance with a military amputees rally team, broadcast in July 2011, he was introduced by Hammond as "ex-Stig Ben Collins." Collins returned to ''Top Gear'' in the series 18 special "50 Years of Bond Cars," where Hammond interviewed him on his work as a stunt driver in the film ''[[Skyfall]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Series 17, Episode 6|episodelink=Top Gear (series 17)#s17e06|series=Top Gear (2002 TV series)|serieslink=Top Gear (2002 TV series)|network=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=31 July 2011|seriesno=17|number=6|minutes=53:50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammond again introduced him as an ex-Stig and referred several times during the interview to Collins' departure.

On 26 December 2010, five days after the "USA Road Trip" special, ''Top Gear'' aired a "[[Top Gear: Middle East Special|Middle East Special]]" in which the presenters re-enacted the journey of the [[Three Wise Men]] to [[Bethlehem]]. At the episode's conclusion, they discovered a manger cradling not [[Jesus]], but a baby Stig.

In the [[Top Gear (series 16)|series 16 premiere]] a month later, the presenters explained that Stigs grow very quickly, and the new Stig was thus already fully grown. Aside from a slightly different helmet and overalls, the current Stig resembles the previous Stig. In his first episode, he set a speed record around the track (1:15.1) in an [[Ariel Atom V8]] – Clarkson commenting that this Stig posted times "broadly comparable to those of Sacked Stig".

==="Cousins"===
Various episodes have featured "cousins" of the Stig, often when the show is filming outside the United Kingdom.

; "Big Stig": [[Top Gear: US Special|US Special]] (2007)
: The show featured a portly American cousin nicknamed "Big Stig."&lt;ref group="ep" name="9.3"/&gt; He raced the presenters' cars around the [[Palm Beach International Raceway]] track.  Clarkson stated he had a "relaxed driving style". 
; "African Cousin": [[Top Gear: Botswana Special|Botswana Special]] (2007)
: This special featured the Stig's African cousin, with dark skin, wearing just [[Puma AG|Puma]] racing boots, a loincloth, white racing gloves and the iconic white helmet. He raced two of the presenters' chosen cars around an improvised rally track; Clarkson's [[Lancia Beta]] refused to start. According to the special's DVD commentary, this cousin did have experience in Formula 1 racing, a possible reference to [[Lewis Hamilton]].
; "Rig Stig": [[Top Gear (series 12)|Series 12; Episode 1]] (2008)
: "Rig Stig" made his debut, sporting a "sunburned" right sleeve and glove in reference to his supposed job as a lorry driver. He appeared [[Drifting (motorsport)|powersliding]] a [[Stuart Oliver (racing driver)|Team Oliver]] [[Truck racing|racing truck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamoliver.co.uk/topgear.asp?v=Qxek3oizCxo&amp;feature=related |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029192504/http://www.teamoliver.co.uk/topgear.asp?v=Qxek3oizCxo&amp;feature=related |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2010 |title=Team Oliver Racing |work=Team Oliver Racing |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to show to the presenters that a lorry could drift.
; "Vietnamese/Communist Cousin": [[Top Gear: Vietnam Special|Vietnam Special]] (2008)
: A version of the Stig that rode a motorbike, he was nicknamed the "Vietnamese/Communist" cousin and wore a red uniform. Although featured in a montage compiled at the beginning of series twelve showing a preview of the episodes to come, his feature did not air in the original broadcast of the special. The footage was however included in a later DVD release. ''Top Gear'' hired a local motorcycle stunt rider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/jeremy_clarkson/article7148883.ece |title=Simple surgery to solve the deficit – cut off Scotland |work=The Sunday Times |last=Clarkson |first=Jeremy |date=13 Jun 2010 |accessdate=27 Aug 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; "Janet Stig Porter/Eco Stig": [[Top Gear (series 14)|Series 14; Episode 2]] (2009)
: The Stig's vegetarian cousin, nicknamed [[Janet Street-Porter|"Janet Stig Porter"]], appeared. He wore green overalls, [[Birkenstock]] sandals with socks, and a solar-powered helmet. He drove the presenters' "Hammerhead Eagle iThrust" [[hybrid car|hybrid]] around the [[Motor Industry Research Association|MIRA]] test circuit to see how long it would last, but died from the car's diesel fumes.
; "Herr Stig/Stiggy Ray Cyrus": [[Top Gear (series 15)|Series 15; Episode 2]] (2010)
: The Stig's German cousin was also nicknamed "[[:wikt:Herr|Herr]] Stig" and [[Billy Ray Cyrus|"Stiggy Ray Cyrus"]]. He was almost identical to the main Stig, the main difference being a [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] haircut. He drove the presenters' cheap sports saloons around [[EuroSpeedway Lausitz]]. Ben Collins later revealed that he played the part of the German Stig.
; "Bunga-Bunga Stig": [[Top Gear (series 18)|Series 18; Episode 1]] (2012)
: The Stig's Italian cousin, [[Bunga bunga|"Bunga-Bunga Stig"]], was introduced during the final leg of the Italian Road Trip at [[Imola Circuit]]. He came out of a motor-home dressed in a suit, followed by three glamorous women, to set a lap time in a [[Ferrari 458 Italia]].
; "Attack Stig": [[Top Gear (series 18)|Series 18; Episode 2]] (2012) 
: The Stig's Chinese cousin "Attack Stig" made his dramatic arrival by kung fu kicking through a door at the local race track. While in appearance he looks the same as the normal Stig, Chinese Stig attacked anyone indiscriminately with martial arts. His unruly behaviour caused problems not just for the presenters but also for the ''Top Gear'' filming crew, flag bearer and a nearby track marshal, the latter for whom this Stig even interrupted his timed lap of the [[Roewe 350]] in order to attack. After the timed laps, he walked on-screen and kicked James "in the [[testicle|plums]]". His behaviour was so bad that Clarkson remarked, "that's the worst Stig we've ever had."
; "Teenage Cousin": [[Top Gear (series 21)|Series 21; Episode 1]] (2014)
: The Stig's Teenage cousin appeared, with headphones on, a [[Sagging (fashion)|low waist line]] allowing his underwear to be seen and a phone he seldom stopped looking at. He drove a modern [[SEAT León#Third generation .28Typ 5F.3B 2012.E2.80.93.29|hot hatchback]] to set a hill run time against the presenters's classic hot hatchbacks. He also appears in advertisements promoting the mobile game ''Top Gear: Race The Stig''.
; "Australian Cousin": [[Top Gear (series 22)|Series 22; Episode 2]] (2015)
: The Stig's Australian cousin was introduced during a hillclimb track in the Australian Outback, placed in an [[Open-pit mining|open cut]] [[iron ore]] mine. Setting a benchmark time in an Australian [[Holden Special Vehicles#Maloo|HSV Maloo ute]]. He looks similar to the ordinary Stig, except for dusty, white overalls with [[Flip-flops]], and sporting a large "gentleman sausage" and muscular upper body.
; "Leisure Stig": [[Top Gear (series 22)|Series 22; Episode 8]] (2015)
: The Stig's leisure activity cousin is also known as Top Gear's top-secret Leisure Stig. He is only used for testing caravans and is an otherwise useless driver. He appears identical to the ordinary Stig, but is notably slower.
; "Teenaged Cousins": [[Top Gear (series 24)|Series 24; Episode 4]] (2017) ; [[Top Gear (series 25)|Series 25; Episode 4]] (2018)
: The Stig's three Teenaged Cousins sported the same appearance as the previous Teenage cousin, each sporting smartphones and headphones of different colours. They drove the [[Renault Twingo]] GT, the [[Smart Fourtwo]] Brabus, and the [[Volkswagen Up]] on the Top Gear track, in a race against each other. Two Teenaged Stigs appear again in Series 25, this time racing the [[Hyundai i30|Hyundai i30N]] against the [[Volkswagen_Golf_Mk7#Golf_GTI|VW Golf GTI Mk7]] on a wet Top Gear track.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Top Gear Australia'' Stig was wheeled on screen, upside down in a delivery crate for the UK-Australian "Top Gear Ashes" episode. Additionally, when ''Top Gear Australia'' visited New Zealand (in [[Top Gear Australia (series 3)|series 3]] episode 2), they introduced their Stig's Kiwi cousin, "The Stug" (referencing [[New Zealand English]]'s [[central vowel|centralised]] short-"i" sound). When ''Top Gear U.S.'' drove a modified off-road racer through Colorado against a kayak, they introduced "Backwoods Stig," who wears a white racing overall with torn off sleeves. The Stig is rarely used in the US version as presenter [[Tanner Foust]] is himself a professional racing driver.

In the DVD ''Top Gear: The Worst Car in the History of the World,'' the Stig's [[Yorkshire]] cousin, nicknamed "T'Stig" (a reference to the [[Yorkshire dialect#Vocabulary and grammar|Yorkshire accent]]), was featured. Alongside his trademark racing outfit, he had a flat cap on his helmet and two [[whippet]]s by his feet. He was involved in driving a BMW around a [[Gymkhana (motorsport)|Gymkhana]] course to show how it is done for when James and Jeremy attempt to do so with two of the worst American cars. He was also prompted to drive a [[Peugeot 308]] - one of the cars that was the candidate for the title, but he fled.

In the "USA Road Trip" (aired 21 December 2010), [[Tiff Needell]] was brought in as an "Emergency Stig" to train [[Danny Boyle]] on the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/tv/2010/12/17/top-gear-s-new-stig-is-tiff-needell-115875-22788744/|title=Top Gear's new Stig is...

==Other appearances==
In June 2008, the Stig drove a passenger in a two-seat Formula One car at speeds up to {{convert|178|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for three laps around the [[Silverstone Circuit]] in wet conditions, hours before the start of the [[2008 British Grand Prix]]. The drive was the prize in a charity auction held in aid of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital]] where the winning bidder paid £35,000 for the privilege.&lt;ref name=StigF1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ag/&gt; The Stig appeared at the 2008 October [[National Television Awards]] to accept ''Top Gear's'' third award for best factual programme, as the other presenters were ostensibly busy filming the new series.&lt;ref name=TGB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stig has appeared outside ''Top Gear'' in Clarkson's motoring DVDs since 2005. He also appeared before the BBC's [[2011 British Grand Prix]] coverage when Clarkson and Hammond gave the camera crew a tour of the ''Top Gear'' studio.

In the 2011 [[X Games]] 17, the Stig can be seen walking in the background during one of [[Brian Deegan (rider)|Brian Deegan]]'s interviews during Rallycross. [[Tanner Foust]], one of the presenters of ''[[Top Gear (U.S. TV series)|Top Gear US]]'', was competing in the event.

Google Street view of the Dunsfold track shows the Google Camera car being paced by The Stig driving a [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG|Mercedes SLS coupe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.117964,-0.539973,3a,75y,192.86h,52.98t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s_2x-buSI2sP3hzjmZOLLWA!2e0!3e5?hl=en|title=Google Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he was a part of [[The Getaway Car]] presented by [[Dermot O'Leary]] along with his 2 'nephews' simply called 'Red Stig' and 'Blue Stig'.

On March 30, 2017, the Stig appeared on [[Colin Furze]]'s YouTube ''World's Fastest Bumper Car'' video, which featured a modified 1960s [[Bumper cars|bumper car]] and a 600cc 100bhp engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/stig/100mph-dodgem-stig-has-set-new-world-record|title=100mph in a dodgem: The Stig has set a new world record!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact and merchandising==
''The Scotsman'' described the Stig in 2008 as a "real-life [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] able to tame the most powerful cars, while possessing all the mystique of [[Zorro]]."&lt;ref name=S8/&gt; ''The Sunday Times'' in 2009 described the Stig as "not a man but an idea, possibly an extraterrestrial," speculating that, along the lines of the [[Spartacus|Spartacus mythology]], the more people that were linked with the character, the stronger the mystery would become. It paid tribute to how long the show had actually kept the secret.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

'''Íñigo Arista''' ({{lang-eu|[[Eneko (given name)|Eneko]]}}, {{lang-ar|ونّقه}}, ''Wannaqo'', c. 790 – 851 or 852) was a [[Basque people|Basque]] leader, considered the first [[King of Pamplona]].{{Sfn|Collins|1990|p=41}}{{Sfn|Lévi-Provençal|1953|p=11}} He is thought to have risen to prominence after the defeat of local [[Carolingians|Frankish]] partisans in 816, and his rule is usually dated from shortly after the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|defeat of a Carolingian army]] in 824. 

He is first attested by chroniclers as a rebel against the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Emirate of Córdoba]] from 840 until his death a decade later. Remembered as the nation's founder, he would be referred to as early as the 10th century by the nickname "Arista",{{Sfn|Lacarra|1945|p=204}} coming either from Basque ''Aritza'' (''Haritza''/''[[Aiza]]'', literally 'the oak', meaning 'the resilient') or Latin ''Aresta'' ('the considerable').{{Sfn|Caro Baroja|1978|p=48}}

==Origin==
The origin of Íñigo Arista is obscure.  There is even disagreement regarding the name of his father.  A charter preserved at Leyre describes him as ''Enneco ... filius Simeonis'' (Íñigo son of Jimeno) and another Leyre document reports the obituary of ''Enneco Garceanes, que fuit vulgariter vocas Areista'' (Íñigo Garcés [son of García], who is commonly called Arista). Many later historians have followed one or the other of these, but the reliability of both are questioned due to the possibility of later corruption or forgery.

Eleventh century chroniclers [[Ibn Hayyan]], who calls him and his brother both ''ibn Wannaqo'' ({{lang-ar|بن&amp;nbsp;ونّقه}}, Íñiguez), and [[Al-Udri]] (''ibn Yannaqo'') indicate that his father was likewise named Íñigo.{{Sfn|Martínez Díez|2007|p=22}} He is said by [[Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada]] (c. 1170–1247) to have been count of [[Bigorre]], or at least to have come from there, but there is no near-contemporary evidence of this.{{Sfn|Barrau-Dihigo|1900|p=}}

It has been speculated that he was kin to [[García Jiménez (Basque leader)|García Jiménez]], who in the late 8th century succeeded his father [[Jimeno (Basque leader)|Jimeno 'the Strong']] in resisting [[Carolingian]] expansion into [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]]. A second dynasty of Pamplona monarchs that would supplant his, the [[Jiménez dynasty|Jimena]], are usually made to be related to him.{{Sfn|Lacarra|1945|p=207}}

The name of Íñigo's mother is unknown (she is sometimes called Onneca, without foundation) but it is known that she also married local [[Muladi|''muwallad'']] lord Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, by him having a son [[Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi]].{{efn|Íñigo and Fortún Íñiguez are explicitly called brothers of Musa ibn Musa on their mother's side by chroniclers [[Ibn Hayyan]] and [[Al-Udri]]. The order of the maternal marriages has been subject to speculation, with Lévi-Provençal and Pérez de Urbel having the widowed mother of Íñigo marrying Musà ibn Fortún, while Sánchez Albornoz ("Problemas") argued that the Christian marriage came after the Muslim.{{Sfn|Sánchez Albornoz |1959 |pp=14–15}}}} This younger Musa would become head of the [[Banu Qasi]], ruler of [[Tudela (Navarre)|Tudela]] and one of the chief lords of [[Ebro]] Valley. Due to this relationship, Íñigo and his kin frequently acted in alliance with Musa ibn Musa, a relationship that allowed Íñigo to extend his influence over large territories in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] valleys, and was also instrumental in the rebellions that would lead to Pamplona breaking with the Emirate.

==Rise to power==
The family came to power through struggles over [[Franks|Frankish]] and [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Córdoban]] influence in northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. In 799, pro-Frankish assassins murdered [[Mutarrif ibn Musa]], governor of [[Pamplona]], perhaps the brother of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi and even of Íñigo himself. Ibn Hayyan reports that in 816, Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Mugit launched a military campaign against the pro-Frankish "Enemy of God", [[Velasco the Gascon]] ({{lang-ar|بلشك&amp;nbsp;الجلشقي}}, ''Balašk al-Ŷalašqī''), ''[[Sahib]]'' of Pamplona ({{lang-ar|صاحب&amp;nbsp;بنبلونة}}), who had united Christian and pagan factions. They fought [[Battle of Pancorbo (816)|a three-day battle]] in which the pro-[[Caliphate of Córdoba|Córdoba]] faction routed their enemies and killed Velasco, along with García López, kinsman of [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], Sancho "warrior/knight of Pamplona", and pagan warrior "Ṣaltān". This defeat of the pro-Frankish force appears to have allowed the anti-Frankish Íñigo to come to power.

In 820, Íñigo is said to have intervened in the [[County of Aragon]], ejecting a Frankish vassal, count [[Aznar I Galíndez]], in favor of [[García Galíndez|García ''el Malo'']] (''the Mean''), who would become Íñigo's son-in-law. In 824, a Carolingian force led by counts [[Aeblus]] and [[Aznar Sánchez]] made an expedition against Pamplona, but were defeated in the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|second Battle of Roncesvalles]].{{Sfn|Martínez Díez|2007|p=23}}

Traditionally, this battle is portrayed as resulting in the crowning of Íñigo as "King of Pamplona", but there is no direct evidence of his involvement in the battle or his crowning thereafter, and he is referred to by Arabic chroniclers with the same title as given Velasco, "Lord of Pamplona". His realm would continually play Muslim and Christian against themselves and each other to maintain independence against the outside powers.

==Rebellion and death==
In 840 Íñigo's lands were attacked by Abd Allah ibn Kulayb, ''[[Wāli|wali]]'' of Zaragoza, leading his half-brother, Musa ibn Musa, into rebellion.{{Sfn|Granja|1967|pp=468–69}} Íñigo's son [[García Íñiguez of Pamplona|García]] acted as [[regent]], in concert with Íñigo's warrior brother [[Fortún Íñiguez]] ({{lang-ar|فرتون&amp;nbsp;بن&amp;nbsp;ونّقه}}, ''Fortūn ibn Wannaqo''), who was also half-brother of Musa, and they joined Musa in an uprising against the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Emirate of Córdoba]]. [[Abd-ar-Rahman II]], [[emir of Córdoba]], launched reprisal campaigns in the succeeding years.

In an 843 battle, Fortún Íñiguez was killed, and Musa unhorsed and forced to escape on foot, while Íñigo and his son Galindo escaped with wounds and several noblemen, most notably Velasco Garcés, defected to Abd-ar-Rahman. The subsequent year, Íñigo's own son, Galindo Íñiguez, and Musa's son Lubb ibn Musa went over to Córdoba, and Musa was forced to submit. Following a brief campaign in 845, a general peace was achieved. In 850, Mūsā again rose in open rebellion, supported by Pamplona,{{Sfn|Granja|1967|pp=468–69}} and envoys of ''Induo'' (thought to be Íñigo) and ''Mitio'',{{efn|Identified by Pérez de Urbel with [[Jimeno of Pamplona]], but Sánchez Albornoz rejects this.}} "Dukes of the Navarrese", were received at the [[France|French]] court.

Íñigo died in the [[Islamic calendar|Muslim year]] 237 A.H., which is late 851 or early 852, and was succeeded by his son García Íñiguez who was already governing the kingdom during his father's long illness prior to his death.{{Sfn|Martínez Díez|2007|p=23}}{{efn|Lévi-Provençal and García Gómez; Sánchez Albornoz ("Problemas"). It has been suggested that either [[Jimeno of Pamplona]] or his son [[García Jiménez of Pamplona|García Jiménez]] served as regent following the death of Íñigo, but as the chroniclers of Al-Andalus show García Íñiguez already taking a leadership role before his father's death, this is unlikely.}}

==Leyre, major monastery of Navarre==
During the lifetime of Íñigo, the existence of several monasteries is attested across Navarre, when the Cordovan priest [[Eulogius of Córdoba|Eulogius]] had to stay in the area (848). In a letter written to [[Wiliesind]], not only does Eulogius reveal that the Basque leader was a ''christicola princeps'' but he provides the names of three monasteries not far from Pamplona: Siresa, St. Zacharias and Leyre.

The iconic [[monastery of Leyre]], founded in the 9th century{{Sfn|Collins|1990|p=146}} and claimed later to be founded by the king of Pamplona, was fostered by granting lands and estates to it. A document in the archives of the monastery shows that in 842, Íñigo bestowed the town and lands of Yesa on Leyre ("''Ego rex Eneco concedo...''"), although the authenticity of the document recording this grant is disputed. Íñigo himself is reported to have been buried in the monastery after his death in 851/852.

==Lineage and family links==
The name of the wife (or wives) of Íñigo is not reported in contemporary records, although sources from centuries later assign her the name of Toda or Onneca.{{Sfn|Settipani|2004|p=}} There is also scholarly debate regarding her derivation, some hypothesizing that she was daughter of [[Velasco the Gascon|Velasco]], lord of Pamplona (killed 816), and others making her kinswoman of [[Aznar I Galíndez]].{{efn|Mello Vaz de São Payo;Stasser. These identifications are based on the names given in subsequent generations, but Sánchez Albornoz ("Problemas") wrote of the danger of assuming such name usage demonstrates specific familial linkage.}} He was father of the following known children:
* Assona Íñiguez, who married her father's half-brother, Musa ibn Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, lord of Tudela and [[Huesca]]
* [[García Íñiguez of Pamplona|García Íñiguez]], regent and then Íñigo's successor as 'king'.
* Galindo Íñiguez, fled to Córdoba where he was friend of Eulogius of Córdoba.  The [[Musa ibn Galind]], ''Amil'' of [[Huesca]] in 860, assassinated in 870, was apparently his son.{{Sfn|Sánchez Albornoz|1959|p=32}}
* a daughter who married Count [[García Galíndez|García ''el Malo'']] (''the Mean'') of [[Aragón]].{{Sfn|Martínez Díez|2007|p=23}}

==Historical Legacy==
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
The dynasty founded by Íñigo reigned for about 80 years, being supplanted by a rival dynasty in 905. However, due to intermarriages, subsequent kings of [[Navarre]] descended from Íñigo, and some accounts even wrongly showed them to descend from Íñigo in the direct male line.  He is remembered as the founder of the nation of Navarre.
