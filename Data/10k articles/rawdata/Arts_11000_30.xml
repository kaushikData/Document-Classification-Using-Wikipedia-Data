* May 25 - ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' opens in theaters and becomes the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of the year.

The film's release is often considered one of the most important events in the film history.
*June 22 - [[Walt Disney Productions]] releases ''[[The Rescuers]]'', which brings back an interest in animation that had been lost to both film-goers and critics throughout the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBrescu.html|title=Don Bluth The Disney Years: The Rescuers|work=cataroo.com|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*November 16 - ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' opens to widespread critical acclaim and massive box office success, becoming one of the top-grossing films to date and cementing Steven Spielberg's status as one of the most talented and profitable film directors of all time.
* The average price of a movie ticket in the United States is about $2.25.

'''Alexandru Macedonski''' ({{IPA-ro|alekˈsandru mat͡ʃeˈdonski}}; also rendered as '''Al. A. Macedonski''', '''Macedonschi''' or '''Macedonsky'''; March 14, 1854 – November 24, 1920) was a [[Romania]]n poet, novelist, dramatist and literary critic, known especially for having promoted French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] in his native country, and for leading the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]] during its early decades. A forerunner of local [[modernist literature]], he is the first local author to have used [[free verse]], and claimed by some to have been the first in modern [[European literature]]. Within the framework of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], Macedonski is seen by critics as second only to [[List of national poets|national poet]] [[Mihai Eminescu]]; as leader of a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] trend formed around his ''[[Literatorul]]'' journal, he was diametrically opposed to the inward-looking traditionalism of Eminescu and his school.

Debuting as a [[Neo-romanticism|Neoromantic]] in the [[Wallachia]]n tradition, Macedonski went through the [[Literary realism|Realist]]-[[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] stage deemed "social poetry", while progressively adapting his style to Symbolism and [[Parnassianism]], and repeatedly but unsuccessfully attempting to impose himself in the [[Francophone]] world. Despite having theorized "instrumentalism", which reacted against the traditional guidelines of poetry, he maintained a lifelong connection with [[Neoclassicism]] and its ideal of purity. Macedonski's quest for excellence found its foremost expression in his recurring motif of life as a [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], notably used in his critically acclaimed ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle. The stylistic stages of his career are reflected in the collections ''[[Prima verba]]'', ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poezii]]'', and ''[[Excelsior (Macedonski)|Excelsior]]'', as well as in the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novel]] ''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]''. In old age, he became the author of [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]], noted for their detached and serene vision of life, in contrast with his earlier combativeness.

In parallel to his literary career, Macedonski was a civil servant, notably serving as [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] in the [[Budjak]] and [[Northern Dobruja]] during the late 1870s. As journalist and militant, his allegiance fluctuated between the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]] and [[conservatism]], becoming involved in polemics and controversies of the day. Of the long series of publications he founded, ''Literatorul'' was the most influential, notably hosting his early conflicts with the ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society. These targeted [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and especially Eminescu, their context and tone becoming the cause of a major rift between Macedonski and his public. This situation repeated itself in later years, when Macedonski and his ''[[Forța Morală]]'' magazine began campaigning against the ''Junimist'' dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], whom they falsely accused of [[plagiarism]]. During [[World War I]], the poet aggravated his critics by supporting the [[Central Powers]] against Romania's alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente side]]. His biography was also marked by an enduring interest in [[esotericism]], numerous attempts to become recognized as an inventor, and an enthusiasm for [[cycling]].

The scion of a political and aristocratic family, the poet was the son of [[Alexandru D. Macedonski|General Alexandru Macedonski]], who served as [[Ministry of Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]], and the grandson of [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|1821 rebel]] [[Dimitrie Macedonski]]. Both his son [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] and grandson [[Soare Macedonski|Soare]] were known painters.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
[[File:Macedonski Rondelul trecutului.png|thumb|260px|Manuscript version for one of Macedonski's late poems, referencing his family's estates on the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia Valley]]]]

The poet's paternal family had arrived in [[Wallachia]] during the early 19th century. Of [[South Slavs|South Slav]] ([[Serbs|Serb]] or [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]])&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.517; Vianu, Vol.II, p.330&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Aromanians|Aromanian]]&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.517"&gt;Călinescu, p.517&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vztcron"&gt;{{ro icon}} Virgiliu Z. Teodorescu, [http://www.cronicaromana.ro/index.php?editie=347&amp;art=16363 "Alexandru Macedonski - 150 de ani de la naștere"], in ''[[Cronica Română]]'', March 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; origin, they claimed to have descended from Serb insurgents in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.517" /&gt; Alexandru's grandfather Dimitrie and Dimitrie's brother [[Pavel Macedonski|Pavel]] participated in the 1821 uprising against the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] administration, and in alliance with the [[Filiki Eteria]]; Dimitrie made the object of controversy when, during the final stage of the revolt, he sided with the Eteria in its confrontation with Wallachian leader [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], taking an active part in the latter's killing.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.517; Vianu, Vol.II, p.333-334&lt;/ref&gt; Both Macedonski brothers had careers in the [[Wallachian military forces]], at a time when the country was governed by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] envoys, when the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime recognized the family as belonging to Wallachia's nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.517; Vianu, Vol.II, p.332&lt;/ref&gt; Dimitrie married Zoe, the daughter an [[Russians|ethnic Russian]] or [[Poles|Polish]] officer; their son, the Russian-educated Alexandru, climbed in the military and political hierarchy, joining the [[Romanian Land Forces|unified Land Forces]] after his political ally, [[Alexander John Cuza]], was elected ''[[Domnitor]]'' and the two [[Danubian Principalities]] became [[United Principalities|united Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.8; Călinescu, p.517, 518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.334-338&lt;/ref&gt; Both the officer's uncle Pavel&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.517" /&gt; and brother Mihail&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.334&lt;/ref&gt; were amateur poets.

Macedonski's mother, Maria Fisența (also ''Vicenț'' or ''Vicența''), was from an aristocratic environment, being the scion of [[Oltenia]]n [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.517-518, 519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.330, 338-339&lt;/ref&gt; Through her father, she may have descended from Russian immigrants who had been absorbed into Oltenia's nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.339. Călinescu also renders the family's alternative theory, according to which their ancestors were [[Italo-Russian]] (p.517).&lt;/ref&gt; Maria had been adopted by the boyar Dumitrache Pârâianu, and the couple had inherited the Adâncata and Pometești estates in [[Goiești]], on the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.517-518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.339-341&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the poet and his father were dissatisfied with accounts of their lineage, contradicting them with an account that researchers have come to consider spurious.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.7; Călinescu, p.517; Vianu, Vol.II, p.330-332&lt;/ref&gt; Although adherents of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], the Macedonskis traced their origin to [[Rogala coat of arms|Rogala]]-bearing [[Lithuanian nobility]] from the defunct [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.7; Călinescu, p.517, 519, 520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.330, 331-332&lt;/ref&gt; While the writer perpetuated his father's claim, it is possible that he also took pride in investigating his [[Balkans|Balkan]] roots: according to literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]], who, as a youth, was a member of his circle, this tendency is attested by two of Macedonski's poems from the 1880s, where the South Slavs appear as icons of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;The pieces are named ''Vânt de stepe'' ("[[Steppe]] Wind") and ''Stepa'' ("The Steppe"). Vianu (Vol.II, p.333) places emphasis on "[Macedonski's] soul [...] where so many of his ancestors' instincts resided."&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu's contemporary, literary historian [[George Călinescu]], postulated that, although the family had been absorbed into the ethnic and cultural majority, the poet's origin served to enrich [[Culture of Romania|local culture]] by linking it to a "[[Thracians|Thracian]]" tradition and the spirit of "adventurers".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.517, 974, 976&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved often, following General Macedonski's postings. Born in [[Bucharest]], Macedonski-son was the third of four siblings, the oldest of whom was a daughter, Caterina.&lt;ref&gt;An amateur poet, she later married into the [[Ghica family]], but divorced, marrying a second time, to a [[France|Frenchman]] by the name of Leboeuf (Vianu, Vol.II, p.340).&lt;/ref&gt; Before the age of six, he was a sickly and nervous child, who is reported to have had regular [[tantrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.518; Suciu, p.104; Vianu, Vol.II, p.342&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, his father sent him to school in Oltenia, and he spent most time in the Amaradia region.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.340-341"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.340-341&lt;/ref&gt; The nostalgia he felt for the landscape later made him consider writing an ''Amărăzene'' ("Amaradians") cycle, of which only one poem was ever completed.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.340-341" /&gt; He was attending the [[Carol I National College|Carol I High School]] in [[Craiova]] and, according to his official record, graduated in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonski's father had by then become known as an authoritarian commander, and, during his time in [[Târgu Ocna]], faced a [[mutiny]] which only his wife could stop by pleading with the soldiers (an episode which made an impression on the future poet).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.334&lt;/ref&gt; A stern parent, he took an active part in educating his children.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.334-335&lt;/ref&gt; Having briefly served as [[Ministry of Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]], the general was mysteriously dismissed by Cuza in 1863, and his pension became the topic of a political scandal. It ended only under the rule of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], Cuza's [[Hohenzollern]] successor, when [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] voted against increasing the sum to the level demanded by its recipient.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.337"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.337&lt;/ref&gt; Having preserved a negative impression of the [[Romanian plebiscite, 1866|1866 plebiscite]], during which Cuza's dethronement had been confirmed,&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.423"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.423&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski remained a committed opponent of the new ruler. As a youth and adult, he sought to revive his father's cause, and included allusions to the perceived injustice in at least one poem.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.337" /&gt; After spending the last months of his life protesting against the authorities, Macedonski-father fell ill and died in September 1869, leaving his family to speculate that he had been murdered by political rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.8; Călinescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.338, 344&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debut years===
[[File:Alexandru Macedonski - prima pagina - Prima verba.png|thumb|First page of ''[[Prima verba]]'', 1872]]

Macedonski left Romania in 1870, traveling through [[Austria-Hungary]] and spending time in [[Vienna]], before visiting Switzerland and possibly other countries; according to one account, it was here that he may have first met (and disliked) his rival poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], at a time a Viennese student.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/rivalul_lui_eminescu "Rivalul lui Eminescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 27/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski's visit was meant to be preparation for entering the [[University of Bucharest]], but he spent much of his time in the [[Bohemianism|bohemian environment]], seeking entertainment and engaging in romantic escapades.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.342-344&lt;/ref&gt; He was however opposed to the lifestyle choices of people his age, claiming that they were engaged in "orgy after orgy".&lt;ref name="aonarco22"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oișteanu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509083836/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=4538&amp;nr=2008-05-07 "Scriitorii români și narcoticele (2). Macedonski și 'literatura stupefiantelor' "], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 948, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At around that date, the young author had begun to perfect a style heavily influenced by [[Romanticism]], and in particular by his Wallachian predecessors [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] and [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]].&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.342-343, 365, 388, 394, 479&lt;/ref&gt; He was for a while in [[Styria]], at [[Bad Gleichenberg]], a stay which, George Călinescu believes, may have been the result of a medical recommendation to help him counter excessive nervousness.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.518&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape there inspired him to write an [[ode]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.342, 343&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1870, he published his first lyrics in [[George Bariț]]'s [[Transylvania]]n-based journal ''[[Telegraful Român]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, he left for Italy, where he visited [[Pisa]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]], and possibly other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Călinescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.343-344&lt;/ref&gt; His records of the journey indicate that he was faced with financial difficulties and plagued by disease.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.343-344&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski also claimed to have attended college lectures in these cities, and to have spent significant time studying at [[University of Pisa|Pisa University]], but this remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Călinescu, p.518; Vianu, Vol.II, p.343&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually returned to Bucharest, where he entered the Faculty of Letters (which he never attended regularly).&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Călinescu, p.518, 519&lt;/ref&gt; According to Călinescu, Macedonski "did not feel the need" to attend classes, because "such a young man will expect society to render upon him its homages."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519"&gt;Călinescu, p.519&lt;/ref&gt; He was again in Italy during spring 1872, soon after publishing his debut volume ''[[Prima verba]]'' ([[Latin]] for "First Word").&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol.II, p.343-344&lt;/ref&gt; Having also written an anti-Carol piece, published in ''Telegraful Român'' during 1873, Macedonski reportedly feared political reprisals, and decided to make another visit to Styria and Italy while his case was being assessed.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Călinescu, p.518&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Italy that he met French [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[Jules Combarieu]], with whom he corresponded sporadically over the following decades.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.341-342"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.341-342&lt;/ref&gt;

During that period, Macedonski became interested in the political scene and political journalism, first as a sympathizer of the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal-radical current]]—which, in 1875, organized itself around the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]]. In 1874, back in Craiova, Macedonski founded a short-lived literary society known as ''Junimea'', a title which purposefully or unwittingly copied that of the influential [[Junimea|conservative association]] with whom he would later quarrel.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol.II, p.346&lt;/ref&gt; It was then that he met journalist and pedagogue [[Ștefan Velescu]], a meeting witnessed by Velescu's pupil, the future liberal journalist [[Constantin Bacalbașa]], who recorded it in his [[memoir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.345&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oltul'' magazine, which he had helped establish and which displayed a liberal agenda, continued to be published until July 1875, and featured Macedonski's translations from [[Pierre-Jean de Béranger]], [[Hector de Charlieu]] and [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], as well as his debut in [[travel writing]] and short story.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.345, 419&lt;/ref&gt; At age 22, he worked on his first play, a [[comedy]] titled ''Gemenii'' ("The Twins").&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.452"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.452&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 that he came to the attention of young journalist future dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], who [[Satire|satirized]] him in articles for the magazine ''[[Ghimpele]]'', ridiculing his claim to Lithuanian descent, and eventually turning him into the character ''Aamsky'', whose fictional career ends with his death from exhaustion caused by contributing to "for the country's political development".&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.52-53&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first episode in a consuming polemic between the two figures. Reflecting back on this period in 1892, Macedonski described Caragiale as a "noisy young man" of "[[Sophistry|sophistic]] reasoning", whose target audience was to be found in "[[beer garden]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

===1875 trial and office as prefect===
[[File:Al. A. Macedonski 1878.JPG|thumb|1878 photograph of Macedonski]]

In March 1875, Macedonski was arrested on charges of [[defamation]]&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.519; Sandqvist, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sedition]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.347"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; For almost a year before, he and ''Oltul'' had taken an active part in the campaign against [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] and its leader, [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Lascăr Catargiu]]. In this context, he had demanded that the common man "rise up with weapons in their hands and break both the government agents and the government", following up with similar messages aimed at the ''Domnitor''.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.346"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.346&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to Bucharest's [[Văcărești prison]] and confined there for almost three months. Supported by the liberal press and defended by the most prestigious pro-liberal attorneys ([[Nicolae Fleva]] among them), Macedonski faced a jury trial on June 7, being eventually cleared of the charges.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347; Sandqvist, p.197. According to Vianu, the court also ruled out that Macedonski's arrest had been rendered void by the [[statute of limitations]].&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the Bucharest populace organized a spontaneous celebration of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Călinescu, p.519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, after the National Liberal [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]] was assigned the post of Premier by Carol, Macedonski embarked on an administrative career. The poet was upset by not being included on the National Liberal list for the [[Romanian general election, 1875|1875 suffrage]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347"&gt;Călinescu, p.519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; This disenchantment led him into a brief conflict with the young liberal figure [[Bonifaciu Florescu]], only to join him soon afterward in editing ''Stindardul'' journal, alongside [[Pantazi Ghica]] and [[George Fălcoianu]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.347"/&gt; The publication followed the line of [[Nicolae Moret Blaremberg]], made notorious for his [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[Republicanism|republican]] agenda.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347"/&gt; Ghica and Macedonski remained close friends until Ghica's 1882 death.&lt;ref name="pippididilema"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=164&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=5331 "Acasă la Pantazi Ghica"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', 164/IV, March 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The new cabinet eventually appointed him [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] of [[Bolgrad County|Bolgrad]] region, in the [[Budjak]] (at the time part of Romania). In parallel, he published his first translation, a version of ''[[Parisina]]'', an 1816 [[epic poem]] by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]],&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.349"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.349&lt;/ref&gt; and completed the original works ''Ithalo'' and ''Calul arabului'' ("The Arab's Horse").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.347, 349&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke at the [[Romanian Atheneum]], presenting his views on the state of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] (1878).&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol.II, p.349-350&lt;/ref&gt; His time in office ended upon the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]. At the time, Russian volunteers were amassed on the Budjak border, requesting from the Romanian authorities the right of free passage into the [[Principality of Serbia]]. The National Liberal Premier [[Ion Brătianu]], who was negotiating an anti-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] alliance, sent Macedonski signals to let them pass, but the prefect, obeying the official recommendation of [[Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Internal Affairs Minister]] [[George D. Vernescu]], decided against it, and was consequently stripped of his office.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519" /&gt;

Still determined to pursue a career in the press, Macedonski founded a string of unsuccessful magazines with [[Patriotism|patriotic]] content and titles such as ''Vestea'' ("The Announcement"), ''Dunărea'' ("The [[Danube]]"), ''Fulgerul'' ("The Lightning") and, after 1880, ''Tarara'' (an [[onomatopoeia]] equivalent to "Toodoodoo").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.348, 350-351&lt;/ref&gt; Their history is connected with that of the Russo-Turkish War, at the end of which Romanian participation on the Russian side resulted in her independence.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.348"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.348&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski remained committed to the anti-Ottoman cause, and, some thirty years later, stated: "We want no [[Rumelia|Turkey in Europe]]!"&lt;ref name="elrseisl"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Eugen Lungu]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080820172941/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20020709 "Islamul la noi acasă. Monologul lui Baiazid"], in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', Nr. 2 (48)/2002&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1879, the poet, who continued to voice criticism of Carol, had several times switched sides between the National Liberals and the opposition Conservatives.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519" /&gt; That year, while the Budjak was ceded to Russia and [[Northern Dobruja]] was integrated into Romania, the Brătianu cabinet appointed him administrator of the [[Sulina]] ''[[plasă]]'' and the [[Danube Delta]]. He had previously refused to be made [[comptroller]] in [[Putna County]], believing such an appointment to be beneath his capacity, and had lost a National Liberal appointment in [[Silistra]] when [[Southern Dobruja]] was granted to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519" /&gt; During this short interval in office, he traveled to the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]] in the [[Black Sea]]—his appreciation for the place later motivated him to write the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novel]] ''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]'' and the poem ''Lewki''.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.348-349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early ''Literatorul'' years===
With the 1880s came a turning point in Alexandru Macedonski's career. Vianu notes that changes took place in the poet's relationship with his public: "Society recognizes in him the nonconformist. [...] The man becomes singular; people start talking about his oddities."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.350&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski's presumed frustration at being perceived in this way, Vianu notes, may have led him closer to the idea of ''[[poète maudit]]'', theorized earlier by [[Paul Verlaine]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.350, 360-361&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, he had set his sight on promoting "social poetry", the merger between [[lyricism]] and political militantism.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.515-516, 523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.343, 351&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, according to Călinescu, his attacks on the liberals and the "daft insults he aimed at [Romania's] throne" had effectively ruined his own chance of political advancement.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519" /&gt;

In January 1880, he launched his most influential and long-lived publication, ''[[Literatorul]]'', which was also the focal point of his [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] cultural circle, and, in later years, of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist school]]. In its first version, the magazine was co-edited by Macedonski, Bonifaciu Florescu and poet [[Th. M. Stoenescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.301; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351&lt;/ref&gt; Florescu parted with the group soon after, due to a disagreement with Macedonski, and was later attacked by the latter for allegedly accumulating academic posts.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.529"&gt;Călinescu, p.529&lt;/ref&gt; ''Literatorul'' aimed to irritate ''Junimist'' sensibilities from its first issue, when it stated its dislike for "political prejudice in literature."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.301&lt;/ref&gt; This was most likely an allusion to the views of ''Junimist'' figure [[Titu Maiorescu]], being later accompanied by explicit attacks on him and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.301-302&lt;/ref&gt; An early success for the new journal was the warm reception it received from [[Vasile Alecsandri]], a Romantic poet and occasional ''Junimist'' whom Macedonski idolized at the time, and the collaboration of popular memoirist [[Gheorghe Sion]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.351"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.351&lt;/ref&gt; Another such figure was the intellectual [[V. A. Urechia]], whom Macedonski made president of the ''Literatorul'' Society.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Călinescu, p.529; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, [[Ministry of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Education Minister]] Urechia granted Macedonski the ''Bene-Merenti'' medal 1st class,&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Călinescu, p.519; Sandqvist, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; although, Călinescu stresses, the poet had only totaled 18 months of public service.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.519" /&gt; At around that time, Macedonski had allegedly begun courting actress [[Aristizza Romanescu]], who rejected his advances, leaving him unenthusiastic about love matters and unwilling to seek female company.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.94, 97-98, 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandru Macedonski - prima pagina - Poesii.png|thumb|First page of ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poesii]]'', 1882]]
In parallel, Macedonski used the magazine to publicize his disagreement with the main ''Junimist'' voice, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''. Among the group of contributors, several had already been victims of Maiorescu's irony: Sion, Urechia, Pantazi Ghica and [[Petru Grădișteanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.302-303&lt;/ref&gt; While welcoming the debut of its contributor, [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]]-[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] novelist and poet [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]],&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.351"/&gt; Macedonski repeatedly attacked its main exponent, the conservative poet Eminescu, claiming not to understand his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-355. According to Vianu (Vol.II, p.355), [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] also joined in the attack, using ''Literatorul'' for articles where his rival Eminescu was being criticized on various grounds, and signing them with the pseudonym ''Rienzi''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Literatorul'' was also open to contributions from some ''Convorbiri Literare'' affiliates (Zamfirescu, [[Matilda Cugler-Poni]] and [[Veronica Micle]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1880, Macedonski's plays ''Iadeș!'' ("Wishbone!", a comedy first printed in 1882) and ''Unchiașul Sărăcie'' ("Old Man Poverty") premiered at the [[National Theater Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 452&lt;/ref&gt; A sign of government approval, this was followed by Macedonski's appointment to a minor administrative office, as Historical Monuments Inspector.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.519; Sandqvist, p.197; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 361&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, both plays failed to impose themselves on public perception, and were withdrawn from the program by 1888.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.462"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.462&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu asserts that, although Macedonski later claimed to have always been facing poverty, his job in the administration, coupled with other sources of revenue, ensured him a comfortable existence.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.519-520&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, Macedonski published a new collection of poetry. Titled ''[[Poezii (Macedonski)|Poezii]]'', it carries the year "1882" on its original cover.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.351, 394&lt;/ref&gt; Again moving away from liberalism, Macedonski sought to make himself accepted by ''Junimea'' and Maiorescu.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.356-357&lt;/ref&gt; He consequently attended the ''Junimea'' sessions, and gave a public reading of ''Noaptea de noiembrie'' ("November Night"), the first publicized piece in his lifelong ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Ornea, p.304-305; Vianu, Vol.I, p.54; Vol.II, p.356&lt;/ref&gt; It reportedly earned him the praise of historian and poet [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], who, although an anti-''Junimist'', happened to be in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.16; Vianu, Vol.I, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rumors according to which he had applauded Macedonski, Maiorescu himself was not impressed, and left an unenthusiastic account of the event in his private diary.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.16; Perpessicius, p.246; Ornea, p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against Alecsandri and Eminescu===
Macedonski's open conflict with ''Junimea'' began in 1882, when he engaged in a publicized polemic with Alecsandri.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Călinescu, p.296; Vianu, Vol.II, p.350-352&lt;/ref&gt; It was ignited when, through Macedonski's articles, ''Literatorul'' criticized Alecsandri for accepting [[Romanian Academy]] prizes despite being its member,&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Călinescu, p.296; Vianu, Vol.II, p.351-352&lt;/ref&gt; and later involved Sion (whose replies on behalf of the Academy were derided by Macedonski).&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.351-352&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski also took distance from Alecsandri's style, publishing a "critical analysis" of his poetry in one issue of ''Literatorul''.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Alecsandri humiliated his young rival by portraying him as [[Zoilus]], the prototype of slanderers, and himself as the model poet [[Horace]] in the 1883 play ''[[Fântâna Blanduziei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.316; Vianu, Vol.II, p.352-353&lt;/ref&gt; The two were eventually reconciled, and Macedonski again spoke of Alecsandri as his ideological and stylistic predecessor.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.353"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.353&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1882, Eminescu had also replied to Macedonski in ''[[Timpul]]'' journal, referring to an unnamed poet who "barely finishes high-school, comes over to Bucharest selling nick-nacks and makeup [and goes into] literary dealership". Reproaching Macedonski's attacks on Alecsandri, Eminescu makes a [[nationalism|nationalist]] comment about the young poet bearing "the bastard instincts of those foreigners who were [[Romanianization|Romanianized]] only yesterday", and attributes him "the physiognomy of a hairdresser".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.357. Vianu believes that Macedonski had not authored any of the anti-Eminescu articles before that date.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the articles of [[Petru Th. Missir]], ''Convorbiri Literare'' gave ''Poezii'' a negative review, deemed "malevolent" by literary historian [[Mircea Anghelescu]].&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.15"&gt;Anghelescu, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the political and cultural spectrum, Macedonski faced opposition from the intellectuals attracted to [[socialism]], in particular ''[[Contemporanul]]'' editors [[Constantin Mille]] and [[Ioan Nădejde]], with whom he was engaged in an extended polemic.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.15; Perpessicus, p.138-139, 266, 352&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, Macedonski published his own play, which had Cuza for its main character and was eponymously titled ''Cuza-Vodă'',&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.462"/&gt; and completed translations for ''Literatorul''—from [[Maurice Rollinat]], whom he helped impose as a main cultural reference in Romanian Symbolism, and from the [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Akhillefs Paraskhos]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.I, p.296-299; Vol.III, p.385-386&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, he also contributed his first [[sketch story]], ''Casa cu nr. 10'' ("The House at Number 10").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.420-421&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1883, he married Ana Rallet-Slătineanu.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Călinescu, p.519; Nastasă, p.106; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthy and supposedly related to Romanian aristocrats,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.519; Nastasă, p.106-107&lt;/ref&gt; she would bear him five children in all: the painter [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] was the eldest, followed by Nikita; the three youngest were two sons (Panel and Constantin Macedonski) and a daughter, Anna (also known as Nina).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.522&lt;/ref&gt; His heterosexual lifestyle notwithstanding, Macedonski remained a self-avowed admirer of male beauties, and was rumored to be a closeted homosexual.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;

In July 1883, Macedonski undertook one of his most controversial anti-''Junimist'' actions. That month, ''Literatorul'' published an [[epigram]] signed with the pseudonym ''Duna'',&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.353"/&gt; deriding an unnamed author who had lost his mind. Mihai Eminescu—whom many had already come to see as Romania's [[List of national poets|national poet]]—had by then developed a [[mental disorder]] which had become known to the general public. Ever since that moment, Macedonski has generally been believed to be ''Duna'', and as a result, was faced with much criticism from both readers and commentators.&lt;ref name="vztcron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.10; Călinescu, p.519, 520-521; Cernat, p.10; Perpessicius, p.138-139, 266, 352; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-361, 387&lt;/ref&gt; The intense anti-''Literatorul'' press campaign was initiated in August, when writer [[Grigore Ventura]] issued an article condemning Macedonski's attitude (published in the Bucharest-based newspaper ''[[L'Indépendance Roumaine]]''), with Macedonski responding in the National Liberal organ ''[[Românul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.358-360&lt;/ref&gt; During one evening, Macedonski is reported to have been assaulted by anonymous supporters of Eminescu.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.359&lt;/ref&gt; His previous conflict with Nădejde was also affected by this renewed controversy: while opposed to ''Junimist'' policies, the socialists at ''Contemporanul'' voiced their admiration for Eminescu's art.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicus, p.138-139, 266, 352&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1883, Macedonski and his friends unveiled [[Ion Georgescu]]'s statue of their mentor Bolintineanu in the National Theater lobby. The circumstances in which this took place rose suspicion of foul play; on this grounds, Macedonski was ridiculed by his former friend Zamfirescu in the journal ''[[România Liberă]]'', which left him embittered.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.533; Vianu, Vol.II, p.353-354, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu proposes that, although such negative reactions were invoked by Macedonski's supporters as a sign of their mentor having been marginalized, Macedonski had expressed his dissatisfaction with the cultural environment long before that moment, and was still a respected figure even after the incidents took place.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.519-520, 521&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Paris sojourn and ''Poezia viitorului''===
[[File:Le Vaisseau fantôme Macedonski L'Élan littéraire.PNG|thumb|260px|Macedonski's poem ''Le Vaisseau fantôme'' ("The Phantom Ship"), as originally published in ''[[L'Élan littéraire]]'' (February 1885)]]

Having been stripped of his administrative office by the new Brătianu cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.360-361&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski faced financial difficulties, and was forced to move into a house on the outskirts of Bucharest, and later moved between houses in northern Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.520-521, 523&lt;/ref&gt; According to Călinescu, the poet continued to cultivate luxury and passionately invested in the [[decorative arts]], although his source of income, other than the supposed assistance "of [European] ruling houses", remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.522-523&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that Macedonski was "always in need of money" to use on his luxury items, poet [[Victor Eftimiu]] claimed: "He did not shy away from sending emphatic notes to the potentates of his day [...], flattering some, threatening others. He would marry off or simply mate some of his disciples with aging and rich women, and then he would squeeze out their assets."&lt;ref name="veready"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=154&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=4780 "Ready Made"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. IV, Nr. 154, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonski eventually left Romania in 1884, visiting [[Paris]]. On his way there, he passed through Craiova, where he met aspiring author [[Traian Demetrescu]], whose works he had already hosted in ''Literatorul'' and who was to become his friend and protégé. Demetrescu later recalled being gripped by "tremors of emotion" upon first catching sight of Macedonski.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.361"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.361&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Macedonski set up contacts within the French literary environment, and began contributing to French or [[Francophone]] literary publications—including the Belgian Symbolist platforms ''[[La Wallonie]]'' and ''[[L'Élan littéraire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.12; Sandqvist, p.197; Suciu, p.104, 109; Vianu, Vol.II, p.362; Vida, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; His collaboration with ''La Wallonie'' alongside [[Albert Mockel]], Tudor Vianu believes, makes Alexandru Macedonski one in the original wave of European Symbolists.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.362. Krasztev (''From a Deadlocked Present...'', p.42) considers Macedonski "the first [[East Central Europe]]an symbolist poet".&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation to Symbolism also drew on his marked [[Francophile|Francophilia]], which in turn complemented his tendencies toward [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.10, 18; Suciu, p.102, 103-110; Vianu, Vol.II, p.362. See also Boia, p.190, 245&lt;/ref&gt; He became opposed to Carol I, who, in 1881, had been granted the [[King of Romania|Crown]] of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]. In addition to his admiration for Cuza and the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Wallachian revolutionaries]], the poet objected to the King's sympathy for France's main rival, the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.363, 366&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1885, after having returned from the voyage, he announced his retirement from public life, claiming that German influence and its exponents at ''Junimea'' had "conquered" [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.362&lt;/ref&gt; and repeating his claim that Eminescu lacked value.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.521"&gt;Călinescu, p.521&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, ''Literatorul'' went out of print, although new series were still published at irregular intervals until 1904 (when it ceased being published altogether).&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.362-363, 365, 366-367, 371-372, 376&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was reportedly hated by the public, causing Macedonski, Stoenescu, Florescu, Urechia and educator [[Anghel Demetriescu]] to try to revive it as ''Revista Literară'' ("The Literary Review", published for a few months in 1885).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.516, 520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.363&lt;/ref&gt; The poet attempted to establish other magazines, all of them short-lived, and, in 1887, handed for print his [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] [[novella]] ''Dramă banală'' ("Banal Drama")&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.421"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.421&lt;/ref&gt; while completing one of the most revered episodes in the ''Nights'' series, ''Noaptea de mai'' ("May Night").&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.363"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.363&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1886, he worked on his other Naturalist novellas: ''Zi de august'' ("August Day"), ''Pe drum de poștă'' ("On the Stagecoach Trail"), ''Din carnetul unui dezertor'' ("From the Notebook of a Deserter"), ''Între cotețe'' ("Amidst Hen Houses") and the eponymous ''Nicu Dereanu''.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.421"/&gt;

By 1888, he was again sympathetic toward Blaremberg, whose dissident National Liberal faction had formed an alliance with the Conservatives, editing ''Stindardul Țărei'' (later ''Straja Țărei'') as his supporting journal.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.364-365&lt;/ref&gt; However, late in the same year, he returned to the liberal mainstream, being assigned a weekly column in ''Românul'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.365"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.365&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he attempted to relaunch ''Literatorul'' under the leadership of liberal figure [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], but the latter eventually settled for founding his own ''[[Revista Nouă]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1891, he saluted ''Junimea''{{'}}s own break with the Conservatives and its entry into politics at the Conservative-Constitutional Party, before offering an enthusiastic welcome to the 1892 ''Junimist'' agitation among university students.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.365"/&gt; In 1894, he would speak in front of student crowds gathered at a political rally in [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]], and soon after made himself known for supporting the cause of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] and other underrepresented groups of [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.367"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.367&lt;/ref&gt;

His literary thesis of the time was titled ''Poezia viitorului'' ("The Poetry of the Future"). It upheld Symbolist authors as the models to follow,&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.11; Cioculescu, p.63; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.199, 382; Suciu, p.109-110; Vianu, Vol.II, p.366&lt;/ref&gt; while Macedonski personally began producing what he referred to as "instrumentalist" poems, composed around musical and [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] elements, and showing a preference for [[internal rhyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.525-526; Vianu, Vol.II, p.365, 414-418. See also Vida, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Such an [[experimental literature|experimental]] approach was soon after [[Parody|parodied]] and ridiculed by Ion Luca Caragiale, who had by then affiliated and parted with ''Junimea'', in his new ''[[Moftul Român]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.11; Cioculescu, p.63-64, 67, 134; Vianu, Vol.II, p.366, 373&lt;/ref&gt; The poet sought to reconcile with his rival, publicizing a claim that Caragiale was being unjustly ignored by the cultural establishment, but this attempt failed to mend relations between them, and the conflict escalated further.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

While, in 1893, ''Literatorul'' hosted fragments of ''Thalassa'' in its [[Romanian-language]] version,&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.436"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cmmareroman"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cornel Moraru, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Un-mare-roman-simbolist*articleID_4226-articles_details.html "Un mare roman simbolist"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 41, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the author also launched a daily, ''Lumina'' ("The Light").&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.367"/&gt; It was also at that stage that Alexandru Macedonski associated with [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], the noted epigrammarian, who joined him in editing ''Literatorul'', and with whom he co-authored the 1893 verse [[tragedy]] depicting the [[Bible|Biblical]] hero [[Saul]], and named after him. Although showcased by the National Theater with star actor [[Constantin Nottara]] in the title role, it failed to register success with the public.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.366-367, 465-466&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the two ''Literatorul'' editors made headlines as pioneers of [[cycling]]. An enthusiastic promoter of the sport, Macedonski joined fellow poet [[Constantin Cantilli]] on a marathon, pedaling from Bucharest across the border into Austria-Hungary, all the way down to [[Brașov]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.522; Vianu, Vol.II, p.367&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1890s===
Macedonski also returned with a new volume of poetry, ''[[Excelsior (Macedonski)|Excelsior]]'' (consecutive editions in 1895 and 1896),&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.11, 12; Vianu, Vol.II, p.364, 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; and founded ''Liga Ortodoxă'' ("The Orthodox League"), a magazine noted for hosting the debut of [[Tudor Arghezi]], later one of the most celebrated figures in Romanian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.11; Călinescu, p.808; Cernat, p.8, 29; Vianu, Vol.II, p.368-369; Vol.III, p.280, 476-478&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski commended his new protégé for reaching "the summit of poetry and art" at "an age when I was still prattling verses".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.III, p.477&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liga Ortodoxă'' also hosted articles against Caragiale, which Macedonski signed with the pseudonym ''Sallustiu'' ("[[Sallustius]]").&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.135, 136&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was additional proof of Macedonski's return to conservatism, and largely dedicated to defending the cause of [[Patriarch of All Romania|Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan]] [[Ghenadie Petrescu|Ghenadie]], deposed by the [[Romanian Synod]] following a political scandal. It defended Ghenadie up until he chose to resign, and subsequently went out of print.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.11; Vianu, Vol.II, p.368-369, 371&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski was shocked to note that Ghenadie had given up his own defense.&lt;ref name="igpresa"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Georgescu, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/vestitorul/1937/BCUCLUJ_FP_279921_1937_013_004.pdf "Presa periodică și publiciștii români"], in ''Vestitorul'', Nr. 4/1937, p.41 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, his ''Casa cu nr. 10'' was translated into French by the ''[[Journal des Débats]]'', whose editors reportedly found it [[picturesque]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.421"/&gt; Two years later, Macedonski himself published French-language translations of his earlier poetry under the title ''Bronzes'', a volume prefaced by his disciple, the critic and promoter [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.190-191, 245; Cernat, p.12, 42; Vianu, Vol.II, p.369-370. See also Suciu, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was positively reviewed by ''[[Mercure de France]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.152; Vianu, Vol.II, p.371&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bronzes'' was largely unnoticed by the French audience, a fact which Tudor Vianu attributes to Bogdan-Pitești's lack of qualification for the cultural mission Macedonski had trusted him with.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.370-371&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, his circle had come to be frequented with regularity by Bogdan-Pitești's friend and collaborator, the celebrated painter [[Ștefan Luchian]], who was in the Symbolist and [[Art Nouveau]] stage of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Șușară]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/tefan_luchian "Ștefan Luchian"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 4/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898, Macedonski was again facing financial difficulties, and his collaborators resorted to organizing a [[fundraiser]] in his honor.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.371"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.371&lt;/ref&gt; His rejection of the Orthodox establishment was documented by his political tract, published that year as ''{{lang|ro|Falimentul clerului ortodox}}''.&lt;ref name="igpresa"/&gt; Between that time and 1900, he focused on researching [[Esotericism|esoteric]], [[occult]] and [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Cernat, p.11; Vianu, Vol.II, p.372-373, 386&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traian Demetrescu]], who recorded his visits with Macedonski, recalled his former mentor being opposed to his [[Positivism|positivist]] take on science, claiming to explain the workings of the Universe in "a different way", through "imagination", but also taking an interest in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s [[astronomy]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.389&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski was determined to interpret death through [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] means, and, in 1900, conferenced at the Atheneum on the subject ''Sufletul și viața viitoare'' ("The Soul and the Coming Life").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.372&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of his vision was that man could voluntarily stave off death with words and gestures, a concept he elaborated upon in his later articles.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.372-373, 386&lt;/ref&gt; In one such piece, Macedonski argued: "man has the power [...] to compact the energy currents known as thoughts to the point where he changes them, according to his own will, into objects or soul-bearing creatures."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to build a machine for extinguishing [[chimney fire]]s.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.523"&gt;Călinescu, p.523&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nikita Macedonski registered the invention of [[nacre]]-treated paper, which is sometimes attributed to his father.&lt;ref name="veready"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caion scandal and expatriation===
The few issues of ''Literatorul'' that were printed in 1899-1900 saw the circle being joined by the young Symbolist poet [[Ștefan Petică]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.371"/&gt; In 1902, he published ''Cartea de aur'' ("The Golden Book"), comprising his [[Sketch story|sketch stories]] and novellas. In parallel, Macedonski returned to the public scene, founding ''[[Forța Morală]]'' magazine. It was through this venue that he began responding to Ion Luca Caragiale's earlier attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.12; Cioculescu, p.132-140; Vianu, Vol. II, p.373-376&lt;/ref&gt; This he did by hosting the articles of aspiring journalist [[Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion]], who accused Caragiale of having [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] author by the name of Kemény in his tragedy play ''[[Năpasta]]''. Kemény turned out to be non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.140; Vianu, Vol. II, p.373-376&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vianu, Macedonski had no prior knowledge of the fraud, but had also been "blinded" by his resentments instead of displaying "discernment", and had even showed evidence of "insanity".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.373, 387&lt;/ref&gt; Most in Macedonski's own series of anti-Caragiale articles were unsigned, or signed with pseudonyms such as ''Luciliu'' ("[[Gaius Lucilius]]").&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.134-136&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in the case of Eminescu's conflict with Macedonski, the polemic enlisted a negative response from the public.&lt;ref&gt;According to Anghelescu (p.12), Cioculescu (p.137) and Vianu (Vol. II, p.374), Macedonski was [[Heckler|heckled]] by the public during a conference at the [[Romanian Atheneum]], and responded by blowing a whisle. Călinescu (p.493) recounts the same story with Caragiale for a protagonist.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet's associate [[Th. M. Stoenescu]] convinced himself that Caragiale was being framed, and refused to allow ''Revista Literară'' to be used for endorsing Caion, which caused Macedonski to shun him.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.374, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski refused to withdraw his support for the cause even after Caragiale sued Caion, but ''Forța Morală'' soon went out of print.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.374-376&lt;/ref&gt; Before it did so, the journal hosted some of Macedonski's most renowned poems, including ''Lewki'' and ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' ("December Night"),&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.375-376&lt;/ref&gt; together with his article on [[Remy de Gourmont]]'s thoughts on [[poetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.413-414&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article of 1903, titled ''{{lang|ro|Spre ocultism. Orientări ulterioare spre teozofie și filozofie socială}}'' ("Toward Occultism. Later Orientations toward [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Social Philosophy]]"), the poet envisaged making his interest in esoteric subjects the basis of a new literary movement.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.11"&gt;Cernat, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, poet [[George Bacovia]] began attending the literary circle, and gave a reading of his celebrated ''[[Plumb (Bacovia)|Plumb]]'' poem, being welcomed by Macedonski with a flattering epigram.&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.12"&gt;Anghelescu, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski's series of short-lived periodicals resumed in 1905, when he founded ''Le Beau Danube Bleu'' (French for "The Beautiful Blue Danube") and ''Liga Conservatoare'' ("The Conservative League").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.376-377&lt;/ref&gt; He registered more success in 1906, when his ''Thalassa'' was published, as ''Le Calvaire de feu'', by [[Edward Sansot]]'s Paris-based publishing house.&lt;ref name="cmmareroman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.12; Boia, p.245; Sandqvist, p.383; Vianu, Vol.II, p.371, 377, 436-440&lt;/ref&gt; This followed intense self-promotion within the French literary environment, as well as advertisements in the French press.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.197; Vianu, Vol. II, p.376-377&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this involved Macedonski sending his book to be reviewed by [[Émile Faguet]], [[Jean Mounet-Sully]], [[Joséphin Péladan]], [[Pierre Quillard]] and [[Jean Richepin]], who replied with what Vianu deems "the politeness of circumstance."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.377. See also Suciu, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The volume was nonetheless favorably reviewed by the prestigious magazines ''Mercure de France'' and ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]''.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol. II, p.438-439"&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.438-439&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1906, ''[[La Revue Musicale]]'' published his interview with Combarieu, through which the latter aimed to verify supposed connections between literary inspiration and musical sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.341&lt;/ref&gt; By 1907, he was concentrating on experiments in physics, and eventually publicized his claim to have discovered that light does not travel through [[vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.12; Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.377-378&lt;/ref&gt; He sent a paper on astronomy subjects to be reviewed by the [[Société Astronomique de France]], of which he subsequently became a member.&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.12"/&gt; The same year, he drafted the plan for a [[world government]], announcing that he had found sympathy for the cause throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.523"/&gt; Macedonski also introduced himself to an [[Italophone]] public, when two of his [[sonnet]]s were published by ''[[Poezia (magazine)|Poesia]]'', the magazine of [[Futurism|Futurist]] theorist [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.88-89; Sandqvist, p.200, 235, 383. Cernat gives the date as 1909, while Sandqvist mentions 1895 and 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1910 and 1912, Macedonski was again in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.12-13; Călinescu, p.522; Vianu, Vol.II, p.377-379; Vol.III, p.352&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to withdraw himself from Romania's public life due to what he perceived as injustice,&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.III, p.352"&gt;Vianu, Vol.III, p.352&lt;/ref&gt; he had by then completed work on the French-language [[tragicomedy]] ''Le Fou?'' ("The Madman?"), which was only published after his death.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.378-379&lt;/ref&gt; He was actively seeking to establish his reputation in [[Theatre of France|French theater]], reading his new play to a circle which included [[Louis de Gonzague Frick]] and [[Florian-Parmentier]], while, at home, newspapers reported rumors that his work was going to be staged by [[Sarah Bernhardt]]'s company.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.378-379, 467&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts were largely fruitless, and, accompanied by his son Alexis, the poet left France, spent some time in Italy, and eventually returned to Romania.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.379"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.379&lt;/ref&gt; Passing through the [[German Empire]], he learned of Ion Luca Caragiale's sudden death, and wrote ''[[Adevărul]]'' daily an [[open letter]], which showed that he had come to revise his stance, notably comparing the deceased author's style and legacy to those of [[Mark Twain]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.374-375&lt;/ref&gt;

During Macedonski's absence, his style and work had come to be reviewed more positively, in particular by the young authors [[I. Dragoslav]], [[Horia Furtună]], [[Ion Pillat]], [[Anastasie Mândru]], [[Al. T. Stamatiad]], as well as by post-''Junimist'' critic [[Mihail Dragomirescu]], who offered Macedonski a good reception in his ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.379-380; Vol.III, p.350-353&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor Vianu, who cites contemporary statements by Dragoslav, concludes that, upon arrival, Macedonski was enthusiastically received by a public who had missed him.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.379"/&gt; Also in 1912, one of his poems was published as an homage by ''[[Simbolul]]'', a magazine published by the young and radical Symbolists [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Ion Vinea]] and [[Marcel Janco]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49; Sandqvist, p.75, 384&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Macedonski also collaborated with the [[Iași]]-based moderate Symbolist magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.684; Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Polemics surrounding his case nevertheless continued: in late 1912, as part of a National Theater adaptation of [[Alphonse Daudet]]'s ''[[Sapho (novel)|Sapho]]'', actor [[Cazimir Belcot]] borrowed from Macedonski's appearance and mannerisms to portray a failure.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.381"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.381&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return and World War I years===
Macedonski and his protégés had become regular frequenters of Bucharest cafés. Having a table permanently reserved for him at Imperial Hotel's [[Kübler Coffeehouse]],&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.118, 120, 199&lt;/ref&gt; he was later a presence in two other such establishments: High-Life&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terasa Oteteleșanu]].&lt;ref name="micafene"&gt;Mioara Ioniță, "Cafenele de altădată. Terasa Oteteleșanu", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have spent part of his time at Kübler loudly mocking the traditionalist poets who gathered at an opposite table.&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the poet's literary club, set up at his house in [[Dorobanți]] quarter, had come to resemble a [[Mysticism|mystical]] circle, over which he held magisterial command. Vianu, who visited the poet together with Pillat, compares this atmosphere with those created by other "mystics and magi of poetry" (citing as examples [[Joséphin Péladan]], [[Louis-Nicolas Ménard]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Stefan George]]).&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.III, p.352"/&gt; The hall where seances were hosted was only lit by candles, and the tables were covered in red fabric.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.III, p.352&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski himself was seated on a throne designed by Alexis, and adopted a dominant pose.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.522-523; Sandqvist, p.25, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent secrecy and the [[initiation rite]]s performed on new members were purportedly inspired by [[Rosicrucianism]] and the [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;Krasztev, "From a Deadlocked Present...", p.42-43; Sandqvist, p.199-200&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Macedonski was rewarding his followers' poems with false [[gemstone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Cernat, p.43; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.25, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet founded ''Revista Critică'' ("The Critical Review"), which again closed after a short while, and issued the poetry volume ''[[Flori sacre]]'' ("Sacred Flowers").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.380-381&lt;/ref&gt; Grouping his ''Forța Morală'' poems and older pieces, it was dedicated to his new generation of followers, whom Macedonski's preface referred to as "the new Romania."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.380&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to hope that ''Le Fou?'' was going to be staged in France, especially after he received some encouragement in the form of articles in ''Mercure de France'' and ''Journal des Débats'', but was confronted with the general public's indifference.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.381"/&gt; In 1914, ''Thalassa'' was published in a non-definitive version by [[Constantin Banu]]'s magazine ''[[Flacăra]]'',&lt;ref name="cmmareroman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.13; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382, 440; Vol.III, p.353&lt;/ref&gt; which sought to revive overall interest in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.690&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[French Red Cross]] conference in September, Macedonski paid his final public homage to France, which had just become entangled in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in 1914 that Macedonski commissioned for print his very first [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]] and completed work on a tragedy play about [[Renaissance]] poet [[Dante Aligheri]]—known as ''La Mort de Dante'' in its French original, and ''Moartea lui Dante'' in the secondary Romanian version (both meaning "Dante's Death").&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.13; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382&lt;/ref&gt; The aging poet was by then building connections with the [[Art of Romania|local art scene]]: together with artist [[Alexandru Severin]], he created (and probably presided over) ''Cenaclul idealist'' ("The [[Idealism|Idealist]] Club"), which included Symbolist artists and was placed under the honorary patronage of King Carol.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marian Constantin, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Visuri-si-himere*articleID_21773-articles_details.html "Visuri și himere"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 474, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

1916 was also the year when Romania abandoned her neutrality and, under a National Liberal government, rallied with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. During the neutrality period, Macedonski had shed his lifelong Francophilia to join the [[Germanophile]]s, who wanted to see Romanian participation on the [[Central Powers]]' side.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103, 104, 245-248; Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382-383&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, he issued the journal ''Cuvântul Meu'' ("My Word"). Entirely written by him,&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.13"&gt;Anghelescu, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; it published ten consecutive issues before going bankrupt, and notably lashed out against France for being "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" and "lawyer-filled", demanding from Romania not to get involved in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.245-246; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators and researchers of his work have declared themselves puzzled by this change in allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.245-247; Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.382&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonski further alienated public opinion during the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]], when the Central Powers armies entered southern Romania and [[Battle of Bucharest|occupied Bucharest]]. Alexis was drafted and became a war artist,&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe Nicolescu, "Imortalizînd eroii de la Mărășești, Mărăști, Oituz", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', August 1977, p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; but Macedonski Sr, who received formal protection from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest]],&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; chose to stay behind while the authorities and many ordinary citizens relocated to [[Iași]], where resistance was still being organized. His stance was interpreted as [[collaborationism]] by his critics. However, Macedonski reportedly faced extreme poverty throughout the occupation.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.246; Cernat, p.45; Vianu, Vol.II, p.383&lt;/ref&gt; Having by then begun to attend the circle of [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], his promoter and fellow Germanophile, he was once rewarded by the latter with a turkey filled with gold coins.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late polemics, illness and death===
[[File:Mormant Macedonski.jpg|thumb|Macedonski's grave in [[Bellu Cemetery|Bellu]]]]

''Literatorul'' resumed print in June 1918, once Romania capitulated to the Central Powers under the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.383-384&lt;/ref&gt; A controversial incident occurred soon afterwards, when, going against the counsel of his friend and collaborator Stamatiad, Macedonski signed a ''Literatorul'' article where the German military administrator [[August von Mackensen]], who was about to lead his troops out of Romania, was presented in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.383-384, 387. See also Boia, p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt; In a manner deemed "excessive" by historian [[Lucian Boia]], the Romanian writer was paying homage not just to Mackensen, but also, indirectly, to [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] and the ''[[German Army (German Empire)|Reichsheer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after reading the piece, [[Romanian Academy]] member and fellow Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]] withdrew his own nomination of Macedonski for an Academy seat.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.384"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.384&lt;/ref&gt; During summer, Macedonski also joined the group of public figures who saluted the senior Conservative Germanophile [[Petre P. Carp]] (deeming Carp "the veteran of character, honesty and Romanianism"), and, in September, joined [[Ioan Slavici]] and [[Gala Galaction]] as a contributor to the occupation magazine ''Rumänien in Wort und Bild'', where he prophesied an [[Francophobia|anti-French]] "political renaissance" of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandru Macedonski faced problems after the Romanian government resumed its control over Bucharest, and during the early years of [[Greater Romania]]. What followed the Mackensen article, Vianu claims, was Macedonski's ''bellum contra omnes'' ("war against all").&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.384"/&gt; However, the poet made efforts to accommodate himself with the triumphal return of the Iași authorities: in December 1918, ''Literatorul'' celebrated the extension of Romanian rule "from the [[Tisza]] to the [[Dniester]]" as a success of the National Liberals, paying homage to Francophile political leaders [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] and [[Take Ionescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski also envisaged running in the [[Romanian general election, 1918|1918 election]] for a seat in the new [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] (which was supposed to vote a document to replace the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]] as the organic law), but never registered his candidature.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.384&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vianu, he had intended to create a [[joke political party]], the "intellectual group", whose other member was an unnamed coffeehouse acquaintance of his.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.392&lt;/ref&gt; ''Literatorul'' was revived for a final time in 1919.&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.13"/&gt;

His health deteriorated from [[heart disease]], which is described by Vianu as an effect of constant smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.393. See also Suciu, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; By that stage, Vianu recalls, Macedonski also had problems coming to terms with his age.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.472-473&lt;/ref&gt; His last anthumous work was the pamphlet ''Zaherlina'' (named after the Romanian version of "[[Zacherlin]]"; also known as ''Zacherlina'' or ''Zacherlina în continuare'', "Zacherlin Contd."), completed in 1919 and published the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.13; Vianu, Vol.II, p.384&lt;/ref&gt; It notably attacked Densusianu, who had become Macedonski's personal enemy.&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.13"/&gt; Some other polemical texts he had authored late in life saw print only after his death, under the title ''Mustrări postume către o generație neînțelegătoare'' ("Posthumous Reprimands for an Obtuse Generation").&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;

1920 was also the year when the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] cabinet attempted to pension him off from his office at the Historical Monuments Commission, but the publicized protest of Macedonski's fellow writers in Bucharest made it reconsider.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.384"/&gt; Confined to his home by illness and old age, Macedonski was still writing poems, some of which later known as his ''Ultima verba'' ("Last Words").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.384-385&lt;/ref&gt; The writer died on November 24, at three o'clock in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.385&lt;/ref&gt; Having come to develop an addiction to floral fragrances, he was inhaling a rose petal extract during his last hours.&lt;ref name="aonarco22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523. According to Călinescu, the poet's last word was ''rozele'' ("the roses").&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Bucharest's [[Bellu Cemetery|Bellu]].&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;

==Work==

===General characteristics===
[[File:Macedonski Noaptea de maiu.png|thumb|250px|Macedonski's manuscript for ''Noaptea de mai'' (in or around 1887)]]

Although Alexandru Macedonski frequently changed his style and views on literary matters, a number of constants have been traced throughout his work. Thus, a common perception is that his literature had a strongly visual aspect, the notion being condensed in [[Cincinat Pavelescu]]'s definition of Macedonski: "Poet, therefore painter; painter, therefore poet."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.409"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.409&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traian Demetrescu]] too recalled that his mentor had been dreaming of becoming a visual artist, and had eventually settled for turning his son Alexis into one.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.409"/&gt; This pictorial approach to writing created parallels between Macedonski and his traditionalist contemporaries [[Vasile Alecsandri]] and [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.318, 569; Vianu, Vol.III, p.40, 451&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the tenets of [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] and [[Théophile Gautier]], the writer repeatedly called for purity in [[Meter (poetry)|versification]], and upheld it as an essential requirement,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.242, 516, 523-524, 683&lt;/ref&gt; while progressively seeking to verify the quality of his poetry through [[phonaesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.28-29&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of Macedonski's style is his inventive use of [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Initially influenced by [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]'s introduction of Italian-based words to the [[Romanian lexis]], Macedonski himself later infused poetic language with a large array of neologisms from several [[Romance languages|Romance]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.415-416, 459-460&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Vianu notes, Macedonski had a tendency for comparing nature with the artificial, the result of this being a "document" of his values.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.450-451&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski's language alternated neologisms with [[Barbarism (modern linguistics)|barbarisms]], many of which were coined by him personally.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.525; Sandqvist, p.200; Vianu, Vol.II, p.451&lt;/ref&gt; They include ''claviculat'' ("[[clavicle]]d", applied to a shoulder), ''împălăriată'' ("enhatted", used to define a crowd of hat-wearing tourists),&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.451&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ureichii'' (instead of ''urechii'', "to the ear" or "of the ear").&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.525"&gt;Călinescu, p.525&lt;/ref&gt; His narratives nevertheless take an interest in recording direct speech, used as a method of characterization.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.449-450, 456&lt;/ref&gt; However, Călinescu criticizes Macedonski for using a language which, "although grammatically correct [...], seems to have been learned only recently", as well as for not following other Romanian writers in creating a lasting poetic style.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.525"/&gt;

The writer's belief in the effects of sheer willpower, notably present in his comments on [[Esotericism|esoteric]] subjects, was itself a defining characteristic of his perspective on literature. In 1882, he wrote about progression in one's career: "We are all poets at birth, but only those who shape themselves through study will become poets."&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.524; Vianu, Vol.II, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu, who notes Macedonski's "exclusivity" and "fanaticism", places such statements in connection with Macedonski's personal ambition, "pride" and "the willingness to carry out ventured actions [...], in stated opposition with the entire surrounding and with contempt for the foreseeable reaction."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.387-388&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all periods of Macedonski's work reflect, in whole or in part, his public persona and the polemics he was involved in. George Călinescu's emits a verdict on the relation between his lifetime notoriety and the public's actual awareness of his work: "Macedonski [was] a poet well-known for being an unknown poet."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.521"/&gt; According to literary critic [[Matei Călinescu]], the innovative aspects of his impact on [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] were not as much related to his "literary ideology", as much as to his "contradictory spirit" and "essential nonconformism".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.11"/&gt; However, literary researcher [[Adrian Marino]] proposes that Macedonski was one of the first modern authors to illustrate the importance of "[[dialectic]] unity" through his views on art, in particular by having argued that poetry needed to be driven by "an idea".&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Having theorized once, while questioning ''Junimist'' rigor, that "the logic of poetry is ''absurdity'' itself [italics in the original]",&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.516. Paraphrased by Sandqvist, p.197, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; the poet also said: "Poetry is the chaos of spirit and matter, of the cries of distress and mad laughter. From the sublime to the trivial, that is what it should be."&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.152. Paraphrased by Sandqvist, p.25, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; He later revised part of this verdict, and, making explicit his adoption of [[aestheticism]], spoke against trivial subjects and in favor of the sublime.&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.200"&gt;Sandqvist, p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

While Macedonski also discarded the concept of "social poetry" not long after postulating it, its spirit, Tudor Vianu believes, can still be found in his later contributions. This, the critic notes, was owed to his "social temperament", whose "fundamental experience is that of the social."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.402&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing this sociable and extrovert character, other critics see in the poet's life and work the imprint of "[[quixotism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.140; Cernat, p.8, 16; Sandqvist, p.200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arteodo"&gt;Alexandru Ruja, chronological table, in [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]], ''Tămâie și otravă'', [[Editura de Vest]], Timișoara, 1994, p.14-15.  {{ISBN|973-36-0165-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Vianu, this contrasted with Macedonski's failures in communicating with the public, an experience which made him "[[Misanthropy|misanthropic]]" and contributed to his ultimate vision of death as freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.137; Vianu, Vol.II, p.403-406, 434-435&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] concluded: "Macedonski could not resign; his one martyrdom was for Art, as the sole liberation from a tormented life."&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have defined the poet's perspective on life as a result of "[[neurosis]]".&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.200"/&gt;

In Vianu's perspective, Macedonski's stance is dominated by a mixture of [[nostalgia]], [[sensuality]], lugubrious-grotesque imagery, and "the lack of bashfulness for antisocial sentiments" which compliments his [[sarcasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.404-405&lt;/ref&gt; In respect to the latter characteristic, Vianu notes "no one in Romanian literature has laughed the same way as Macedonski",&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.137; Vianu, Vol.II, p.405&lt;/ref&gt; whereas critic [[Ștefan Cazimir]] argues: "[Macedonski was] lacking the sense of relativity in principles, and implicitly a sense of humor." Cazimir adds: "Only when he aged did [Macedonski] learn to smile".&lt;ref name="stcantxvii"&gt;[[Ștefan Cazimir]], preface to ''Antologia umorului liric'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1977, p.XVII.  {{OCLC|251657588}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Călinescu himself believes Macedonski to have been "fundamentally a spiritual man with lots of humor", speculating that he was able to see the "uselessness" of his own scientific ventures.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.523"/&gt;

Critics note that, while Macedonski progressed from one stage to the other, his work fluctuated between artistic accomplishment and mediocrity.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523-524, 525-526, 527, 528; Vianu, Vol.II, p.393, 394, 480-481&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor Vianu believes "failure in reaching originality" and reliance on "soppy-conventional attributes of the day" to be especially evident wherever Macedonski tried to emulate [[epic poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.394&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that Macedonski's love-themed pieces "cannot be listed among [his] most fortunate".&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.398"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.398&lt;/ref&gt; At his best, commentators note, he was one of the Romanian literature's classics.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.393-394&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski is thus perceived as the author second only to Eminescu, and as his ideal counterpart—a relation Vianu describes as "the internal [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] [confronting] two [[Lares|familiar gods]]".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.III, p.353-354&lt;/ref&gt; Various critics have compared Eminescu's poetic discourse with that of the Symbolist leader, concluding that the two poets often display very similar attitudes.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.24, 27-28; Călinescu, p.518, 524, 526&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu writes that, while Macedonski's work is largely inferior to that of his ''Junimist'' rival, it forms the best "reply" ever conceived within their common setting.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.527"&gt;Călinescu, p.527&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prima verba'' and other early works===
With [[Ion Catina]], [[Vasile Păun]] and [[Grigore H. Grandea]], young Macedonski belonged to late Romanian [[Romanticism]], part of a [[Neo-romanticism|Neoromantic]] generation which had for its mentors Heliade Rădulescu and Bolintineanu.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.388, 479-480&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences were [[Pierre-Jean de Béranger]] and [[Gottfried August Bürger]], together with [[Romanian folklore]], motifs from them being adapted by Macedonski into [[pastoral]]s and [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]s of ca. 1870-1880.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.394-395, 397&lt;/ref&gt; The imprint of Romanticism and such other sources was evident in ''[[Prima verba]]'', which groups pieces that Macedonski authored in his early youth, the earliest of them being written when he was just twelve.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.344"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.344&lt;/ref&gt; Critics generally argue that the volume is without value.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.344&lt;/ref&gt; The poems display his rebellious attitude, [[self-victimization]] and strong reliance on autobiographical elements, centering on such episodes as the death of his father.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.344"/&gt; In one piece inspired by the ideology of Heliade Rădulescu, Vianu notes, Macedonski sings "the [[French Revolution]]'s love for freedom and equality, otherwise proclaimed from his nobleman's perspective."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.343"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.343&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Când acum poporul vedem că studiază
Să nu avem ură când se luminează,
Ca frați să-l iubim!}}&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.343"/&gt;
|
Now that we see the people studying
Let us not be hating them while they grow enlightened,
Let us love them like brothers!}}

In parallel, Macedonski used [[Erotic literature|erotic themes]], completing a series which, although written on the model of idylls, is noted for its brute details of sexual exploits. The poet probably acknowledged that posterity would reject them, and did not republish them in any of his collected poetry volumes.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.398"/&gt;

During his time at ''Oltul'' (1873–1875), Macedonski published a series of poems, most of which were not featured in definitive editions of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.345-346&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[ode]]s written in the Italian-based version of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], it includes lyrics which satirize [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] without mentioning his name.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.346"/&gt; Following his arrest, Macedonski also completed ''Celula mea de la Văcărești'' ("My Cell in Văcărești"), which shows his attempt to joke about the situation.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.347"/&gt; In contrast to this series, some of the pieces written during Macedonski's time in the [[Budjak]] and [[Northern Dobruja]] display a detachment from contemporary themes. At that stage, he was especially inspired by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], whom Vianu calls "the sovereign poet of [Macedonski's] youth."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.349"/&gt; In ''Calul arabului'', Macedonski explores [[Exoticism|exotic]] and [[Levant]]ine settings, using symbols which announce [[George Coșbuc]]'s ''[[El-Zorab]]'',&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.348" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt; and the [[Venice|Venetian]]-themed ''Ithalo'', which centers on episodes of betrayal and murder.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.349"/&gt; Others were epic and [[patriotism|patriotic]] in tone, with subjects such as Romanian victories in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] or the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] sites along the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.348, 349, 395-398&lt;/ref&gt; One of these pieces, titled ''Hinov'' after the village and stone quarry in [[Rasova]], gives Macedonski a claim to being the first modern European poet to have used [[free verse]], ahead of the French Symbolist [[Gustave Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol.II, p.349&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski himself later voiced the claim, and referred to such a technique as "symphonic verse", "proteic verse", or, in honor of composer [[Richard Wagner]], "Wagnerian verse".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.525; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.7, 152; Sandqvist, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

While editing ''Oltul'', Macedonski also completed his first prose writings. These were the [[Travel writing|travel account]] ''Pompeia și Sorento'' ("Pompeia and Sorento", 1874) and a prison-themed story described by Vianu as "a tearjerker", titled ''Câinele din Văcărești'' ("The Dog in Văcărești", 1875).&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.419&lt;/ref&gt; These were later complemented by other travel works, which critic [[Mihai Zamfir]] likens to the verbal experiments of [[Impressionist literature]], pioneering in the Romanian [[prose poetry]] genre.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; The short comedy ''Gemenii'' was his debut work for the stage, but, according to Vianu, failed to show any merit other than a "logical construction" and a preview into Macedonski's use of sarcasm.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.452"/&gt; These writings were followed in 1876 by a concise biography of [[Cârjaliul]], an early 19th-century [[hajduk]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.419-420&lt;/ref&gt; In line with his first Levant-themed poems, Macedonski authored the 1877 story ''Așa se fac banii'' ("This Is How Money Is Made", later retold in French as ''Comment on devient riche et puissant'', "How to Become Rich and Powerful"), a [[fable]] of [[fatalism]] and the [[Muslim world]]—it dealt with two brothers, one hard-working and one indolent, the latter of whom earns his money through a series of serendipitous events.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.420, 434&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, his [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse comedy]] ''Iadeș!'' borrowed its theme from the widely circulated collection of [[Persian literature]] known as ''Sindipa''.&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453&lt;/ref&gt; The setting was however modern, and, as noted by French-born critic [[Frédéric Damé]], the plot also borrowed much from [[Émile Augier]]'s ''Gabrielle'' and from other [[morality play]]s of the period.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.452-453" /&gt; Part of the text was an ironic treatment of youth in [[liberal profession]]s, an attitude which Macedonski fitted in his emerging anti-[[bourgeois]] discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.454-455&lt;/ref&gt;

With the first poems in his ''[[Nights (Macedonski)|Nights]]'' cycle, Macedonski still showed his allegiance to Romanticism, and in particular to [[Alphonse de Lamartine]],&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.398"/&gt; and the supposed inventor of this theme, [[Alfred de Musset]].&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.16-18, 24-25; Călinescu, p.524; Suciu, p.105-106&lt;/ref&gt; ''Noaptea de noiembrie'' opens with a violent condemnation of his adversaries, and sees Macedonski depicting his own funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is commended by Călinescu, who notes that, in contrast to the "apparently trivial beginning", the main part, where Macedonski depicts himself in flight over the [[Danube]], brings the Romanian writer close to the accomplishments of [[Dante Aligheri]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.528"&gt;Călinescu, p.528&lt;/ref&gt; The writer himself claimed that the piece evidenced "the uttermost breath of inspiration I have ever felt in my life."&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Another poem, ''Noaptea de aprilie'' ("April Night"), was probably his testimony of [[unrequited love]] for [[Aristizza Romanescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism and Naturalism===
By the 1880s, Macedonski developed and applied his "social poetry" theory, as branch of [[Literary realism|Realism]]. Explained by the writer himself as a reaction against the legacy of Lamartine,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523; Vianu, Vol.II, p.398-399&lt;/ref&gt; it also signified his brief affiliation with the [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] current, a radical segment of the Realist movement. [[Traian Demetrescu]] thus noted that Macedonski cherished the works of French Naturalists and Realists such as [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[Émile Zola]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.389, 421. See also Suciu, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, Macedonski made known his sympathy for the disinherited, from girls forced into prostitution to convicts sentenced to [[penal labor]] on salt mines, and also spoke out against the conventionalism of [[civil marriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.524; Vianu, Vol.II, p.398-402&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Ocnele'' ("The Salt Mines") includes the verdict:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Vai! Ce-am convenit cu toții a numi soțietate
Mult mai demnă ca tâlharii e de-acest cumplit locaș!
Statul e o ficțiune, iar dreptatea—strâmbătate,
Care duce omenirea dintr-un hop într-un făgaș.}}&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.400&lt;/ref&gt;
|
Alas! What we have all agreed to deem society
Is far more suited than bandits are for this terrible dwelling!
State is fiction, and justice—an injustice
That leads humanity from a bump down into a rut.}}

Naturalist depiction was also the main element in his prose pieces of the early 1880s. Among them was the first of several [[Sketch story|sketch stories]] using [[still life]] techniques, ''Casa cu nr. 10''&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.420-421, 425-426&lt;/ref&gt; (according to Zamfir, a prime sample of Macedonski's "ornamental" genre).&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; With ''Între cotețe'', ''Dramă banală'' and later ''Cometa lui Odorescu'' ("Odorescu's Comet"), Macedonski speaks about his own biography.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.426-427&lt;/ref&gt; The former has for a protagonist Pandele Vergea, a thirty-five-year-old man who is consumed by an [[Aviculture|avicultural]] obsession, who dreams of turning into a bird, and who is eventually maimed by his overcrowded fowls.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.427-429&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Dereanu is a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] university student, possessed by dreams of military and political glory, and who meditates about his future in front of Heliade Rădulescu's statue or in Bucharest cafés.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.429-430&lt;/ref&gt; Also a bohemian, Odorescu announces his discovery of a comet, before being proved wrong by his aunt, an ordinary woman.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.430&lt;/ref&gt; Some pieces also double as [[memoir]]s: in ''Dramă banală'', the plot revolves around Macedonski's recollection of the 1866 plebiscite.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.423" /&gt; Vianu draws attention to the [[picturesque]] depiction of [[History of Bucharest|historic Bucharest]], a contributing element in ''Cometa...'', ''Casa cu nr. 10'' and ''Între cotețe''.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.425-426, 430, 432-433&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Unchiașul Sărăcie'' (also written in verse), Macedonski took Naturalist tenets into the field of drama. Frédéric Damé believed it an imitation of a play by [[Ernest d'Hervilly]] and [[Alfred Grévin]], but, Vianu argues, the Romanian text was only loosely based on theirs: in Macedonski's adaptation, the theme became [[fairy tale]]-like, and used a speech style based on [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.455-456&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of its completion, Macedonski was also working on a similarly loose adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', which notably had the two protagonists die in each other's arms.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.457-458&lt;/ref&gt; Another such play is ''3 decemvrie'' ("December 3"), which partly retells [[Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias Werner]]'s ''Der 24 Februar'' using Naturalist devices.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.459-462&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the homage-play ''Cuza-Vodă'' is mainly a Romantic piece, where [[Alexander John Cuza]] finds his political mission validated by legendary figures in [[History of Romania|Romanian history]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.462"/&gt;

In parallel, Macedonski was using poetry to carry out his polemics. In an 1884 [[epigram]], he reacted against Alecsandri's ''[[Fântâna Blanduziei]]'', but, in Vianu's definition, "his regular causticity seems to be restrained."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.353"/&gt; The piece he had earlier written, presumably against Eminescu, scandalized the public by mocking the rival's mental ruin:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Un X... pretins poet—acum
S-a dus pe cel mai jalnic drum...
L-aș plânge dacă-n balamuc
Destinul său n-ar fi mai bun
Căci până ieri a fost năuc
Și nu e azi decât nebun.}}&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.354. Partly rendered in Perpessicus, p.352&lt;/ref&gt;
|
An X... who calls himself a poet—has now
Gone down that most pathetic road...
I'd cry for him if in bedlam
His fate were not one for the best
As up to yesterday he had been dopey
And now he is merely insane.}}

According to Tudor Vianu, Macedonski was mostly motivated by his disappointment in ''Junimea'', and in particular by Eminescu's response to his public persona. Vianu contends that, although Macedonski "never was familiar with the resigned and patient attitudes", he was "by no means an evil man."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.358&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, the poet defended himself against criticism, noting that the epigram had not been specifically addressed to Eminescu, but had been labeled as such by the press, and claiming to have authored it years before its ''Literatorul'' edition.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.359-360. According to Vianu, Macedonski also stated that poet [[Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu]] had published the piece without his knowledge, because he liked it and had learned it by heart. Novelist [[I. Peltz]] later claimed that Teleormăneanu was the poem's real author: {{ro icon}} [[Al. Săndulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/i._peltz_memorialist "I. Peltz memorialist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 35/2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the later piece ''Viața de apoi'' ("The Afterlife") still displays resentments he harbored toward Eminescu.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.357&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1880-1884, particularly after the Eminescu scandal, Macedonski envisaged prioritizing French as his language of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.11; Vianu, Vol.II, p.361, 362&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vianu, Macedonski had traversed "the lowest point" of his existence, and had been subject to "one of the most delicate mysteries of poetic creation."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.363" /&gt; Among his pieces of the period is the French-language [[sonnet]] ''Pârle, il me dit alors'' ("Speak, He Then Said to Me"), where, Vianu notes, "one discovers the state of mind of a poet who decides to expatriate himself."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.361"/&gt;

===Adoption of Symbolism===
[[File:Fleurs-du-mal ame du vin schlussvignette.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Carlos Schwabe]]'s ''Âme du vin'' ("Soul of the Wine"), illustration for [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'']]

According to Mihai Zamfir, at the end of his transition from the "mimetic and egocentric" verse to Symbolist poetry, Macedonski emerged a "remarkable, often extraordinary" author.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; In the early 20th century, fellow poet and critic [[N. Davidescu]] described Macedonski, [[Ion Minulescu]] and other Symbolists from [[Wallachia]] as distinct from their [[Moldavia]]n counterparts in both style and themes.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.17. Cernat notes that the same view is held by Vianu.&lt;/ref&gt; Endorsing the theory and practice of Symbolism for much of his life, Macedonski retrospectively claimed to have been one of its first exponents.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.525; Cernat, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; His version of Symbolism, critic [[Paul Cernat]] notes, clashed with that advocated by many of his contemporaries in that it rejected merit to the [[Decadent movement]], and represented the "decorative" [[Aestheticism|aestheticist]] trend of [[Parnassianism|Paranassian]] spirit within the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist current]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.11-12, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Within ''Poezia viitorului'', Macedonski invoked as his models to follow some important or secondary Symbolist and Parnassian figures: [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Joséphin Péladan]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Jean Moréas]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.366&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of ''Bronzes'' for ''[[Mercure de France]]'', [[Pierre Quillard]] remarked the "irreproachable" technique, but criticized the poet for being too indebted to both Baudelaire and [[Charles Marie René Leconte de Lisle|Leconte de Lisle]];&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.371"/&gt; other Symbolist figures whom Macedonski is known to have borrowed from are [[José María de Heredia]]&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.526"&gt;Călinescu, p.526&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iwan Gilkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.413&lt;/ref&gt; While undergoing this transition, to what linguist Manuela-Delia Suciu argues is a mostly Parnassian phase,&lt;ref&gt;Suciu, p.107-109&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski was still referencing Naturalism, and considered it compatible with Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Krasztev, "From Modernization...", p.345&lt;/ref&gt;

With the adoption of such tenets came a succession of Symbolist poems, where the focus is on minutely-observed objects, usually items of luxury, partly reflecting themes he had explored in the Naturalist stage. Commenting on them, Tudor Vianu argues that no such works had ever been produced in Romanian literature up until that moment.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.410"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.410&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Ospățul lui Pentaur'' ("The Feast of [[Pentaur]]"), the poet reflected on civilization itself, as reflected in inanimate opulence.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.410"/&gt; The motif was also developed in descriptive prose fragments later grouped in ''Cartea de aur'', collectively titled ''nuvele fără oameni'' ("novellas without people") and compared by Călinescu with the paintings of [[Theodor Aman]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.318, 528&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during that stage, Macedonski was exploring the numerous links between Symbolism, [[mysticism]] and [[esotericism]]. Earlier pieces had already come to explore [[macabre]] themes characteristic for an early branch of Symbolism. Influenced by [[Maurice Rollinat]], they include the somber ''Vaporul morții'' ("The Ship of Death") and ''Visul fatal'' ("The Fatal Dream").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.363-364, 412&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the piece titled ''Imnul lui Satan'' ("Satan's Hymn") was placed by critics in connection with ''[[Les Litanies de Satan]]'' (part of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''), but, Vianu argues, the source of Macedonski's satanic themes may have been lodged in his own vision of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.407-408&lt;/ref&gt; This interest also reflected in his 1893 ''Saul'', where [[Cincinat Pavelescu]]'s contribution is supposedly minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.463&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing satanic themes, [[Ernest Legouvé]]'s dramatic version of the ''[[Medea]]'' myth (which Macedonski translated at some point in his life)&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.463-464&lt;/ref&gt; and the classical work of [[Jean Racine]],&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; it shows the dark powers of political conflict intervening between the eponymous king and his ''[[ephebos]]''-like protégé [[David]], the latter of whom turns out to be the agent of spiritual revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.464-467&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{lang|ro|Noaptea de august}}'' ("August Night"), outlines a [[Monism|monistic]] belief probably inspired by [[Rosicrucianism]], stressing the unity between soul and matter and depicting Macedonski's own journey into a transcendental space.&lt;ref&gt;Krasztev, "From a Deadlocked Present...", p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Following the examples of Baudelaire's ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', but also echoing his readings from [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Théophile Gautier]], Macedonski left poems dealing with [[narcotic]]s and [[substance abuse]], at least some of which reflected his personal experience with [[nicotine]] and possibly other unnamed drugs.&lt;ref name="aonarco22" /&gt; Also at that stage, Macedonski also began publishing the "instrumentalist" series of his Symbolist poems. This form of [[Experimental literature|experimental poem]] was influenced by the theories of [[René Ghil]]&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol.II, p.366, 413-415&lt;/ref&gt; and verified through his encounter with [[Remy de Gourmont]]'s views.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.413-415&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, it reaffirmed Macedonski's personal view that music and the spoken word were intimately related (a perspective notably attested by his 1906 interview with [[Jules Combarieu]]).&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.341-342"/&gt; Romanian critic [[Petre Răileanu]] theorized that such elements evidenced Macedonski's transition to "[[metaliterature]]".&lt;ref name="Sandqvist, p.200"/&gt; On a different level, they echoed an older influence, that of [[Gottfried August Bürger]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.526" /&gt;

===''Excelsior''===
Despite having stated his interest in innovation, Macedonski generally displayed a more conventional style in his ''[[Excelsior (Macedonski)|Excelsior]]'' volume. It included ''Noaptea de mai'', which Vianu sees as "one of the [vernacular's] most beautiful poems"&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.363" /&gt; and as evidence of "a clear joy, without any torment whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.408&lt;/ref&gt; A celebration of spring partly evoking folkloric themes, it was made famous by the recurring [[refrain]], ''Veniți: privighetoarea cântă și liliacul e-nflorit'' ("Come along: the nightingale is singing and the lilac is in blossom").&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Noaptea de mai'', ''Lewki'' (named after and dedicated to the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Snake Island]]), depicts intense joy, completed in this case by what Vianu calls "the restorative touch of nature."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.409"/&gt; The series also returned to [[Levant]] settings and [[Islam]]ic imagery, particularly in ''Acșam dovalar'' (named after the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] version of ''[[Witr]]'').&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt; Also noted within the volume is his short "Modern [[Psalms]]" series, including the piece ''Iertare'' ("Forgiveness"), which is addressed to God:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Iertare! Sunt ca orice om
M-am îndoit de-a ta putere,
Am râs de sfintele mistere
Ce sunt în fiecare-atom...
Iertare! Sunt ca orice om.}}&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.526"&gt;Călinescu, p.526&lt;/ref&gt;
|
Forgiveness! I'm like any man
I have been doubting your power
I derided the sacred mysteries
That lie within each of the atoms...
Forgiveness! I'm like any man.}}

''Excelsior'' also included ''Noaptea de ianuarie'' ("January Night"), which encapsulates one of his best-known political statements.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.21-22; Ornea, p.263; Vianu, Vol.II, p.368&lt;/ref&gt; Anghelescu reads it as a "meditation on disillusionment that culminates in a vitality-laden exhortation of action."&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Its anti-[[bourgeois]] attitude, literary historian [[Z. Ornea]] argues, was one of the meeting points between Macedonski and ''Junimism''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; In what is seen as its most acid section, the text notably reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|M-am născut în niște zile când tâmpita burghezime
Din tejghea făcând tribună, legiune de coțcari,
Pune-o talpă noroioasă pe popor și boierime,
Zile când se-mparte țara în călăi și în victime
Și când steagul libertății e purtat de cârciumari.}}&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.21; Vianu, Vol.II, p.368&lt;/ref&gt;
|
I was born into days when the moronic bourgeoisie
Turning counters into rostrums, a legion of knaves,
Places a muddy sole on the people and the boyars,
Days when the country is divided into hangmen and victims
And when the flag of liberty is carried by publicans.}}

At the same time as being engaged in his most violent polemics, Macedonski produced meditative and serene poems, which were later judged to be among his best. ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' is the synthesis of his main themes and influences, rated by commentators as his "masterpiece".&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.527; Vianu, Vol.II, p.410&lt;/ref&gt; Partly based on an earlier poem (''Meka'', named after the [[Mecca|Arab city]]),&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; it tells the story of an [[emir]], who, left unsatisfied by the shallow and opulent life he leads in [[Baghdad]], decides to leave on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]]. While critics agree that it is to be read as an [[allegory]] of Macedonski's biography, the ironic text does not make it clear whether the emir actually reaches his target, nor if the central [[metaphor]] of Mecca as a [[mirage]] means that the goal is not worth sacrificing for.&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.25-26, 30-31; Perpessicius, p.63; Sandqvist, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Mircea Anghelescu]] comments that Macedonski illustrates "unusual tension" by rigorously amplifying references to the color red, seen as a symbol of suffering,&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu notes that the sequence of lyrics has a studied "delirious" element, and illustrates this with the quote:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Și el e emirul, și toate le are...
E tânăr, e farmec, e trăsnet, e zeu,
Dar zilnic se simte furat de-o visare...
Spre Meka se duce cu gândul mereu,
Și-n fața dorinței—ce este—dispare
Iar el e emirul, și toate le are.}}&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.527"/&gt;
|
And he is the emir, and he owns each thing...
He's young, he's a charm, he's a bolt, he's a god,
But in each day he feels he is swept by a dream...
Towards Mecca his though races constantly,
And faced with the wish, all things disappear,
And he is the emir, and he owns each thing.}}

===Late prose works===
In prose, his focus shifted back to the purely descriptive, or led Alexandru Macedonski into the realm of [[fantasy literature]]. These stories, most of which were eventually collected in ''Cartea de aur'', include memoirs of his childhood in the [[Amaradia River (Dolj)|Amaradia]] region, nostalgic portrayals of the [[Oltenia]]n [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] environment, idealized depictions of Cuza's reign, as well as a retrospective view on the [[Slavery in Romania|end of Rom slavery]] (found in his piece ''Verigă țiganul'', "Verigă the Gypsy").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.422-424, 431-432&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known among them is ''Pe drum de poștă'', a [[third-person narrative]] and thinly disguised memoir, where the characters are an adolescent Alexandru Macedonski and his father, [[Alexandru D. Macedonski|General Macedonski]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.334, 424-425, 427&lt;/ref&gt; The idyllic outlook present in such stories is one of the common meeting points between his version of Symbolism and traditionalist authors such as [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.19; Vianu, Vol.II, p.431, 432&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu indicates the connection, but adds: "Macedonski descended, through memory, in the world of the village, with the tremor of regret for the peace and plenty of the old settlements, so well polished that each person, landowner as well as peasant, lived within a framework that nature itself seemed to have granted. [...] in depicting rural environments, Macedonski presents the point of view of a [[Conservatism|conservative]]."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.432&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu]]'', a fantasy novel and extended [[Prose poetry|prose poem]], was celebrated by Macedonski's disciple [[Oreste Georgescu]] as "the new religion of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.377&lt;/ref&gt; The volume carried the mocking dedication "To France, this [[Chaldea]]" (thought by Vianu to reference Péladan's views on the decay of civilization).&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.436"/&gt; It has affinities with writings by the Italian [[Decadent movement|Decadent]] author [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.528; Cernat, p.89; Vianu, Vol.II, p.436-437, 444&lt;/ref&gt; as well as echoes from [[Anatole France]].&lt;ref name="mds106"&gt;Suciu, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; The hero Thalassa, a Greek boy, works as a [[lighthouse]]-keeper on Snake Island, fantasizing about the [[golden age]] of mankind.&lt;ref name="cmmareroman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.440-441&lt;/ref&gt; His fate is changed by a shipwreck, during which a girl, Caliope, reaches the island's shore. Thalassa and Caliope fall in love, but are mysteriously unable to seal their union through sexual intercourse: the boy attributes this failure to the "curse" of human individuality. Seeking to achieve a perfect union with his lover, he eventually kills her and drowns himself in the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name="cmmareroman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.441-442; Suciu, p.106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for ''[[Mercure de France]]'', novelist [[Rachilde]] argued: "Very difficult to read, entirely developed in Symbolist manner [and] almost impossible to recount, obviously written in French but nevertheless obviously conceived by a Romanian (and what a spirited Romanian!)."&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol. II, p.438-439"/&gt; Rachilde believed the work to display "the fragrance of Oriental spices [...] rose marmalade and a slice of bear meat."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vianu, the book builds on Macedonski's earlier themes, replacing Naturalist observation with a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation about [[idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.442-444&lt;/ref&gt; One other aspect of Macedonski's stylistic exploration took him to attempt recording [[synesthesia]]. His manuscript is written in ink of several colors, which, he believed, was to help readers get a full sense of its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.525; Vianu, Vol. II, p.445&lt;/ref&gt; Like other synesthetic aspects of his novel, this is believed to have been inspired by the techniques of Baudelaire&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.199; Vianu, Vol. II, p.445&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.152; Sandqvist, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

''Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu'' is noted for its numerous cultural references, and especially for using a wide range of metaphors. Such aspects have been reviewed negatively by modern critics. Tudor Vianu writes: "the poet makes such waste of gemstones that we feel like saying some of them must be false",&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.444&lt;/ref&gt; while Călinescu, who notes that some fragments reveal "an incomparable artist" and "a professional metaphorist", notes that "in the end, such virtuosities become a bore."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.528" /&gt; According to Manuela-Delia Suciu, ''Thalassa'' is "prolix" and "too polished",&lt;ref name="mds106"/&gt; traits believed by Zamfir to be less irritating in the Romanian version.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; Critic Cornel Moraru found that, in the background, ''Thalassa'', a "great Symbolist novel", confronts [[Greek mythology|Ancient Greek]] and [[Christian mythology]], but "abuses" the religious vocabulary.&lt;ref name="cmmareroman"/&gt; Another part of the novel's imagery is [[Erotic literature|erotic]], and includes an elaborate and aestheticized description of male genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jurnalul.ro/index.php?section=rubrici&amp;article_id=35631 "Sex în scris, sex de scris!"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', October 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-act [[tragicomedy]] ''Le Fou?'' is seen by Vianu as comparable in subject matter and depth to ''[[Enrico IV]]'', a celebrated 1922 play by [[Luigi Pirandello]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.378, 470-471&lt;/ref&gt; The plot reflects Macedonski's confrontation with his critics, and his acceptance of the fact that people saw in him an eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.378, 467-468, 470, 472&lt;/ref&gt; The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] to the point where he sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with [[dissociative identity disorder]], Dorval does not actually imagine his life has become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.469-470&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see his take on life as a manifestation of genius.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.471&lt;/ref&gt; The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.529" /&gt; At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of [[capitalism]], and, using Parisian [[argot]], makes allusive references to famous people of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.471-472&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly during the 1890s, Macedonski was a follower of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and of [[Gothic fiction]] in general, producing a Romanian version of Poe's ''[[Metzengerstein]]'' story, urging his own disciples to translate other such pieces, and adopting "Gothic" themes in his original prose.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Carlson, "Poe in Romania", in Lois Vines (ed.), ''Poe Abroad. Influence, Reputation, Affinities'', [[University of Iowa Press]], Iowa City, 1999, p.77.  {{ISBN|0-87745-697-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indebted to [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]], Macedonski also wrote a number of [[science fiction]] stories, including the 1913 ''Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought'', which depicts civilization on the verge of a crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.421-421, 435-436&lt;/ref&gt; The gigantic commercial ship is maintained by a banker's union, and designed to grant travelers access to every pleasure imaginable; this causes the working-class inhabited cities on the continent to fall into a state of neglect and permanent violence, the climax of the story occurring with the bankers' decision to destroy their creation.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, 435-436&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought'' is noted for anticipating [[television]], the ship being equipped with electrically-operated "large and clear mirrors" that display "images from various parts of the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, 435&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski was by then interested in the development of cinema, and authored a [[silent film]] screenplay based on ''Comment on devient riche et puissant''.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.448&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final transition===
[[File:Frederic Leighton - Dante in Exile.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dante in Exile'', 1864 painting by [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]]]]

Late in his life, Macedonski had come to reject Symbolist tenets, defining them as "imbecilities" designed for "the uncultured".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.526" /&gt; ''Ultima verba'', the very last poems to be written by him, show him coming to terms with himself, and are treasured for their serene or intensely joyous vision of life and human accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.29-31; Călinescu, p.527; Vianu, Vol.II, p.385&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rondel (poem)|rondels]] written at this stage, known collectively as ''[[Poema rondelurilor]]'', are one of the first instances where the technique is used locally. Like those written previously by ''Literatorul''{{'}}s Pavelescu and [[Alexandru Obedenaru]], they are based on an earlier motif present in Macedonski's work, that of recurring refrains.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the pieces document the poet's final discoveries. One of them is ''Rondelul crinilor'' ("The Rondel of the Lilies"), which proclaims fragrances as the source of beatitude: ''În crini e beția cea rară'', "In lilies one finds that exceptional drunkenness".&lt;ref name="aonarco22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.527"/&gt; According to [[Ștefan Cazimir]], ''Rondelul orașului mic'' ("The Rondel of the Small Town") shows a "likable wave of irony and self-irony", and the poet himself coming to terms with "the existence of a world who ignores him."&lt;ref name="stcantxvii" /&gt; Proof of his combativeness was still to be found in ''Rondelul contimporanilor'' ("The Rondel of the Contemporaries").&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.473-474&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet's take on life is also outlined in his final play, ''Moartea lui Dante''. Călinescu writes that, by then, Macedonski was "obsessed" with the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.528"&gt;Călinescu, p.528&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski identifies with his hero, [[Dante Aligheri]], and formulates his own poetic testament while identifying [[World War I]] Romania with the medieval [[Republic of Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.13; Călinescu, p.523, 529; Vianu, Vol.II, p.474-479&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor Vianu remarks: "In Dante's great self-pride, Macedonski found his own."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.476&lt;/ref&gt; He sees the play as the best such work to have been produced by Macedonski,&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.478-479, 482&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Călinescu deems it "puerile".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.529"/&gt; Zamfir believes ''Moartea...'' to be a significant text in Macedonski's bibliography, "one of the first samples of Romanian Symbolist theater", and as such indebted mainly to Maeterlinck.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt; Vianu argues that the play may document the Romanian writer's late rejection of France, through the protagonist's statement: "the French are a gentle people, but their soul is different from mine."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.477&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of rondels show Macedonski's late fascination with the [[Far East]], China and Japan. George Călinescu believes that this is to be understood as one item in a large [[antithesis]], the other being Decadent Paris, which one rondel describes as "hell".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.528" /&gt; The Orient, viewed as the space of serenity, is believed by Macedonski to be peopled by toy-like women and absent [[opium]]-smokers, and to be kept orderly by a stable [[meritocracy]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.528" /&gt; The Chinese-themed poem ''Tsing-Ly-Tsi'', which Cazimir notes for its discreet, "almost imperceptible", humor, reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Tsing-Ly-Tsi stă-n prispa de-aur,
Cu ochi mici ca de ghierlan,
Sub de-argint frunzos tezaur,
Casa e de porțelan.}}&lt;ref name="stcantxvii" /&gt;
|
Tsing-Ly-Tsi sits on the golden porch,
With his eyes as small as those of mice,
Under the silvery, leafy, treasure,
His house is porcelain-like.}}

===Macedonski's school and its early impact===
[[File:Alexandru Macedonski, Alexis &amp; Oreste Georgescu.JPG|thumb|250px|Alexandru Macedonski (seated, to the right) facing [[Oreste Georgescu]]. [[Alexis Macedonski]] standing]]

Alexandru Macedonski repeatedly expressed the thought that, unlike his contemporaries, posterity would judge him a great poet.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.519, 520-521, 523, 527, 529; Vianu, Vol.III, p.434-435&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of [[Mihail Dragomirescu]], conservative literary critics tended to ignore Macedonski while he was alive. The first such figure was ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[Titu Maiorescu]], who believed him to be a minor author, referring to him only a couple of times in his books and usually ridiculing him in his articles.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.407, 412; Ornea, p.117; Vianu, Vol.II, p.243, 356&lt;/ref&gt; One of these texts, the 1886 essay ''Poeți și critici'' ("Poets and Critics"), spoke of Macedonski as having "vitiated" poetry, a notion he also applied to [[Constantin D. Aricescu]] and [[Aron Densușianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Especially radical pronouncements were left by the traditionalist authors [[Ilarie Chendi]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]]. Chendi wrote of Macedonski being "the caricature of a man", having "a feverish mind" and being motivated by "the brutal instinct of revenge".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.391. According to Călinescu (p.638): "Chendi lacks even the faintest intuition of Macedonski's poetry."&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga, who became better known as a historian, later retracted some of the statements he had made against the poet during the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.15"/&gt; Among the younger prominent traditionalist writers was the [[Transylvania]]n-born [[Lucian Blaga]], who may have purposefully avoided Macedonski during his first visit to Bucharest in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Although more sympathetic to the Symbolist author, both Dragomirescu and [[Gheorghe Adamescu]] tended to describe him as exclusively the product of French and Decadent literature,&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.15" /&gt; while Dragomirescu's disciple [[Ion Trivale]] denied all merit to Macedonski's literature.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.644&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tudor Vianu, Macedonski's intellectual friends (among them [[Anghel Demetriescu]], [[George Ionescu-Gion]], [[Bonifaciu Florescu]], [[Grigore Tocilescu]] and [[V. A. Urechia]]) were largely responsible for passing down "a better and truer image of the abused poet."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.388-389&lt;/ref&gt; It was also due to Dragomirescu that ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' was included in a literature textbook for final grade high school students, which some argue is the poet's first-ever presence in the [[Education in Romania|Romanian curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.380. According to Anghelescu (p.15), this was preceded by an 1891 textbook published by educator E. Manliu, which introduced Macedonski through his ''Calul arabului''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Lucian Nastasă, the poet's wife Ana Rallet behaved like an "excellent secretary" while Macedonski was still alive, and thereafter helped sort and edit his manuscript while maintaining "an actual cult" for her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonski's [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] circle was the center of a literary alternative to the prevailing conservatism and Eminescu-like traditionalism of the day, the latter tendency being grouped around ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' magazine for part of Macedonski's lifetime.&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.10-11, 15, 18; Ornea, p.136-137; Sandqvist, p.75, 197, 200, 202&lt;/ref&gt; While Macedonski himself maintained his links with Romanticism and Classicism, commentators have retrospectively recognized in him the main person who announced Romania's first wave in [[modernist literature]].&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.139-140; Cernat, p.10-11, 15; Krasztev, "From Modernization...", p.334, 338, 343; Sandqvist, p.197, 200; Vianu, Vol.II, p.483&lt;/ref&gt; Many first-generation disciples were to part with his guidelines early on, either by radicalizing their Symbolism or by stepping out of its confines. [[Traian Demetrescu]] was one of the first to do so, focusing on his commitment to [[socialism]]—Vianu notes that the split took place "without coldness and the heart's versatility" on Macedonski's part.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p.391&lt;/ref&gt; Literary researcher [[Lidia Bote]] argues that it was Petică who first illustrated mature Symbolism, emancipating himself from Macedonski's [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] tendencies after 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the Symbolist authors [[Dimitrie Anghel]] and [[N. D. Cocea]] used Macedonski's fantasy prose as an inspiration for their own, and [[N. Davidescu]] was borrowing from his mystical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.690, 697, 919&lt;/ref&gt; The pictorial and joyous elements in Macedonski's poems were also serving to inspire Stamatiad, [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]] and [[Horia Furtună]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.700-701, 727&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of his career, [[Ion Pillat]] wrote pieces which echo his master's choice of [[Exoticism|exotic]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.857-858&lt;/ref&gt; A more discreet legacy of Macedonski's ideas was also preserved inside the conservative and traditionalist camps. Although his separation from ''Literatorul'' was drastic, and led him to rally with ''Junimea'', [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] built on some elements borrowed from the magazine's ideology, incorporating them into his literary vision.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.263-264; Vianu, Vol.II, p.432&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Macedonski's most devoted disciples, whom he himself had encouraged, have been rated by various critics as secondary or mediocre. This is the case of [[Theodor Cornel]] (who made his name as an art critic),&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Demetriade]],&lt;ref name="aonarco22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.388"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oreste Georgescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.652-653&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandru Obedenaru]],&lt;ref name="aonarco22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.418-419" /&gt; Stoenescu, Stamatiad, [[Carol Scrob]], [[Dumitru Karnabatt]] and [[Donar Munteanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.523, 531-532, 701-702&lt;/ref&gt; Another such minor author was the self-styled "[[hermeticist]]" [[Alexandru Petroff]], who expanded on Macedonski's ideas about esoteric knowledge.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.11"/&gt;

Macedonski's eldest son [[Alexis Macedonski|Alexis]] continued to pursue a career as a painter. His son [[Soare Macedonski|Soare]] followed in his footsteps, receiving acclaim from art critics of the period. Soare's short career ended in 1928, before he turned nineteen, but his works have been featured in several retrospective exhibitions, including one organized by Alexis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Tonitza]], "Cronica plastică (Despre cei mai tineri: Soare Al. Macedonski.—Adina Paula Moscu.—Titina Căpitănescu.—Lazăr Zim)", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr.4/1929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tosoare"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Tudor Octavian]], [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/soare-macedonski-1910-1928-2981174/ "Soare Macedonski (1910-1928)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', June 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Alexis later experimented with [[scenic design]] as an assistant to French filmmaker [[René Clair]]; his later life, shrouded in mystery and intrigue, led him to a career in [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref name="tosoare" /&gt; Another of Alexandru Macedonski's sons, Nikita, was also a poet and painter. For a while in the 1920s, he edited the literary supplement of ''[[Universul]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Emil Manu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MANUoct.html "Melancolia agrestă (Zaharia Stancu)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after her father's death, Anna Macedonski married poet [[Mihail Celarianu]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.960"&gt;Călinescu, p.960&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his polemical portrayals in works by Alecsandri, Eminescu and Caragiale, Macedonski's career was an inspiration for various authors. His image acquired mythical proportions for his followers. Like Demetrescu, many of them left memoirs on Macedonski which were published before or after his death. His admirers were writing poetry about him as early as 1874,&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.342&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1892, [[Cincinat Pavelescu]] published a rhapsodizing portrait of Macedonski as "the Artist".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.387&lt;/ref&gt; Pavelescu, Dragoslav and Petică paid homage to the writer by leaving recollections which describe him as a devoted and considerate friend.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.390&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, traditionalist poet [[Alexandru Vlahuță]] authored an 1889 [[sketch story]] in which Macedonski (referred to as ''Polidor'') is the object of derision.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.558; Vianu, Vol.II, p.386-387. Vlahuță's articles include several other attacks on Macedonski (Anghelescu, p.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late recognition===
Actual recognition of the poet as a classic came only in the [[interwar period]]. A final volume of never before published poems, ''[[Poema rondelurilor]]'', saw print in 1927.&lt;ref name="Anghelescu, p.13"/&gt; Macedonski's work was analyzed and popularized by a new generation of critics, among them Vianu and George Călinescu. The post-''Junimist'' modernist critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]] also commented favorably on Macedonski's work,&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anghelescu, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; but overall, Călinescu asserts, his opinions on the subject gave little insight into what he actually thought about the poet.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.801&lt;/ref&gt; He also recounts that Macedonski himself treated Lovinescu with disdain, and once called him "a canary".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.523"/&gt;

The emerging [[avant-garde]], although originating from Symbolism, progressively took its distance from ''Literatorul''{{'}}s legacy. Initially, Macedonski's contribution to [[experimental literature]] was continued within formal Symbolism by his disciples Demetriade, [[Iuliu Cezar Săvescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.III, p.374&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ion Minulescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.202, 384; Vianu, Vol.III, p.374&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was particularly indebted to Macedonski in matters of vision and language.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.693, 697; Vianu, Vol.III, p.380&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, [[Tudor Arghezi]] also left behind the ''Literatorul'' circle and its tenets, eventually arriving to the fusion of modernist, traditionalist and [[avant-garde]] elements.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balotă, p.10, 16-34; Cernat, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; However, he remained indebted to Macedonski's example in his descriptive prose.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.III, p.451&lt;/ref&gt; The 1912 ''[[Simbolul]]'' magazine, which moved between conventional Symbolism and the emerging avant-garde, also published an [[Imagism|Imagist]]-inspired [[parody]] of ''Noaptea de mai'', signed by [[Adrian Maniu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; A co-founder of [[Dada]]ism during the late 1910s, [[Tristan Tzara]] is believed by Swedish researcher [[Tom Sandqvist]] to have been inspired more or less directly by Macedonski, and in particular by the latter's thoughts on the relation between absurdity and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.197, 199, 200, 207&lt;/ref&gt; In his debut poems, [[Benjamin Fondane|Benjamin Fondane-Barbu Fundoianu]] occasionally followed Macedonski,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Martin]], preface to [[Benjamin Fondane|B. Fundoianu]], ''Poezii'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1978, p.XI.  {{OCLC|252065138}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, by 1920, stated that the Symbolist doyen merely imitated French models to the point of "parasitism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.208-209; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Several avant-garde authors returned to Macedonski's literary guidelines by the late 1920s, as they themselves grew more moderate. This was the case of Maniu and [[Ion Vinea]], both of whom published prose works in the line of ''Thalassa''.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.184"&gt;Cernat, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; The same work is also believed to have influenced two non-avant-garde authors, Davidescu and [[Mateiu Caragiale]], who remained close to the tenets Symbolism.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.184" /&gt; Mateiu was the illegitimate son of Ion Luca Caragiale, but, Vianu notes, could withstand comparisons with his father's rival: the eccentricities were complementary, although Mateiu Caragiale shied away from public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.III, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; In the same post-Symbolist generation, Celarianu (Macedonski's posthumous son-in-law),&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.960" /&gt; [[George Bacovia]]&lt;ref name="mzrivalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, p.208-209; Vianu, Vol.III, p.388&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]]&lt;ref name="arteodo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.779&lt;/ref&gt; also built on Macedonski's legacy, being later joined in this by the [[Bessarabia]]n linguist [[Eugenio Coșeriu]] (who, in his early poetic career, imitated Macedonski's rondel style).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Țurcanu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TURCANUiun6.html "Poezia basarabeană din interbelic"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, when their form of modern [[psalms]] inspired [[Albanians of Romania|Albanian-Romanian]] poet [[Aleksander Stavre Drenova]], Macedonski and Arghezi both made an indirect impact on [[Albanian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Elsie]], ''Albanian Literature: A Short History'', [[I.B. Tauris]], Centre for Albanian Studies, London &amp; New York, 2005, p.104.  {{ISBN|1-84511-031-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonski's status as one of Romanian literature's greats was consolidated later in the 20th century. By this time, ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' had become one of the most recognizable literary works to be taught in Romanian schools.&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt; During the first years of [[Communist Romania]], the [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realist current]] condemned Symbolism (''see [[Censorship in Communist Romania]]''), but spoke favorably of Macedonski's critique of the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/canonul_literar_proletcultist "Canonul literar proletcultist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 27/2008&lt;/ref&gt; A while after this episode, [[Marin Sorescu]], one of the best-known modernist poets of his generation, wrote a homage-parody of the ''Nights'' cycle. Included in the volume ''Singur între poeți'' ("Alone among Poets"), it is seen by critic [[Mircea Scarlat]] as Sorescu's most representative such pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Scarlat]], preface to [[Marin Sorescu]], ''Drumul'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1984, p.XI, XIII, XIX, XXV.  {{OCLC|17114213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also then, ''Noaptea de decemvrie'' partly inspired [[Ștefan Augustin Doinaș]]' [[ballad]] ''[[Mistrețul cu colți de argint]]''.&lt;ref name="elrseisl" /&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Ștefan Agopian]] took the ''Nights'' cycle as inspiration for an [[Erotic literature|erotic]] short story,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} UN Cristian, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/%C4%B9%C5%BEtefan-Agopian-Cind-citeam-o-carte-buna-uitam-sa-mi-fac-lectiile*articleID_20516-articles_details.html "Ștefan Agopian: 'Cînd citeam o carte bună, uitam să-mi fac lecțiile!'

Macedonski's poems had a sizable impact on Romania's [[popular culture]]. During communism, ''Noaptea de mai'' was the basis for a successful musical adaptation, composed by [[Marian Nistor]] and sung by [[Mirabela Dauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://colectie.jurnalul.ro/articole/108612/ "Copilul cu vocea poleită"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', November 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tudor Gheorghe]], a singer-songwriter inspired by [[American folk music revival|American folk revival]], also used some of Macedonski's texts as lyrics to his melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jurnalul.ro/index.php?section=rubrici&amp;article_id=20201 "Concert - Toamna lui Tudor Gheorghe"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', May 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, the refrain of ''Noaptea de mai'' was mixed into a ''[[Manele|manea]]'' parody by [[Adrian Copilul Minune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Radu Pavel Gheo]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20071202101333/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=2398&amp;nr=2006-01-25 "Un gen muzical proteic"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 829, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his poetic theories were largely without echoes in [[Art of Romania|Romanian art]],&lt;ref&gt;Vida, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Macedonski captured the interest of several modern artists, including, early on, cartoonist [[Nicolae Petrescu Găină]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rezeanu, "Caricaturistul N.S. Petrescu-Găină", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', August 2008, p.61, 62&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside other writers who visited Terasa Oteteleșanu, Macedonski was notably portrayed the drawings of celebrated Romanian artist [[Iosif Iser]].&lt;ref name="micafene" /&gt; He is also depicted in a 1918 [[lithograph]] by [[Jean Alexandru Steriadi]], purportedly Steriadi's only Symbolist work.&lt;ref&gt;Vida, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu'' inspired a series of [[relief]]s, designed by Alexis Macedonski and hosted in his father's house in [[Dorobanți]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.III, p.352"/&gt; During the 1910s, busts of him were completed by two sculptors, [[Alexandru Severin]] and [[Friedrich Storck]], one of Storck's variants being hosted by the [[Ioan Cantacuzino]] collection.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt; In 1919, [[Theodor Burcă]] was also inspired to complete another bust, and, during [[World War II]], was commissioned by [[Mayor of Bucharest]] [[Ion Rășcanu]] to build a Macedonski Monument in the [[Grădina Icoanei]] park, but this was never completed.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt; [[Constantin Piliuță]], a painter active in the second half of the 20th century, made Macedonski the subject of a portrait in series dedicated to Romanian cultural figures (also depicted were [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Ștefan Luchian]] and Vianu).&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Drăguț, Vasile Florea, [[Dan Grigorescu]], Marin Mihalache, ''Pictura românească în imagini'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1970, p.312. {{OCLC|5717220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, a bust of Macedonski, the work of [[Constantin Foamete]], was unveiled in [[Craiova]].&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;

Of Macedonski's numerous residences, the one in Dorobanți was demolished when the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies|Academy of Economic Studies]] (ASE) was expanded.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema" /&gt; A commemorative plaque was later put up near the spot.&lt;ref name="vztcron" /&gt; Macedonski's childhood home in [[Goiești]] passed into state property under communism, and was in turn a school, a community home and a Macedonski Museum, before falling into neglect after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Aldezir Marin, [http://www.gds.ro/Viata%20satului/2006-05-27/O+ruina+incarcata+de+istorie "O ruină încarcată de istorie"], in ''[[Gazeta de Sud]]'', May 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Several streets named in honor of Alexandru Macedonski, notably in Bucharest (by the ASE), Craiova, [[Cluj-Napoca]] and [[Timișoara]].

The '''Art Research Center''' is an independent not-for-profit association in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. In its early days, members included architects, artists, composers, designers, writers and others. Its work was connected with the exploration of abstract Neo-[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], by both individuals and groups.{{r|leo}} The association grew out of an earlier [[Artist-run space|collaborative art gallery project]], and was started by [[Thomas Michael Stephens]] in 1964. The first exhibition was held in 1966.{{r|armin|page=190}} In 1969, Stephens, with Jon Brees Thogmartin and Nancy Ann Stephens, took work by eight artists of the group to the fourth [[New Tendencies]] exhibition in [[Zagreb]], at that time in [[Yugoslavia]]; the works were displayed as a group, forming a cohesive whole.{{r|armin|page=190}}

The Art Research Center's first exhibition ran from October 29, 1966 to January 31, 1967 at a branch of the Kansas City public library. Seven members participated in the first ARC exhibition.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

== The ARC Welders ==
The Art Research Center often recruited artists and musicians to participate in live music concerts.  These concerts included improvised ensemble works by the "ARC Welders."  The ARC Welders in general, consisted of the musicians who happened to be participating in any given event.

At least one of the ARC Welders concerts received favorable reviews from ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Beit Lessin Theater''' ({{lang-he-n|תיאטרון בית ליסין}}, [[Transliteration|translit]]: ''Teatron Bet Lessin'') is a theater in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].
==History==
Established in 1978 by [[Yaakov Agmon]] for the [[Histadrut]],&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ben-Zvi. ''Theater in Israel''. University of Michigan Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-472-10607-4}}. pg.22. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=v_tXKyDG5j4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=beit%20lessin&amp;f=false ''Theater in Israel'' on Google Books ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years the theater has shown over a thousand contemporary American and European plays, as well as original productions. In 1993, [[Zippi Pines]] started managing the theater. It was separated from the Histadrut and started showing mostly original Israeli material reflecting the political and social situation in Israel.

In 2003, the theater moved from Lessin House to the old residence of the Cameri Theater after it was remodeled. This venue having more seats allowed larger and more expensive plays to be produced, such as [[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]] and [[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]].

The theater's production "Mikveh" won the Israeli Theater Prize in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10538">A '''Bit-hilani''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''Bīt-Ḫilāni'', meaning 'house of pillars') is an ancient architectural type of palace. It seems to have become popular at the end of the tenth and during the ninth century BCE during the early [[Iron Age]] in northern Syria although it may have originated as early as the [[Bronze Age]]. Contemporary records call it a Hittite-style palace, probably after the [[Neo-Hittite]] kingdoms of northern Syria.

The oldest excavated building described as ''Hilani'' by its excavator [[Sir Leonard Woolley]] is a palace&lt;ref&gt;A [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001717/https://feldman.berkeley.edu:453/?course=nes190a&amp;do=detail&amp;imgid=00535 plan] of the Palace of Niqmepa at Tell Atchana, the ancient Alalakh.&lt;/ref&gt; in level IV at [[Alalakh]] dated to the 15th century BCE. The palace is thought to have been built by [[Niqmepa, King of Alalakh|Niqmepa]], a son of [[Idrimi]] of the royal family of the [[Amorite]] state of [[Yamhad]] based in [[Halab]].

A building at the citadel (Büyükkale) of the Hittite capital [[Hattusa]] may also have been of the hilani type.&lt;ref&gt;The detached building (labeled as building E on most plans) lies near the north west corner of the palace area of the citadel, between the large reception hall and the more private building in the northernmost corner of the citadel. It does not seem to have been incorporated in the court systems and may thus have served as a more private reception building. During excavations an archive was found within the building. The [https://archive.is/20120802185613/http://www.hattuscha.de/English/kingspalace.htm plan of the building] seems rather symmetrical and is more similar to those unearthed in Sam'al and Carchemish than for example the palace of Kapara at Guzana.

The palace,&lt;ref&gt;A [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001744/https://feldman.berkeley.edu:453/?course=nes120a&amp;do=detail&amp;imgid=00546 plan] of the palace with the adjoining Skorpians Gate.

Some of the finds were taken to [[Berlin]], and most of them destroyed when von Oppenheim's private museum was hit during a bombing raid in November 1943. The [[National Museum of Aleppo]] has reconstructed the pillared portico in front of its entrance.

When claiming to have built in the style of a hilani, most builders probably referred to the pillared portico with [[antechamber]] such as:

[[Sargon II]], King of [[Assyria]] 722–705 BCE, at his new city of [[Dur-Sharrukin]], begun in 713 BCE. An isolated building of which not much is known yet has been located in the western corner of the palace terrace. It may be a candidad &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225256&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225256&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500800&amp;bmLocale=en Description]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of the site the relief "[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Genie_poppy_Dur_Sharrukin_Louvre_AO19869.jpg Genius holding a poppy flower]", now at the [[Louvre]], was found at.&lt;/ref&gt; for the building he mentions in his founding text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeotype.dalton.org/library/oldsite/eighth.html Translation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725215249/http://archaeotype.dalton.org/library/oldsite/eighth.html |date=July 25, 2011 }} and plans of the excavated parts of the palace of Sargon II at Dur-Sharrukin.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A portico, patterned after the Hittite palace, which in the language of Amurru they call a bit-hilani, I built in front of the palaces' gates."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]] (704–681 BC), claims to have done some building in [[Niniveh]] in the style of a bit-hilani. Nothing similar to a ''hilani'' has to date been identified without doubt at his palace, known today as the South-West Palace in Niniveh, finished in 694 BCE. The building in question may not have been found yet.

== Description ==
The major feature for a visitor would have been the monumental entrance [[loggia]] or [[portico]] with columns&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. M. G. Akkermans, Glenn M. Schwartz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_4oqvpAHDEoC&amp;pg=PA368&amp;lpg=PA368&amp;dq=Bit-hilani&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0kkl53LDER&amp;sig=_l6ci23AWxY9FUTNdNw7q8Ie2Qw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA370,M1 The Archaeology of Syria: From Complex Hunter-gatherers to Early Urban Societies (c. 16,000-300 BC)]'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-79666-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-79666-8}}, pages 368-370&lt;/ref&gt; flanked by large massive parts of the building and approached by a broad but relative low flight of steps. On one side a stairway to the upper parts would reside in one of these block like structures.&lt;ref&gt;Historical dictionary of the Hittites by Charles Allen Burney, Scarecrow Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=azPl5Jzv930C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=hilani+aleppo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3_ajarZ0Qi&amp;sig=b-QTpvTFnjISpTpaLExQOitUUmk&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=ZPi8TsewDK_a4QSxlKjFBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=hilani%20aleppo&amp;f=false page 41-2] (google books link)&lt;/ref&gt; Straight ahead one would enter the great hall, where one would have to turn by 90° to see the throne in the far end of the hall. The overall plan of the building would be rectangular with the large hall in the middle surrounded on all sides by the other much narrower rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Comparable [https://books.google.com/books?id=oYearm8YobQC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=%2B%22bit+hilani%22+-Assi+%22confronting+the+past%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YpOVpJm7rs&amp;sig=IgKON32uqrZETTrd5vEa9WIE2AU&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA145,M1 plans] of the hilani type buildings at the top on page 146 (fig.1 ""Tell Ta'yinat", "Tell Halaf", "Zinjirli" and "Sakje Guezi") in ''Podium Structures with Lateral Access'' by Ilan Sharon and Anabel Zarzecki-Peleg in ''"Confronting the Past: Archaeological and Historical Essays on Ancient Israel in Honor of William G. Dever"'', 2006, {{ISBN|1-57506-117-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57506-117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This type of design with a large central space surrounded by a double wall with smaller rooms taking up the space within the walls may be based on designs first used in the late [[Ubaid period]] in southern Mesopotamia such as the [[Ubaid house]]. Pillared porticos as gates or grand entrances were used by several cultures of the Bronze Age around the eastern Mediterranean sea. The examples of the Hittites and the Myceneans may be the best known. Through the [[megaron]]s and [[propylaea]] of the [[Mycenaean Greece|mycenaean]] palaces the style may have lived into classical Greek designs. The late ''hilani'' of the levant may well be the combination of the old broad room concept with a Hittite-style portico. In recent traditional architecture it may have a late resemblance in the design of the [[liwan]] house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14340">The '''British Construction Industry Awards''' ('''BCI Awards''' or '''BCIA''') were launched by the [[New Civil Engineer]] magazine and Thomas Telford Ltd - both owned by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] - in 1998.

The awards seek to recognise outstanding achievement in the construction of buildings, taking account of a wide range of factors including architectural and engineering design, but also consideration of the construction process, delivery to time and budget, and client satisfaction.

In 2012, [[Network Rail]] chief executive [[David Higgins (businessman)|Sir David Higgins]] was the chair of the 2012 British Construction Industry Awards judging panel which celebrated its 25th anniversary of rewarding excellence in UK construction delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.nce.co.uk/news/business/sir-david-higgins-to-chair-british-construction-industry-awards-2012-judges/8624531.article |title =Sir David Higgins to chair British Construction Industry Awards 2012 judges |website =www.nce.co.uk |publisher=[[New Civil Engineer]]|date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute owes its establishment to Miriam Koral, who is the Founding Director, and who, as a Yiddish instructor at [[UCLA]] and native Yiddish speaker, created the center and community that brings world-renowned Yiddish authors, playwrights, musicians, poets, artists and others to the [[Los Angeles]] area. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Routledge Handbook of Heritage Language Education|page=459|url=https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=Ri8lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA459&amp;lpg=PA459&amp;dq=california+institute+for+yiddish+culture+and+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RgSYPhwZW2&amp;sig=tUl7Vn5vm4f8-2XtadQKBPT-qPw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYq6nN9sfXAhUCkJQKHbUPD5M4ChDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=california%20institute%20for%20yiddish%20culture%20and%20language&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color-blocking''' is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Color-blocking|url=http://blog.blisshomeanddesign.com/2015/06/15/building-blocks-a-brief-history-of-color-blocking/|website=Bliss by Design|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, [[Piet Mondrian]]. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|first=Ellen|last=Duffer|date=23 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mondriaanmode_door_Yves_St_Laurent_(1966).jpg|thumb|Mondrian dresses by Yves Saint Laurent]]
It’s widely believed by most historians that [[Piet Mondrian]], a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color Blocking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] to create the famous Mondrian Dresses.&lt;ref name="College Fashion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color-blocking|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. [[Pop Art]] incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution.&lt;ref name="Origins of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|url=http://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.

As for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.

==Process==
In the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/10/15/the-art-of-colorblocking/20743446/?swp=1|title=The art of colorblocking|first=AOL|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashiondujourdaily.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/color-blocking-101-what-how/|title=Color Blocking 101: What &amp; How|first=FASHION du|last=jour|date=11 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://achicdirection.com/2011/03/29/what-is-color-blocking/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=achicdirection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Fashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|title=Rules of colour blocking - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Since color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.&lt;ref name="Rules of Colour blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Colour Blocking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|website=DNA|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design==
Color-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decorlove.com/color-blocking-in-home-decor-tips-and-inspirations/|title=Color Blocking In Home Decor – Tips And Inspirations|date=23 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.

'''DV8 Physical Theatre''' (or Dance Visual 8) is a [[physically integrated dance]] company based at [[Artsadmin]] in [[London]], United Kingdom. It was officially founded in 1986 by [[Lloyd Newson]] (1986-2015), Michelle Richecoeur (1986-1988) and Nigel Charnock (1986-1989, 1992). [[Lloyd Newson]] has led the company as choreographer and artistic director since its inception, apart from the production ''My Sex, Our Dance'' (1986), which was co-created and performed with Nigel Charnock.

DV8's work is characterised by the desire to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and very pretentiously, often with a focus on socio-political issues. The work challenges the limitations of dance by using any means necessary to find the most appropriate way to say something, thereby incorporating elements of theatre, dance, film, and, increasingly, text.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatreanddance.britishcouncil.org/artists-and-companies/profiles/dv8-physical-theatre/|title=DV8 Physical Theatre|work=Theatre and Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt; DV8 has toured work in the UK and to 28 countries worldwide, and received 55 national and international awards.&lt;ref name="dv8.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/awards|title=Awards|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation and Early Work===
Lloyd Newson founded DV8 Physical Theatre in 1986 in response to his frustration with the lack of subject matter in contemporary dance.  He felt audiences were being ‘conned about the depth’ of (much) contemporary dance, which he saw as generally superficial; obsessed with 'aesthetics over content'.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsKtaMrxguE|title=DV8 Physical Theatre - Company Promo|date=10 March 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first work Newson produced with the new company was made in partnership with Nigel Charnock, and was titled ''My Sex, Our Dance'' (1986); it tackled the emergence of AIDS and investigated the idea of trust, both emotionally and physically, between two gay men.&lt;ref name="Arditti"&gt;{{cite news | last = Arditti

All three works toured the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/elemen-three-sex/about|title=ELEMEN T(H)REE SEX|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/deep-end|title=DEEP END|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''My Sex, Our Dance'' and ''Deep End'' were also performed in New York as part of the Next Wave Festival (held at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]) in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The next work for the company was ''My Body, Your Body'' (1987), which explored the psychology of women who seek out relationships with abusive men. It was based on an audio recording of a close female friend of Newson’s and the book, Women Who Love Too Much by [[Robin Norwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The production drew inspiration from the book, Killing for Company, about serial killer [[Dennis Nielsen]].&lt;ref name="Arditti"/&gt; It garnered numerous awards for DV8, including the [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] Dance Award and the [[Evening Standard]] Ballet Award, both in 1989.&lt;ref name="Bremser 2011 303"&gt;{{cite book

===1990 - 2000===

After Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men, Newson began to develop a more poetic style, involving increasingly complex sets.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;  He stated at the time that he was ‘fatigued by the bruising physicality’ that marked DV8’s work from 1986-1989.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;  The first of these works was ''If Only…'' (1990), which won the Golden Pegasus Award at the Melbourne International Festival (1990).&lt;ref name="Bremser 2011 303"/&gt; ''Strange Fish'' (1992) followed, featuring Wendy Houstoun&lt;ref name="Judith"/&gt; alongside Nigel Charnock and singer [[Melanie Pappenheim]].

Throughout the 1990s, DV8 continued to produce work that was critically well received and popular with audiences.  The [[BBC]] film version of [[Enter Achilles]] (1995) won a Prix Italia and an International [[Emmy Award]] in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Recent Work===

In 2004-5, DV8 created ''Just for Show'', the first of a series of co-productions with the [[National Theatre (UK)|National Theatre]] (London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The next production, ''To Be Straight With You'' (2007), marked a move by Newson into [[verbatim theatre]] – setting minutely-detailed movement to the real (edited) words of real people. To create the script, 85 people of varying ethnicities and sexuality were interviewed by Newson and his researcher, Anshu Rastogi, about their experiences and views concerning religion, culture and homosexuality.

''Can We Talk About This?'' (2011–12), a second verbatim production, dealt with freedom of speech, censorship and Islam. It drew on existing interviews as well as those conducted by Newson himself, and involved people associated with the burning of author [[Salman Rushdie|Salman Rushdie’s]] [[Satanic Verses]] and associates of film-maker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], who was murdered by Dutch Islamist, [[Mohammed Bouyeri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

DV8’s most recent work, ''JOHN'' (2014) follows the life-story of a man, the eponymous title character, played by Hannes Langolf. It traces his criminality, drug use, personal relationships, efforts at rehabilitation and desire to lead an ordinary life. Again co-produced with the [[National Theatre (UK)|National Theatre]], it was broadcast to cinemas worldwide through the [[NT Live]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/47625-john|title=JOHN|work=nationaltheatre.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 12th January 2016, the company announced that artistic director Lloyd Newson was taking time out to reflect about the future. Due to this the company confirmed that the production of new work was to be paused indefinitely. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Style==
DV8’s work is characterised by a desire to take risks, to question people’s attitudes and beliefs, to dissolve barriers that separate art forms, and ultimately to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously. The company frequently addresses pertinent social topics, such as freedom of speech, human rights, multiculturalism, tolerance/intolerance, gender roles, sexual identity and social class, as well as personal issues.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;
	
DV8’s work seeks to use the most appropriate means available to serve its mission. Thus, its productions have incorporated elements of dance, naturalistic movement, video, circus skills and more recently, verbatim text.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt;

==Funding and Production==
DV8 Physical Theatre receives funding through Arts Council England’s National Portfolio programme, as well as occasional project support from the British Council.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt; It has toured work extensively in the UK and Europe, and further afield to Australia, the USA, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. Many of its long-term co-production partners are theatres and festivals from across the world. It is an [[Artsadmin]] associate company,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artsadmin.co.uk/artists/dv8-physical-theatre&lt;/ref&gt; and also a member of the ITC, Dance UK and IETM. Newson has often stated that the company is motivated by artistic inspiration and creative need, rather than financial, organisational and touring demands.&lt;ref name="DV8 Physical Theatre"/&gt;

==Works==

[[File:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|right|thumb|The opening page of Spinoza's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Ethics'', in the posthumous Latin first edition]]

'''''Ethics, Demonstrated in Geometrical Order''''' ({{lang-la|Ethica, ordine geometrico demonstrata}}), usually known as the '''''Ethics''''', is a philosophical treatise written in Latin by [[Benedict de Spinoza]]. It was written between 1664 and 1665{{Citation needed|reason=The Baruch Spinoza article states that Ethics was completed in 1676. So who's lying?|date=November 2018}} and was first published posthumously in 1677.

The book is perhaps the most ambitious attempt to apply the [[Euclid's Elements|method of Euclid]] in philosophy. Spinoza puts forward a small number of definitions and axioms from which he attempts to derive hundreds of [[propositions]] and [[corollaries]], such as "When the Mind imagines its own lack of power, it is saddened by it",&lt;ref&gt;Part 3, proposition 33.&lt;/ref&gt; "A free man thinks of nothing less than of death",&lt;ref&gt;Part 4, proposition 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The human Mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the Body, but something of it remains which is eternal."&lt;ref&gt;Part 5, proposition 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
===Part I: Of God===
The first part of the book addresses the relationship between God and the [[universe]]. [[Abrahamic religions|Tradition]] held that God exists outside of the universe, created it for a reason, and could have created a different universe if he chose. Spinoza denies each point. According to Spinoza, God ''is'' the natural world. As with many of Spinoza's claims, what this means is a matter of dispute. Spinoza claims that the things that make up the universe, including human beings, are God's "modes". This means that everything is, in some sense, dependent upon God. The nature of this dependence is disputed. Some scholars say that the modes are [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of God in the traditional sense. Others say that modes are [[Causality|effect]]s of God. Either way, the modes are also logically dependent on God's essence, in this sense: everything that happens [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the nature of God, just like how it follows from the nature of a triangle that its angles are equal to two right angles&lt;!--Spinoza's metaphor, not the editor's--&gt;. Since God had to exist with the nature he has, nothing that has happened could have been avoided, and if God has fixed a particular fate for a particular mode, there is no escaping it. As Spinoza puts it, "A thing which has been determined by God to produce an effect cannot render itself undetermined." God's creation of the universe is not a decision, much less one motivated by a purpose.

[[File:Spinoza - Structure Logique en Éthique.png|thumb|Logical structure of the first six propositions of Spinoza's ''Ethics'']]

===Part II: Of Nature &amp; Its Origin===
The second part focuses on the human mind and body. Spinoza attacks several [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] positions: (1) that the mind and body are distinct [[substance theory|substances]] that can affect one another; (2) that we know our minds better than we know our bodies; (3) that our senses may be trusted; (4) that despite being created by God we can make mistakes, namely, when we affirm, of our own free will, an idea that is not clear and distinct. Spinoza denies each of Descartes's points. Regarding (1), Spinoza argues that the mind and the body are [[nondualism|a single thing]] that is being thought of in two different ways. The whole of nature can be fully described in terms of thoughts or in terms of bodies. However, we cannot mix these two ways of describing things, as Descartes does, and say that the mind affects the body or vice versa. Moreover, the mind's self-knowledge is not fundamental: it cannot know its own thoughts better than it knows the ways in which its body is acted upon by other bodies.

Further, there is no difference between contemplating an idea and thinking that it is true, and there is no [[free will|freedom of the will]] at all. Sensory perception, which Spinoza calls "knowledge of the first kind", is entirely inaccurate, since it reflects how our own bodies work more than how things really are. We can also have a kind of accurate knowledge called "knowledge of the second kind", or "reason". This encompasses knowledge of the features common to all things, and includes principles of physics and geometry. We can also have "knowledge of the third kind", or "[[Intuition|intuitive knowledge]]". This is a sort of knowledge that, somehow, relates particular things to the nature of God.

===Part III: The Origin and Nature of Emotions===
In the third part of the ''Ethics'', Spinoza argues that all things, including human beings, strive to persevere in their being. This is usually taken to mean that things try to last for as long as they can. Spinoza explains how this striving ("[[conatus]]") underlies our [[emotion]]s (love, hate, joy, sadness and so on). Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.

===Part IV: Of the Servitude of Humanity, or the Strength of the Emotions===
The fourth part analyzes human passions, which Spinoza sees as aspects of the mind that direct us outwards to seek what gives pleasure and shun what gives pain. The "bondage" he refers to is domination by these passions or "[[affect (philosophy)|affect]]s" as he calls them. Spinoza considers how the affects, ungoverned, can torment people and make it impossible for mankind to live in harmony with one another.

===Part V: Of the Power of the Intellect, or the Liberty of Humanity===
The fifth part argues that reason can govern the affects in the pursuit of virtue, which for Spinoza is [[self-preservation]]: only with the aid of reason can humans distinguish the passions that truly aid virtue from those that are ultimately harmful. By reason, we can see things as they truly are, ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'', "under the aspect of eternity," and because Spinoza treats God and nature as indistinguishable, by knowing things as they are we improve our knowledge of God. Seeing that all things are determined by nature to be as they are, we can achieve the rational tranquility that best promotes our happiness, and liberate ourselves from being driven by our passions.

==Themes==
===God or Nature - ''Deus sive Natura''&lt;!--'God or Nature', 'Deus sive Natura' and 'Deus seu Natura' redirect here--&gt;===
According to Spinoza, God is Nature and Nature is God. This is his [[pantheism]]. In his previous book, ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus|Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', Spinoza discussed the inconsistencies that result when God is assumed to have human characteristics. In the third chapter of that book, he stated that the word "God" means the same as the word "Nature". He wrote: "Whether we say&amp;nbsp;... that all things happen according to the laws of nature, or are ordered by the decree and direction of God, we say the same thing." He later qualified this statement in his letter to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Letter XXI (Van Vloten LXXIII)&lt;/ref&gt; by abjuring [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The supposition of some, that I endeavor to prove in the ''Tractatus Theologico–Politicus'' the unity of God and Nature (meaning by the latter a certain mass or corporeal matter), is wholly erroneous."&lt;/ref&gt; Nature, to Spinoza, is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[Substance theory|substance]], not physical matter.&lt;ref&gt;”Having established that Nature is an indivisible, infinite, uncaused, substantial whole—in fact, the ''only'' substantial whole; that outside of Nature there is nothing; and that everything that exists is a part of Nature and is brought into being by and within Nature with a deterministic necessity through Nature’s laws, Spinoza concludes that God and Nature—the substantial, unique, unified, active, infinitely powerful, necessary cause of everything—are one and the same thing.” (''A Book Forged in Hell'', [[Steven Nadler]], ch.4)&lt;/ref&gt; In this posthumously published book ''Ethics'', he equated God with nature by writing “God or Nature” four times.&lt;ref&gt;Twice in Part IV, Preface (''Deum seu Naturam'', ''Deus seu Natura''); twice in Part IV, Proposition IV, Proof (''Dei sive Naturæ'', ''Dei seu Naturæ'').&lt;/ref&gt; “...For Spinoza, God or Nature—being one and the same thing— is the whole, infinite, eternal, necessarily existing, active system of the universe within which absolutely everything exists. This is the fundamental principle of the ''Ethics''....”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Steven Nadler]], ''A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2011, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza holds that everything that exists is part of nature, and everything in nature follows the same basic laws. In this perspective, human beings are part of nature, and hence they can be explained and understood in the same way as everything else in nature. This aspect of Spinoza’s philosophy — his [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] — was radical for its time, and perhaps even for today. In the preface to Part III of ''Ethics'' (relating to emotions), he writes:

{{quote|Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating rather of matters outside nature than of natural phenomena following nature's general laws. They appear to conceive man to be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom : for they believe that he disturbs rather than follows nature's order, that he has absolute control over his actions, and that he is determined solely by himself. However, my argument is this. Nothing comes to pass in nature, which can be set down to a flaw therein ; for nature is always the same, and everywhere one and the same in her efficacy and power of action ; that is, nature's laws and ordinances, whereby all things come to pass and change from one form to another, are everywhere and always the same ; so that there should be one and the same method of understanding the nature of all things whatsoever, namely, through nature's universal laws and rules.| [[:s: Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 3|''Ethics'', Part 3]]}}

Therefore, Spinoza affirms that the passions of hatred, anger, envy, and so on, considered in themselves, “follow from this same necessity and efficacy of nature; they answer to certain definite causes, through which they are understood, and possess certain properties as worthy of being known as the properties of anything else”. Humans are not different in kind from the rest of the natural world; they are part of it.&lt;ref name="Pynn"&gt;Cf. [http://www.niu.edu/~gpynn/322_H8.pdf "Introduction to Spinoza’s ''Ethics''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226103559/http://www.niu.edu/~gpynn/322_H8.pdf |date=2015-02-26 }}, by Geoﬀ Pynn, [[Northern Illinois University]], Spring 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza’s [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] can be seen as deriving from his firm commitment to the [[principle of sufficient reason]] ({{small caps|psr}}), which is the thesis that everything has an explanation. He articulates the {{small caps|psr}} in a strong fashion, as he applies it not only to everything that is, but also to everything that is not:

{{quote|Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned, either for its existence, ''or for its non-existence'' — e.g. if a triangle exists, a reason or cause must be granted for its existence; if, on the contrary, it does not exist, a cause must also be granted, which prevents it from existing, or annuls its existence.| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 1|''Ethics'', Part 1, XI]] (emphasis added)}}

And to continue with Spinoza's triangle example, here is one claim he makes about God:

{{quote|From God’s supreme power, or infinite nature, an infinite number of things – that is, all things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of ways, or always flow from the same necessity; in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity and for eternity, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles.| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 1|''Ethics'', Part 1, XVII]]}}

Spinoza rejected the idea of an external Creator suddenly, and apparently capriciously, creating the world at one particular time rather than another, and creating it out of nothing. The solution appeared to him more perplexing than the problem, and rather unscientific in spirit as involving a break in continuity. He preferred to think of the entire system of reality as its own ground. This view was simpler; it avoided the impossible conception of creation out of nothing; and it was religiously more satisfying by bringing God and man into closer relationship. Instead of Nature, on the one hand, and a supernatural God, on the other, he posited one world of reality, at once Nature and God, and leaving no room for the supernatural. This so-called naturalism of Spinoza is only distorted if one starts with a crude materialistic idea of Nature and supposes that Spinoza degraded God. The truth is that he raised Nature to the rank of God by conceiving Nature as the fulness of reality, as the One and All. He rejected the specious simplicity obtainable by denying the reality of Matter, or of Mind, or of God. The cosmic system comprehends them all. In fact, God and Nature become identical when each is conceived as the Perfect Self-Existent. This constitutes Spinoza's ''Pantheism''.&lt;ref name="Pynn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Structure of reality===
[[File:Spinoza Ethica Pars1 Prop1.jpg|thumb|300px|Spinoza's original text of ''Ethica'', Part 1]]
According to Spinoza, God has "attributes". One attribute is 'extension', another attribute is 'thought', and there are infinitely many such attributes. Since Spinoza holds that to exist is to ''act'', some readers take 'extension' to refer to an activity characteristic of bodies (for example, the active process of taking up space, exercising physical power, or resisting a change of place or shape). They take 'thought' to refer to the activity that is characteristic of minds, namely thinking, the exercise of mental power. Each attribute has modes. All bodies are modes of extension, and all ideas are modes of thought.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Substance, attributes, modes====
Spinoza's ideas relating to the character and structure of reality are expressed by him in terms of ''substance'', ''attributes'', and ''modes''. These terms are very old and familiar, but not in the sense in which Spinoza employs them. To understand Spinoza, it is necessary to lay aside all preconceptions&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/ "Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics"], on the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], cit.'', publ. 21/08/2007.&lt;/ref&gt; about them, and follow Spinoza closely.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Spinoza, Baruch |volume=20 |pages=687–691 |first=Andrew Seth |last=Pringle-Pattison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also A. Wolf's, "Spinoza, the Man and His Thought", 1933; [[Antonio Damasio]], ''Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain'', William Heinemann, 2003, esp. ch. 6, 224–261; [[Richard McKeon]], ''The Philosophy of Spinoza: The Unity of His Thought'', Ox Bow Pr., 1928; Ray Monk &amp; Frederic Raphael, ''The Great Philosophers''. Phoenix, 2000, ''s.v.'' "Spinoza", pp. 135–174. See also the very useful Olli Koistinen (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Spinoza's Ethics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 2009, esp. ch. 7, by Diane Steinberg, pp. 140–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza found it impossible to understand the finite, dependent, transient objects and events of experience without assuming some reality not dependent on anything else but self-existent, not produced by anything else but eternal, not restricted or limited by anything else but infinite. Such an uncaused, self-sustaining reality he called ''substance''. So, for instance, he could not understand the reality of material objects and physical events without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal physical force which expresses itself in all the movements and changes which occur, as we say, in [[space]].

This physical force he called ''extension'', and described it, at first, as a ''substance'', in the sense just explained. Similarly, he could not understand the various dependent, transient mental experiences with which we are familiar without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal consciousness, mental force, or mind-energy, which expresses itself in all these finite experiences of perceiving and understanding, of feeling and striving. This consciousness or mind-energy he called ''thought'', and described it also, at first, as a ''substance''.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;Especially valuable for these specific sections of Spinoza's thought as expounded in his ''Ethics'', have been the online pages by the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' at these four links [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-attributes/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-psychological/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-physics/] — which respectively represent an interpretation and commentary of the philosopher's stance on "Modal Metaphysics", "Theory of Attributes", "Psychological Theory", "Physical Theory", and are currently cited as a reference within the present text.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these "substances" he regarded as infinite of its kind (that is, as exhaustive of all the events of its own kind), and as irreducible to the other, or any other, substance. But in view of the intimate way in which Extension and Thought express themselves conjointly in the life of man, Spinoza considered it necessary to conceive of Extension and Thought not as detached realities, but as constituting one organic whole or system. And in order to express this idea, he then described Extension and Thought as ''attributes'', reserving the term ''Substance'' for the system which they constitute between them. This change of description was not intended to deny that Extension and Thought are substances in the sense of being self-existent, etc. It was only intended to express their coherence in one system. The system of course would be more than any one attribute. For each attribute is only ''infinite of its kind''; the system of all attributes is ''absolutely infinite'', that is, exhausts the whole of reality. Spinoza, accordingly, now restricted the term "substance" to the complete system, though he occasionally continued to use the phrase "substance or attribute", or described Extension as a substance.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

As commonly used, especially since the time of [[John Locke|Locke]], the term substance is contrasted with its attributes or qualities as their substratum or bearer. But this meaning must not be read into Spinoza. For Spinoza, Substance is not the support or bearer of the Attributes, but the system of Attributes — he actually uses the expression "Substance or the Attributes."&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt; If there is any difference at all between "Substance" and "the Attributes", as Spinoza uses these terms, it is only the difference between the Attributes conceived as an organic system and the Attributes conceived (but not by Spinoza) as a mere sum of detached forces. Something is still necessary to complete the account of Spinoza's conception of Substance. So far only the two Attributes have been considered, namely, Extension and Thought. Spinoza, however, realised that there may be other Attributes, unknown to man. If so, they are part of the one Substance or cosmic system. And using the term "[[infinity|infinite]]" in the sense of "complete" or "exhaustive", he ascribed to Substance an infinity of Attributes, that is, all the attributes there are, whether known to man or not.&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

Now reality, for Spinoza, is activity. Substance is incessantly active, each Attribute exercising its kind of energy in all possible ways. Thus the various objects and events of the material world come into being as ''modes'' (modifications or states) of the attribute Extension; and the various minds and mental experiences come into being as modes of the attribute Thought (or Consciousness). These modes are not external creations of the Attributes, but immanent results — they are not "thrown off" by the Attributes, but are states (or modifications) of them, as air-waves are states of the air. Each Attribute, however, expresses itself in its finite modes not immediately (or directly) but mediately (or indirectly), at least in the sense to be explained now. [[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] [[physics]] tended to regard the whole world of [[physical phenomena]] as the result of differences of [[motion (physics)|motion]] or [[momentum]]. And, though erroneously conceived, the Cartesian conception of a constant quantity of motion in the world led Spinoza to conceive of all physical phenomena as so many varying expressions of that store of motion (or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[Rest (physics)|rest]]).

Spinoza might, of course, have identified Extension with [[energy]] of motion. But, with his usual caution, he appears to have suspected that motion may be only one of several types of [[physical energy]]. So he described motion simply as a mode of Extension, but as an ''infinite'' mode (because complete or exhaustive of all finite modes of motion) and as an ''immediate'' mode (as a direct expression of Extension). Again, the physical world (or "the face of the world as a whole", as Spinoza calls it)&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; retains a certain sameness in spite of the innumerable changes in detail that are going on. Accordingly, Spinoza described also the physical world as a  whole as an ''infinite'' mode of extension ("infinite" because exhaustive of all facts and events that can be reduced to motion), but as a ''mediate'' (or indirect) mode, because he regarded it as the outcome of the conservation of motion (itself a mode, though an ''immediate'' mode). The physical things and events of ordinary experience are ''finite'' modes. In essence each of them is part of the Attribute Extension, which is active in each of them. But the finiteness of each of them is due to the fact that it is restrained or hedged in, so to say, by other finite modes. This limitation or determination is negation in the sense that each finite mode is ''not'' the whole attribute Extension; it is not the other finite modes. But each mode is positively real and ultimate as part of the Attribute.&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

In the same kind of way the Attribute Thought exercises its activity in various mental processes, and in such systems of mental process as are called minds or souls. But in this case, as in the case of Extension, Spinoza conceives of the finite modes of Thought as mediated by infinite modes. The immediate infinite mode of Thought he describes as "the idea of God"; the mediate infinite mode he calls "the infinite idea" or "the idea of all things". The other Attributes (if any) must be conceived in an analogous manner. And the whole Universe or Substance is conceived as one dynamic system of which the various Attributes are the several world-lines along which it expresses itself in all the infinite variety of events.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://archive.org/details/spinozasshorttre00spinuoft ''The Short Treatise on God, Man and his Well-being''],  London: A. &amp; C. Black, 2006 – scanned, [[University of Toronto]], Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the persistent misinterpretation of [[Spinozism]] it is worth emphasizing the dynamic character of reality as Spinoza conceived it. The cosmic system is certainly a logical or rational system, according to Spinoza, for Thought is a constitutive part of it; but it is not ''merely'' a logical system — it is dynamic as well as logical. His frequent use of [[geometry|geometrical]] illustrations affords no evidence at all in support of a purely [[logics|logico]]-[[mathematics|mathematical]] interpretation of his philosophy; for Spinoza regarded geometrical figures, not in a [[Plato]]nic or static manner, but as things traced out by moving [[particles]] or [[Line (geometry)|lines]], etc., that is, dynamically.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Marcello Colitti, ''Etica e politica di Baruch Spinoza'', Aliberti, 2010, esp. ''s.v.'' "Etica". {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Baruch Spinoza]], 1665.]]
{{quotation|''Without intelligence there is not rational life: and things are only good, in so far as they aid man in his enjoyment of the intellectual life, which is defined by intelligence. Contrariwise, whatsoever things hinder man's perfecting of his reason, and capability to enjoy the rational life, are alone called evil.''| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 4|''Ethics'', Part IV, Appendix V]]}}

For Spinoza, reality means activity, and the reality of anything expresses itself in a tendency to self-preservation — to exist is to persist. In the lowest kinds of things, in so-called inanimate matter, this tendency shows itself as a "will to live". Regarded physiologically the effort is called ''appetite''; when we are conscious of it, it is called ''desire''. The moral categories, good and evil, are intimately connected with desire, though not in the way commonly supposed. Man does not desire a thing because he thinks it is good, or shun it because he considers it bad; rather he considers anything good if he desires it, and regards it as bad if he has an aversion for it. Now whatever is felt to heighten vital activity gives pleasure; whatever is felt to lower such activity causes pain. Pleasure coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called love, and pain coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called hate — "love" and "hate" being used in the wide sense of "like" and "dislike". All human feelings are derived from pleasure, pain and desire. Their great variety is due to the differences in the kinds of external objects which give rise to them, and to the differences in the inner conditions of the individual experiencing them.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Spinoza gives a detailed analysis of the whole gamut of human feelings, and his account is one of the classics of [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;For this and other affirmations about Spinoza's "psychology", cf. esp. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-psychological/ "Spinoza's Psychological Theory"], on the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], cit.'', rev. 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For the present purpose the most important distinction is that between "active" feelings and "passive" feelings (or "passions"). Man, according to Spinoza, is active or free in so far as any experience is the outcome solely of his own nature; he is passive, or a bondsman, in so far as any experience is due to other causes besides his own nature. The active feelings are all of them forms of self-realisation, of heightened activity, of strength of mind, and are therefore always pleasurable. It is the passive feelings (or "passions") which are responsible for all the ills of life, for they are induced largely by things outside us and frequently cause that lowered vitality which means pain. Spinoza next links up his ethics with his theory of knowledge, and correlates the moral progress of man with his intellectual progress. At the lowest stage of knowledge, that of "opinion", man is under the dominant influence of things outside himself, and so is in the bondage of the passions. At the next stage, the stage of "reason", the characteristic feature of the human mind, its intelligence, asserts itself, and helps to emancipate him from his bondage to the senses and external allurements. The insight gained into the nature of the passions helps to free man from their domination. A better understanding of his own place in the cosmic system and of the place of all the objects of his likes and dislikes, and his insight into the necessity which rules all things, tend to cure him of his resentments, regrets and disappointments. He grows reconciled to things, and wins peace of mind. In this way reason teaches acquiescence in the universal order, and elevates the mind above the turmoil of passion. At the highest stage of knowledge, that of "intuitive knowledge", the mind apprehends all things as expressions of the eternal [[cosmos]]. It sees all things in God, and God in all things. It feels itself as part of the eternal order, identifying its thoughts with cosmic thought and its interests with cosmic interests. Thereby it becomes eternal as one of the eternal ideas in which the Attribute Thought expresses itself, and attains to that "blessedness" which "is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself", that is, the perfect joy which characterises perfect self-activity. This is not an easy or a common achievement. "But", says Spinoza, "everything excellent is as difficult as it is rare."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

==Reception==
{{Main|Spinozism}}

Shortly after his death in 1677, Spinoza's works were placed on the Catholic Church's Index of Banned Books. Condemnations soon appeared, such as [[Noel Aubert de Versé|Aubert de Versé]]'s ''L'impie convaincu'' (1685). According to its subtitle, in this work "the foundations of [Spinoza's] atheism are refuted".

For the next hundred years, if European philosophers read this so-called heretic, they did so almost entirely in secret. How much forbidden Spinozism they were sneaking into their diets remains a subject of continual intrigue. Locke, Hume, Leibniz and Kant all stand accused by later scholars of indulging in periods of closeted Spinozism.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Boehm, Omri. 2014. ''Kant's Critique of Spinoza''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the 18th century, a [[Pantheism controversy|controversy]] centering on the ''Ethics'' scandalized the German philosophy scene.

The first known translation of the ''Ethics'' into English was completed in 1856 by the novelist [[George Eliot]], though not published until much later. The book next appeared in English in 1883, by the hand of the novelist [[Hale White]]. Spinoza rose clearly into view for anglophone metaphysicians in the late nineteenth century, during the British craze for [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. In his admiration for Spinoza, Hegel was joined in this period by his countrymen [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. In the twentieth century, the ghost of Spinoza continued to show itself, for example in the writings of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]. Among writers of fiction and poetry, the students of Spinoza include [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], George Eliot, [[Herman Melville|Melville]], [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], and [[Bernard Malamud|Malamud]].

The first published Dutch translations were by the poet [[Herman Gorter]] (1895) &lt;ref&gt;publ. Loman en Funke, The Hague, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; and by Willem Meyer (1896) &lt;ref&gt;publ. Van Looy, Amsterdam, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; .

==Criticism==
{{importance section}}
===Misuse of words===
[[Schopenhauer]] claimed that Spinoza misused words. “Thus he calls ‘God’ that which is everywhere called ‘the world’; ‘justice’ that which is everywhere called ‘power’; and ‘will’ that which is everywhere called ‘judgement’.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', vol, I, “Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,” p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Also, “that concept of ''substance''...with the definition of which Spinoza accordingly begins...appears on close and honest investigation to be a higher yet unjustified abstraction of the concept ''matter''.”&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', vol, I, “Fragments for the History of Philosophy,” § 12, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his repeated objections and critical remarks, Schopenhauer incorporated some of Spinoza's fundamental concepts into his system, especially concerning the theory of emotions; there was also a striking similarity between Schopenhauer's will and Spinoza's substance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Henry Walter Bran, [http://secure.pdcnet.org/philhist/content/philhist_1971_4_1_0018_0018 ''Philosophy and History''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415153349/http://secure.pdcnet.org/philhist/content/philhist_1971_4_1_0018_0018 |date=2013-04-15 }}, on "Schopenhauer and Spinoza", Vol. 4, Issue 1, 1971, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical influence===
In fact, within the German philosophical sphere, Spinoza’s influence on [[German Idealism]] was remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;A very detailed examination of Spinoza’s influence on German Idealism is given in Jean-Marie Vaysse, ''Totalite et Subjectivite: Spinoza dans l’Idealisme Allemand'', Vrin, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He was both a challenge and inspiration for the three major figures of this movement: [[Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Fichte]] — who all sought to define their own philosophical positions in relation to his. Schopenhauer, who detested these three philosophers to varying degrees of intensity,&lt;ref&gt;His vicious attacks on Hegel stand out: once he called him "a commonplace, inane, loathsome, repulsive and ignorant charlatan..."{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/arthursc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007224123/http%3A//www%2Ekirjasto%2Esci%2Efi/arthursc%2Ehtm |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also had a similarly ambivalent relation to the Dutch philosopher. How Spinoza came to influence Schopenhauer is not clear, but one might speculate: it could have come from his exposure to Fichte’s lectures, from his  conversations with [[Goethe]] or simply from being caught up in the post-[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian attempt to rethink the [[Critical Philosophy]]. Still, his engagement with [[Spinozism]] is evident throughout his writings and attentive readers of his chief work may indeed note his ambivalence toward Spinoza’s philosophy. He sees in Spinoza an ally against the feverish culture of the West. For example, in the context of a rather favourable account of "the standpoint of affirmation" he notes that “[T]he philosophy of [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and that of Spinoza might also bring to this standpoint the person whose conviction was not shaken or weakened by their errors and imperfections”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', trans. E.F.G. Payne, Dover Books, 1958 [Voll. I &amp; II originally published in 1819 and 1844, respectively], Vol. I, 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in discussing Spinoza and Giordano Bruno, Schopenhauer also affirms that:

{{quote|They do not belong either to their age or to their part of the globe, which rewarded the one with death, and the other with persecution and ignominy. Their miserable existence and death in this Western world are like that of a tropical plant in Europe. The banks of the [[Ganges]] were their spiritual home; there they would have led a peaceful and honoured life among men of like mind.|''[[The World as Will and Representation|World]]'', I, 422, n. 2}}

Given Schopenhauer’s respect for [[Hindu philosophy]], comments like these indicate that he too felt intellectual kinship with Spinoza. Elsewhere, Schopenhauer points to more fundamental affinities, but he also criticizes Spinoza. These criticisms deal with fundamental disagreements about the ultimate nature of reality and whether it is to be affirmed or denied.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. essay by Bela Egyed, [http://philosophy.concordia.ca/documents/247.pdf "Spinoza, Schopenhauer and the Standpoint of Affirmation"], on ''PhaenEx'' 2, no. 1 (spring/summer 2007): pp. 110–131. The author argues that "Schopenhauer’s ambivalence toward Spinoza’s philosophy is a reflection of an inner tension within his own doctrine of the denial of the will-to-live, and that his criticisms of Spinoza are related to his rejection of the standpoint of affirmation. In addition ... if this tension is resolved in favour of the standpoint of affirmation, Schopenhauer’s own ethics turns out to be closer to Spinoza’s than he takes it to be." Egyed also offers a suggestion about the possible relation of Schopenhauer’s philosophy to two different strains of [[Buddhist philosophy]]: [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''François Zourabichvili''' (1965 – 19 April 2006) was a French philosopher specialized in the works of [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]].

==Biography==
François Zourabichvili was the son of composer [[Nicolas Zourabichvili]], nephew of historian [[Hélène Carrère d'Encausse]], and cousin of author [[Emmanuel Carrère]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Carrère. (2007). ''Un roman russe''. Paris: Pol.&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[agrégé]] in 1989 and earned his [[PhD]] in Philosophy in 1999. He taught at a [[lycee]] already from 1988 to 2001, was docent at [[Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III]], and a director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] from 1998 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmanencia.com/2010/07/vertiges-de-spinoza-tumba-para.html &amp;#91;Vertiges de Spinoza&amp;#93;: Tumba para ZOURABICHVILI"], ''Inmanencia'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He committed suicide in 2006 and is buried in the Russian Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris (XVIe arrondissement).

A year after Zourabichvili's death, the Collège international de philosophie and the [[École normale supérieure]] organized a colloquium upon ''Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili'' ("The physics of the thinking according to François Zourabichvili") led by [[Bruno Clément]] and [[Frédéric Worms]]. The event took place with the participation of [[Pierre Macherey]], [[Pierre-François Moreau]], [[Pierre Zaoui]], [[Paola Marrati]], [[Paul R. Patton]], [[Paolo Godani]] and [[Marie-France Badie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://revue-klesis.org/pdf/EDITO-FZ-1.pdf EDITO-FZ-1], Klesis Revue Philosophique, Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324044207/http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=129 |date=2008-03-24 }}, ''RhapSodyK'', Retrieved 24 March 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
François Zourabichvili worked primarily on the concepts of "''event''" and "''littéralité''", inspired by the philosophy of Deleuze.
In addition, he wrote about [[aesthetics]], a discipline in which he centered his interest for the purpose of finding relations between [[art]] and [[game]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actu-philosophia.com/spip.php?article354 François Zourabichvili : La littéralité et autres essais sur l’art.], ''ACTU PHILOSOPHIA'', Retrieved 01 February 2014 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published some articles about the films of [[Boris Barnet]] and [[Dziga Vertov]].

==Plot==
Aya, the most popular student of a [[Catholic school|Catholic all-girls school]], suddenly shuts herself in her room. Her admirer, Kasumi Nohara, kisses her photo at midnight and suddenly disappears with her friend Michi as a witness. Her disappearance is quickly attributed to a supposed curse that affects girls who kiss the photo of the person they admire at midnight. Aya's photo is taken to the attic by Sakuya Itsuki and Risa for safekeeping, but the two alongside three other girls are enticed to kiss the photo. Except for Risa, who is later found dazed but alive, all of them are eventually found dead at a nearby river.

When Michi attempts to kiss the photo, Aya stops her and reveals that she is not responsible for the curse, as the photo is not hers. They search help in Kazumi "Mary" Kusanagi, an eccentric photographer, who keeps photos inside her studio of [[lesbian]] girls who made [[suicide pact]] by drowning themselves at a lake, which is now closed down, due to the then society's intolerance towards same-sex couples. She also tells a story about a couple who was doomed when one of them refused to commit suicide, causing her to be haunted by her lover for the rest of her life. Aya then admits to Michi that she is haunted by the guilt of letting a fellow orphan of hers die in front of her. 

Michi decides to kiss the photo to put herself into the curse and chains herself to Aya so the latter can save her should she be in danger. However, the two are separated halfway through and Aya is knocked out by Takashi, the mentally handicapped brother of the school [[nun]], Mayumi Aso. She is thrown into a reservoir located at the place where the lesbian couples committed their suicides. There, Aya remembers that the doppelganger is in fact her twin sister, Maya. Though she died at an early age, Maya "grew up" alongside Aya and put a curse at the photo until Aya could find her in the reservoir. Meanwhile, Michi is about to be drowned by Mayumi, who is revealed to be the one murdering the girls so as to keep Takashi's supposed involvement in Maya's death a secret, but she chooses to drown herself with Takashi when the authorities are closing in. Michi goes to the reservoir and reunites with Aya.

Aya and Michi participate in the school [[choir]] celebrating their graduation. Meanwhile, Mary visits the school's headmistress and [[abbess]], correctly deducing her as the lesbian girl who was haunted by the spirit of her lover. The headmistress reveals that to keep her lover from bothering her, she murdered Maya so the latter could accompany her, though she is distressed when the act led to more murders by Mayumi, although her brother had nothing to do with it. After the choir, Michi bids Aya goodbye before she departs for [[Tokyo]] to attend a photography college. She is about to take a photo of her, but pulls up at the last second and makes Aya promise to wait for her until she has become a proper photographer.

==Reception==
The film has grossed {{KRW|213 million}} in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/san-andreas-rumbles-in-south-korea|title= San Andreas rumbles in South Korea|author= Kevin Ma|date= June 8, 2015|accessdate= June 9, 2015|work= [[Film Business Asia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Eisenbeis from [[Kotaku]] gave the film a positive review. He commented that the best aspect of the movie is the way in which it is told. Rather than focusing solely on Michi, the movie constantly shown the story through many viewpoints other than her own, which intertwining with each other and slowly expose the truth behind the mystery in the film. He found it interesting that a large portion of the story revolves around being a lesbian in Japan not only during the modern era, but also at Meiji era. He also noted that the movie's "intensely creepy and atmospheric" tone are what builds the fear, a feat many horror films could not hope to accomplish. However, he has a mixed review for the lack of ghost killing via camera in the film, which is supposed to be one of pivotal elements in the game franchise. Nevertheless, he noted that the movie is a film very much worthy of the Fatal Frame name, and stated that "if you are a fan of Fatal Frame or Japanese horror in general, this is most certainly a film to watch."&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/the-fatal-frame-movie-is-an-atmospheric-masterpiece-1646000260&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''early plays of [[Henry Fielding]]''' mark the beginning of Fielding's literary career. His early plays span the time period from his first production in 1728 to the beginning of the [[Actor Rebellion of 1733|Actor's Rebellion of 1733]], a strife within the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] that divided the theatrical community and threatened to disrupt London stage performances. These plays introduce Fielding's take on politics, gender, and morality and serve as an early basis for how Fielding develops his ideas on these matters throughout his career.

==Background==
Fielding first produced a play in February 1728. Although his first production, ''[[Love in Several Masques]]'', lasted only a few nights, it was the start of his career in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the [[Leiden University|University of Leyden]], but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]], in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an [[allowance (money)|allowance]] of 200 pounds a year.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is little evidence that Fielding lacked funds, or that such a lack of funds would cause him to leave Leyden to return to writing plays; Fielding eventually returned to Leyden on 22 February 1729. It is not known when or why Fielding left the school, but he produced ''[[The Temple Beau]]'' on 26 January 1730, which suggests that he returned to London by November 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his return, he had three plays, either still in draft form or complete: ''[[Don Quixote in England (play)|Don Quixote in England]]'', ''The Wedding-Day'' and ''The Temple Beau''. Of these, only ''The Temple Beau'' was accepted for the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

When Fielding returned to working with the Royal Theatre, his piece ''[[The Lottery (play)|The Lottery]]'' became an immediate success and lasted for decades after.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with ''[[The Modern Husband]]'', Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 126–129&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, only a handful of them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early plays==
The early plays include ''Love in Several Masques'', ''The Temple Beau'', ''[[The Author's Farce]]'', ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', ''[[Rape upon Rape]]'', ''[[The Tragedy of Tragedies]]'', ''[[The Letter Writers]]'', ''[[The Welsh Opera]]'', ''[[The Grub-Street Opera]]'', ''The Lottery'', ''The Modern Husband'', ''[[The Old Debauchees]]'', ''[[The Covent-Garden Tragedy]]'', and ''[[The Mock Doctor]]''. These plays start in 1727, when Fielding first worked on ''Love in Several Masques'', until the disruption of the winter 1732–1733 theatre season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson 2000 pp. 33–35&lt;/ref&gt; This disruption, caused by illness, management problems, and other incidents, started the [[Actor Rebellion of 1733]].&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 143, 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

===1727–1728===
''[[Love in Several Masques]]'' was Fielding's first play, and was first released on 16 February 1728. Though the play was never revived&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and only ran for four nights,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; it still did moderately well especially when compared with the competing plays at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and [[libertine]] beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

''Don Quixote in England'' was started as Fielding's second play, but it was not finished and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of ''Don Quixote in England''. It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was an imitation of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes's]] ''Don Quixote''. After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the play until 1733, when the [[Drury Lane|Drury-Lane]] actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wedding Day'' was started as his third play, but it was not finished until years later and finally brought out on both the stage and in print after his theatrical career ended. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of ''The Wedding-Day''. It was refused by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] to be staged, and it was not produced until 1743 by [[David Garrick]]. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's preface to the play in his ''Miscellanies'' (1743). In it, Fielding says that he intended the leads, Millamour and Charlotte, for [[Robert Wilks]] and [[Anne Oldfield]]. However, Oldfield died before the play could be produced, and Fielding and Wilks got into a fight, which made it impossible for Fielding to convince him to join the production.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

===1729–1730===
Fielding started work on his fourth play, ''The Temple Beau'', in April 1729, but did not finish until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Rejected by his first theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; the play had to be performed at another one, where it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on [[hypocrisy]] and [[gender equality]] in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's fifth play, ''The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town'', first opened on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and initially ran for 41 nights, which marked it as a major success. The play incorporates Fielding's response to Drury Lane and their previous rejection of his works. It also contains a third act, a puppet show, that pokes fun at theatre and the literary community as a whole. The play was revived many times in its original format&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 pp. 192–197&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the medium of puppet show for its entire format.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight 1990 p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The plot focuses on Harry Luckless, an author, as he attempts to have a successful writing career, pursue women, dodge his landlady, and eventually put on a show within the show. To emphasise the literary satire, Fielding introduced his persona "Scriblerus Secundus" and adopts the tradition of the Scriblerus Club.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tom Thumb'', Fielding's sixth play, was added to the ninth showing of ''The Author's Farce'', 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were replaced by Fielding's next production, ''Rape upon Rape''. ''Tom Thumb'' was later included with other productions, including ''Rape upon Rape'', and later transformed into the ''Tragedy of Tragedies''.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the print edition, Fielding added footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, which introduced the narratorial style found in Fielding's later works.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The plot deals with the English hero, Tom Thumb, who is of only tiny proportions. After defeating a group of giants, Tom Thumb is handsomely rewarded by King Arthur, which later erupts in a comical love triangle between Tom, Arthur's wife Queen Dollalolla, and Princess Huncamunca.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 61–63&lt;/ref&gt; Tom is eventually swallowed by a cow and killed. Soon after, his ghost appears but meets an untimely death. This scene reportedly provoked Jonathan Swift to laughter, a rare feat.&lt;ref&gt;Hillhouse 1918 note p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The farcical nature of Tom Thumb pokes fun at 17th and 18th-century tragedy,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; gender roles and gender politics.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1995 pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's seventh play, ''Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap'', was a five-act comedic play that first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success until it was renamed ''The Coffee-House Politician'' and was altered to possibly update the play as it focused on mocking current news events.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 pp. 405–417&lt;/ref&gt; The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 80–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1731===
[[File:FrontispieceTragedyOfTragedies.png|right|thumb|Frontistpiece to ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'' by Hogarth]]

Fielding's expanded version of ''Tom Thumb'', ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', first ran on 24 March 1731. Its printed edition was "edited" and "commented" on by Fielding's pseudonym H. Scriblerus Secundus who pretends not to be the original author,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 70–73&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains a frontispiece by Hogarth, which serves as the earliest proof of a relationship between Fielding and Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden 1966 p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; There are few major changes to the plot's outline except that Grizzle became Tom's rival for Huncamunca's heart, and Tom is not killed by Grizzle. Instead, Tom is able to defeat Grizzle, which changes the outcome of the play. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on faulty language and Fielding emphasises the problems within poorly written tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's ninth play, the unsuccessful ''The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home'', ran for four nights as a companion piece to ''The Tragedy of Tragedies''&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon after replaced by ''The Welsh Opera'' on 22 April 1731.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs and how they attempt to keep their wives faithful. The immoral characters are forgiven within the play and there is a lack of moral commentary within the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth play and new companion piece to ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', ''The Welsh Opera'', ran many times until it was expanded into ''The Grub-Street Opera''. The expanded version of the play, ''The Grub-Street Opera'', was not put on for an audience, which provoked E. Rayner to print ''The Welsh Opera'' without Fielding's consent.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The play serves both as a tribute to the Scriblerians, especially Gay and Gay's ''The Beggar's Opera'', and to put forth a political allegory that satirises [[Robert Walpole|Walpole's]] government and the British monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it mocked the feud between Walpole and [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Pulteney]], a Privy Councillor.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 II pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The expanded and altered version of ''The Welsh Opera'', ''The Grub-Street Opera'', was first rehearsed in May 1731,&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; but it never ran on stage. It was printed and exists in a complete printed format,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that it was not performed because of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Goldgar 1976 p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Its original printing was done without Fielding's consent,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; and it is uncertain as to when Fielding's official version of the play was printed.&lt;ref&gt;Morrissey 1973 pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The plot focuses on a standard love story but with characters that exhibit less than virtuous characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The title pokes fun at the ''Grub Street Journal'' and also links to the theme within the plot of attacking theatre in general.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt;

===1732===
After Fielding returned to working with the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote ''The Lottery'', which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's ''Cato''. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and those who support it.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's thirteenth play, ''The Modern Husband'', first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 nights at Drury Lane, rivalling the run of the ''Provok'd Husband'' and ''Zara'' for production length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 122–126&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Old Debauchees'', originally titled ''The Despairing Debauchee'', appeared with ''The Covent-Garden Tragedy'' on 1 June 1732. The play ran for six nights and was later paired with ''The Mock Doctor''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 129–133&lt;/ref&gt; The play was later revived to attack Catholics during the disputes with the Stuarts between 1745 and 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary 1984 pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; The play alludes to the 1731 trial of Father Girard, a Jesuit tried for using magic during an attempted seduction/rape of a young girl. The nature of the attacks against Catholicism within the play undermines the overall humour of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 130–132&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Covent-Garden Tragedy'' appeared with ''The Old Debauchees'', it was not a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 129–132&lt;/ref&gt; After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson 2000 pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the first night fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with ''Don Quixote in England'', once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's sixteenth play, ''The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd'', replaced ''The Covent Garden Tragedy'' as the companion play to ''The Old Debauchees''. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's ''Le Medecin malgre Lui''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; It first ran on 23 June 1732&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 136–138&lt;/ref&gt; and was later revised in 1732; both versions were very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute to avoid having to marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and concern==
In 1728, John Gay's ''The Beggar's Opera'' was extremely successful and ran for 62 times during the season, an unprecedented length of time.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The play began to change London theatre through the introduction of political themes and experimentation in form. Following this trend, Fielding pushed politics into the forefront of his plays. This provoked criticism from all sides, including from the playwright Colley Cibber.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Beggar's Opera'' is not Fielding's only influence; Fielding is part of the theatrical tradition surrounding him, and, as Harold Pagliaro points out, "Fielding's first play, like all those to follow, is among other things an accommodation to the world of theatre in which he worked."&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding was concerned with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in the actions of the character Merital in ''Love in Several Masques'' in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of his characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading and how reading defines characters is a focus within many plays and in Fielding's later works. In ''Love in Several Masques'', the character Wisemore focuses on classics but ignores contemporary society. Similarly, the character Wilding, in ''The Temple Beau'', practices law but doesn't read at all. Reading is an outlet to understanding humanity, and Fielding uses his plays to inform an audience how to better understand humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Morality and moral characters was an important concern within Fielding's works, and his first play serves as a representation for Fielding's believes surrounding the relationship between morality and libertine beliefs that is found throughout his work. The plays also introduces most of the character types that Fielding would reuse throughout his plays and novels. However, his use of libertine themes and characters served as a way for those like Pat Rogers to believe that Fielding lacked an orthodox understanding of Christianity; he believes that Fielding was harsh towards hypocrisy but not against other actions.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Rogers claims, "Fielding was generous enough in that sphere of morality, however implacable he might be in his larger political and religious attachment. Provided that soldiers were brave and loyal he did not require their lives to be models of absolute purity."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1979 p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Tiffany Potter follows this idea by claiming, "Eliminating a moral imperative to drama (and to life in general) gives Fielding the liberty to create unconventional characters and to set plays anywhere from ballrooms to brothels without having to defend anything more than his own stance on issues. The necessity of even that defence, however, is usually negated by his libertine belief in privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
Gender plays a large role within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral shortcomings or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with ''Love in Several Masques'', the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are the results of the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] extended into politics, especially within ''Tom Thumb''. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as ''Love in Several Masques'' and continues throughout, especially in prose parody ''Shamela'' where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1995 pp. 20–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding does not limit his analysis of gender roles to just the living; the image of the ghost plays a significant part in many of Fielding's plays, including ''The Author's Farce'', the ''Tom Thumb'' plays, and ''The Covent Garden Tragedy''. Even though Fielding fails to explain what the existence of ghosts means, the image of the ghost can serve as a metaphor for Fielding's expectation of women who are supposed to be publicly virtuous. According to Campbell,
&lt;blockquote&gt;woman bears the representational burden for Fielding of his disappointment about the relation between internal and external selves, as, culturally, she must sustain the realm of private life, interior feeling, and personal identity apart from the public and commercial world of the male; inevitably, then, she must fail Fielding through her reliance on the 'harlotry' of pomp, ostentation, or the drama of self-display if she is to be a part of this world. And yet, he fears her alternative fate as a ghost as well, though he may seem to wish it on her.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1995 p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not every critic sees that Fielding sets up an inevitable fall for women. Potter argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful in the hands of a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Counter to Campbell, Potter seems to emphasise how gender is removed and emphasises that Fielding sees gender as a social construct. There is a balancing of the genders and neither is favoured over the other. To Potter, "Only the weakening of humanity through cross-adoption of the most ridiculous qualities of either gender is attacked in Fielding's plays."&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The reception of Fielding's plays received early recognition; his early plays placed him in a position of popularity alongside Gay.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
George Bernard Shaw believed that Fielding was "the greatest practising dramatist, with the single exception of Shakespeare, produced in England between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw 1963 p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern critics rarely agree with Shaw, as Robert Hume points out, "Few scholars have been much interested in Fielding's highly successful career as a dramatist. To most it has seemed a false start. Readers tend to find the conventional plays derivative and sentimental, the topical ones scrappy and superficial."&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1985 p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, only one book until 1988 was published on the topic, which was Ducrocq's ''Le theatre de Fielding, 1728–1737, et ses prolongements dans l'oeuvre romanesque''. This critical approach is not limited to just Fielding, but to the whole field;&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. ix–xi&lt;/ref&gt; the reputation of Colley Cibber was ruined by Pope's characterising him as the Arch Dunce and "Since the plays of Cibber's only serious rival, Henry Fielding, are hardly even read these days, let alone performed, the earlier eighteenth-century theater tends to be passed over with (at best) a polite cough."&lt;ref&gt;Varey 1985 p. 6, qtd by Rivero p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Paul Hunter believes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fielding's plays do not prophesy that he will become a major novelist, but the direction of his theatrical career does suggest concerns that increasingly led him away from pure representation [...] Fielding's separation from the theatre was a forced one, but the expulsion was fortunate, freeing him from a relationship and commitment that had always been in some sense against the grain [...] Fielding's way is not really very dramatic, either in novels or in plays; he never developed stage-likely objective correlatives, having reserved his artistic energy for the examining process in which the action is rerun again and again, reviewed, considered, nearly masticated.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter 1975 p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Albert Rivero, ten of the plays "mark significant moments in [Fielding's] theatrical life": ''Love in Several Masques'', ''The Temple Beau'', ''The Author's Farce'', ''Tom Thumb'', ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', ''Rape upon Rape'', ''The Grub Street Opera'', ''The Modern Husband'', ''Pasquin'', and ''The Historical Register''.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Potter organised the plays by a general theme of developing libertine characters and believed that "Fielding's most successful group of plays followed ''Love in Several Masques'' both chronologically and thematically. Comedies and burlesques such as ''The Author's Farce'', ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', ''The Old Debauchees'', and ''Pasquin'' made Fielding the most popular playwright of the 1730s, and all of these plays contain characters, situations, and dialogues that invoke libertine philosophy in some way, thought they vary in the explicitness of the depiction."&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of Fielding, Pagliaro declares that "Between 1727 and 1737, by which time he was only 30 years old, Fielding became England's most successful living playwright."&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6509">The '''ICMJE recommendations''' (full title, '''''Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals''''') are a set of guidelines produced by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for standardising the [[ethics]], preparation and formatting of [[manuscript]]s submitted for publication by [[biomedical]] journals.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations&gt;{{Citation |author=ICMJE |title=Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals |url=http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf |postscript=.|date=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compliance with the ICMJE Recommendations is required by most leading biomedical journals. As of 2017, over ~3274 journals worldwide followed the Uniform Requirements.&lt;ref name="ICMJEjournallist"&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Journals that have Requested Inclusion on the List of Publications that follow the ICMJE's Uniform Requirements For Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals [homepage on the Internet]. Philadelphia: ICMJE; c2005 [updated 27 May 2006; cited 30 May 2006]. Available from: [http://www.icmje.org/journals.html http://www.icmje.org/journals.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations were formerly called the '''''Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals''''' (abbreviated '''URMs''' and often shortened to '''''Uniform Requirements''''').

==International Committee of Medical Journal Editors==
The '''International Committee of Medical Journal Editors''' ('''ICMJE''') was originally known as the '''Vancouver Group''', after the location of their first meeting in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] in [[Canada]]. {{As of|2017}} members of the ICMJE are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/icmje-membership/ |title=ICMJE Membership |publisher=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citation style==
{{Main|Vancouver system}}

The citation style recommended by the ICMJE Recommendations, which is also known as the [[Vancouver system]], is the style used by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), codified in ''[[Citing Medicine]]''.

References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text&amp;nbsp;– they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] enclosed in [[bracket|parentheses]].

Example of a journal citation:

==Manuscripts describing human interventional clinical trials==
URM includes a mandate for manuscripts describing human interventional trials to register a trial in a clinical trial registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) and to include the trial registration ID in the abstract of the article. The URM also requires that this registration is done prior enrolling the first participant. A study of five high impact factor journals (founders of [[ICMJE]]) showed that only 89% of published articles (articles published during   2010-2011; about trials that completed in 2008) were properly registered prior enrolling the first participant.&lt;ref name=adherence&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Cimino | first2 = J.

==Disclosure of Competing Interests==
The ICMJE also developed a uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Drazen JM, Van der Weyden MB, Sahni P, Rosenberg J, Marusic A, Laine C, Kotzin S, Horton R, Hébert PC, Haug C, Godlee F, Frizelle FA, de Leeuw PW, DeAngelis CD |title=Uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in ICMJE journals |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=19 |pages=1896–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19825973 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0909052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grey literature==
The ''Uniform Requirements'' were adapted by the Grey Literature International Steering Committee [[GLISC]] for the production of scientific and technical [[reports]] included in the wider category of [[grey literature]]. These ''GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports'' are translated to French, German, Italian and Spanish and are available on the GLISC website [https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235208/http://www.glisc.info/].

== History ==
The IGNCA was launched on 19 November 1985 by Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi at a function where the symbolism of the components was clearly articulated at different levels. The elements - fire, water, earth, sky and vegetation - were brought together. Five rocks from five major rivers - Sindhu ([[Indus]]), [[Ganga]], [[Kaveri]], [[Mahanadi]] and the [[Narmada]] (where the most ancient ammonite fossils are found) were composed into sculptural forms. These remain at the site as reminders of the antiquity of Indian culture and the sacredness of her rivers and rocks.

The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts Trust was constituted and registered at New Delhi on 24 March 1987.
==About==
The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, established in memory of Indira Gandhi, is visualised as a centre encompassing the study and experience of all the arts—each form with its own integrity, yet within a dimension of mutual interdependence, interrelated with nature, social structure and cosmology.

==Location==
Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts&lt;br /&gt;
1, C. V. Mess, Janpath,&lt;br /&gt;
New Delhi - 110 001 (India)

*to provide a forum for dialogue through performances, exhibitions, multi-media projections, conferences, seminars and workshops on traditional and contemporary Indian arts;
*to foster dialogue between the arts and current ideas in philosophy, science and technology, with a view toward bridging the gap in intellectual understanding between modern sciences and arts and culture;
*to evolve models of research programmes and arts administration pertinent to the Indian ethos;
*to elucidate the formative and dynamic factors in the complex web of interactions between diverse social strata, communities and regions;

'''Jean-Jacques Scherrer''' (1855–1916) was a French [[Academic art|academic painter]]. Now largely forgotten, his historical paintings earned him considerable attention in his day.&lt;ref name=lutterbach&gt;[http://www.histoire-lutterbach.com/pdf/Personnalit%C3%A9s1.pdf "Jean Jacques Scherrer"], ''Histoire-Lutterbac.com''. {{fr icon}}. Retrieved 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born in [[Lutterbach]] in [[Alsace]], Scherrer was brought up by his uncle following the death of his father when he was only 6 years old. After leaving school, he worked at the Haeffley factory in [[Pfastatt]] where his talent for drawing was noticed by one of the directors. In 1871, after the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] he chose French nationality and moved to Paris where he was taught by [[Pierre-Jules Cavelier]] in the studio of [[Félix-Joseph Barrias]]. Barrias encouraged him to continue his studies at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] where he came under the guidance of [[Alexandre Cabanel]], whose academic style he closely followed.&lt;ref name=lutterbach/&gt;

==Career==
Although Scherrer began to exhibit in 1877, it was his ''Résurrection du fils de la veuve de Naïm'' at the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture|Salon de l'Académie de Peinture]] which established his reputation. In 1881, his painting '' L'Assassinat du maréchal Brune'' was received with particular success, earning him a stipendium which allowed him to spend two years in Italy. On his return to Paris in 1883, he painted ''Beaurepaire, la capitulation de Verdun, le 2 septembre 1792''. He went on to receive awards for '' L'Entrée de Jeanne d'Arc à Orléans, victorieuse des Anglais'' (1887) and ''Isabeau de Bavière'' (1889), exhibited the same year at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], and ''Charlotte Corday à Caen'' (1892). At the end of the century, after decorating the SEITA pavilion for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]], he was made a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name=lutterbach/&gt;

In addition to his academic works which were painted with almost photographic precision, Scherrer also painted nudes and copied the works of [[Raphael|Raphaël]] in Italy and those of other masters exhibited in the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]. He also painted landscapes of northern France, the Netherlands and Italy, and [[genre painting]]s including ''Joueurs de dames''. Other important works are ''Rachel déclamant la tragédie de Phèdre, devant Alfred de Musset'' and ''L'Heure du lait en Haute Alsace''. He also painted animals (''Chevaux à l'abri'') and portraits (''Gaston Roullet'').

For a period of 32 years, Scherrer exhibited his works in Paris, Barcelona, Chicago and Tunis. Today they can be seen in France, Canada and the United States. Following his death in Paris in May 1916, there was an exhibition of his work in 1920. In 2006, a large exhibition of his work was held in his native [[Lutterbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemap.dna.fr/articles/200607/04/belle-retrospective,culture-et-loisirs,000001710.php "Belle rétrospective"], ''DNA''. {{fr icon}} Retrieved 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although Scherrer is not well known today, eclipsed as he is by contemporary impressionists, he was well received in the early 20th century. A commentator for the ''Journal d'Alsace'' wrote: "Scherrer's is characterized by constant attention to form and composition. A powerful [[Colourist painting|colourist]], with the gift of a fruitful imagination, our famous countryman is one of the most highly esteemed artists of our times."&lt;ref&gt;''Journal d'Alsace'', 6 October 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1880, Scherrer married Mathilde Haquette, a porcelain decorator at the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres factory]]. They had two children: Jean who died at sea when he was 18, and Lucie-Marthe (1884–1979) who was very close to her father.

'''Jerome "Jerry" Balmuth''' (May 8, 1924 - September 28, 2017) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] and the Harry Emerson Fosdick Professor of Philosophy and Religion, Emeritus, at [[Colgate University]] in [[Hamilton, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerome Balmuth|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/uticaod/obituary.aspx?pid=186821402|publisher=The Observer-Dispatch|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Balmuth developed his interest in philosophy after high school, when he enrolled in a philosophy night course at the [[City College of New York]]. In 1944 he joined the [[United States Army]] and was assigned to a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] unit. He subsequently attended [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)|officer candidate school]] and was commissioned as a second lieutenant, transferring to the military police. In 1948 he was discharged at the rank of first lieutenant. Balmuth then attended [[Amherst College]] on the [[G.I. Bill]]. After graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and [[magna cum laude]] from Amherst, Balmuth entered graduate school at [[Cornell University]], where he held a Sage Fellowship, and later, a [[Danforth Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Gary|title=An Extended Season of Deeds|url=http://www4.colgate.edu/scene/july2004/balmuth.html|work=The Colgate Scene|publisher=Colgate University}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Robert|title=Marxist Social Thought|date=1968|publisher=Harcourt Brace|location=New York|page=Introduction}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|last=Balmuth|first=Jerome|title=The Illusion of Sameness|url=http://colgate.imodules.com/s/801/scene_inside_2col.aspx?id=801&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2581|work=The Colgate Scene|publisher=Colgate University|accessdate=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JuanTamad.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal'' (The life lived by Lazy John, son of Fabio and Sofia in the Kingdom of Portugal"), published in 1919]]
'''''Juan Tamad''''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for "Lazy John") is a character in [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[folklore]] noteworthy for extreme [[laziness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Filipinos: Folklore | url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Norway-to-Russia/Filipinos.html | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually portrayed as a child, although in some interpretations, he is said to be a young man.

==Stories==
Arguably, the ''Juan Tamad'' story most often told illustrates his utmost laziness to the point of stupidity that it becomes [[comedy|comedic]]. In it, Juan Tamad comes upon a [[guava]] tree bearing ripe fruit. Being too slothful to climb the tree and take the fruits, he instead decides to lie beneath the tree and let [[gravity]] do its work. There he remained, waiting for the fruit to fall into his gaping mouth.

Other ''Juan Tamad'' stories include:
* ''Juan Tamad and the Mud Crabs"
: Juan Tamad is instructed by his mother to purchase [[Scylla serrata|mud crab]]s at the market. Being too lazy to carry them home, he sets them free in a ditch and tells them to go on home, as he would be along later.

* "Juan Tamad and the Rice Cakes"
: Juan Tamad's mother makes some [[Puto|rice cake]]s and instructs him to sell these at the market. Passing by a pond, he sees frogs swimming to and fro. Being too lazy to sell the cakes at the market, he instead throws them at the frogs, who eat the cakes. Upon reaching home, he tells his mother that all the cakes had been sold on credit; the buyers would pay for them the next week.

* "''Juan Tamad and the Flea-Killer''"
: ''Juan Tamad'''s mother instructs him to go to the village market and buy a rice pot. A [[flea]] infestation in the village soon has ''Juan Tamad'' jumping and scratching for all he's worth; he lets go of the pot and it breaks into pieces. Thinking quickly, he picks up the pieces, grinds them into fine powder and wraps the powder in [[banana]] leaves, which he markets as "flea-killer."

* "''Juan Tamad takes a Bride''"
: ''Juan Tamad'''s mother tells him it is time he took a bride. He asks his mother what sort of woman should he look for. His mother replies "a woman of a few words." ''Juan Tamad'' searches long and hard, but all the women he encounters seem to talk too much. Finally, he comes upon a house where an old woman and her daughter live. Upon seeing the girl, he proposes "Will you marry me?" The girl simply stares at him. He tells himself, "Ah, here is a woman of a few words," and lifts her up and takes her back to his mother. His mother chastises him, for he had brought back a corpse.

==Books==
A book published by an unknown author in 1919 in [[Manila]] entitled ''Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "The Life lived by Juan Tamad, son of Fabio and Sofia, in the Kingdom of Portugal") contains a poem consisting of 78 pages of four-line [[stanza]]s at seven stanzas per page. It tells of how ''Juan Tamad'' was born to a couple named Fabio and Sofia, and his adventures in [[Portugal]].

In 1957, Manuel E. Arguilla (author of ''How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife'') and Lyd Arguilla wrote the book ''Philippine Tales and Fables'' which included the story of Juan Tamad with illustrations by Romeo V. Tabuena. In 1965, playwright and publisher Alberto Florentino took the Arguillas' re-telling of Juan Tamad and published it as ''Stories of Juan Tamad,'' part of a series of 3 booklets for young readers. Illustrated with woodcuts by the late J. Elizalde Navarro (post-humously declared National Artist for Visual Arts), the book is out-of-print and is now considered a collector's item.

==Films==
Several Filipino [[film]]s have treated ''Juan Tamad'' as a central or supporting character.
* ''Si Juan Tamad '', released in 1947 and directed by [[Manuel Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Si  Juan Tamad| url=https://italian.imdb.com/title/tt0791573/combined | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad Goes to Congress'', released in 1960 and directed by [[Manuel Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad Goes to Congress | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436458/#comment | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad Junior'' released in 1980, features [[Niño Muhlach]] as Juan Tamad Jr. and [[Manuel Conde]] as Juan Tamad Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad Junior | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1167640/ | accessdate = 2000-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mongolian Barbecue The Movie'', released in 1991, features director [[Manuel Urbano, Jr.]]'s television character [[Mr. Shooli]] and [[Eric Quizon]] as ''Juan Tamad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Mongolian Barbecue The Movie | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437337/ | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Juan Tamad'', released in 1993, again bills [[Eric Quizon]] as ''Juan Tamad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Juan Tamad | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0441330/ | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
* GMA 7 had also launched their newest comedy serye, ''Juan Tamad'' with StarStruck Alumni Sef Cadayona, Max Collins, RJ Padilla, Stephanie Sol, &amp; more, the show was premiering on August 23, 2015, a part of GMA 7's 65th Anniversary Offering.

==In Philippine folklore==
{{main article|Philippine mythical creatures}}
''Juan Tamad'' is a man who is buried by monkeys who, because of his laziness, thought he was long dead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35548">The following '''is a list of unproduced [[Kamal Haasan]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, Indian film actor-director [[Kamal Haasan]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his acting commitments or direction. Some of these projects fell into [[development hell]] or were officially cancelled.

== 1980s ==
=== ''Khabardar'' ===
Telugu director [[Tatineni Rama Rao]] started working on the film in 1984, which was a social drama centred upon a terminally ill patient and a doctor. [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]] worked on the film which revolved around the notion of euthanasia. However, after shooting a substantial portion of the film, it was shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mid-day.com/photos/sunday-rewind-bollywood-films-that-never-released/4737/41951|title=Sunday rewind: Bollywood films that never released|website=mid-day}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Untitled adaptation of ''The Godfather'' ===
In the mid-1980s, [[Muktha Srinivasan]] planned to direct a film based on the American film ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) with [[Sivaji Ganesan]], Kamal Haasan and [[Amala Akkineni|Amala]]. He paid them an [[Advance payment|advance]] and confirmed their dates; however the project was dropped after Kamal Haasan's then associate Ananthu felt that it would be a Ganesan-focused film and not a Kamal film.&lt;ref name="GLORY"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/living-in-past-glory/article4034360.ece |title=Living in past glory |last=Srinivasan |first=Muktha V. |date=28 October 2012 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=22 February 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6NtT7DnHh?url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/living-in-past-glory/article4034360.ece |archive-date=7 March 2014 |dead-url=no |author-link=Muktha Srinivasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1990s ==
=== ''Athi Veerapandiyan'' ===
In the early 1990s, [[Gangai Amaran]] agreed terms to direct a film titled ''Athi Veerapandiyan'' starring Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The film was based on [[jallikattu]] and [[Aishwarya (actress)|Aishwarya]] was signed to portray the leading female role. However Kamal Haasan later opted out of the film and instead began work on another rural drama, ''[[Thevar Magan]]'' (1992), directed by [[Bharathan]]. He later credited Gangai Amaran for the idea of the song "Sandhu Pottu" from the film, which was initially meant for ''Athi Veerapandiyan''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayyam.com/talk/archive/index.php/t-9820-p-10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Gangai Amaran alleged that his brother [[Ilaiyaraaja]] had effectively told Kamal Haasan to stop working on the project, during an ego clash between the two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiaglitz.com/gangai-amaran-says-illayaraja-and-kamal-haasan-cheated-him-tamil-news-161513&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Kanden Seethaiyai'' ===
{{see|Kanden Seethaiyai (unreleased film)}}
[[Balachandra Menon]] wanted to remake his Malayalam film ''[[Ammayane Sathyam]]'' (1993) into Tamil, and turned down remake offers from other directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/soc.culture.tamil/sbJZSuIwTZs|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Raveendran signed on Kamal Haasan to do the film and recruited [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]] to take another role.&lt;ref name=KSeethayae&gt;{{cite journal|title=Commentry - Bhagyathinte Marukara|journal=[[Vellinakshatram (magazine)|Vellinakshatram]]|date=7 January 1996 |pages= 28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team initially approached [[Annie (actress)|Annie]], who starred in the original to reprise her role as the lead female character, though her reluctance meant that the team picked newcomer Ruchita Prasad, who adopted a stage name of Jayasandhya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/soc.culture.tamil/sandya$20sitaraman/soc.culture.tamil/1EPmpEGDWEg/8xqXWn0UH2YJ|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The makers abandoned the project due to creative differences. It was later alleged that Kamal Haasan had wanted his role to be more prominent than the character from the original version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=13 Movies that were shot, but got shelved|url=http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/slideshow/13-movies-that-were-shot-but-got-shelved/chinnamani-kuyile-1987.html|publisher=Behindwoods.com|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=News - Kamal joins ''Indian''|journal=[[Vellinakshatram (magazine)|Vellinakshatram]]|date=21 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on ''[[Avvai Shanmughi]]'' (1996), and recruited several members of the cast of ''Kanden Seethaiyai'' to work on his next project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayyam.com/talk/archive/index.php/t-9820-p-10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Ladies Only'' ===
{{see|Ladies Only}}
A remake of the Tamil film ''[[Magalir Mattum]]'' (1994), the film is yet to have a theatrical release for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No day, no show-30 Bollywood movies that never were released|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/30-bollywood-movies-that-never-were-released/1/181061.html|publisher=India Today|date=2006-07-03|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood films that never released|url=http://www.mid-day.com/photos/bollywood-films-that-never-released/4737/41950|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by Kamal Haasan, ''Ladies Only'' is the story of three women, Seema Biswas, Shilpa Shirodkar and Heera Rajagopal working in the same office. They are constantly harassed by their lecherous boss Randhir Kapoor. The three decide to gang up against him to teach a lesson, but a strange accident complicates things when the boss lands in a hospital and the three women end up with the dead body of a terrorist, played by Kamal Haasan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindi remake of "Magalir Mattum"|url=http://members.tripod.com/s_jagadish/kamal/ladies.html|publisher=tripod.com|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ladies Only-A Preview|url=http://www.asiangigs.com/ladies.htm|publisher=asiangigs.com|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Marudhanayagam'' ===
{{see|Marudhanayagam}}
Kamal Haasan had been pondering directing a historical film for a period of four to five years, when writer [[Sujatha Rangarajan|Sujatha]] suggested that Kamal Haasan looked at a [[Folk music|folk]] ballad edited by Tamil scholar Vanamamalai, which introduced them to the historical figure of [[Muhammed Yusuf Khan]], an 18th-century warrior.&lt;ref name="sujatha"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sudhakar |url=http://www.oocities.org/sujathapage/english/einterview1.html |title=Interview with Sujatha |publisher=Oocities.org |date=1998-05-17 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan immediately agreed at the prospect and felt that the story had all the potential of a good historical film, being appealed to by the elevation from the nadir to the top of Khan's life. Sujatha revealed that nearly 80% of the film would faithfully adapt Samuel Charles Hill's biography of Khan, also known as Marudhanayagam, and to only use imagination where no solid or substantial information is available.&lt;ref name="sujatha"/&gt;

The producers and Kamal Haasan managed to rope in Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to appear as the chief guest at the launch of the project which took place in the MGR Film City on 16 October 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/99CA44DC65DFBC7465256941001E4BCD |title=Dose of Indian culture leaves Queen shoeless, speechless - The Times of India |publisher=Cscsarchive.org:8081 |date=1997-10-17 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch also saw the inaugural shot canned with Kamal Haasan, in the persona of Marudhanayagam, hearing and reacting to an imperial announcement read out by the character played by [[Nassar]], with [[Om Puri]]'s character looking on.&lt;ref name="redlaunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/oct/16queen.htm |title=Rediff On The NeT: Queen Elizabeth visits Kamal Hassan set |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official filming began several months later in [[Kottaiyur|Velangudi]] on 10 August 1998 with a scene of where a companion of the lead character, played by Kamal Haasan, is hanged prompting a brief altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/News/98/October/pnews_11159.html |title=Marudhanayagam Update! |publisher=Indolink.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Londonil Kameshwaran'' ===
{{see|Nala Damayanthi}}
Kamal Haasan had written the script of ''Londonil Kameshwaran'' and wanted to play the lead role in the late 1990s, but never got down to making it because he felt it would not have been cost-effective.&lt;ref name="rediff2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/entertai/2003/jun/21sand.htm |title='Someone has taken a political ride on my vehicle' - Rediff.com India News |publisher=Inhome.rediff.com |date=2003-06-21 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the project, he had aimed to reprise his character of the [[Palakkad]] [[Brahmin]] cook Kameshwaran from ''[[Michael Madana Kama Rajan]]'' (1990) and place him in funny situations when he visits [[London]]. He had briefly considered making the film in early 1999 after ''[[Marudhanayagam]]'' had run into production troubles, but instead chose to prioritise his commitments for ''[[Hey Ram]]'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.rediff.com/movies/1999/mar/10ss.htm|title=Rediff On The NeT, Movies: Gossip from the southern film industry|website=m.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the profitable ''[[Pammal K. Sambandam]]'' (2002), Mouli asked Haasan to re-collaborate with this particular script but Haasan was uninterested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://election.rediff.com/movies/2003/feb/15mouli.htm |title=Director Mouli on Nala Damayanthi&amp;nbsp;— Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Election.rediff.com |date=2003-02-15 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]] was selected by Haasan to replace him, after the pair had shot for ''[[Anbe Sivam]]'' together in the period, and the project was made under Haasan's production house with the title of ''[[Nala Damayanthi]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mypage.rediff.com/movies/2003/jan/09kamal.htm |title=Kamal Haasan and Madhavan on their film Anbesivam |publisher=Mypage.rediff.com |date=2003-01-09 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Robot'' ===
{{see|Enthiran}}
Following the completion of his first directorial venture in Hindi, ''[[Nayak (2001 Hindi film)|Nayak]]'' (2001), [[S. Shankar]] announced his next project, ''Robot'', which was to feature Kamal Haasan and [[Preity Zinta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/others/news-interviews/Shankars-Endhiran-to-become-a-reality-soon/articleshow/6215072.cms? |title=Shankar's Endhiran to become a reality soon |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=26 July 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118101009/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/others/news-interviews/Shankars-Endhiran-to-become-a-reality-soon/articleshow/6215072.cms |archivedate=18 January 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BZ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/jan/02south.htm | title=Boys Zone | publisher=[[Rediff.com]] | date=2 January 2002 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118101218/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/jan/02south.htm | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was to be produced by the now-defunct company Media Dreams, a division of [[Pentamedia Graphics]].&lt;ref name = "BZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Govardan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-01-05/news/28413738_1_rajinikanth-lulla-owned-eros-multimedia | title=Rajinikanth replaces Shah Rukh Khan in India's costliest movie | work=The Economic Times | date=5 January 2008 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | last=Govardan | first=D. | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126124918/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-01-05/news/28413738_1_rajinikanth-lulla-owned-eros-multimedia | archivedate=26 January 2013 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was reported to be a futuristic [[techno-thriller]] set in Chennai in around 2200 or 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2004/08/16/stories/2004081600740200.htm | title=Man vs. machine | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=16 August 2004 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118100919/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2004/08/16/stories/2004081600740200.htm | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/movies/nirav-and-sabu-sign-up-for-robot-news-tamil-kkfuh8aidcdsi.html | title=Nirav and Sabu sign up for Robot! | publisher=[[Sify]] | date=9 January 2008 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118162759/http://www.sify.com/movies/nirav-and-sabu-sign-up-for-robot-news-tamil-kkfuh8aidcdsi.html | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the completion of a photoshoot featuring Haasan and Zinta,&lt;ref name="RFR"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/article566585.ece | title=Ready for Robot? | work=The Hindu | date=12 August 2010 | accessdate=18 September 2010 | last=Rangarajan | first=Malathi | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118103719/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/article566585.ece | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project was shelved as a result of scheduling conflicts with Haasan.&lt;ref name="Fate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/script-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article982047.ece | title=Script decides the fate of the movie | work=The Hindu | date=27 December 2010 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | last=Tankha | first=Madhur | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118101504/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/script-decides-the-fate-of-the-movie/article982047.ece | archivedate=18 January 2015 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shankar consequently started work on ''[[Boys (2003 film)|Boys]]'' (2003). The film was eventually revived and released in 2010 as ''[[Enthiran]]'' starring [[Rajinikanth]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]].&lt;ref name = "BZ"/&gt;

=== ''Krishna Leela'' ===
In February 2004, Kamal Haasan and [[Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao]] began pre-production works on a project titled ''Krishna Leela''. The film was set to narrate the story of an individual called Krishna Das, played by Kamal Haasan, and the women in his life. The project was described as a comedy entertainer, much like the actor and director's previous collaborations in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://lazygeek.net/2004/02/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gautami]] was reported to feature alongside him in a leading role, in a proposed comeback, while actresses [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] and [[Vinodhini]] were also cast in roles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cooljilax.com/cinenews.html&lt;/ref&gt; Comedians including [[Goundamani]], [[Vadivelu]], [[Senthil (actor)|Senthil]], [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] and [[Chitti Babu (Tamil actor)|Chitti Babu]] were also added to the supporting cast. Seeking to cast two new actresses, Kamal Haasan scouted for talent in [[London]]. The film was later dropped, and Kamal Haasan and Rao considered working together for a different project.&lt;ref&gt;http://tfmpage.com/forum/5623.03.44.05.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== ''Kumar Sambhavam'' ===
In May 2004,  Kamal Haasan and [[Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao]] were keen to make a Hindi and Tamil bilingual film titled ''Kumar Sambhavam'' with [[Madhuri Dixit]] as the lead actress. Kamal Haasan stated he needed a "woman of substance who would look convincing as a wife and mother" and stated there was "no second choice" for the role. Bharat Shah was set to finance the project and negotiated terms with Dixit to work on the project, having earlier worked with her during the making of ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;http://tfmpage.com/forum/19880.05.19.18.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was dropped after Dixit quoted a salary, which was more than the whole cost of the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiaglitz.com/kamalhassan-madhuri-dixit-film-dropped-tamil-news-10002&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan later expressed his disappointment at the film not materialising as a result of Dixit's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraphindia.com/1041231/asp/etc/story_4123302.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''KG'' ===
Kamal Haasan, [[Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao]] and [[Ramesh Aravind]] discussed the script of a film titled ''KG'' in early 2004, usually during Kamal Haasan's visits to Bangalore. Described as a "cop thriller" to be shot in Tamil and Kannada around Bangalore, Kamal Haasan revealed that there would be no female lead and that it would be "quite a change" from his other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/home/madhuri-too-pricey-for-kamal-the-times-of-india_169487.html|title=Madhuri too pricey for Kamal: The Times of India|date=23 July 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tfmpage.com/forum/21712.00.12.57.html&lt;/ref&gt; In a turn of events, Kamal Haasan accepted an offer to star in [[Saran (director)|Saran]]'s ''[[Vasool Raja MBBS]]'' (2004), and put ''KG'' on hold. He later continued to work on ''KG'', which marked Ramesh Aravind's directorial debut, and Mumbai-based financier Bharat Shah agreed to fund the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiaglitz.com/kamals-magic-tamil-news-10633|title=Kamal's magic - Tamil Movie News - IndiaGlitz.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio later decided to indefinitely postpone work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/interview.php?id=13606546&amp;cid=2408|title=Welcome to Sify.com|website=www.sify.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/mar/22ramesh.htm|title=Ramesh Arvind likes the director's cap|website=www.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Marmayogi'' ===
''Marmayogi'' was first pondered by Kamal Haasan after the release of ''[[Aalavandhan]]'' (2001), however nothing proceeded.&lt;ref name="alavandhan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shah, Kunal|year=2007|title=A New Tam-Table|publisher=[[Mumbai Mirror]]|accessdate=2007-12-18|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/net/mmpaper.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=30&amp;contentid=200712182007121802322346148350ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-year sabbatical from directing films since ''[[Virumaandi]]'' (2004), Kamal Haasan announced ''Marmayogi'' as his next project after the completion of ''[[Dasavathaaram]]'' (2008). The film was planned as a bilingual Hindi-Tamil [[Historical period drama|period film]], set in the [[7th century]]. Production house [[Pyramid Saimira]] along with Haasan's company [[Raaj Kamal Films International]] were set to produce the venture, and work began in late 2007.&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2008|title=PS signs Marmayogi!|publisher=Sify|accessdate=2008-08-19|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14742930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early media reports suggested a box-office battle between ''Marmayogi'' and Shankar's ''[[Enthiran]]'' (2010), which was rebooted from the shelved ''Robot''.

Pre-production on the film continued throughout 2008, with technicians such as [[Rajesh Selva]] and [[Sanu Varghese]] actively involved for close to a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cinematographer-sanu-john-varghese-talks-about-working-in-take-off/article17839705.ece|title=A long visual journey|first=Aswin|last=Vn|date=6 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-39105920090417|title=Just A Minute With: actor Kamal Hassan|first=Shilpa|last=Jamkhandikar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Kamal Haasan grew a long, thick beard for the film. He also cast actors [[Mohanlal]] and [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]], as well as, actresses including [[Hema Malini]], [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] and [[Shriya Saran]] in pivotal roles. Along with Trisha, Kamal Haasan held a photoshoot at the AVM Studios in August 2008. Following the failure of [[Rajinikanth]]'s ''[[Kuselan]]'' (2008), Pyramid Saimira opted out of the project in November 2008, effectively shelving the film. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on ''[[Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)|Unnaipol Oruvan]]'' (2009), and later filed a legal complaint against Pyramid Saimira for loss of earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Marmayogi-on-hold/articleshow/3691213.cms|title=Marmayogi on hold? - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/sep-09-02/kamal-haasan-10-09-09.html|title=Kamal's action against Pyramid Saimira - Kamal Haasan - Raj Kamal International - Unnai Pol Oruvan - Marmayogi - Pyramid Saimira - Behindwoods.com|website=www.behindwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Thalaivan Irukkiraan'' ===
The project was first reported in the media in November 2008 as Kamal Haasan's next project, after his historical drama ''Marmayogi'' was shelved as a result of [[Pyramid Saimira]]'s financial problems. Titled ''Thalaivan Irukkiraan'' and described by the [[Times of India]] as an "action adventure" film, it was said to be directed by Kamal Haasan and co-produced by [[Gemini Film Circuit]] and [[Sun Pictures]], with [[A. R. Rahman]] working as the music composer. Pre-production works continued throughout late 2008, with actors such as [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Mohanlal]] and [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]] approached for leading roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Marmayogi-on-hold/articleshow/3691213.cms|title=Marmayogi on hold? - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/kamal-mohanlal-in-thalaivan-irukindran-tamil-news-42953.html|title=Kamal, Mohanlal in 'Thalaivan Irukindran' - Tamil Movie News - IndiaGlitz.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actresses [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] and [[Shriya Saran]], who were originally a part of ''Marmayogi'', were expected to be retained for the film in order to use the dates they had allotted for the shelved film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/nov-08-02/kamal-12-11-08.html|title=Kamal's plans for Thalaivan Irukkiran - Behindwoods.com - Trisha Shriya Marma Yogi Mohanlal Rishi Kapoor Venkatesh A R Rahman Gemini Film Circuit tamil movie news images picture gallery images|website=www.behindwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamal Haasan's [[Raaj Kamal Films International]] registered the film's title but production was postponed after a deal could not be agreed with the proposed co-producers. During the period, Kamal Haasan also pitched the idea of financing the film to [[Udhayanidhi Stalin]] of [[Red Giant Movies]], who did not take up the offer citing that he felt the script was too political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/was-thalaivan-irrukiran-story-first-narrated-to-udhayanidhi-stalin/articleshow/59952204.cms|title=Was Thalaivan Irrukiran story first narrated to Udhayanidhi Stalin? - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used the dates offered by Mohanlal and Venkatesh for another of his productions, ''[[Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)|Unnaipol Oruvan]]'' (2009), which was incorrectly reported in the media as being the same project as ''Thalaivan Irukkiraan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/kamalmohan-lal-team-up-in-unnai-pol-oruvan/484038/|title=Kamal-Mohan Lal team up in 'Unnai Pol Oruvan' - Indian Express|website=archive.indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-articles/movies-08/kamal-21-01-09.html|title=Kamal's next: the lull before the storm - Behindwoods.com - Tamil Movie Artical - Kamal Haasan Marmayogi Thalaivan Irukkiran|website=www.behindwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was busy writing the final draft of the film and would look to start production by March 2011 with American producers. Actress [[Anushka Shetty]] was also reported to have accepted to star in the film during the period, but the film was again stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kollyinsider.com/2010/12/kamal-and-anushka-in-thalaivan-irukiran.html|title=Kamal and Anushka in 'Thalaivan Irukiran' for Hollywood production|website=www.kollyinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the film resurfaced with Kamal Haasan confirming that the film would be simultaneously made in Hindi under the title of ''Amar Hain''. The media reported that the film would be produced by [[Aascar Ravichandran]], with actors Mohanlal, [[Ajith Kumar]], [[Ravi Teja]] and [[Katrina Kaif]] also in the cast, though this later proved to be untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/katrina-kaif-to-romance-kamal-hassan-/906059/|title=Katrina Kaif to romance Kamal Hassan? - Indian Express|website=archive.indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kollyinsider.com/2012/01/ajith-and-kamal-to-act-together-in.html|title=Ajith and Kamal to act together in 'Thalaivan Irukiran'|website=www.kollyinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports later in February 2012, suggested that Kamal Haasan had asked [[S.

Associating with Hindi producers Virender K. Arora and Arjun N. Kapoor, Kamal Haasan revealed that the project would be a "contemporary story, touching on politics, finance and the underworld" and "an action film with lots of emotion", while comparing the film to [[Brian De Palma]]'s English film, ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Kamal-Haasan-Even-six-years-ago-I-was-only-thinking-of-Saif/articleshow/47538581.cms|title=Kamal Haasan: Even six years ago, I was only thinking of Saif - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the film would be shot in Mumbai and Delhi in India, with schedules also planned in [[Jordan]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], while also that he would finish scripting the film after he finished work on the production of ''[[Thoongaa Vanam]]'' (2015). Despite the announcements, the producers backed out of the project and the film was again stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/kamal-haasan-to-make-thalaivan-irukiran-in-hindi-news-tamil-pgepGyjcejbjg.html|title=Kamal Haasan to make 'Thalaivan Irukiran' in Hindi?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two more years of inactivity, in July 2017, Kamal Haasan suggested that he would revive the project after the release of his ongoing projects ''[[Vishwaroopam II|Vishwaroopam 2]]'' (2018) and ''[[Sabaash Naidu]]'' (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/kamal-haasan-confirms-reviving-thalaivan-irukiran-news-tamil-rh1je5gfhhahe.html|title=Kamal Haasan confirms reviving 'Thalaivan Irukiran'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/after-sabaash-naidu-and-vishwaroopam-2-it-thalaivan-irukkiran-for-kamal-haasan-4769312/|title=After Sabaash Naidu and Vishwaroopam 2, it’s Thalaivan Irukkiran for Kamal Haasan|date=27 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''19 Steps'' ===
In mid-2008, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to be a part of an Indo-Japanese production titled ''19 Steps'' to be directed by [[Bharat Bala]]. The film was written by Malayalam scriptwriter, [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] and was set to tell the tale of a Samurai warrior trying to conquer the ancient Indian martial art of [[Kalaripayattu]]. Starring alongside [[Asin]] and [[Tadanobu Asano]], Kamal Haasan was set to play the role of an Indian martial arts guru. The film was being produced by [[Walt Disney]] and pre-production work had begun with large portions set to be shot in Kerala.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/19-steps-is-my-next-big-film-says-asin/story-kF9Dh0dYyP9UyhqGG17ipK.html|title=19 Steps is my next big film, says Asin|date=9 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty days before the film began shoot, Kamal Haasan dropped out and the film was subsequently reported to be shelved indefinitely.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes.com"/&gt; As recently as 2016, Bharat Bala and producer Phillip Lee have expressed their desire to continue the film with a different cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/revenant-executive-producer-talks-assassins-creed-india-china-film-ties-949914|title='The Revenant' Executive Producer Talks 'Assassin's Creed,' India-China Film Ties|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Tooth of Buddha'' ===
In mid-2009, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to work with [[Mysskin]] on a film about [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Following the cancellation of ''Marmayogi'' and ''19 Steps'', Kamal Haasan was keen to work on a historical film with a similar theme, with the project also referred to in the media as ''500 BC''. He travelled to the [[United States]] to seek out production companies who were willing to fund the film, but no studio eventually agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/others/news-interviews/Kamals-tooth-fairy/articleshow/5163626.cms|title=Kamal's tooth fairy - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysskin was then forced to drop the project and revealed it took him six months to get over the disappointment of the project's sudden end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/His-own-path/article15699643.ece|title=His own path|first=Subha J.|last=Rao|date=20 November 2010|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010s ==
=== ''Moo'' ===
In late 2012, Hollywood producer [[Barrie M. Osborne|Barrie Osborne]] expressed his interest in making an English film in association with Kamal Haasan, who would direct the project and feature in the lead role. The actor subsequently announced a project titled ''Moo'' in February 2013, which was said to be about three lives. A potential English title of ''Triple Impact'' was speculated, while other sources titled the film as ''Yaavarum Kelir'', with an English title of ''All Are Kin''. The project later failed to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Kamal-Haasans-next-is-titled-Moo/articleshow/18344858.cms|title=Kamal Haasan's next is titled Moo - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kollytalk.com/cinenews/kamal-haasans-hollywood-venture-named-as-all-are-kin-82689.html|title=Kamal Haasan’s Hollywood venture named as All Are Kin - KOLLY TALK|date=14 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, sources suggested that the film was still under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/celebrities/story/kamal-haasan-hollywood-film-barry-osborne-vishwaroopam-2-970026-2017-04-07|title=Kamal Haasan's Hollywood flick with Barry Osborne is very much on the cards|date=7 April 2017|website=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Amma Appa Vilayattu'' ===
In November 2015, Kamal Haasan and [[T. K. Rajeev Kumar]] agreed to collaborate on a project and announced that they were working on a family drama script to be titled ''Amma Appa Vilayattu'' in Tamil and ''Amma Naana Aata'' in Telugu. After initial discussions with [[Sridevi]] failed to materialise, Rajeev Kumar cast [[Amala Akkineni]] and [[Zarina Wahab]] in pivotal roles and announced that the film would be shot entirely across the [[United States]], with schedules in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kamal-and-tk-rajeev-kumar-get-together-after-26-years/article7879692.ece|title=A long wait, but worth it|first=G.|last=Krishnakumar|date=15 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Kamal-Haasans-next-titled-Appa-Amma-Vilayattu/articleshow/49893302.cms|title=Kamal Haasan's next titled Appa Amma Vilayattu - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later postponed and by early 2016, Kamal Haasan chose to collaborate with Rajeev Kumar on a different project that he had written himself, ''[[Sabaash Naidu]]'' (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/entertainment/exclusive-kamal-haasan-shruti-to-play-father-daughter-on-screen|title=Exclusive: Kamal Haasan, Shruti to Play Father-Daughter On-screen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Komische Oper Berlin'''&lt;ref&gt;The names mentioned should not be confused with similar names of other theatres in Berlin. The theatre is not identical to the "Theater unter den Linden" which operated from 1933 to 1945 in the former "Kleines Theater" at Unter den Linden 44; nor to the "Staatsoper Unter den Linden", the [[Berlin State Opera]]. Neither is it identical to the "Metropol-Theater" that operated in the former [[Admiralspalast]] from 1955 into the 1990s. Furthermore, today's "Komische Oper" has no connection to the "Komische Oper (an der Weidendammer Brücke)" which operated from 1905 into the 1920s as an opera theater, later as an operetta theatre, and finally as a revue theatre.&lt;/ref&gt; is a German opera company based in [[Berlin]].  The company produces [[opera]], [[operetta]] and [[musical theatre|musicals]].

The opera house is located on Behrenstraße, just a few steps from [[Unter den Linden]]. Since 2004, the Komische Oper Berlin, along with the [[Berlin State Opera]], the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], the [[Berlin State Ballet]], and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design), has been a member of the Berlin Opera Foundation.

== History of the building ==
[[File:Komische Oper Berlin interior Oct 2007 Zuschauerraum.jpg|thumb|Interior of Komische Oper Berlin]]
[[File:Komische Oper Berlin interior Oct 2007 Bühne.jpg|thumb|Stage of Komische Oper Berlin]]
The theatre was built between 1891 and 1892 by architects [[Fellner &amp; Helmer|Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer]] for a private society. It first opened on 24 September 1892 as ''"Theater Unter den Linden"'' with Adolf Ferron's operetta ''Daphne'' and Gaul and Haßreiter's ballet ''Die Welt in Bild und Tanz''.

The theatre was primarily a vehicle for [[operetta]], but was also used for various other events and balls. Around 800 people could be seated in the stalls, and the balconies and various en-suite dinner rooms housed about a further 1,700 seats. Its directors went bankrupt in 1896 and the theatre was forced to close its doors.

On 3 September 1898 the theatre was reopened as ''Metropol-Theater'' with Julius Freund's revue ''Paradies der Frauen''. It then grew to become one of Berlin's most famous and successful variety theatres. During the 1920s and early 1930s, it was leased by the brothers Alfred and Fritz Rotter. Under their management, it saw the premieres of two operettas by [[Franz Lehár]] - ''Friederike (opera)'' in 1928 and [[Das Land des Lächelns]] in 1929, both starring [[Richard Tauber]]. However, due to a decline of variety and music hall entertainment the theatre was again closed in 1933.

In 1934 the theatre was nationalised and renamed ''Staatliches Operettentheater''. It operated as part of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ''[[Strength Through Joy|Kraft durch Freude]]'' entertainment and leisure programmes. During [[World War II]], the auditorium was damaged by Allied bombing on 7 May 1944. The façade, entrance hall, and auditorium ceiling murals were destroyed by bombs on 9 March 1945.

After the war, the theatre was in [[East Germany]], being that the building was in the eastern part of Berlin. Following repair works and provisional rebuilding, the theatre reopened on 23 December 1947, as the ''Komische Oper'' with Johann Strauss's operetta ''[[Die Fledermaus]]''.

The 1950s saw various further alterations and extensions. The theatre was completely rebuilt in 1965/1966 by Architektenkollektiv Kunz Nierade, adding functional extensions and giving the theatre a completely new exterior. The theatre reopened again on 4 December 1966, with Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The auditorium underwent further restoration in 1986, and the stage technology was further modernised by 1989. Today the theatre seats 1,270.

== The Komische Oper company ==
In 1947, [[Walter Felsenstein]] founded and led the resident opera company, the ''Komische Oper'', until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DE153EF937A15755C0A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all | title=East Berlin Opera Nervously Awaits The Next Act|work=The New York Times|date=24 June 1990|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Götz Friedrich]] was an assistant to Felsenstein at the company. Joachim Herz became general director after Felsenstein's death and served until 1981. Subsequently, [[Harry Kupfer]] directed the company for 21 seasons, until 2002. The company specializes in German language productions of opera, operetta and musicals. In 2007 the company won, jointly with [[Theater Bremen|Oper Bremen]], the "[[Opera house of the year]]" award by the German magazine ''[[Opernwelt]]''. From 2002 to 2012, the company's chief director and ''Intendant'' was [[:de:Andreas Homoki|Andreas Homoki]]. In June 2008, the company announced the appointment of [[Barrie Kosky]] to succeed Homoki as its next ''Intendant'', as of the 2012/2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Komische Oper Berlin: Barry Kosky neuer Intendant|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/musik/komische-oper-berlin-barry-kosky-neuer-intendant_aid_313525.html?drucken=1|work=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]|date=24 June 2008|accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2014, his contract with the company was extended through 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/boulevard_nt/article133108341/Barrie-Kosky-bleibt-bis-2022-in-Berlin.html | title=Barrie Kosky bleibt bis 2022 in Berlin | work=Die Welt | date=2014-10-09 | accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2005, the company's managing director has been Susanne Moser.

From 1966 to 2004, the theatre was also home to a resident ballet company – first as the "Tanztheater der Komischen Oper", and then from 1999 as "BerlinBallett – Komische Oper". In 2004, due to budgetary problems, the separate ballet companies of Berlin's three opera houses were merged into a single company called the [[Berlin State Ballet|Staatsballett Berlin]].

Past General Music Directors (GMD) of the company have included [[Kurt Masur]], Rolf Reuter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Berliner Dirigent Rolf Reuter gestorben|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article1176319/Berliner_Dirigent_Rolf_Reuter_gestorben.html|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=11 September 2007|accessdate=20 November 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakov Kreizberg]], [[Kirill Petrenko]], [[Carl St.Clair]], and Patrick Lange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Frederik Hanssen|title=Meister von morgen|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/meister-von-morgen/1841954.html|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=20 November 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2012, the GMD of the company is Henrik Nánási.  Nánási is scheduled to conclude his tenure at the end of the 2017-2018 season.  In May 2017, the company announced the appointment of Ainārs Rubiķis as its next GMD, effective with the 2018-2019 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://komische-oper-newsroom.hosted-application.de/download/11712/pm_20170508_rubikis_neuer_gmd_ab18_19.pdf | title=Ainārs Rubiķis ab 2018/19 Generalmusikdirektor an der Komischen Oper Berlin | publisher=Komische Oper Berlin | date=8 May 2017 | accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5495">"'''Le Chant des Africains'''" (''The Song of the Africans'') is the unofficial anthem of the [[Pied-noir]] community in [[France]] and her former colonies in [[Africa]].

== History ==

===World War I===
Originally written in 1914 by a Sergeant-Major Bendifallah and companyman Marizot, ''Le Chant des Africains'' is a testimony to the bravery of a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[goumier]] regiment disbanded after suffering severe losses in [[Meaux]], northeast of [[Paris]]. The song became popular among the soldiery as well as civilians, but was not set to music until 1918 by Félix Boyer, [[bandmaster]] of the Algerian Garrison.

===World War II===
[[File:7e régiment de chasseurs d'Afrique-drapeau.svg|thumb|Battleflag of the 7e RCA showing its 1944-45 Allied campaigns.]]
The lyrics were modified in 1943 to include all Africans who identified as Frenchmen or Pieds-noirs, especially those from the [[Arab world]]. Also changed were references to location, as most singers had returned to the colonies. Ironically, this situation has again reversed itself in the meantime. This 1943 version was dedicated to Lt.Col. van Hecke's [[:fr:7e régiment de chasseurs d'Afrique]] who fought the 1944-45 Italian, French and German Allied military campaigns.

===Algerian War===
The song was reportedly being used by the Europeans supporting the [[status quo]] of French Algeria against its independence supported by president [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Because of that the song was forbidden from the French military until it was authorized again, in 1969.

===Today===
''Le Chant des Africains'' remains today an adopted symbol of identity for the Pied-noir community.

Below are the lyrics of the first stanza and refrain of the 1914 and 1944 versions.

'''Leo Garel''' (1917 – July 4, 1999) was an American artist. He illustrated cartoons for such notable magazines as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''.

==Early life==
Garel was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to Max and Sarah Garil (née Kramer); his surname was changed from 'Garil' to 'Garel' to sound more American. Both of Garel's parents were [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants from an area of the [[Russian Empire]] near [[Kiev]].

==Career==
Garel was a mentor, instructor and friend to many who exhibited at and made art upstairs at the Lavendar Door, a Stockbridge tradition that was attached to the Austin Riggs Center.  Thus, Garel, in a natural way, helped hundreds of emotionally charged psychiatric patients paint their way out of difficulties that were often too complex for mere therapy to cure. So many of the lives he touched were literally turned around by the knowledge that if they applied themselves their art could gain an audience.  An audience not judgmental, in a field where most work is done alone:  a perfect combination for those trying to overcome the scars left by myriad unusual circumstances too awful to describe here. His art was superb, but his capacity as a lifesaver was unmatched.

==Later years==
He lived the later part of his life in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]] until his death from [[cancer]]. He was survived by a brother, two children and two grandchildren.

'''''Lincoln Portrait''''' (also known as '''''A Lincoln Portrait''''') is a classical [[orchestral work]] written by the American composer [[Aaron Copland]]. The work involves a full [[orchestra]], with particular emphasis on the [[Brass instrument|brass]] section at climactic moments. The work is narrated with the reading of excerpts of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s great documents, including the [[Gettysburg Address]]. An orchestra usually invites a prominent person to be the narrator.

==History==
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Aaron Copland Lincoln Portrait.ogg|title=''Lincoln Portrait''|description=A 23 second sample demonstrating the narration, by [[Gregory Peck]], of Lincoln's documents along with the prominence of brass instruments for dramatic emphasis}}
Copland was asked to write a musical portrait of an "eminent American" by the conductor [[Andre Kostelanetz]]. Copland used material from speeches and letters of Lincoln and quoted original folk songs of the period, including "[[Camptown Races]]" and "[[On Springfield Mountain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/catalogue/cat_detail.asp?musicid=2103 |title=''Lincoln Portrait''|publisher=Boosey &amp; Hawkes|date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Copland finished ''Lincoln Portrait'' in April 1942.

The first performance was by the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] on 14 May 1942, with [[William Adams (who?)|William Adams]] as the narrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollack|first=Howard|title=Aaron Copland: the life and work of an uncommon man|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
Together with some descriptive comments on Lincoln ("Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man"), the work contains the following excerpts from his speeches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or
insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. (Annual Message to Congress [since the twentieth century, [[State of the Union]]], December 1, 1862)

The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country. (Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862)

It is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. ([[Lincoln–Douglas debates]], October 15, 1858)

As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy. (Unknown, though in Lincoln's ''Collected Works'')

That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth. ([[Gettysburg Address]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In Venezuela==
[[Juana Sujo]], an Argentine actress resident in Venezuela and an opponent of the repressive regime of Venezuelan President [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], was credited with sparking the popular uprising that led to his removal from power. Aaron Copland had come to [[Caracas]] to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of ''Lincoln Portrait'' on March 27, 1957. A ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer said it had a "magical effect" on the audience.{{Quote without source|date=November 2018}}

As Copland recalled, "To everyone's surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment." On that evening Juana Sujo was the fiery narrator who performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, "... [[Gettysburg Address|that government of the people, by the people, for the people]] (el gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo) shall not perish from the earth," the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music. Copland continued, "It was not long after that the dictator was deposed and fled from the country. I was later told by an American foreign service officer that the ''Lincoln Portrait'' was credited with having inspired the first public demonstration against him. That, in effect, it had started [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'état|a revolution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holzer|first1=Harold|authorlink1=Harold Holzer|editor1-last=Cuomo|editor1-first=Mario|editor2-last=Holzer|editor2-first=Harold|editor1-link=Mario M.

The composition was [[parody|lampooned]] by [[Peter Schickele]] ("[[P. D. Q. Bach]]") in his piece ''Bach Portrait'' on the album ''[[1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults]]''. Another parody, "A Quayle Portrait" by Jeff Ehrhart, features quotes from former U.S. Vice President [[Dan Quayle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quayle Portrait|url=http://www.madmusic.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=1275|author=Mad Music Productions, LLC}}{{sps|certain=y|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Relevant Dr. Demento show playlists reviewable at dmdb.org: 1991-04-21, 1991-06-16, 1992-06-21 --&gt;

Nine minutes of the composition, without narration (from a late 1960s recording by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]), plays during the climactic one-on-one sequence between Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth (played by [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Ray Allen]]) in the 1998 Spike Lee film, ''[[He Got Game]]''. In the film, Jesus Shuttlesworth is a student at [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in Brooklyn.

'''[[Lonban]]''' ({{lang-fa|لنبان}}), one of the oldest quarters of [[Isfahan]], is famous for its [[mosque]]. Its current structure is rebuilt in the contemporary era, but some of the [[plaster work]]s and [[painting]]s are from the [[Safavid]] age. Some of the [[inscription]]s on the [[portal (architecture)|portal]] are the art works of [[Mohammad Reza Emami]]. Besides there is an extraordinary wooden [[minbar]] which is one of the most exquisite artworks from the time of the [[Safavid dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān(Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan)|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|author=Hosseyn Yaghoubi|editor=Arash Beheshti|page=103|language=Persian|year=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aboutorab Esfahani]], the important [[calligrapher]] of the Safavid era, has been buried in this mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ḥabībollāh Fażāʾelī|Title=Aṭlas-e Ḫaṭṭ : Taḥqīq dar Ḫuṭūṭ-e Islāmī (The researches of the Islamic scripts)|PublicationPlace=Isfahan|Year=1971–2|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;541-542|Date=  1971–2|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lynne Ramsay''' (born 5 December 1969) is a Scottish film director, writer, producer, and cinematographer best known for the [[feature film]]s ''[[Ratcatcher (film)|Ratcatcher]]'' (1999), ''[[Morvern Callar (film)|Morvern Callar]]'' (2002), ''[[We Need to Talk About Kevin (film)|We Need to Talk About Kevin]]'' (2011), and ''[[You Were Never Really Here]]'' (2017).

Her films are marked by a fascination with [[children]] and young people and the recurring themes of [[grief]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[death]], and its aftermath. They are low on [[dialogue]] and explicit story exposition, and instead use images, vivid details, music, and [[sound design]] to create their worlds. In April 2013 she was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/nicole-kidman-christopher-waltz-ang-lee-among-cannes-jury-members-1200410650/ | title=Nicole Kidman, Christopher Waltz, Ang Lee Among Cannes Jury Members | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=23 April 2013 | accessdate=23 April 2013 | last=Saperstein | first=Pat}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, she was named as a member of the jury for the main competition at the [[72nd Venice International Film Festival|2015 Venice Film Festival]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Glasgow]] on 5 December 1969, Ramsay studied [[photography]] at [[Edinburgh Napier University|Napier College, Edinburgh]]. In 1995, she graduated from the [[National Film and Television School]] in [[Beaconsfield]], [[England]], where she specialised in [[cinematography]] and [[Film director|direction]].

==Career==
Ramsay took a break in-between ''Black and White Town'' and ''We Need to Talk About Kevin'', explaining she thinks the filmmaking process is different for her, and other writer-directors, than it is for directors who don’t write their own material. The [[Harvard Film Archive]] welcomed Lynne Ramsay for a showcase of her films, including the three acclaimed shorts that inaugurated her career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2012janmar/ramsay.html "Harvard Film Archive."] (Retrieved 5 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

She experienced great personal frustration in her involvement with ''The Lovely Bones,'' during which personal and professional setbacks and mishandling saw her lose the job of directing to [[Peter Jackson]], whose version of the film received largely negative reviews. She stated in an interview with Oliver Lyttelton that "People started to call it 'The Lovely Money,' they were getting greedy around it. And I could feel the vibes. It became like the Holy Bible, I kept handing in drafts and I thought they were good, but it was like 'But that's not exactly like the book, the book's going to be a success.' That was the mistake they made with the project." She stated additionally that she considered Jackson's interpretation of the film, with a desire to stick as closely as possible to the original story, was partially responsible for what she considered the lacklustre quality of the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyttelton|first=Oliver|title=Lynne Ramsay Talks Her Version Of 'The Lovely Bones,' Tilda Swinton Says More Adventures Are Coming|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/lynne_ramsay_talks_her_the_lovely_bones_tilda_swinton_says_she_thinks_of_he|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=Indiewire|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short films===
Ramsay won the 1996 Cannes Prix de Jury for her graduation film, the short "Small Deaths". Her second short film, "Kill the Day", won the Clermont Ferrand Prix du Jury; her third, "Gasman", won her another Cannes Prix du Jury in addition to a Scottish BAFTA for Best Short Film.

''[[Small Deaths (film)|Small Deaths]]'' (1996) is Ramsay's debut short film that she completed as her graduating film at the UK's [[National Film and Television School]]. Small Deaths is a series of three vignettes of children grappling with familial realities and the repercussions of their actions. (1996, video, 11 minutes). Ramsay is the Writer, Director and cinematographer for this film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2012/double-feature-lynne-ramsay-early-shorts-and "Double Feature: Lynne Ramsay Early Shorts and Ratcatcher."] (Retrieved 5 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Kill the Day (film)|Kill the Day]]'' (1996), written and directed by Ramsay, captures a day in the life of a heroin addict recently released from  jail, and in the process inventively probes the inner workings of memory (1996, 35mm, 17 minutes).

''[[Gasman (film)|Gasman]]'' (1998), also written and directed by Ramsay, is about a brother and sister who attend a Christmas party with their dad, and encounter two other children who are strangely familiar with him. (1998, video, 15 minutes).

''[[Swimmer (film)|Swimmer]]'' (2012), was co-commissioned by [[BBC Films]], Film4 and the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games]]. The short was nominated for the [[British Independent Film Awards]] (BIFA) in the category for Best Short Film. It won a [[BAFTA]] Award for Best Short Film at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="bafta-2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=BAFTAs 2013: Complete List Of Winners From This Year's BAFTA Awards|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/10/baftas-awards-2013-winners_n_2658184.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feature films===
''[[Ratcatcher (film)|Ratcatcher]]'' (1999), Ramsay's debut feature, won critical acclaim and numerous awards. It was screened at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5373/year/1999.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Ratcatcher |accessdate=10 October 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]], winning  her the Guardian New Directors prize. She also won the Carl Foreman Award for Newcomer in British Film at the 2000 BAFTA Awards, the Sutherland Trophy at the [[London Film Festival]] and the Silver Hugo for Best Director at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]].

''[[Morvern Callar (film)|Morvern Callar]]'' (2002) won [[Samantha Morton]] the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress, and [[Kathleen McDermott]] the Scottish BAFTA Award for Best Actress. It also won the 2002 C.I.C.A.E. Award and the Award of The Youth at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]. The motion picture soundtrack includes tracks from [[Stereolab]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Broadcast (band)|Broadcast]], [[Velvet Underground]], and Nancy Sinatra. Ramsay is credited as the writer and director. The film is based on Alan Warner's 1995 novel of the same name, [[Morvern Callar]]. It was featured in the Directors Fortnight for the Cannes Film Festival 2002 and then went on to open the Edinburgh International Film Festival in August of the same year. The film also featured at the Telluride, Toronto, San Sebastian, Dinard and Stockholm Film Festivals of 2002. It was nominated for seven British Independent Film Awards.

Ramsay was slated to direct the adaptation of [[Alice Sebold]]'s ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'', which she had read in manuscript form prior to its publication. She left the project in early 2004 after the novel had become a bestseller and the producers wanted a version more faithful to the original than she had been planning.&lt;ref name="Ramsay in NYT 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kois|first=Dan|title=Lynne Ramsay Is Back. Finally.|url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/lynne-ramsay-is-back-finally/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[We Need to Talk About Kevin (film)|We Need to Talk About Kevin]]'' (2011) was Ramsay's next feature-length film in which she was the writer, producer and director. The film, based on [[Lionel Shriver]]'s [[We Need to Talk About Kevin|novel]], is about a mother dealing with the aftermath of a school massacre committed by her son. Budgetary difficulties held the production up, but after several script drafts, the film, which employed a fragmented, elliptical narrative and starred [[Tilda Swinton]] as the tormented mother, premiered in 2011 to great acclaim at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/552070/index.html "Screen Online: Lynne, Ramsay".] "BFI Screen Online" (Retrieved: 5 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsay went on to receive a [[BAFTA]] nomination for Best Director as well as taking the Best Director prize at the [[British Independent Film Awards]], and a win for Best Film Screenplay at the Writer's Guild of Great Britain.

In 2013 Ramsay was slated to direct ''[[Jane Got a Gun]]''. [[Natalie Portman]] signed on to star and produce the film as the farmer wife of an outlaw husband, who, after his gang turns on him, she must defend with the help of an old lover. In March 2013 Ramsay left the project due to creative differences with producers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/shocker-jane-got-a-gun-loses-director-lynne-ramsay-on-first-day-of-production/ |title=Director Lynne Ramsay Bails Out Of 'Jane Got A Guy' Movie On First Day |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;and funders, including over the latter's demand for a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/25/lynne-ramsay-director-you-were-never-really-here-observer-interview&lt;/ref&gt;  She was replaced by [[Gavin O'Connor (director)|Gavin O'Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/warrior-helmer-gavin-oconnor-rides-to-rescue-on-jane-got-a-gun/ |title=Gavin O'Connor Replaces AWOL Director Lynne Ramsay On 'Jane Got A Gun' |publisher=Deadline.com |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Jude Law]] also left the production shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/more-fallout-on-jane-got-a-gun-jude-law-exits-picture/ |title=Jude Law Latest To Depart Troubled 'Jane Got A Gun' Movie |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynne Ramsay is scheduled to direct a modern adaptation of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]''. She has stated that the film will be set in space, and deal with themes of [[psychology]] and [[claustrophobia]], quoting "So we're creating a whole new world, and a new alien. [It's] a very psychological piece, mainly taking place in the ship, a bit like ''[[Das Boot]]'', so it's quite claustrophobic. It's another monster movie, cos the monster's Ahab."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Lynne Ramsay to steer Moby-Dick into outer space|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/25/lynne-ramsay-moby-dick-space|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay directed ''[[You Were Never Really Here]]'', an adaptation of [[Jonathan Ames]]'s novella of the same name. It premiered to wide critical acclaim in competition at the [[70th Cannes Film Festival]] in 2017, where it received a seven-minute standing ovation, and Ramsay won the [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Screenplay]] award. The film, starring [[Joaquin Phoenix]], was released by [[Amazon Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/cannes-a24-buys-joaquin-phoenixs-you-were-never-really-here-exclusive-1201773661/|title=Cannes: Amazon Sweeps in To Buy Joaquin Phoenix’s ‘You Were Never Really Here’|last=Setoodeh|first=Elsa Keslassy,Ramin|date=2016-05-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Ramsay said in an interview that she was working on her new film, a comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forlackofabetterreview.com/2018/03/08/in-conversation-with-lynne-ramsay/|title=In Conversation with Lynne Ramsay|date=2018-03-08|work=For Lack Of A Better Review|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music promos===
Ramsay directed the promotional video for the Manchester-based [[indie-rock]] band [[Doves (band)|Doves]]' single [[Doves discography#Singles|"Black and White Town"]], which was released on 7 February 2005. However, Ramsay's version was re-edited and the released version was significantly different from her original piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyfilms.com/flash/#/academy/music_videos/lynne_ramsay/doves_black_and_white_town "MUSC VIDEOS: Lynne Ramsay — Doves: "Black and White Town"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420105042/http://www.academyfilms.com/flash |date=2010-04-20 }} ''AcademyFilms.com'' (Retrieved: 6 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise and criticism==
Ramsay is known for the outspoken praise and criticism she receives from her industry contemporaries.

[[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that her "Ramsay is entertaining company, whether talking about the art films she loves —by [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[John Cassavetes|Cassavetes]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder|Fassbinder]]— or railing against the 'bullshitters and backstabbers' of the film industry."&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Hagan|first=Sean|authorlink = Sean O'Hagan (journalist) | title=Lynne Ramsay: 'Just talk to me straight'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/02/lynne-ramsay-interview-about-kevin|accessdate=8 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard Film Archive describes Ramsay as "an uncompromising filmmaker fascinated by the tremendous power of cinema to appeal directly to the senses and awaken new depths in our audio-visual imagination. Immersive and at times almost overwhelming, Ramsay's films abound with uncommon imagery arresting for its remarkable use of texture, composition, color, music and sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lynne Ramsay and the Senses of Cinema|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2012janmar/ramsay.html|publisher=Harvard Film Archive|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her ''[[The New York Times]]'' biography, Ramsay's work is described as having a "gritty, realistic visual style that demands attention."

[[Tilda Swinton]], whom Ramsey directed in ''We Need To Talk About Kevin'', called her "the real McCoy", saying, "She is one of those rare directors who creates the kind of films that just would not be there if she didn't make them."&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"/&gt;

British film critic Jonathan Romney, when speaking on ''We Need To Talk About Kevin'', opined "Ramsay, thinks not in concepts but in images. She doesn't make intellectual films, but ones that are close to music, taking visuals to the point of abstraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Romney|first=Jonathan|title=We Need to Talk About Kevin, Lynne Ramsay, 112 mins (15)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/we-need-to-talk-about-kevin-lynne-ramsay-112-mins-15-2374467.html|accessdate=8 June 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist Mark Olsen considered Ramsay "one of the leading lights of young British cinema", describing her additionally as "among the most celebrated British filmmakers of her generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Olsen|first=Mark|title=Indie Focus: Lynne Ramsay talks about 'Kevin'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/05/news/la-en-indie-focus-20120105|accessdate=8 June 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

On 8 October 2013, Ramsay was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[University of Edinburgh]] for her contribution to British film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-05-12|title=A celebration of achievement|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2013/celebrationofachievement-041013|newspaper=University of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manisa relief''', also known as the '''Akpınar relief''' and the '''Cybele relief''' ({{Lang-tr|'Taş Suret'}} (Cliff image) or  '''Sipil Heykeli''' (Sipylos Monument)), is a Hittite [[rock relief]] at Akpınar, about 5 km east of the Turkish provincial capital of [[Manisa]] above an amusement park on the road to [[Salihli]]. It depicts a [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] divinity.  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Description ==
[[File:KybeleStatue19thCenturyPostcardMountSipylusManisaTurkey.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction on a French postcard, c.1900]]
The relief is located in a niche about 100-120 m up a granite cliff-face of [[Mount Sipylus]], overlooking the city of Manisa, the ancient [[Lydia]]n city of [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]], and the [[Gediz River|Gediz]] river valley (the ancient Hermos). It is over 6 m  high and in poor condition. 

A seated figure 8-10 m high is depicted in high relief (but not completely separated from the cliff face), who looks northwards and wears a tall pointed headdress. Its hands seem to rest on its breasts, the feet rest atop a footstool. The head has partly cleaved away, from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Bean, ''Aegean Turkey: an archaeological guide'', vol. ii, pp 31-33 and pl. 3; C. P. Jones, "A Geographical Setting for the Baucis and Philemon Legend (Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' 8.611-724)" ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' '''96''' (1994:203-23 and pls. I-IV) pp 210f, with bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two remnants of [[Luwian hieroglyphs|Luwian hieroglyphic]] inscriptions are visible to the right of his head, which indicate that the relief dates to the Hittite period. [[Cecil John Cadoux]] thought a date in the time of [[Suppiluliuma I]] or his son [[Mursili II]] (i.e. 14th century BC) was probable.&lt;ref&gt;
Cecil John Cadoux: ''Ancient Smyrna. A history of the city from the earliest times to 324 A.D.'' Blackwell, Oxford 1938, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmuth Theodor Bossert]] read the leftmost inscription (Akpınar 1) as "Prince Kuwalanamuwa", the same name which is found on the [[Hanyeri relief]], but it is unclear whether both refer to the same individual. The right inscription (Akpınar 2) was not legible to [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]], who studied the relief with R.A. Alexander in 1978.&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften.'' 2005, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In the second century AD, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] recorded the figure in his ''Description of Greece'' as a depiction of the mother goddess, [[Cybele]], made by [[Broteas]] the son pf [[Tantalos]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 3.22.4 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.3.22.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160, English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; Several travellers in the 18th and 19th centuries described the work, including [[Richard Chandler]], [[Charles Texier]], [[Gustav Hirschfeld]] and [[Archibald Henry Sayce]].&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"/&gt; 
The interpretation of the figure is disputed. Bossert's identification with Cybele was rejected by [[Kurt Bittel]] as unsustainable, but he still saw a female goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Bittel. "Kubaba – Kybele." in [[Erich Ebeling]], [[Bruno Meissner]], [[Dietz Otto Edzard]] (ed.): ''[[Reallexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Archäologie]].'' Vol. 6: ''Klagegesang – Libanon.'' Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1983, {{ISBN|3-11-010051-7}}, p. 264, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OIeiZaIo91IC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=manisa+kybele&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=manisa%20kybele&amp;f=false in Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Ekrem Akurgal]]. Peter Z. Spanos, however, interprets the figure as the Weather god,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Z. Spanos: "Einige Bemerkungen zum sogenannten Niobe-Monument bei Manisa (Magnesia ad Sipylum)." ''Beiträge zur Altertumskunde Kleinasiens. Festschrift für Kurt Bittel.'' Zabern, Mainz 1983, pp. 477-483.&lt;/ref&gt; which conforms to the general tendency today to interpret the image as a male god; Ehringhaus suggests it is a mountain god.&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"/&gt;

As a result of confusion with a different natural rock formation near Manisa, which resembles a sitting figure and is known as ''Weeping [[Niobe]]'', this relief is sometimes, incorrectly, known as the ''Niobe cliffs''.

'''Max Rössler''' (born 1940) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[investor]] and [[Patronage|patron]].

== Life ==
Rössler attended the Kantonsschule at Burggraben in St. Gallen, where he finished his [[Matura|matriculation]]. He then studied mathematics at [[ETH Zurich]], where he co-authored a dissertation on railway computations in the field of [[Celestial mechanics|space mechanics]] in 1966 with [[Eduard Stiefel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/133750 |title=Analytische Störungstheorie im Dreikörperproblem mit Hilfe von regularisierenden Variablen |author=Max Rössler |date=1966 |publisher=ETH Zürich |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent time at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for a [[NASA]] research project to calculate space travel. Subsequently, he was a lecturer for applied mathematics and [[operations research]] at ETH [[Zürich|Zurich]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/main/news/eth-tag/dokumente/2013/131116_Laudatio_Ehrenraete_Braginsky_Haefner_Roessler.pdf |title=Laudatio für die Ehrenräte René Braginsky, Martin Haefner und Dr. Max Rössler |date=16 November 2013 |publisher=ETH Zürich |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Rössler changed to finances. He was responsible for the analysis department of fixed interest investments and the management of investment funds of CHF 12 billion at the [[Credit Suisse|Schweizerische Kreditanstalt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rsb-securities.ch/ |title=Personen Max Rössler |publisher=RSB Securities |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was responsible for financial investments of the [[Suva (insurer)|Swiss Accident Insurance Institution]] (SUVA). He successfully used his knowledge in the financial sector for his own investments, to which a considerable amount of his assets includes investments in several Swiss companies. He is the main shareholder of the Parmino Holding AG which includes the construction company [[Implenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzz.ch/der_implenia-goenner-1.4055650 |title=Der Implenia-Gönner |date=24 November 2009 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.implenia.com/de-ch/investoren/die-aktie.html |title=Kotiert an der SIX Swiss Exchange |date=6 March 2006 |publisher=Implenia |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his influence on the occupation of the Implenia management team, Rössler became well known to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Weitere-Ruecktritte-bei-Implenia/story/12757256 |title=Weitere Rücktritte bei Implenia |author=Benita Vogel |date=18 February 2016 |publisher=Tages Anzeiger |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handelszeitung.ch/unternehmen/machtkampf-bei-implenia-sorgt-fuer-kritik-994450 |title=Machtkampf bei Implenia sorgt für Kritik |author=Bernhard Fischer, Marcel Speiser |date=17 February 2016 |publisher=Handelszeitung |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Rössler holds a major stake in the machine tool business Starrag Group and is a board member of other companies such as RSB Securities AG, Global Care and SunVesta Holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunvesta.com/index.php?id=39 |title=Dr. Max Rössler |publisher=SunVesta Holding |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an advisor to Swiss private banks. Rössler is a member of the Board of Trustees at the Rütli Foundation, which is affiliated to the private bank [[Reichmuth &amp; Co]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ruetli-stiftung.ch/kontakt.html |title=Stiftungsräte |publisher=Rütli-Stiftung |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Max-Rössler-Prize ==
His private wealth enabled him to [[Donation|donate]] largely. In 2009, Rössler funded the annual Max-Rössler-Prize for the support of outstanding young professors at the ETH Zurich. The prize money amounted to CHF 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethz.ch/de/forschung/wissenschaftspreise-und-veranstaltungen/roessler-preis.html |title=Rössler Preis |publisher=ETH Zürich |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major donation, together with the [[Walter Haefner]] Foundation, enabled the founding of the new Institute for Theoretical Studies at ETH Zurich 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/hochschule-eth-zuerich-gruendet-institut-fuer-theoretische-studien-id2304357.html |title=ETH Zürich gründet Institut für Theoretische Studien |date=15 May 2013 |publisher=Blick |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mithun, Inc.''' ('''Mithun''') is a [[multidisciplinary]] [[professional services]] firm headquartered in the city of [[Seattle]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the [[United States|United States of America]] offering [[integrated design]] services related to [[architecture]], [[land use planning]], [[landscape architecture]], [[interior architecture]], [[interior design]], and "cultural audits" with a focus on [[sustainability]].

==History==

The firm was founded in 1949 by Omer Mithun, a professor of architecture at the [[University of Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Marga Rose Hancock Hon. AIA | title=Honors Archive: Omer Mithun FAIA 1918-1983 | url=http://www.aiaseattle.org/archive_honors_fellows_mithun.htm | work= | publisher=AIA Seattle | date= | accessdate=2008-05-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521034552/http://www.aiaseattle.org/archive_honors_fellows_mithun.htm | archivedate=2008-05-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a private practice in [[Bellevue, Washington]]. Mithun incorporated in 1953, and became Mithun Partners in 1988. The practice moved into the historic [[Times Square Building]] in 1990, after the firm outgrew the space they moved again in 2000, after renovating their present-day headquarters on Pier 56. Mithun is now led by a board of directors, presided by Bert Gregory, FAIA, who also serves as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">'''Molse School''', ''translated as "School of Mol",'' is a common term for some international paint artists or a specific genre of paintings in late 19th and early 20th century.  The paintings typically show picturesque and rustic places, farms, ... of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[municipality]] [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]], which is located in the [[Campine]].  The most famous painters of the  ''Molse School'' were [[Jakob Smits]] and [[Dirk Baksteen]] who lived in Achterbos, a hamlet of Mol.

Based upon the [[Barbizon school]] the municipality Mol organized an international art [[exhibition]] in 1907 and invited painters from all over the world.   Most of these artists had not met before and their only connection was their stay in a local [[hotel]] during the exhibition. These artists were not tied by a fine art society, neither was there a common style. In total 68 artists participated at this event, showing  212 works. This exhibition was also an attempt to show the artists the beauty of Mol, its [[heath]], the white sand flats and how the inhabitants (mostly [[farmer]]s) lived.  This attempt succeeded.

Upon their return home, the artists showed their paintings to their colleagues. This resulted in those colleagues also coming over to Mol making painting [[en plein air]] popular.

Some artists commonly categorized under the  ''Molse School'' are [[Dirk Baksteen]], [[Gerard Baksteen]], [[Charles Claessens]], [[Leon Delderenne]], [[Paul Mathieu]], [[Ernest Midy]], [[Erneste Rinquet]], [[Jakob Smits]], [[Willem Battaille]], [[Emile Van Damme-Sylva]], [[Paula Van Rompa-Zenke]], [[Gaston De Biemme]]

'''Pierce Egan''' (1772–1849) was a British journalist, [[sportswriter]], and writer on popular culture.

==Life==
Egan's parents were [[Irish people|Irish]] migrants, but he may have been born in the London area. He went into the printing trade, and was a compositor for [[George Smeeton]] in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=8577|title=Egan, Pierce|first=Dennis|last=Brailsford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established himself as the country's leading reporter of sporting events, which at the time meant mainly prize-fights and horse-races.

It was Egan who first defined boxing as "the sweet science". He is buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]], North London.

==Works==
Four volumes of ''[[Boxiana|Boxiana; or Sketches of Ancient and Modern Pugilism]]'' appeared, lavishly illustrated, between 1813 and 1824. Following a dispute with his publisher, Egan was replaced for the fourth ''Boxiana'' volume (replaced by 'Jon Bee'), the court permitting Egan continued rights to the title provided he used the ''New Series'' prefix. Two volumes of Egan's ''New Series Boxiana'' were published in 1828/29.&lt;ref name=Snowdon&gt;Snowdon, David, ''Writing the Prizefight: Pierce Egan's 'Boxiana' World'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821 Egan announced the publication of a regular journal: ''Life in London'', appearing monthly at a shilling a time. It was to be illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]] (1792–1878), and was dedicated to the King, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], who at one time had received Egan at court. The first edition of ''Life in London or, the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, esq., and his elegant friend, Corinthian Tom, accompanied by Bob Logic, the Oxonian, in their rambles and sprees through the Metropolis'' appeared on 15 July 1821.

Egan's creation was an instant success. Pirate versions appeared, featuring such figures as 'Bob Tallyho', 'Dick Wildfire' and the like. Print-makers speedily knocked off cuts featuring the various 'stars' and the real-life public flocked to the 'sporting' addresses that Egan had his heroes frequent. There was a translation into French. At least six plays were based on Egan's characters, contributing to yet more sales. One of these was exported to America, launching the ''Tom and Jerry'' craze there. The version created by [[William Thomas Moncrieff]] was praised as ''The Beggar's Opera of its day''. Moncrieff's production of ''[[Tom and Jerry, or Life in London]]'' ran continuously at the Adelphi Theatre for two seasons and it was the dramatist's work as much as the author's that did so much to popularise the book's trademark use of fashionable slang. ''Life in London'' appeared until 1828, when Egan closed it down.

Egan published a report of the trial of John Thurtell and Joseph Hunt, for [[Radlett murder|the murder of William Weare]]. Thurtell allegedly mentioned, just seven hours before his execution, that among his final wishes was a desire to read Egan's coverage of a recent prizefight. Egan wrote also satirical legal pieces such as ''The Fancy Tog's Man versus Young Sadboy, the Milling Quaker''. In 1824 he launched a new journal, ''Pierce Egan's Life in London and Sporting Guide'', a weekly newspaper priced at eightpence-halfpenny. Other works included sporting anecdotes, theatrical autobiographies, guide-books, and 'fancy ditties'. Among his later efforts, in 1838, was a series of pieces on the delights to be found on and immediately adjacent to the Thames. It was dedicated, with permission, to the young Queen Victoria and featured the illustrative work of his son [[Pierce Egan the Younger]].

In 1823 Egan produced an edition of [[Francis Grose]]'s ''Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' (1785 et seq.), including mainly sporting Regency slang. He also cut the "coarse" and "broad" expressions' which Grose had allowed, and noted the way that some slang terminology, typically ''rum'' – once a positive term, but by 1820 generally the reverse – had altered. Don Atyeo wrote in his study of ''Violence in Sport'' (1979) that

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Boxiana'' is riddled with "Fancy" slang: '"Ogles" were blackened, "peepers" plunged into darkness, "tripe-shops" received "staggerers", "ivories" were cracked, "domino boxes" shattered, and "claret" flowed in a steady stream.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Atyeo |first=Don |title=Blood &amp; Guts: Violence in Sports |edition=illustrated |publisher=Grosset &amp; Dunlap |year=1979 |isbn=9780709200000 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=Yj0TAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=F-troop+%22them+and+sending%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ogles- 146]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And as Egan's character Corinthian Tom explains in ''Life in London'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;A kind of ''cant'' phraseology is current from one end of the Metropolis to the other, and you will scarcely be able to move a single step, my dear JERRY, without consulting a ''Slang''  Dictionary, or having some friend at your elbow to explain the strange expressions which, at every turn, will assail your ear.' Such a dictionary is what Egan offers, hoping in sum that his efforts work 'to improve, and not to degrade mankind; to remove ''ignorance'', and put the UNWARY on their guard; to rouse the ''sleepy'', and to keep them AWAKE; to render those persons who are a little UP, more FLY: and to cause every one to be ''down'' to those tricks, manoeuvres and impositions practised in life, which daily cross the paths of both young and old.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
[[John Camden Hotten]] brought out a reprint of ''Life in London'' in 1869. "Tom and Jerry", the celebrated duo, have been perpetuated in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's [[Tom and Jerry|cartoon cat and mouse]], and as the male protagonists of the 1970s' BBC television sitcom ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]''.

==In literature==
Pierce Egan was one of the narrators of [[George MacDonald Fraser]]'s book ''[[Black Ajax]]'', about [[Tom Molineaux]] and his quest for the heavyweight championship of England. One chapter of the book also featured schoolboy versions of Egan's characters from ''Life in London''.

[[File:ChopinSandDelacroix.jpg|thumb|Modern hypothetical reconstruction of the painting]]

The '''''Portrait of Frédéric Chopin and George Sand''''' was an 1838 [[Unfinished work|unfinished]] oil-on-canvas painting by French artist [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Originally a double portrait, it was later cut in two and sold off as separate pieces. It showed composer [[Frédéric Chopin]] (1810–49) playing piano while writer [[George Sand]] (1804–76) sits to his right, listening and sewing (a favorite activity of hers). The sitters were lovers at the time, and both were close friends of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Néret, 38&lt;/ref&gt; 

The portrait remained in Delacroix's studio until his death. Shortly afterward, it was cut into two separate works, both of which are tightly focused. Chopin's portrait comprises only a head shot, while Sand's shows her upper body but is narrowly cut. This led to the loss of large areas of the original canvas. The reason for the divide is likely the then-owner's belief that two paintings would sell for a higher price than one. Today Chopin's portrait is housed at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]] in Paris, while Sand's hangs at [[Copenhagen]]'s [[Ordrupgaard]] Museum.&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;Ann Malaspina, ''Chopin's World (Music Throughout History)'', Rosen Central, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4042-0723-6}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Sand was a French [[Romanticism|Romantic]] novelist, one of the first female French writers to establish an international reputation. She became known for behavior unusual for a woman at the time, including openly conducting [[Romantic friendship|affairs]], smoking a pipe and wearing men's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Finch, ''Women's Writing in Nineteenth-Century France'',  Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-63186-6}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Sand had been a friend of Delacroix for a number of years, though the painter did not hold her work in high regard. She met Chopin in 1836 and from 1838 conducted a relationship with him for ten years, until two years before he died. Much of the composer's best work was done during those ten years. Though their relationship began as physical, Chopin's failing health (described in Sand's autobiographical "Winter in 
Mallorca"&lt;ref&gt;Spending the winter 1838/9 in Mallorca exacerbated his symptoms - ''Un hiver à Mallorque''.&lt;/ref&gt;) in time changed her role to that of caregiver. 

Sand introduced Delacroix to Chopin in 1838, and the two men remained close friends until the composer's death.
The double portrait showed Chopin playing piano while Sand sat and listened.&lt;ref name="AMA" /&gt; Little is known of the painting's origin or the circumstances of its execution. It is not known whether it was a commission or intended as a gift to the composer. It is known that Delacroix borrowed a piano so that the work could be painted in his studio. The double portrait was not finished, and one of the elements that was not painted was the piano.&lt;ref name="Halina24"&gt;Goldberg, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sand canvas is generally seen as the more interesting because, in its original form, it was intended as a counterpoint to the Chopin portrait, not as a stand-alone work. As such, it contravenes many conventions of portraiture. It was usual in 19th-century bust-sized paintings for the subject to be largely static, but here Sand is shown reacting to the music Chopin is playing, and highly animated and energetic in her emotional response.&lt;ref name="Halina24" /&gt;

The '''portraiture of Elizabeth I of England''' illustrates the evolution of English royal [[portrait]]s in the [[Early Modern period]] from the representations of simple likenesses to the later complex imagery used to convey the power and aspirations of the state, as well as of the monarch at its head.

Even the earliest portraits of [[Elizabeth I]] (1533–1603) contain [[symbol]]ic objects such as [[rose]]s and prayer books that would have carried meaning to viewers of her day. Later portraits of Elizabeth layer the [[iconography]] of [[empire]]—[[globe]]s, [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]], [[sword]]s and [[column]]s—and representations of [[virginity]] and purity—such as [[moon]]s and [[pearl]]s—with [[Classical antiquity|classical]] allusions to present a complex "story" that conveyed to [[Elizabethan era]] viewers the majesty and significance of their Virgin Queen.

==Overview==

===Portraiture in Tudor England===
{{Main|Artists of the Tudor court}}
Two portraiture traditions had arisen in the Tudor court since the days of Elizabeth's father, [[Henry VIII]].  The [[portrait miniature]] developed from the [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition.  These small personal images were almost invariably painted from life over the space of a few days in [[watercolour]]s on [[vellum]] stiffened by being glued to a [[playing card]]. [[Panel painting]]s in [[oil painting|oils]] on prepared wood surfaces were based on preparatory drawings and were usually executed at life size, as were oil paintings on canvas.

Unlike her contemporaries in France, Elizabeth never granted rights to produce her portrait to a single artist, although [[Nicholas Hilliard]] was appointed her official [[limning|limner]] or miniaturist and goldsmith. [[George Gower]], a fashionable court portraitist created [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581, was responsible for approving all portraits of the queen created by other artists from that date until his death in 1596.&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Elizabeth sat to a number of artists over the years, including Hilliard, [[Cornelis Ketel]], [[Federico Zuccari|Federico Zuccaro or Zuccari]], [[Isaac Oliver]], and most likely to Gower and [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]].&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

Portraits were commissioned by the government as gifts to foreign monarchs and to show to prospective suitors.  Courtiers commissioned heavily symbolic paintings to demonstrate their devotion to the queen.  The fashionable [[long gallery|long galleries]] of later Elizabethan [[country house]]s were filled with sets of portraits.  The studios of Tudor artists produced images of Elizabeth working from approved "face patterns" or drawings of the queen to meet this growing demand for her image, an important symbol of loyalty and reverence for the crown in times of turbulence.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

===European context===
Far the most impressive models available to English portraitists were the many portraits by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], the outstanding Northern portraitist of the first half of the century, who had made two lengthy visits to England and been Henry VIII's court artist.  Holbein had accustomed the English court to the full-length life-size portrait,&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 25–6.  This was in notable contrast to France, in particular, where smaller portraits remained more typical until [[Henry IV of France]] came to power in 1594.&lt;/ref&gt; although none of his originals now survive.  His great [[Whitehall Mural|dynastic mural]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], destroyed in 1698, and perhaps other original large portraits, would have been familiar to Elizabethan artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Remigius van Leemput 001.jpg|image of a copy]] Waterhouse:19–22, who points out that only very high ranking persons could enter the room where it was when the court was in residence at Whitehall.  But artists could probably have gained access during the long periods the monarch was elsewhere; certainly there are many apparent copies of the figure of Henry from this work.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Holbein and his great Italian contemporary [[Titian]] had combined great psychological penetration with a sufficiently majestic impression to satisfy their royal patrons.  By his second visit Holbein was already moving away from a strictly realist depiction; in his ''[[Jane Seymour]]'' "the figure is no longer seen as displacing with its bulk a recognizable section of space: it approaches rather to a flat pattern, made alive by a bounding and vital outline".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse:19&lt;/ref&gt;  This tendency was to be taken much further by the later portraits of Elizabeth, where "Likeness of feature and an interest in form and volume have gradually been abandoned in favour of an effect of splendid majesty obtained by decorative pattern, and the forms have been flattened accordingly".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronzino - Eleonora di Toledo col figlio Giovanni - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''Eleanor of Toledo and her son Giovanni'', Bronzino, 1545]]

Titian continued to paint royal portraits, especially of [[Philip II of Spain]], until the 1570s, but in sharply reduced numbers after about 1555, and he refused to travel from Venice to do them.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Jennifer in: David Jaffé (ed), ''Titian'', pp. 31–2, The National Gallery Company/Yale, London 2003, {{ISBN|1-85709-903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full-length portrait of Philip (1550–51) now in the [[Prado]] was sent to Elizabeth's elder sister and predecessor [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in advance of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Tizian 084.jpg|Image]] It came from Philip's aunt [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary]] in Brussels, presumably as a loan. Fletcher, op. cit. pp. 31 and 148.  It was presumably returned by or after Mary I's death in 1558, as it is in a Spanish royal inventory of 1600.  Prado:398–99 (#411). The painting has returned to London for an exhibition at the National Gallery until January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the mid-century the most influential Continental courts came to prefer less revealing and intimate works,&lt;ref&gt;For analysis of this trend see Levey (1971, Ch. 3, and Trevor-Roper (1976) Ch. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the mid-century the two most prominent and influential royal portraitists in paint, other than Titian, were the Netherlandish [[Anthonis Mor]] and [[Agnolo Bronzino]] in [[Florence]], besides whom the Habsburg court sculptor and medallist [[Leone Leoni]] should also be mentioned.  Mor, who had risen rapidly to prominence in 1540s, worked across Europe for the Habsburgs in a tighter and more rigid version of Titian's compositional manner, drawing also on the North Italian style of [[Moretto da Brescia|Moretto]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 27–8. For his relationship with the Habsburgs, see Trevor-Roper (1976) passim, who also covers those of Leone Leoni and Titian in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mor had actually visited London in 1554, and painted three versions of his well-known portrait of Queen Mary; he also painted English courtiers who visited Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), p. 28. Surviving portraits include those of [[Sir Thomas Gresham]] and [[Sir Henry Lee]], who was later to commission the ''Ditchley Portrait''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mor's Spanish pupil [[Alonso Sánchez Coello]] continued in a stiffer version of his master's style, replacing him  as Spanish court painter in 1561.  [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] had painted in an intimately informal style, but after her recruitment to the Spanish court as the Queen's painter in 1560 was able to adapt her style to the much more formal demands of state portraiture.  Moretto's pupil [[Giovanni Battista Moroni]] was Mor's contemporary and formed his mature style in the 1550s, but few of his spirited portraits were of royalty, or yet to be seen outside Italy.&lt;ref&gt;And even in Italy his best portraits were routinely attributed to Titian or Moretto, for example what has always been his most famous work, the so-called ''Titian's Schoolmaster'', now in Washington but previously in the [[Palazzo Borghese]] in Rome.  Penny:194–5 on his life and style, 196–7 on his reputation. Freedberg (1993), pp. 593–5 analyses his portrait style.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronzino]] developed a style of coldly distant magnificence, based on the [[Mannerist]] portraits of [[Pontormo]], working almost entirely for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke.&lt;ref&gt;In an extended discussion, [[Michael Levey]] says Bronzino showed the ducal family "so wrought and congealed that there is nothing of living tissue left in them. Their hands have turned to ivory, and their eyes to pieces of beautifully cut, faceted jet." Levey (1971), pp. 96–108 — quotation from p. 108.  See also Freedberg (1993), pp. 430–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Bronzino's works, including his striking portraits of Cosimo's Duchess, [[Eleanor of Toledo]] were distributed in many versions across Europe, continuing to be made for two decades from the same studio pattern; a new portrait painted in her last years, about 1560, exists in only a few repetitions.  At the least many of the foreign painters in London are likely to have seen versions of the earlier type, and there may well have been one in the [[Royal Collection]].

French portraiture remained dominated by small but finely drawn bust-length or half-length works, including many drawings, often with colour, by [[François Clouet]] following, with a host of imitators, his father [[Jean Clouet|Jean]], or even smaller oils by the Netherlandish [[Corneille de Lyon]] and his followers, typically no taller than a paperback book.  A few full-length portraits of royalty were produced, dependent on German or Italian models.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating the royal image===
[[File:El bieta I lat 13.jpg|thumb|upright|''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'', c. 1546, by an unknown artist.]]
William Gaunt contrasts the simplicity of the 1546 portrait of ''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'' with later images of her as queen.  He wrote, "The painter...is unknown, but in a competently Flemish style he depicts the daughter of [[Anne Boleyn]] as quiet and studious-looking, ornament in her attire as secondary to the plainness of line that emphasizes her youth. Great is the contrast with the awesome fantasy of the later portraits: the pallid, mask-like features, the extravagance of headdress and ruff, the padded ornateness that seemed to exclude all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of emphasis given to depicting depth and volume in her later portraits may have been influenced by the Queen's own views. In the ''Art of Limming'' Hilliard cautioned against all but the minimal use of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling that we see in his works, reflecting the views of his patron: "seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light...Her Majesty..chose her place to sit for that purpose in the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all..."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Hilliard's ''Art of Limming'', c. 1600, in ''Nicholas Hilliard'', [[Roy Strong]], 1975, p.24, Michael Joseph Ltd, London, {{ISBN|0-7181-1301-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1570s, the government sought to manipulate the image of the queen as an object of devotion and veneration.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] writes: "The cult of Gloriana was skilfully created to buttress public order and, even more, deliberately to replace the pre-[[English Reformation|Reformation]] externals of religion, the cult of the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and [[saint]]s with their attendant images, processions, ceremonies and secular rejoicing."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  The pageantry of the [[Accession Day tilt]]s, the poetry of the court, and the most iconic of Elizabeth's portraits all reflect this effort.  The management of the queen's image reached its heights in the last decade of the reign, when realistic images of the aging queen were replaced with an eternally youthful vision defying the reality of the passage of time.

===The young queen===
Portraits of the young queen, many of them likely painted to be shown to prospective suitors and foreign heads of state, show a naturalness and restraint similar to those in the portrait of Elizabeth as a princess.
[[File:Elizabeth I Steven Van Der Meulen.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Hampden Portrait'' of Elizabeth I, by Van Der Meulen, 1560s]]

The full-length ''Hampden'' image of Elizabeth in a red satin gown by [[Steven van der Meulen]] has been identified by Sir Roy Strong as an important early portrait, "undertaken at a time when her image was being tightly controlled. 'This is a portrait dating from the mid to late 1560s, one of a group produced in response to a crisis over the production of the royal image, one which was reflected in the words of a draft proclamation dated 1563,' he said."&lt;ref name="IND"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20071101/ai_n21092731 Portrait of a royal quest for a husband]". ''The Independent'', (London), Nov 1, 2007. Retrieved on 24 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The draft proclamation (never published) was a response to the circulation of poorly made portraits in which Elizabeth is shown "in blacke with a [[French hood|hoode and cornet]]", a style she no longer wore.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In these portraits Elizabeth may be wearing [[mourning]] for her sister Mary; see commentary on a portrait ([[:Image:Mary Queen of Scots French School c 1558-60.jpg|Image]]) of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in a similar black gown and French hood with the cornet or ''bongrace'' pinned up at {{cite web|url=http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |title=Mary Queen of Scots (1542 - 1587) c. 1558 |work=Historical Portraits Image Library |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016154526/http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}, where the costume is compared to Elizabeth's in the ''Clopton'' portrait type.&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolism in these pictures is in keeping with earlier Tudor portraiture; in some Elizabeth holds a book (possibly a prayer book) suggesting studiousness or piety. In other paintings she holds or wears a red rose, symbol of the [[Tudor Dynasty]]'s descent from the [[House of Lancaster]], or white roses, symbols of the [[House of York]] and of maidenly chastity.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Hampden portrait, Elizabeth wears a red rose on her shoulder and holds a [[gillyflower]] in her hand.  Of this image, Strong says "'Here Elizabeth is caught in that short-lived period before what was a recognisable human became transmuted into a goddess'."&lt;ref name="IND" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This newly revealed portrait was sold at Sotheby's, London, for £2.6 million in November 2007.[https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSL2246809920071122?sp=true Reuters news story]&lt;/ref&gt;

One artist active in Elizabeth's early court was the [[Flanders|Flemish]] miniaturist [[Levina Teerlinc]] who had served as a painter and [[gentlewoman]] to [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and stayed on as a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber to Elizabeth. Teerlinc is best known for her pivotal position in the rise of the portrait miniature. There is documentation that she created numerous portraits of Elizabeth I, both individual portraits and portraits of the sovereign with important court figures, but only a few of these have survived and been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth and the goddesses===
[[File:Eworth Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses 1569.jpg|thumb|''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'', 1569]] Two surviving [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings show the early use of classical mythology to illustrate the beauty and sovereignty of the young queen.  In ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' (1569), attributed to [[Hans Eworth]],&lt;ref&gt;The portrait is signed "H.E." and the artist formerly identified as the "Monogrammist H.E." is now generally assumed to be Hans Eworth (Hearn 1995, p. 63). Strong had earlier attributed the painting to [[Joris Hoefnagel]] (Strong 1987, p. 42).&lt;/ref&gt; the story of the [[Judgement of Paris]] is turned on its head.  Elizabeth, rather than Paris, is now sent to choose among [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Athena|Pallas-Minerva]], all of whom are outshone by the queen with her crown and royal [[Globus cruciger|orb]].  As Susan Doran writes, "Implicit to the theme of the painting ... is the idea that Elizabeth's retention of royal power benefits her realm. Whereas Paris's judgement in the original myth resulted in the long [[Trojan War]]s 'to the utter ruin of the Trojans', hers will conversely bring peace and order to the state"&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; after the turbulent reign of Elizabeth's sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].

The latter theme lies behind the 1572 ''The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' (attributed to [[Lucas de Heere]]).  In this image, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Mary and her husband [[Philip II of Spain]] are accompanied by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the god of War on the left, while Protestant Elizabeth on the right ushers in the goddesses Peace and Plenty.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription states that this painting was a gift from the queen to [[Francis Walsingham]] as a "Mark of her people's and her own content" and this may indicate that it commemorates the signing of the [[Treaty of Blois (1572)]] which established an alliance between England and France against Spanish aggression in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] during Walsingham's tour of duty as ambassador to the French court.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, pp.185–86&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong identifies both paintings as celebrations of Elizabeth's just rule by Flemish exiles to whom England was a refuge from the religious persecution of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hilliard and the queen===
{{Main|Nicholas Hilliard}}
[[File:Hilliard Elizabeth I 1572 v2.jpg|left|thumb|Miniature by Hilliard, 1572]]
[[File:Elizabeth1 Phoenix.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Phoenix Portrait'', c. 1575, attributed to Hilliard]]
[[File:Hilliard Emmanuel College Charter.gif|thumb|upright|Emmanuel College charter, 1584]]
Nicholas Hilliard was an apprentice to the Queen's jeweller Robert Brandon,&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; a goldsmith and city chamberlain of London, and Sir Roy Strong suggests that Hilliard may also have been trained in the art of limning by Levina Teerlinc.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; Hilliard emerged from his apprenticeship at a time when a new royal portrait painter was "desperately needed."&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 79–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilliard's first known miniature of the Queen is dated 1572. It is not known when he was formally appointed limner (miniaturist) and goldsmith to Elizabeth,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, ''Hilliard and Oliver'', pp. 11–18&lt;/ref&gt; though he was granted the reversion of a lease by the Queen in 1573 for his "good, true and loyal service."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1975, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Two panel portraits long attributed to him, the ''Phoenix'' and ''Pelican'' portraits, are dated c. 1572–76.  These paintings are named after the jewels the queen wears, her personal badges of the [[Pelican#Symbolism and culture|pelican in her piety]] and the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].  National Portrait Gallery researchers announced in September 2010 that the two portraits were painted on wood from the same two trees. They also found that a tracing of the Phoenix portrait matches the Pelican portrait in reverse. They therefore deduce that both pictures of Elizabeth in her forties were painted around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11277451  Pelican and Phoenix research]&lt;/ref&gt;

But Hilliard's panel portraits seem to have been found wanting, and in 1576 the recently married Hilliard left for France to improve his skills.  Returning to England, he continued to work as a goldsmith, and produced some spectacular "picture boxes" or jewelled lockets for miniatures: the ''Armada Jewel'', given by Elizabeth to Sir [[Thomas Heneage]] and the ''Drake Pendant'' given to Sir [[Francis Drake]] are the best known examples.  As part of the cult of the Virgin Queen, courtiers were rather expected to wear the Queen's likeness, at least at Court.

His appointment as miniaturist to the Crown included the old sense of a painter of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and he was commissioned to decorate important documents, such as the founding [[charter]] of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] (1584), which has an enthroned Elizabeth under a [[Baldachin|canopy of estate]] within an elaborate framework of Flemish-style Renaissance strapwork and [[grotesque]] ornament.  He also seems to have designed [[woodcut]] title-page frames and borders for books, some of which bear his initials.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, pp. 62 &amp; 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Darnley Portrait'', c. 1575]]

===The Darnley Portrait===
The problem of an official portrait of Elizabeth was solved with the ''Darnley  Portrait''.&lt;ref&gt;So-called from its location at [[Cobham House]], much later the seat of the [[Earls of Darnley]]; see Strong 1987 p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Likely painted from life around 1575–6, this portrait is the source of a face pattern which would be used and reused for authorized portraits of Elizabeth into the 1590s, preserving the impression of ageless beauty.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] suggested that the artist is [[Federico Zuccari]] or Zucaro, an "eminent" Italian artist, though not really a specialist portrait-painter, who is known to have visited the court briefly with a letter of introduction to Elizabeth's [[favourite]] [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] dated 5 March 1575.&lt;ref name="G2"&gt;Strong 1987, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Zuccaro's preparatory drawings for full-length portraits of both Leicester and Elizabeth survive, although it is unlikely the full-length of Elizabeth was ever painted.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Curators at the National Portrait Gallery believe that the attribution of the Darnley portrait to Zuccaro is "not sustainable" and attribute the work to an unknown "continental" (possibly Netherlandish) artist.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Darnley Portrait'' features a crown and [[sceptre]] on a table beside the queen, and was the first appearance of these symbols of sovereignty separately used as [[Theatrical property|props]] (rather than worn and carried) in Tudor portraiture, a theme that would be expanded in later portraits.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Recent conservation work has revealed that Elizabeth's now-iconic pale complexion in this portrait is the result of deterioration of [[Red#Pigments and dyes|red lake pigments]], which has also altered the coloring of her dress.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors2"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 162-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Art"&gt;{{cite web|author = National Portrait Gallery |title = Making Art in Tudor Britain: 'Darnley' portrait | url = http://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/making-art-in-tudor-britain/case-studies/the-queens-likeness-portraits-of-elizabeth-i.php#darnleyportrait |year = 2014 | accessdate = 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Virgin Empress of the Seas==

===Return of the Golden Age===
[[File:Elizabeth1England.jpg|thumb|The ''Ermine Portrait'', William Segar, 1585. Elizabeth as ''Pax''.]]
The [[excommunication]] of Elizabeth by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570 led to increased tension with Philip II of Spain, who championed the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as the legitimate heir of his late wife Mary I.  This tension played out over the next decades in the seas of the [[New World]] as well as in Europe, and culminated in the invasion attempt of the [[Spanish Armada]].

It is against this backdrop that the first of a long series of portraits appears depicting Elizabeth with heavy symbolic overlays of imperial dominion based on mastery of the seas.&lt;ref name="G3"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a second layer of symbolism representing Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen, these new paintings signify the manipulation of Elizabeth's image as the destined [[Protestant]] protector of her people.

Strong points out that there is no trace of this iconography in portraits of Elizabeth prior to 1579, and identifies its source as the conscious image-making of [[John Dee]], whose 1577 ''General and Rare Memorials Pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'' encouraged the establishment of a British Empire supported by a strong navy, asserting Elizabeth's claims to imperial status via her supposed descent from [[Brutus of Troy]] and [[King Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee's inspiration lies in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'', which was accepted as true history by Elizabethan poets{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and formed the basis of the symbolic history of England.  In this twelfth century [[pseudohistory]], Britain was founded by and named after Brutus, the descendent of [[Aeneas]] who founded Rome.  The Tudors, of [[Wales|Welsh]] descent, are heirs of the most ancient Britons and thus of Aeneas and Brutus.  By uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster following the strife of the [[Wars of the Roses]], the Tudors ushered in a united realm where ''[[Pax (mythology)|Pax]]'' reigned.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spenserian scholar Edwin  Greenlaw states "The descent of the Britons from the Trojans, the linking of Arthur, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth as Britain's greatest monarchs, and the return under Elizabeth of the [[Golden Age]] are all commonplaces of Elizabethan thought."&lt;ref&gt;E[dwin] Greenlaw, ''Studies in Spenser's Historical Allegory,'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1932, quoted in Yates, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of history and Elizabeth's place in it forms the background to the symbolic portraits of the latter half of her reign.

===The Virgin Queen===
[[File:George Gower Elizabeth Sieve Portrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Plimpton Sieve Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I|Plimpton ''Sieve Portrait'']], Gower, 1579]]

A series of ''Sieve Portraits'' copy the ''Darnley'' face pattern and add an allegorical overlay that depicts Elizabeth as [[Tuccia]], a [[Vestal Virgin]] who proved her chastity by carrying a sieve full of water from the [[Tiber River]] to the [[Temple of Vesta]] without spilling a drop.&lt;ref&gt;See Hearn 1995, p. 85; Strong 1987, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Sieve Portrait'' was painted by [[George Gower]] in 1579, but the most influential image is the 1583 version by [[Quentin Metsys the Younger|Quentin Metsys (or Massys) the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Strong attributed the painting to [[Cornelis Ketel]] in 1969 and again in 1987 (Strong 1987 p. 101), closer examination has revealed that the painting is signed and dated on the base of the globe ''1583. Q. MASSYS | ANT'' (for "of Antwerp"). (See Hearn 1995, p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metsys Elizabeth I The Sieve Portrait c1583.jpg|thumb|upright|The Siena ''Sieve Portrait'', Metsys the Younger, 1583]]

In the Metsys version, Elizabeth is surrounded by symbols of empire, including a column and a globe, iconography that would appear again and again in her portraiture of the 1580s and 1590s, most notably in the ''Armada Portrait'' of c. 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p. 85; Strong 1987 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The medallions on the pillar to the left of the queen illustrate the story  of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] and Aeneas, ancestor of Brutus, suggesting that like Aeneas, Elizabeth's destiny is to reject marriage and found an empire.  This painting's patron was likely Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (his [[heraldic badge]] of the white hind appears on the sleeve of one of the courtiers in the background), and the work may express opposition to the proposed marriage of Elizabeth to [[François, Duke of Anjou]].&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"&gt;Yates, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The virgin Tuccia was familiar to Elizabethan readers from [[Petrarch]]'s "The Triumph of Chastity".  Another symbol from this work is the spotless [[ermine]], wearing a collar of gold studded with topazes.&lt;ref&gt;Yates pp. 115, 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol of purity appears in the ''Ermine Portrait'' of 1585, attributed to the [[herald]] [[William Segar]].  The queen bears the olive branch of ''Pax'' (Peace), and the sword of justice rests on the table at her side.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  In combination, these symbols represent not only the personal purity of Elizabeth but the "righteousness and justice of her government."&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions of empire===
{{Main|Armada Portrait}}
[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|The Woburn Abbey version of the ''Armada Portrait'', c. 1588]]
The ''[[Armada Portrait]]'' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] panel painting depicting the queen surrounded by symbols of empire against a backdrop representing the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

There are three surviving versions of the portrait, in addition to several derivative paintings.  The version at [[Woburn Abbey]], the seat of the [[Duke of Bedford|Dukes of Bedford]], was long accepted as the work of George Gower, who had been appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA"&gt;Strong 1987, ''Gloriana'', p. 130–133&lt;/ref&gt;  A version in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery, London]], which has been cut down at both sides leaving just a portrait of the queen, was also formerly attributed to Gower.  A third version, owned by the Tyrwhitt-Drake family, may have been commissioned by Sir [[Francis Drake]]. Scholars agree that this version is by a different hand, noting distinctive techniques and approaches to the modelling of the queen's features.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hearn 1995 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This version was heavily overpainted in the later 17th century, which complicates attribution and may account for several differences in details of the costume.  See  Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'', pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; Curators now believe that the three extant versions are all the output of different workshops under the direction of unknown English artists.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors3"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 151-154&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of a life-sized portrait of the queen with a horizontal format is "quite unprecedented in her portraiture",&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt; although allegorical portraits in a horizontal format, such as ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' and the ''Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' pre-date the ''Armada Portrait''.
[[File:Elizabeth I Crispin van de Passe 1596.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving by Crispijn van de Passe, printed 1596]]
The queen's hand rests on a globe below the crown of England, "her fingers covering the Americas, indicating England's dominion of the seas and plans for imperialist expansion in the New World".&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Andrew Belsey and [[Catherine Belsey]], "Icons of Divinity: Portraits of Elizabeth I" in Gent and Llewellyen, ''Renaissance Bodies'', pp. 11–35&lt;/ref&gt;  The Queen is flanked by two columns behind, probably a reference to the famous [[personal device|impresa]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V]], Philip II of Spain's father, which represented the [[pillars of Hercules]], gateway to the Atlantic Ocean and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the background view on the left, English [[fireship]]s threaten the Spanish fleet, and on the right the ships are driven onto a rocky coast amid stormy seas by the "[[Protestant Wind]]". On a secondary level, these images show Elizabeth turning her back on storm and darkness while sunlight shines where she gazes.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;

An engraving by [[Crispijn van de Passe]] (Crispin van de Passe), published in 1596 but showing costume of the 1580s, carries similar iconography.  Elizabeth stands between two columns bearing her arms and the Tudor [[heraldic badge]] of a [[portcullis]].  The columns are surmounted by her emblems of a pelican in her piety and a phoenix, and ships fill the sea behind her.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cult of Elizabeth===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth I ('The Ditchley portrait') by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Ditchley Portrait'', [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], c.1592]]
The various threads of mythology and symbolism that created the iconography of Elizabeth I combined into a tapestry of immense complexity in the years following the defeat of the Spanish Armada.  In poetry, portraiture and pageantry, the queen was celebrated as [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the just virgin, and simultaneously as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love.  Another exaltation of the queen's virgin purity identified her with the moon goddess who holds dominion over the waters.  Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] had begun to use [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and later [[Artemis#Worship of Artemis|Cynthia]] as aliases for the queen in his poetry around 1580, and images of Elizabeth with jewels in the shape of crescent moons or the huntress's arrows begin to appear in portraiture around 1586 and multiply through the remainder of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;  Courtiers wore the image of the Queen to signify their devotion, and had their portraits painted wearing her colours of black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 70–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ditchley Portrait'' seems to have always been at the Oxfordshire home of Elizabeth's retired Champion, Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], and likely was painted for (or commemorates)  her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. The painting is attributed to Marcus Gheerearts the Younger, and was almost certainly based on a sitting arranged by Lee, who was the painter's patron.  In this image, the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire.  The painting has been trimmed and the background poorly repainted, so that the inscription and sonnet are incomplete.  Storms rage behind her while the sun shines before her, and she wears a jewel in the form of a celestial or [[armillary sphere]] close to her left ear.  Many versions of this painting were made, likely in Gheeraerts' workshop, with the allegorical items removed and Elizabeth's features "softened" from the stark realism of her face in the original.  One of these was sent as a [[diplomatic gift]] to the [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and is now in the [[Palazzo Pitti]].&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 135–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The last sitting and the Mask of Youth===
[[File:Isaac Oliver Elizabeth I of England.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Unfinished miniature, Oliver, c. 1592]]
[[File:Nicholas Hilliard Elizabeth I 1595-1600 v2.jpg|upright|thumb|Recently discovered miniature by Hilliard, 1595–1600]]
Around 1592, the queen also sat to Isaac Oliver, a pupil of Hilliard, who produced an unfinished portrait miniature (left) used as a pattern for [[engraving]]s of the queen.  Only a single finished miniature from this pattern survives, with the queen's features softened, and Strong concludes that this realistic image from life of the aging Elizabeth was not deemed a success.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1590s, woodcuts and engravings of the queen were created as book illustrations, but in this decade individual prints of the queen first appear, based on the Oliver face pattern.  In 1596, the Privy Council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen which had caused her "great offence" should be sought out and burnt, and Strong suggest that these prints, of which comparatively few survive, may be the offending images.  Strong writes "It must have been exposure to the searching realism of both Gheeraerts and Oliver that provoked the decision to suppress all likenesses of the queen that depicted her as being in any way old and hence subject to mortality."&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, no surviving portraits dated between 1596 and Elizabeth's death in 1603 show the aging queen as she truly was.  Faithful resemblance to the original is only to be found in contemporaries’ accounts as in the report written in 1597 by André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from [[Henry IV of France]], after an audience with the sixty-five year-old queen, during which he noticed, "her teeth are very yellow and unequal […] and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." Yet he added, "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal."&lt;ref&gt; De Maisse: a journal of all that was accomplished by Monsieur De Maisse, ambassador in England from King Henri IV to Queen Elizabeth, anno domini 1597, Nonesuch Press, 1931, p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent images rely on a face pattern devised by Nicholas Hilliard sometime in the 1590s called by art historians the "Mask of Youth", portraying Elizabeth as ever-young.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's Catalogue L07123, ''Important British Paintings 1500–1850'', November 2007, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 16 miniatures by Hilliard and his studio are known based on this face pattern, with different combinations of costume and jewels likely painted from life, and it was also adopted by (or enforced on) other artists associated with the Court.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;

===The coronation portraits===
[[File:Elizabeth I Coronation Miniature.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Hilliard, c.1600]]
Two portraits of Elizabeth in her [[coronation]] robes survive, both dated to 1600 or shortly thereafter. One is a panel portrait in oils (&lt;small&gt;above&lt;/small&gt;) and the other is a miniature by Nicholas Hilliard.  The warrant to the queen's tailor for remodelling Mary I's cloth of gold coronation robes for Elizabeth survives, and costume historian [[Janet Arnold]]'s study points out that the paintings accurately reflect the written records, although the jewels differ in the two paintings,&lt;ref name="Coro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1978&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting two different sources, one possibly a miniature by Levina Teerlinc. It is not known why, and for whom, these portraits were created; at or just after the end of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rainbow Portrait===
[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Rainbow Porait'', c. 1600–02, attrib. Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]]
Attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]],&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Roy C. ''Gloriana: The Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I''. Germany: Thames and Hudson, 1987. pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the most heavily symbolic portrait of the queen is the ''Rainbow Portrait'' at [[Hatfield House]]. It was painted around 1600–1602, when the queen was in her sixties.  In this painting an ageless Elizabeth appears dressed as if for a [[masque]], in a linen bodice [[embroidery|embroidered]] with spring flowers and a mantle draped over one shoulder, her hair loose beneath a fantastical headdress.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 157–160&lt;/ref&gt;  She wears symbols out of the popular [[emblem book]]s, including the cloak with eyes and ears, the serpent of wisdom, and the celestial [[armillary sphere]], and carries a rainbow with the motto ''non sine sol iris'' ("no rainbow without the sun").  Strong suggests that the complex "programme" for this image may be the work of the poet [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], whose ''Hymns to Astraea'' honouring the queen use much of the same imagery, and suggests it was commissioned by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] as part of the decor for Elizabeth's visit in 1602, when a "shrine to Astraea" featured in the entertainments of what would prove to be the "last great festival of the reign".&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cult"&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and coins==

[[File:Bishops Bible Elizabeth I 1569.jpg|upright|thumb|Coloured title page of the ''Bishops' Bible'', 1569, [[British Museum]].]]
Prior to the wide dissemination of prints of the queen in the 1590s, the common people of Elizabeth's England would be most familiar with her image on the [[coin]]age.  In December 1560, a systematic recoinage of the debased money then in circulation was begun. The main early effort was the issuance of [[sterling silver]] [[shilling]]s and [[Groat (coin)|groats]], but new coins were issued in both silver and gold.  This restoration of the currency was one of the three principal achievements noted on Elizabeth's tomb, illustrating the value of stable currency to her contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Later coinage represented the queen in iconic fashion, with the traditional accompaniments of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] heraldic badges including the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]].

Books provided another widely available source of images of Elizabeth.  Her portrait appeared on the title page of the ''[[Bishops' Bible]]'', the standard Bible of the [[Church of England]], issued in 1568 and revised in 1572.  In various editions, Elizabeth is depicted with her orb and sceptre accompanied by female [[personification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Reading" the portraits==
[[File:Elizabeth I Palazzo Pitti Florence.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence]]
It may be impossible for modern viewers to see the hundreds of images of Elizabeth as her subjects, courtiers, and rivals saw them.  The portraits are steeped in classical mythology and the [[Renaissance]] understanding of English history and destiny, filtered by [[allusion]]s to [[Petrarch]]'s [[sonnet]]s and, late in the reign, to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.  Dame [[Frances Yates]] points out that the most complexly symbolic portraits may all commemorate specific events or have been designed as part of elaborate themed entertainments.&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"/&gt; The most familiar images of Elizabeth—the ''Armada'', ''Ditchley'', and ''Rainbow'' portraits—are all associated with unique events in this way.  To the extent that the contexts of other portraits have been lost to scholars, so too the keys to understanding these remarkable images as the Elizabethans understood them may be lost in time.  Even those portraits that are not overtly allegorical may be full of meaning to a discerning eye. Elizabethan courtiers familiar with the [[language of flowers]] and the Italian emblem books could have read stories in the blooms the queen carried, the embroidery on her clothes, and the design of her jewels.

According to [[Roy Strong]], &lt;blockquote&gt;Fear of the wrong use and perception of the visual image dominates the Elizabethan age. The old pre-Reformation idea of images, religious ones, was that they partook of the essence of what they depicted. Any advance in technique which could reinforce that experience was embraced. That was now reversed, indeed it may account for the Elizabethans failing to take cognisance of the optical advances which created the art of the Italian Renaissance. They certainly knew about these things but, and this is central to the understanding of the Elizabethans, chose not to employ them. Instead the visual arts retreated in favour of presenting a series of signs or symbols through which the viewer was meant to pass to an understanding of the idea behind the work. In this manner the visual arts were verbalised, turned into a form of book, a 'text' which called for reading by the onlooker. There are no better examples of this than the quite extraordinary portraits of the queen herself, which increasingly, as the reign progressed, took on the form of collections of abstract pattern and symbols disposed in an unnaturalistic manner for the viewer to unravel, and by doing so enter into an inner vision of the idea of monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}
{{Semiotics}}
'''Postmodernism''' is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across [[philosophy]], [[the arts]], [[architecture]], and [[criticism]] and that marked a departure from [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism|title=postmodernism: definition of postmodernism in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reichl, Cook's November 1989; [http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html American Heritage Dictionary's definition of "postmodern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |date=9 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also more generally been applied to the [[Postmodernity|historical era following modernity]] and the tendencies of this era.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; (In this context, "modern" is not used in the sense of "contemporary", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.)
 
While encompassing a wide variety of approaches, postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], [[irony]], or rejection toward the [[meta-narrative]]s and [[ideology|ideologies]] of modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment rationality]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Consequently, common targets of postmodern critique include [[universalism|universalist]] notions of [[objective reality]], [[moral universalism|morality]], [[truth]], [[human nature]], [[reason]], [[language]], and [[social progress]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duignan|first1=Brian|title=Postmodernism|website=[[Britannica]]|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] or [[social conditioning|socially-conditioned]] nature of [[knowledge]] claims and  [[value system]]s, situating them as products of particular political, historical, or cultural [[discourse]]s and [[hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to [[self-reference|self-referentiality]], [[epistemological relativism|epistemological]] and [[moral relativism]], [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], [[subjectivism]], and irreverence.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Postmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including [[cultural studies]], [[philosophy of science]],  [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[architecture]], [[feminist theory]], and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[Postmodern art|art movements]] in fields such as [[postmodern literature|literature]] and music. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as [[deconstruction]] and [[post-structuralism]], as well as philosophers such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Fredric Jameson]]. Some philosophers have criticized the term.

==History==
Postmodernism arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what is now called postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of artists such as [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barth, John: “[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].” ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and [[continental philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,&lt;ref&gt;See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a "[[grand narrative]]" of  Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;See Lyotard, Jean-François, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; a preference for the [[virtual (philosophy)|virtual]] at the expense of [[the Real]] (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)&lt;ref&gt;See Baudrillard, Jean: “[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.” In: ''Jean Baudrillard. Selected Writings''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1988, pp. 166-184.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "waning of affect"&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric: ''Postmodernism or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''.

{{Main article|Manifestations of postmodernism }}
[[Structuralism]] was a philosophical movement developed by French academics in the 1950s, partly in response to French [[Existentialism]]. It has been seen variously as an expression of [[Modernism]], [[High modernism]], or postmodernism {{By whom|date=July 2010}}. [[Post-Structuralism|"Post-structuralists"]] were thinkers who moved away from the strict interpretations and applications of structuralist ideas. Many American academics consider post-structuralism to be part of the broader, less well-defined postmodernist movement, even though many post-structuralists insisted it was not. Thinkers who have been called structuralists include the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], the linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]], and the semiotician [[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Algirdas Greimas]]. The early writings of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] and the literary theorist [[Roland Barthes]] have also been called structuralists. Those who began as structuralists but became post-structuralists include [[Michel Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Gilles Deleuze]]. Other post-structuralists include [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]], and [[Luce Irigaray]]. The American cultural theorists, critics and intellectuals whom they influenced include [[Judith Butler]], [[John Fiske (media studies)|John Fiske]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Avital Ronell]], and [[Hayden White]].

Post-structuralism is not defined by a set of shared axioms or methodologies, but by an emphasis on how various aspects of a particular culture, from its most ordinary, everyday material details to its most abstract theories and beliefs, determine one another. Post-structuralist thinkers reject [[Reductionism]] and [[Epiphenomenalism]] and the idea that cause-and-effect relationships are top-down or bottom-up. Like structuralists, they start from the assumption that people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather than having ''intrinsic'' properties that can be understood in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lévi-Strauss|first1=Claude| |authorlink=Claude Lévi-Strauss| title=Structural Anthropology|date=1963|publisher=New York: Basic Books|location=USA|isbn=046509516X|page=324|edition=I}}&lt;br/&gt;Lévi-Strauss, quoting D'Arcy Westworth Thompson states: "To those who question the possibility of defining the interrelations between entities whose nature is not completely understood, I shall reply with the following comment by a great naturalist: In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself has to be left unanalyzed and undefined."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing [[Relativism]] and [[Social constructionism|Constructionism]]. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of their study might be described, reductively, as a set of ''essential'' relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude Lévi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in "The Structural Study of Myth"&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Anthropologie Structurale''. Paris: Éditions Plon, 1958.&lt;br/&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Structural Anthropology''. Trans. Claire Jacobson and Brooke Grundfest Schoepf (New York: Basic Books, 1963), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmeUknlauJAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=NJWcwczLLV&amp;dq=Structural%20Anthropology%20Basic%20Books&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=Structural%20Anthropology%20Basic%20Books&amp;f=false 228].&lt;/ref&gt;). Post-structuralists thinkers went further, questioning the existence of any distinction between the nature of a thing and its relationship to other things.

Postmodernist ideas in [[philosophy]] and the analysis of [[culture]] and [[society]] expanded the importance of [[critical theory]] and has been the point of departure for works of [[literature]], [[architecture]], and [[design]], as well as being visible in marketing/business and the interpretation of [[history]], [[law]] and [[culture]], starting in the late 20th century. These developments—re-evaluation of the entire Western value system ([[love]], [[marriage]], [[popular culture]], shift from [[industrial society|industrial]] to [[service economy]]) that took place since the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in the [[May 1968 in France|Social Revolution of 1968]]—are described with the term "[[postmodernity]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inst.at/trans/11Nr/luetzeler11.htm|title=TRANS Nr. 11: Paul Michael Lützeler (St. Louis): From Postmodernism to Postcolonialism|work=inst.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to ''Postmodernism'', a term referring to an opinion or movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Postmodernism has also been used interchangeably with the term post-structuralism out of which postmodernism grew; a proper understanding of postmodernism or doing justice to the postmodernist concept demands an understanding of the post-structuralist movement and the ideas of its advocates. Post-structuralism resulted similarly to postmodernism by following a time of structuralism. It is characterized by new ways of thinking through structuralism, contrary to the original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yilmaz | first1 = K | year = 2010 | title = Postmodernism and its Challenge to the Discipline of History: Implications for History Education | url = | journal = Educational Philosophy &amp; Theory | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 779–795 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-5812.2009.00525.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Postmodernist" describes part of a movement; "Postmodern" places it in the period of time since the 1950s, making it a part of [[contemporary history]].

One of the most well-known postmodernist concerns is "deconstruction," a theory for philosophy, literary criticism, and textual analysis developed by [[Jacques Derrida]]. The notion of a "deconstructive" approach implies an analysis that questions the already evident understanding of a text in terms of presuppositions, ideological underpinnings, hierarchical values, and frames of reference. A deconstructive approach further depends on the techniques of close reading without reference to cultural, ideological, moral opinions or information derived from an authority over the text such as the author. At the same time Derrida famously writes: "Il n'y a pas d'hors-texte (''there is no such thing as outside-of-the-text'')."&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1967), Of Grammatology, Part II, Introduction to the "Age of Rousseau," section 2 "...That Dangerous Supplement...", title, The Exorbitant Question of Method, pp. 158–59, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida implies that the world follows the grammar of a text undergoing its own deconstruction. Derrida's method frequently involves recognizing and spelling out the different, yet similar interpretations of the meaning of a given text and the problematic implications of binary oppositions within the meaning of a text. Derrida's philosophy inspired a postmodern movement called [[deconstructivism]] among architects, characterized by the intentional fragmentation, distortion, and dislocation of architectural elements in designing a building. Derrida discontinued his involvement with the movement after the publication of his collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenman in ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman''.&lt;ref&gt;Benoît Peeters, ''Derrida: A Biography'', pp. 377–8, translated by Andrew Brown, [[Polity Press]], 2013, {{ISBN|9780745656151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between postmodernism, posthumanism, and cyborgism has led to a challenge of postmodernism, for which the terms "postpostmodernism" and "postpoststructuralism" were first coined in 2003:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/decon2/decon_leonardo_leon_36_4_285_0.pdf|title="Deconstructing Decontamination", LEONARDO, Vol. 36, No. 4, pp. 285–290, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Postcyborg Ethics: A New Way to Speak of Technology", Heidi A.

More recently [[metamodernism]], post-postmodernism and the "death of postmodernism" have been widely debated: in 2007 Andrew Hoberek noted in his introduction to a special issue of the journal ''Twentieth Century Literature'' titled "After Postmodernism" that "declarations of postmodernism's demise have become a critical commonplace". A small group of critics has put forth a range of theories that aim to describe culture or society in the alleged aftermath of postmodernism, most notably Raoul Eshelman (performatism), [[Gilles Lipovetsky]] ([[hypermodernity]]), [[Nicolas Bourriaud]] ([[altermodern]]), and Alan Kirby (digimodernism, formerly called pseudo-modernism). None of these new theories and labels have so far gained very widespread acceptance. Sociocultural anthropologist Nina Müller-Schwarze offers neostructuralism as a possible direction. &lt;ref&gt;Müller Schwarze, Nina

==Origins of term==
The term ''postmodern'' was first used around the 1880s. John Watkins Chapman suggested "a Postmodern style of painting" as a way to depart from French [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ihab Hassan|Hassan, Ihab]], ''The Postmodern Turn, Essays in Postmodern Theory and Culture'', Ohio University Press, 1987. p. 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt; J. M. Thompson, in his 1914 article in ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' (a quarterly philosophical review), used it to describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of [[religion]], writing: "The raison d'être of Post-Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] by being thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as [[theology]], to Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. M. "Post-Modernism," ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]''. Vol XII No. 4, July 1914. p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 and 1925, postmodernism had been used to describe new forms of [[art]] and [[music]]. In 1942 H. R. Hays described it as a new literary form. However, as a general theory for a historical movement it was first used in 1939 by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]: "Our own Post-Modern Age has been inaugurated by the general war of 1914–1918".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGQ9AQAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''A study of History'', Volume 5], Oxford University Press, 1961 [1939], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portland Building 1982.jpg|right|thumb|[[Portland Building]] (1982), by architect Michael Graves, an example of [[Postmodern architecture]]]]
In 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with [[modern architecture]], and led to the [[postmodern architecture]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and a response to the modernist architectural movement known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]]. Postmodernism in architecture was initially marked by a re-emergence of surface ornament, reference to surrounding buildings in urban settings, historical reference in decorative forms ([[eclecticism]]), and non-orthogonal angles.

[[Peter Drucker]] suggested the transformation into a post-modern world happened between 1937 and 1957 (when he was writing). He described an as yet "nameless era" which he characterized as a shift to conceptual world based on pattern, purpose, and process rather than mechanical cause, outlined by four new realities: the emergence of Educated Society, the importance of [[international development]], the decline of the nation state, and the collapse of the viability of non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=LoT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F.| authorlink=Peter Drucker |title=Landmarks of Tomorrow|date=1957|publisher=Harper Brothers|location=New York|url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/30294/XX_CNE-LIPSOR_1197.pdf.txt?sequence=3|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, in a lecture delivered at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, [[Mel Bochner]] described "post-modernism" in art as having started with Jasper Johns, "who first rejected sense-data and the singular point-of-view as the basis for his art, and treated art as a critical investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bochner|first1=Mel|authorlink=Mel Bochner| title=Solar System &amp; Rest Rooms: Writings and Interviews 1965--2007|date=2008|publisher=The MIT Press|location=USA|isbn=9780262026314|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Walter Truett Anderson]] described postmodernism as belonging to one of four typological world views, which he identifies as either (a) Postmodern-ironist, which sees truth as socially constructed, (b) Scientific-rational, in which truth is found through methodical, disciplined inquiry, (c) Social-traditional, in which truth is found in the heritage of American and Western civilization, or (d) Neo-Romantic, in which truth is found through attaining harmony with nature and/or spiritual exploration of the inner self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Fontana Postmodernism Reader]]|author=Walter Truett Anderson|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]] rejected the philosophical basis of the concepts of "subjectivity" and "objectivity" and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another. Instead of resisting the admission of this paradox in the search for understanding, Heidegger requires that we embrace it through an active process of elucidation he called the "[[hermeneutic circle]]". He stressed the [[historicity]] and cultural construction of concepts while simultaneously advocating the necessity of an [[wikt:atemporal|atemporal]] and [[immanence|immanent]] apprehension of them. In this vein, he asserted that it was the task of contemporary philosophy to recover the original question of (or "openness to") ''[[Dasein]]'' (translated as Being or Being-there) present in the [[Presocratic]] philosophers but normalized, neutered, and standardized since [[Plato]]. This was to be done, in part, by tracing the record of ''Dasein's'' sublimation or forgetfulness through the history of philosophy which meant that we were to ask again what constituted the grounding conditions in ourselves and in the World for the affinity between beings and between the many usages of the term "being" in philosophy. To do this, however, a non-historical and, to a degree, self-referential engagement with whatever set of ideas, feelings or practices would permit (both the non-fixed concept and reality of) such a continuity was required—a continuity permitting the possible experience, possible existence indeed not only of beings but of all differences as they appeared and tended to develop.

Such a conclusion led Heidegger to depart from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of his teacher [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of [[Ontology]], a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]] or between things in themselves (''[[de re]]'') and things as they appear (see [[qualia]]): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness to the process of ''Dasein''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in [[Rationalism]], [[Empiricism]], and [[methodological naturalism]], his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a [[nominalist]]), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Heinrich von Kleist]], [[World view|Weltanschauung]], and [[social constructionism]]), and his [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] and [[Via Negativa|negativist]] notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also [[process philosophy]], [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[Instrumentalism]], [[Pragmatism]], and [[Vitalism]]).

===Jacques Derrida===
[[Jacques Derrida]] re-examined the fundamentals of writing and its consequences on philosophy in general; sought to undermine the language of "presence" or [[metaphysics]] in an analytical technique which, beginning as a point of departure from Heidegger's notion of [[Heideggerian terminology|''Destruktion'']], came to be known as [[Deconstruction]]. Derrida used, like Heidegger, references to Greek philosophical notions associated with the [[Skeptic]]s and the [[Presocratic]]s, such as [[Epoché]] and [[Aporia]] to articulate his notion of implicit circularity between premises and conclusions, origins and manifestations, but—in a manner analogous in certain respects to [[Gilles Deleuze]]—presented a radical re-reading of canonical philosophical figures such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Descartes]] as themselves being informed by such "destabilizing" notions.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]] introduced concepts such as '[[discourse|discursive regime]]', or re-invoked those of older philosophers like '[[episteme]]' and '[[Genealogy of Morals|genealogy]]' in order to explain the relationship between meaning, power, and social behavior within social orders (see ''[[The Order of Things]]'', ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'', ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''). In direct contradiction to what have been typified as [[modernist]] perspectives on [[epistemology]], Foucault asserted that rational judgment, social practice, and what he called "[[biopower]]" are not only inseparable but co-determinant. While Foucault himself was deeply involved in a number of progressive political causes and maintained close personal ties with members of the [[far-left]], he was also controversial with leftist thinkers of his day, including those associated with various [[Marxist]] tendencies, proponents of [[left-libertarianism]] (such as [[Noam Chomsky's political views|Noam Chomsky]]), and supporters of [[humanism]] (like [[Jürgen Habermas]]), for his rejection of what he deemed to be [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] concepts of freedom, liberation, [[self-determination]], and [[human nature]]. Instead, Foucault focused on the ways in which such constructs can foster [[cultural hegemony]], violence, and exclusion.

In line with his rejection of such "[[Positivism|positive]]" tenets of Enlightenment-era humanism, he was active—with [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]—in the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, considering much of institutionalized psychiatry and, in particular, Freud's concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] central to [[Psychoanalysis]] (which was still very influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s), to be both harmful and misplaced. Foucault was known for his controversial aphorisms, such as "language is oppression"{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, meaning that language functions in such a way as to render nonsensical, false, or silent tendencies that might otherwise threaten or undermine the distributions of power backing a society's conventions—even when such distributions purport to celebrate liberation and expression or value minority groups and perspectives. His writings have had a major influence on the larger body of postmodern academic literature.

===Jean-François Lyotard===
[[Jean-François Lyotard]] identified in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' a crisis in the "discourses of the human sciences" latent in modernism but catapulted to the fore by the advent of the "computerized" or "telematic" era (see [[Information Revolution|information revolution]]). This crisis, insofar as it pertains to academia, concerns both the motivations and justification procedures for making research claims: unstated givens or values that have validated the basic efforts of academic research since the late 18th century might no longer be valid—particularly, in social science and humanities research, though examples from mathematics are given by Lyotard as well. As formal conjecture about real-world issues becomes inextricably linked to automated calculation, information storage, and retrieval, such knowledge becomes increasingly "exteriorised" from its knowers in the form of information. Knowledge thus becomes materialized and made into a commodity exchanged between producers and consumers; it ceases to be either an idealistic end-in-itself or a tool capable of bringing about liberty or social benefit; it is stripped of its humanistic and spiritual associations, its connection with education, teaching, and human development, being simply rendered as "data"—omnipresent, material, unending, and without any contexts or pre-requisites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/lyotard.htm Lyotard, Jean-François. The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. Les Éditions de Minuit, 1979. English Translation by Geoffrey Bennington and Brian Massumi. Manchester University Press, 1984. See Chapter 1, The Field: Knowledge in Computerised Societies.]//&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the "diversity" of claims made by various disciplines begins to lack any unifying principle or intuition as objects of study become more and more specialized due to the emphasis on specificity, precision, and uniformity of reference that competitive, database-oriented research implies.

The value-premises upholding academic research have been maintained by what Lyotard considers to be quasi-mythological beliefs about human purpose, human reason, and human progress—large, background constructs he calls "[[metanarrative]]s". These metanarratives still remain in Western society but are now being undermined by rapid [[Informatization]] and the commercialization of the university and its functions. The shift of authority from the presence and intuition of knowers—from the good faith of reason to seek diverse knowledge integrated for human benefit or truth fidelity—to the automated database and the market had, in Lyotard's view, the power to unravel the very idea of "justification" or "legitimation" and, with it, the rationale for research altogether, especially in disciplines pertaining to human life, society, and meaning. We are now controlled not by binding extra-linguistic value paradigms defining notions of collective identity and ultimate purpose, but rather by our automatic responses to different species of "language games" (a concept Lyotard imports from [[J. L. Austin]]'s theory of [[speech act]]s). In his vision of a solution to this "vertigo", Lyotard opposes the assumptions of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]], consensus, and generality that he identified within the thought of humanistic, [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers like [[Jürgen Habermas]], and proposes a continuation of experimentation and diversity to be assessed pragmatically in the context of language games rather than via appeal to a resurrected series of transcendentals and metaphysical unities.

===Richard Rorty===
[[Richard Rorty]] argues in ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' that contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of [[representationalism]] and [[correspondence theory]] that rely upon the independence of knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of [[anti-foundationalism]] and anti-essentialism within a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of [[conventionalism]] and [[relativism]], but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to [[social liberalism]].

===Jean Baudrillard===
[[Jean Baudrillard]], in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'', introduced the concept that reality or the principle of "[[The Real]]" is short-circuited by the interchangeability of signs in an era whose communicative and semantic acts are dominated by electronic media and digital technologies. Baudrillard proposes the notion that, in such a state, where subjects are detached from the outcomes of events (political, literary, artistic, personal, or otherwise), events no longer hold any particular sway on the subject nor have any identifiable context; they therefore have the effect of producing widespread indifference, detachment, and passivity in industrialized populations. He claimed that a constant stream of appearances and references without any direct consequences to viewers or readers could eventually render the division between appearance and object indiscernible, resulting, ironically, in the "disappearance" of mankind in what is, in effect, a virtual or holographic state, composed only of appearances. For [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]], "simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or a reality: a [[hyperreality|hyperreal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Luke, T. W. (1991). Power and politics in hyperreality: The critical project of Jean Baudrillard. Social Science Journal, 28(3), 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fredric Jameson===
[[Fredric Jameson]] set forth one of the first expansive theoretical treatments of postmodernism as a historical period, intellectual trend, and social phenomenon in a series of lectures at the [[Whitney Museum]], later expanded as ''Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'' (1991). Eclectic in his methodology, Jameson has continued a sustained examination of the role that [[periodization]] continues to play as a grounding assumption of critical methodologies in [[humanities]] disciplines. He has contributed extensive effort to explicating the importance of concepts of [[Utopia]] and Utopianism as driving forces in the cultural and intellectual movements of [[modernity]], and outlining the political and existential uncertainties that may result from the decline or suspension of this trend in the theorized state of postmodernity. Like [[Susan Sontag]], Jameson served to introduce a wide audience of American readers to key figures of the 20th century [[continental European]] intellectual left, particularly those associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], [[structuralism]], and [[post-structuralism]]. Thus, his importance as a "translator" of their ideas to the common vocabularies of a variety of disciplines in the Anglo-American academic complex is equally as important as his own critical engagement with them.

===Douglas Kellner===
In ''Analysis of the Journey'', a journal birthed from postmodernism, [[Douglas Kellner]] insists that the "assumptions and procedures of modern theory" must be forgotten. His terms defined in the depth of postmodernism are based on advancement, innovation, and adaptation. Extensively, Kellner analyzes the terms of this theory in real-life experiences and examples. Kellner used science and technology studies as a major part of his analysis; he urged that the theory is incomplete without it. The scale was larger than just postmodernism alone; it must be interpreted through cultural studies where science and technology studies play a huge role. The reality of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States of America is the catalyst for his explanation. This catalyst is used as a great representation due to the mere fact of the planned ambush and destruction of "symbols of globalization", insinuating the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].

{{Clarify|reason=Unclear what exactly is being said here, as if crucial information is omitted.|text=One of the numerous yet appropriate definitions of postmodernism and the qualm aspect aids this attribute to seem perfectly accurate.|date=March 2017}} In response, Kellner continues to examine the repercussions of understanding the effects of the September 11 attacks. He questions if the attacks are only able to be understood in a limited form of postmodern theory due to the level of irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lule | first1 = Jack | year = 2001 | title = The Postmodern Adventure (Book) | url = | journal = Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 78 | issue = 4| pages = 865–866 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In further studies, he enhances the idea of [[semiotics]] in alignment with the theory. Similar to the act of September 11 and the symbols that were interpreted through this postmodern ideal, he continues to even describe this as "[[semiotics|semiotic systems]]" that people use to make sense of their lives and the events that occur in them. Kellner's [[Wikt:adamancy|adamancy]] that signs are necessary to understand one's culture is what he analyzes from the evidence that most cultures have used signs in place of existence.{{Citation needed|reason=Strong Statement with significant implications. Likely point for user to seek source material|date=February 2015}} Finally, he recognizes that many theorists of postmodernism are trapped by their own cogitations. He finds strength in theorist Baudrillard and his idea of [[Marxism]]. Kellner acknowledges Marxism's end and lack of importance to his theory.

The conclusion he depicts is simple: postmodernism, as most use it today, will decide what experiences and signs in one's reality will be one's reality as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danto | first1 = AC | year = 1990 | title = The Hyper-Intellectual | url = | journal = New Republic | volume = 203 | issue = 11/12| pages = 44–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Postmodernism in [[architecture]] began as a response to the perceived blandness and failed Utopianism of the Modern movement. [[Modern Architecture]], as established and developed by [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Le Corbusier]], was focused on the pursuit of a perceived ideal perfection, and attempted harmony of form and function,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Louis. "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered," published Lippincott's Magazine (March 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; and dismissal of "frivolous ornament,"&lt;ref&gt;Loos, Adolf. "Ornament and Crime," published 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tafuri, Manfredo, 'Architecture and Utopia: Design and Capitalist Development', Cambridge: MIT Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as arguing for an architecture that represented the spirit of the age as depicted in cutting-edge technology, be it airplanes, cars, ocean liners or even supposedly artless grain silos.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Towards a New Architecture''. Dover Publications, 1985/1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of modernism argued that the attributes of perfection and minimalism themselves were subjective, and pointed out [[anachronism]]s in modern thought and questioned the benefits of its philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Definitive postmodern architecture such as the work of [[Michael Graves]] and [[Robert Venturi]] rejects the notion of a 'pure' form or 'perfect' architectonic detail, instead conspicuously drawing from all methods, materials, forms and colors available to architects.

Modernist [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] is associated with the phrase "[[Minimalist architecture|less is more]]"; in response [[Robert Venturi|Venturi]] famously said, "Less is a bore." 

The intellectual scholarship regarding postmodernism and architecture is closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-architect [[Charles Jencks]], beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay "The rise of post-modern architecture" from 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, Charles, "The rise of Post-Modern architecture", ''Architecture Association Quarterly'', No.4, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''magnum opus'', however, is the book ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'', first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions. Jencks makes the point that Post-Modernism (like Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not just a reaction to Modernism but what he terms ''double coding'': "Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects."&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, Charles. "The Language of Post-Modern Architecture", Academy Editions, London 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Post-Modern architects would for economic reasons be compelled to make use of contemporary technology, hence distinguishing such architects from mere revivalists. Among the Post-Modern architects championed by Jencks were [[Robert Venturi]], [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]], [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Leon Krier]], and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]].

===Urban planning===
Postmodernism is a rejection of 'totality', of the notion that planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational. In this sense, Postmodernism is a rejection of its predecessor: Modernism. From the 1920s onwards, the Modern movement sought to design and plan cities which followed the logic of the new model of industrial [[mass production]]; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation and [[prefabricated]] design solutions (Goodchild 1990). Postmodernism also brought a break from the notion that planning and architecture could result in [[social reform]], which was an integral dimension of the plans of Modernism (Simonsen 1990). Furthermore, Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475). The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993). In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which [[capitalism]] could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).

Considering Modernism inclined urban planning to treat buildings and developments as isolated, unrelated parts of the overall [[urban ecosystem]]s created fragmented, isolated, and homogeneous urban landscapes (Goodchild, 1990). One of the greater problems with Modernist-style of planning was the disregard of resident or [[public opinion]], which resulted in planning being forced upon the majority by a minority consisting of affluent professionals with little to no knowledge of real 'urban' problems characteristic of post-[[Second World War]] urban environments: [[slum]]s, overcrowding, deteriorated [[infrastructure]], [[pollution]] and disease, among others (Irving 1993). These were precisely the 'urban ills' Modernism was meant to 'solve', but more often than not, the types of 'comprehensive', 'one size fits all' approaches to planning made things worse., and residents began to show interest in becoming involved in decisions which had once been solely entrusted to professionals of the built environment. [[Urban planning#Advocacy planning|Advocacy planning]] and [[Participatory modeling|participatory model]]s of planning emerged in the 1960s to counter these traditional [[elitist]] and [[technocratic]] approaches to urban planning (Irving 1993; Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007). Furthermore, an assessment of the 'ills' of Modernism among planners during the 1960s, fuelled development of a participatory model that aimed to expand the range of participants in urban interventions (Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007, 21).

[[Jane Jacobs]]' 1961 book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when [[Pruitt Igoe]]; a housing development for low-income people in [[St. Louis]] designed by [[architect]] [[Minoru Yamasaki]], which had been a prize-winning version of [[Le Corbusier]]'s 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka &amp; D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and [[disadvantaged]] groups (Goodchild 1990). Urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of [[Fordism|Fordist]]-[[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] paradigm of mass, standardized production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, [[labor market]]s and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).&lt;ref&gt;Goodchild, B 1990, 'Planning and the Modern'Postmodern Debate', in The Town Planning Review, vol. 61, no. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;119–137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatuka, T &amp; D'Hooghe, A 2007, 'After Postmodernism: readdressing the Role of Utopia in Urban Design and Planning', in Places: Forum of Design for the Public Realm, vol. 19, Issue 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–27/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irving, A 1993, 'The Modern/Postmodern Divide and Urban Planning', in The University of Toronto Quareterly, vol. 62, no. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;474–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonsen, K 1990, 'Planning on 'Postmodern' Conditions', in Acta Sociologica, vol. 33, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;51–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

{{Main article|Postmodern literature}}
Literary postmodernism was officially inaugurated in the United States with the first issue of ''[[boundary 2]]'', subtitled "Journal of Postmodern Literature and Culture", which appeared in 1972. [[David Antin]], [[Charles Olson]], [[John Cage]], and the [[Black Mountain College]] school of poetry and the arts were integral figures in the intellectual and artistic exposition of postmodernism at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''The origins of postmodernity'', London: Verso, 1998, Ch.2: "Crystallization".&lt;/ref&gt; ''boundary 2'' remains an influential journal in postmodernist circles today.&lt;ref&gt;''boundary 2'', Duke University Press, [http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/ Boundary2.dukejournals.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Henryk Mikołaj Górecki Polish composer.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Henryk Górecki]].]]
{{Main article|Postmodern music|Postmodern classical music|Art pop}}

[[Postmodern music]] is either music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of the [[modernism|modernist]]. Because of this, postmodern music is mostly defined in opposition to [[Modernism (music)|modernist music]], and a work can either be modernist, or postmodern, but not both. [[Jonathan Kramer]] posits the idea (following [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]) that postmodernism (including ''musical'' postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an ''attitude''.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

The postmodern impulse in classical music arose in the 1960s with the advent of musical [[minimalism]]. Composers such as [[Terry Riley]], [[Henryk Górecki]], [[Bradley Joseph]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[Lou Harrison]] reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably [[John Cage]] challenged the prevailing [[narrative]]s of beauty and objectivity common to Modernism. Some composers have been openly influenced by popular music and world ethnic musical traditions.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Postmodern classical music as well is not a musical ''style'', but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. It bears the same relationship to postmodernist music that postmodernity bears to postmodernism. Postmodern music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]]—that is, art that comes ''after'' and reacts ''against'' modernism.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Though representing a general return to certain notions of music-making that are often considered to be classical or romantic{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, not all postmodern composers have eschewed the experimentalist or academic tenets of modernism. The works of Dutch composer [[Louis Andriessen]], for example, exhibit experimentalist preoccupation that is decidedly anti-romantic. Eclecticism and freedom of expression, in reaction to the rigidity and aesthetic limitations of modernism, are the hallmarks of the postmodern influence in musical composition.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2016}}

Author on postmodernism, Dominic Strinati, has noted, it is also important "to include in this category the so-called '[[art rock]]' musical innovations and mixing of styles associated with groups like [[Talking Heads]], and performers like [[Laurie Anderson]], together with the self-conscious 'reinvention of [[disco]]' by the [[Pet Shop Boys]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Theories of Popular Culture|last=Strinati|first=Dominic|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=234|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic design=== 
[[File:AprilGreiman.jpg|thumb|April Greiman]]
[[Graphic design]] in the postmodern age brought forth ideas that challenged the orderly feel of [[modernism]]. Graphic designers created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. Designers began experimenting with how shapes, forms and typography could react with one another effectively and interestingly in a less rigid way even if the design was rendered illegible. Some graphic design styles that emerged in the postmodernist era were [[New Wave (design)|New Wave]] Typography, retro and vernacular design, playful design inspired by the Italian [[Memphis Group]], punk rock styles and explorative digital design from the late 1980's.  Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that "retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Graphic Design History|last = Drucker|first = Johanna and [[Emily McVarish]]|publisher = Pearson|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0132410755|location = |pages = 305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched for more and more ways to go against the system. Postmodernism did not seek rules but only creative solutions and innovative ideas. The clean orderly grid-based designs of [[International Typographic Style]] were interrupted for more exploration and innovation in color, composition, visual communication, and typography. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include [[Wolfgang Weingart]], [[April Greiman]], [[Jayme Odgers]], [[Tibor Kalman]], [[Dan Friedman (graphic designer)|Dan Friedman]], [[Paula Scher]], [[Neville Brody]], [[Michael Vanderbyl]] and [[Jamie Reid]].

==Criticisms==
{{Main article|Criticism of postmodernism}}
Criticisms of postmodernism are intellectually diverse, including the assertions that postmodernism is meaningless and promotes [[obscurantism]]. For example, [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals do not respond like people in other fields when asked, "what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc.?...If [these requests] can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to Hume's advice in similar circumstances: 'to the flames'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bactra.org/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html|title=Noam Chomsky on Post-Modernism|work=bactra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] has noted "The idea that we live in a postmodern culture is a myth. In fact, a postmodern culture is an impossibility; it would be utterly unliveable. People are not relativistic when it comes to matters of science, [[engineering]], and technology; rather, they are relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and [[ethics]]. But, of course, that's not postmodernism; that's [[modernism]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=William Lane| |authorlink=William Lane Craig| title=God is Not Dead Yet|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/july/13.22.html|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal, academic critiques of postmodernism can also be found in works such as ''[[Beyond the Hoax]]'' and ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''.

However, as for [[continental philosophy]], American academics have tended to label it "postmodernist", especially practitioners of "French Theory". Such a trend might derive from U.S. departments of Comparative Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uninomade.org/italian-theory-english|title=Italian Theory|work=UniNomade|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]], often considered a "postmodernist", rejected its theoretical assumptions by arguing that the structuralist and postmodernist visions of the world were not flexible enough to seek explanations in psychological, social and environmental domains at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guattari|first1=Felix|title=The three ecologies|journal=New formations|date=1989|url=http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/newformations/08_131.pdf|page=134|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] declared, "Postmodernism, the school of 'thought' that proclaimed 'There are no truths, only interpretations' has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for 'conversations' in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster."&lt;ref&gt;DENNETT ON WIESELTIER V. PINKER IN THE NEW REPUBLIC http://edge.org/conversation/dennett-on-wieseltier-v-pinker-in-the-new-republic&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel A. Farber]] and [[Suzanna Sherry]] criticised Postmodernism for reducing the complexity of the modern world to an expression of power and for undermining truth and reason: "If the modern era begins with the European Enlightenment, the postmodern era that captivates the radical multiculturalists begins with its rejection. According to the new radicals, the Enlightenment-inspired ideas that have previously structured our world, especially the legal and academic parts of it, are a fraud perpetrated and perpetuated by white males to consolidate their own power. Those who disagree are not only blind but bigoted. The Enlightenment's goal of an objective and reasoned basis for knowledge, merit, truth, justice, and the like is an impossibility: "objectivity," in the sense of standards of judgment that transcend individual perspectives, does not exist. Reason is just another code word for the views of the privileged. The Enlightenment itself merely replaced one socially constructed view of reality with another, mistaking power for knowledge. There is naught but power."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Farber and Suzanne Sherry, Beyond All Reason
The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law, New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/farber-reason.html&lt;/ref&gt;

H. Sidky pointed out what he sees as several "inherent flaws" of a postmodern antiscience perspective, including the confusion of the authority of science (evidence) with the scientist conveying the knowledge; its self-contradictory claim that all truths are relative; and its strategic ambiguity. He sees 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudo-scientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, as rooted in a postmodernist "decades-long academic assault on science:" "Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards. Sadly, they forgot the lofty ideals of their teachers, except that science is bogus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sidky |first1=H. |title=The War on Science, Anti-Intellectualism, and ‘Alternative Ways of Knowing’ in 21st-Century America |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=38-43 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606170145/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/e_war_on_science_anti-intellectualism_and_alternative_ways_of_knowing_in_21 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert McKee''' (born 1941) is an [[author]], [[lecturer]] and [[story consultant]] who is widely known for his popular "Story [[Seminar]]", which he developed when he was a professor at the [[University of Southern California]]. McKee is the author of ''Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting'', ''Dialogue: the Art of Verbal Action for Stage, Page and Screen'' and ''Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World''. McKee also has the blog and online writers' resource "[https://www.storylogue.com/ Storylogue]".

Robert McKee’s “Story Seminars” have been held around the globe including [[Boston]], [[Moscow]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Beijing]], [[Mumbai]], [[Paris]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and yearly in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[London]]. The 3-day seminar teaches writers the principles of [[storytelling]]. McKee's one-day "[[Genre]] Seminars" teach writers the conventions of different styles of storytelling including [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[Comedy film|comedy]], [[horror film|horror]], [[Romance film|love story]], [[Action (fiction)|action story]], and writing for [[Television program|television]].

Rather than teaching story as a "mechanical" form, McKee gained notoriety for teaching story principles, allowing writers for [[Theatre|theater]], [[Novel|novels]], [[film]] and [[television]] freedom to apply them as they wish provided the story ultimately “works”.

After consulting on business storytelling for various multinational companies including [[Microsoft]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Time Warner]], and [[Siemens]], in the fall of 2013 McKee launched a seminar for the business community in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Beijing]], and [[Malta]]. In 2018, McKee partnered with digital marketer and Skyword CEO [[Tom Gerace]] to write ''Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World.'' Storynomics, and the accompanying seminar, instructs leaders, managers and marketers how to use story in [[strategic management]], [[brand management]], and [[Business communication|business communications]].

== Early life in the theater ==
Robert McKee began his theater career at the age of 9, playing the title role in a community theater production of 'Martin the Shoemaker'. He continued acting as a teenager in theater productions in his hometown of [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Upon receiving the Evans scholarship, he attended the [[University of Michigan]] and earned a Bachelor's degree in [[English Literature]]. While an undergraduate, he acted in and directed over thirty productions. McKee's creative writing professor was the noted [[Kenneth Thorpe Rowe]].

After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree, McKee toured with the APA (Association of Producing Artists) Repertory Company, appearing on Broadway alongside [[Helen Hayes]], [[Rosemary Harris]] and [[Will Geer]]. He then received the Professional Theater Fellowship and returned to [[Ann Arbor|Ann Arbor, Michigan]] to earn his Master's degree in [[Theater|Theater Arts]].

Upon graduating, McKee directed the Toledo Repertory Company, acted with the American Drama Festival, and became Artistic Director of the Aaron Deroy Theater. From there he traveled to London to accept the position of [[Artist-in-residence]] at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] where he studied Shakespearean production at the [[Old Vic]] theatre. He then returned to New York City and spent the next seven years as an actor/director in [[Broadway theater|Broadway]].

== Mid-life in the film industry ==
After deciding to move his career to film, McKee attended Cinema School at the University of Michigan. While there, he directed two short films: ''A Day Off'', which he also wrote, and ''Talk To Me Like The Rain'', adapted from a one-act play by [[Tennessee Williams]]. These two films won the Cine Eagle Award, awards at the Brussels and Grenoble Film Festivals, and various prizes at the Delta, Rochester, Chicago and Baltimore Film Festivals.

In 1979, McKee moved to Los Angeles, where he began to write screenplays and work as a story analyst for [[United Artists]] and [[NBC]]. He sold his first screenplay ''Dead Files'' to AVCO/Embassy Films, after which he joined the WGA ([http://www.wga.org/ Writers Guild of America]). His next screenplay, ''Hard Knocks'', won the National Screenwriting Contest, and since then McKee has had eight feature film screenplays purchased or optioned, including the feature film script ''Trophy'' for [[Warner Bros.]] (Only one of these films, however, was produced). In addition to his screenplays, McKee has had a number of scripts produced for television series such as ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' (starring [[Jack Klugman]]), ''[[Columbo#Mrs. Columbo spin-off|Mrs. Columbo]]'' (starring [[Kate Mulgrew]]), ''[[Spenser: for Hire]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]'' (starring [[Telly Savalas]]).

== Starting the STORY seminar ==
In 1983, as [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]], McKee joined the faculty of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinema-Television]] at the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern California (USC)]], where he began offering his famous STORY Seminar class. A year later, McKee opened the course to the public, giving a 3-day, 30-hour intensive class to sold-out audiences around the world.

Since 1984, more than 50,000 students have taken McKee's course, at various cities around the world: Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto, Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Tel Aviv, Auckland, Singapore, Barcelona, Stockholm, São Paulo and more. In March 2011 and again in 2012, he taught a four-day seminar in Bogotá, Colombia. In February 2012 he taught another four-day seminar in the Ramoji film city of Hyderabad in India. He did the same in [[Amsterdam]], March 2014.

McKee's current lecture series includes the 3-day "Story Seminar", 1-day "Genre Seminars" (teaching the conventions of [[Romance film|love Story]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[comedy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Action fiction|action]] and writing for [[television]]) and the 1-day “Storynomics Seminar”, teaching the application of storytelling principles in the business and marketing world (co-lectured with CEO of Skyword [[Tom Gerace]]).

McKee continues to be a project consultant to major film and television production companies, corporations and governments around the world, as well major software firms such as [[Microsoft]]. In addition, several companies such as [[ABC Studios|ABC]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Miramax]], [[PBS]], [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] regularly send their creative and writing staffs to his lectures. 

== Life and awards ==
Robert McKee is among the most widely known screenwriting [[lecturers]]. McKee's former students include over 65 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners, 200 [[Emmy Award]] winners, 100 WGA ([[Writers Guild of America]]) Award winners and 50 DGA ([[Directors Guild of America]]) Award winners (all participated in McKee's course before or after winning their award; not all were awarded for writing), the British Book of the Year Award and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]]. Some recent notable former students to win or be nominated for Oscars include [[Akiva Goldsman]] for his screenplay "[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]," [[Peter Jackson]] (writer/director of "[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]] I, II and III”), [[Andrew Stanton]] (“[[WALL-E|Wall*E]],” “[[Finding Nemo]]”) and [[Paul Haggis]] (“[[Million Dollar Baby]],” “[[Quantum of Solace]]”). 

He was profiled by Bob Simon of ''60 Minutes'' for [[CBS News]], and by [[CNN]] who also reviewed the Story Seminar. Notable writers and actors such as [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Paul Haggis]], [[Akiva Goldsman]], [[William Goldman]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[John Cleese]], Tony Kaye, [[Steven Pressfield]], among many others have taken his seminar.&lt;ref name="MT" /&gt;

In 1990, Robert McKee was brought to [[New Zealand]] by the NZ Film Commission, and delivered a three-day seminar on screenplay and story structure in [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]]. In the audience were [[Jane Campion]] and [[Peter Jackson]], the latter of which went on to write and direct ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''.

In 2000, McKee won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061207213752/http://www.editor.net/k-k/old/prize99.htm 1999 International Moving Image Book Award] for his book ''Story'' ([[ReganBooks|Regan Books]]/[[HarperCollins]]). The book, currently in its 19th printing in the United States and its 14th printing in the [[UK|United Kingdom]], has become required reading for film and cinema schools at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[UCLA]], [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[Tulane University|Tulane]] universities.[[Robert McKee#cite note-autogenerated1-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Robert McKee#cite note-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The book was on the [[Los Angeles Times]] best-seller list for 20 weeks. It is translated into over 20 languages.

In 2017 McKee was inducted into the [https://www.finaldraft.com/company/hall-fame-awards/ Hall of Fame at the Final Draft Awards], an honor that recognizes professionals who have had a "profound influence on the industry"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.finaldraft.com/company/hall-fame-awards/|title=Hall of Fame Awards {{!}} Final Draft®|work=Final Draft®|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining peers such as [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Steven Zaillian]].

McKee's other credits include writing and presenting the [[BBC]] series ''Filmworks'', the [[Channel Four]] series ''Reel Secrets'', the [[BAFTA]] Award-winning ''J'accuse Citizen Kane'' television program which he wrote and presented, and the writing of [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109036 ''Abraham''], the four-hour mini-series on [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT) that starred [[Richard Harris]], [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Maximilian Schell]].

==Criticism==
McKee has been criticized by writer [[Joe Eszterhas]], for teaching screenwriting without ever having a script of his made into a film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/books/review/Queenan.t.html 'Basic Instinct'] — New York Times article by Joe Queenan, September 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/filmprogramme/filmprogramme_20070209.shtml |title=— Film programme interview, 9 February 2007' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, McKee is credited as writer of the 1994 TV movie ''Abraham''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|571210}}&lt;/ref&gt;) McKee has responded to such criticisms, saying, "The world is full of people who teach things they themselves cannot do", while admitting that even though he sold all of his written screenplays, he still lacks their screen credit since they were only optioned and not ever produced by the studios.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/MT/95/Jun95/mt21j95.html Michigan Today – June 1995] — interview with Brett Forrest&lt;/ref&gt;

While McKee's work might appear to be a fresh approach to story structure, many of the ideas he discusses have been around since [[Aristotle]] and notably appear in the work of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]],&lt;ref name="Archer1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Archer|title=Play-making: A Manual of Craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xs_AAAAYAAJ|accessdate=March 31, 2013|year=1912|publisher=Small, Maynard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Howard Lawson]] and [[Alexander Mackendrick]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Nevertheless, McKee himself tells his students that Aristotle is the basis for much of what he teaches and he often distributes some of John Howard Lawson's writings at his seminar: he acknowledges his forebears and never claims that he is inventing a brand new approach to story telling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleid=305 | title = Robert McKee – Lessons of a screenwriting guru | author = Ian Parker | date = January 27, 2004 | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130206102146/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleid=305 | archivedate = February 6, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore he claims that much of what he teaches was common knowledge 50 or 60 years ago, but that screenwriters have lost touch with the fundamentals of storytelling. In a CBC interview he said that to give his lecture in the 1930s, 40s or 50s "would have been ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc5QRxZidNQ | title = Robert McKee on The Hour with George Stroumboulopoulos | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | date = July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKee also appears and is criticized in several works, for example, ''Missionnaire'' by French author [[Joann Sfar]].

==In popular culture==
In the [[Charlie Kaufman]]-penned film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'', McKee's character was portrayed by the [[Emmy Award]]-winning actor [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. In the Oscar-winning movie, the desperate screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (played by [[Nicolas Cage]]) reluctantly goes to McKee's course, but then – after being "shaken" by McKee's tough-style response to his claim that "nothing happens in the real world" – Kaufman asks McKee to meet in person to discuss his failure to write the [[film adaptation]] he is working on.

Though the story depicts McKee as little more than an amalgam of hack clichés on the subject of screen writing, Charlie's slacker brother Donald uses the knowledge obtained attending the famous seminar to write a [[spec script]] he then sells for a large amount of money through his brother's agent. The film then concludes with the very ending that McKee is ridiculed for recommending, as well as a voice-over epilogue in which — by means of voice-over narration — Cage's Kaufman character admonishes himself for disobeying a cardinal rule of McKee's to avoid voice-over narration.

McKee appeared on the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Caper Chase]]" as himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/yale-harvard-war-bogs-down-overstuffed-simpsons-253107&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anecdotes ==
* McKee claims in his seminars that he does ''not'' say not to use voice-over narration. There is some truth to the scene in ''Adaptation'' however, as he vehemently teaches that using voice-over to substitute for telling the story via action and dialogue is weak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.storylogue.com/docs/question-answer.html?documentId=1345 | title = Q&amp;A: What did you think of the voice-over in GOODFELLAS? | author = Robert McKee | date = August 10, 2013 | accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas he teaches that voice-over used to counterpoint and enrich the story can be wonderful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://peachseedmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mckeevoiceovertechnique.pdf | title = A Study in Voice Over Narration from two recent films, SAVAGES and BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD. | author = Robert McKee | date = August 13, 2012 | accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* McKee is known to object to the French-originated "[[auteur theory]]", which states that the director is the de facto author of a movie.  McKee states otherwise, that the writer/screenwriter is in fact the most important creator of the movie.
* In a ''[[Haaretz]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/782893.html | title = וודי אלן לא עשה עלייה (in Hebrew, rough translation "Woody Allen did increase") | date = November 2, 2006 | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605041310/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/782893.html | archivedate = June 5, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKee was quoted as saying in front of a Tel Aviv audience that Israelis have a rough sense of humor, completely different from the known worldwide Jewish one, since Israelis are living in a harsh reality which leads them to lose their sense of humor.

'''''Water Lilies''''' (or '''''Nymphéas''''', {{IPA-fr|nɛ̃.fe.a|lang}}) is a [[Serial imagery|series]] of approximately 250 oil paintings by French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] [[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926). The paintings depict his [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|flower garden]] at [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|his home]] in [[Giverny]], and were the main focus of his artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name=A&gt;"Monet, Claude." [[Grove Art Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smart|first1=Alastair|title=Why are Monet's water-lilies so popular?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11167000/Why-are-Monets-water-lilies-so-popular.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Monet's long preference for producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and perspective began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the ''Valley of the Creuse'', which were shown at the Galerie Georges Petit.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Paul Hayes, ''Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings'', 1989, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in association with [[Yale University Press]], p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his other famous series are his ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''.

During the 1920s, the state of France built a pair of oval rooms at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] as a permanent home for eight water lily [[mural]]s by Monet. The exhibit opened to the public on 16 May 1927, a few months after Monet's death.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; Sixty water lily paintings from around the world were assembled for a special exhibition at the Musée de l'Orangerie in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Bell. "Paris sees Monet lilies in a new light." ''[[The Times]]''. 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings are on display at museums all over the world, including the [[Princeton University Art Museum]], [[Musée Marmottan Monet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmottan.fr/fr/claude_monet-musee-2517 Claude Monet paintings] at the Marmottan&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=monet Water Lilies] at the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Art Institute of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Monet%2C+Claude Water Lilies] at the Art Institute of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slam.org/emuseum/code/emuseum.asp?style=single&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;page=seealso&amp;profile=objects&amp;searchdesc=The%20Promenade%20with%20the%20Rail...&amp;searchstring=id/,/is/,/7056/,/false/,/true&amp;newvalues=1&amp;rawsearch=id/,/is/,/1930/,/false/,/true&amp;newstyle=single&amp;newprofile=objects&amp;newsearchdesc=Water%20Lilies&amp;newcurrentrecord=1&amp;module=objects Water Lilies] at the Saint Louis Art Museum,&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in Kansas City, Missouri,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelson-atkins.org/art/CollectionDatabase.cfm?id=6650&amp;theme=euro Water Lilies], the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], the [[National Museum of Wales]], the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1960.81 |title=Water Lilies (Agapanthus) |publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Portland Art Museum]] and the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famsf.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The paintings at auction==
On 19 June 2007, one of Monet's water lily paintings sold for £18.5 million at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalya Alberge. "Monet lilies make £18.5m but just miss world record." ''The Times''. 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2008 another of his water lily paintings, ''[[Le Bassin Aux Nymphéas]]'', sold for almost £41 million at [[Christie's]] in [[London]], almost double the estimate of £18 to £24 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xmotu.com/laurahenrycollection/news_monet.html The Laura Henry Collection] "Monet masterpiece sells at auction for almost £41million" ''The Laura Henry Collection''. 25 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, it was announced that the 1906 ''Nymphéas'' work would be auctioned in [[London]] in June 2010. The painting had an estimated sale price of between £30 and £40 million.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10225556.stm|title=Monet water lily to be auctioned at Christie's|date=3 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanna Bertazzoni, [[Christie's]] auction house director and head of impressionist and modern art, said, "Claude Monet's water-lily paintings are amongst the most recognised and celebrated works of the 20th Century and were hugely influential to many of the following generations of artists."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The sale took place on 23 June 2010 at the auction house and the painting attracted bids of up to £29 million, but it ultimately failed to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10396341.stm|title=Picasso reaches £34.7m in Christie's auction|date=24 June 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 2014, one of the Water Lilies paintings was auctioned at Christie's, New York City for $27 million.[16]  This auction totaled $141 millon &lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/market/christies-141-million-impressionist-evening-sale-496091&lt;/ref&gt; with the Monet piece Le bassin aux nymphéas being auctioned for $27 million of this amount. 

In June of 2014, one of the Water Lilies, ''Nymphéas'', sold for $54 million USD at a Sotheby's auction in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; This piece was auctioned to an anonymous buyer, but the piece went on to be part of the exhibition "Painting the Modern Garden: From Monet to Matisse" at the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts, London, starting in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The co-chairman of Sotheby's modern and impressionist art department, Helena Newman, claims that the result is at the top of the original estimated selling price. This price was between 34 and 51 million USD. 

While many of Monet’s masterpieces have sold, there are still an estimated 250 oil paintings from this series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/claude-monet-water-lilies-sell-for-32m-in-second-highest-auction-sale-for-his-work-9558624.html&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is widely popular, with many of these pieces residing in exhibits that have yet to go to auction.

The '''Witham Shield''' is an [[Iron Age]] decorative bronze shield facing of [[La Tène style]], dating from about the 4th century BC. The shield was discovered in the [[River Witham]] in the vicinity of [[Washingborough]] and [[Fiskerton, Lincolnshire|Fiskerton]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]] in 1826. Further excavations at a nearby site have revealed posts interpreted as the foundation for a causeway, as well as artefacts including a sword, spears and part of a human skull with a sword fragment lodged within. The shield now resides in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_witham_shield.aspx Witham Shield], accessed August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The Witham Shield is an example of the style of Celtic art known as [[Celtic art#La T.C3.A8ne art|La Tène]]. The bronze facings show evidence of having been reworked. The most noticeable feature is the central dome which would have been required for functional reasons as it allowed the owner to hold the shield close to its centre of gravity.  Originally a leather silhouette of a long-legged [[wild boar]] would have been riveted to the shield around the central dome, as indicated by small rivet holes and staining of the shield.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;  The pattern of discolouration was very clear when the shield was recovered from the River Witham (see 1863 drawing below). Although it is still possible to see the discolouration under certain lighting conditions, the boar design is no longer easy to make out. The boar may have been a tribal emblem or represented the prowess of the shield's owner, but could also have been a representation of the Celtic god [[Moccus]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Whitwell, ''The Coritani: some aspects of the Iron Age tribe and the Roman civitas'' (B.A.R., 1982), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The shield also has a number of birds and animals incorporated into the design. The roundels at each end are inspired by the heads of birds, which are supported by horses with wings for ears. Birds similar to [[Great Crested Grebe|crested grebes]] are engraved on the central spine and this completes the engraving work elsewhere.&lt;ref name="megaw"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HXpwRkQybekC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22witham+shield%22+museum&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QIBpTMzlLNWSOJyWxbkF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Early Celtic Art in Britain''], Ruth and Vincent Megaw, p.29, accessed 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The shield was made principally from wood, now perished, to a design later known as a "Gaulish Shield" that originated in the seventh century BC.&lt;ref name="jope"/&gt; What remains is an almost complete facing that had been made to cover its surface. The sheeting is 0.2-0.3&amp;nbsp;mm thick and was designed to be applied to a wooden backing estimated at 8&amp;nbsp;mm thick. There are two main sheets that meet at the midpoint of the shield. Each of these sheets is just over one metre long. The join is not neat, and it is hidden from view by a covering strip. The shield is decorated with a central spindle boss, on which are pieces of red coral that are thought to have come from the Mediterranean area.&lt;ref name="jope"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4423072 "The Witham Shield"], E. M. Jope, ''British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 35, No. 1/4 (Spring, 1971), pp. 61–69, [[British Museum]], accessed 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
The shield has been described as a "tour de force" of beaten bronze work. There are no other complete bronze facings that survive in Europe. This is partially due to their rarity, as Celtic shields were normally constructed from unsheathed wood. The idea of covering a shield with bronze may indicate Greek and Etruscan influence.&lt;ref name="jope"/&gt; The shield is comparable with other shields found in Britain dating from the same period, such as the [[Chertsey Shield]] and the [[Battersea Shield]] which were also found in rivers. The British Museum consider this shield to be "one of the best examples of the way British craftspeople adopted the new style of La Tène art".&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

==Ownership==
The shield entered the collection of Sir [[Samuel Rush Meyrick]] (1783–1848), a noted collector of arms and armour, and after his death the shield and other items of Iron Age armour were left to his cousin, Lt. Colonel Augustus Meyrick, who disposed of them between 1869 and 1872.&lt;ref name="Meyrick"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Rush Meyrick|url=http://www.royalarmouries.org/collections/history-of-the-collection/early-scholars/samuel-rush-meyrick|publisher=Royal Armouries|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield was purchased by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|Augustus Franks]], an independently wealthy antiquarian who worked for the British Museum. In 1872 Franks presented the shield to the British Museum, one of over 20,000 objects that he donated to the museum during his lifetime or by bequest at his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_results.aspx?queryAll=People%2f!!%2fOR%2f!!%2f148562%2f!%2f148562-3-9%2f!%2fDonated+by+Sir+Augustus+Wollaston+Franks%2f!%2f%2f!!%2f%2f!!!%2f&amp;allCurrentPage=1 Objects donated by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks].

An unusual triple headed dress pin was also found in 1826. This pin set was also found in the River Witham near Fiskerton. This is described as the only surviving set of triple dress pins and has been dated as 8th century and Anglo-Saxon. The pin set is also held in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/triple_pin_set.aspx Triple Pin Set], British Museum highlights, accessed 22 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century a series of posts were found together with an early to mid Iron Age [[sword]] when a [[Ditch|dyke]] was being cleaned near [[Fiskerton, Lincolnshire|Fiskerton]], near where the Witham Shield had been found. Excavations in 1981 revealed the posts to be a wooden [[causeway]] which [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] dated to a period between 457 and 300 BC. It appeared to have been repaired and added to every eighteen years or so during that period, even though the construction and maintenance of a walkway on such a scale at that time would have been a major feat of engineering.  Hundreds of artifacts were also found around the causeway, including eleven [[spear]]s, six swords, woodworking and metalworking tools, as well as part of a [[human skull]] which had a crescent-shaped chop mark, probably inflicted by a sword; this injury is unlikely to have killed the man.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Naomi and Pearson, Mike Parker, 2003  ''Fiskerton: An Iron Age Timber Causeway with Iron Age and Roman Votive Offerings'', (Oxbow Books, Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years later, during further excavations at the site, more sections of the causeway were dug out, some of them containing posts several metres long, plus a complete spear, a [[currency bar]]&lt;!--a silver ingot?--&gt;, a sword, a [[dagger]] and some bronze fittings, all of which appeared to have been deliberately&lt;!--does Kennedy imply ritually?--&gt; damaged before their burial.&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;Kennedy, Anra. [http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%2526+heritage/archaeology/megaliths+and+prehistoric+archaeology/art12215 "Treasures of the Celtic Causeway - The Fiskerton Log Boat"], ''Culture24'', 26 March 2002. Accessed 20 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The most important discovery was two Iron Age [[votive]] boats. One of these boats, as well as other artifacts from the site, can be seen at [[The Collection (Lincolnshire)|The Collection]] in Lincoln. The area around the site of the causeway was opened as a [[nature reserve]] managed by the [[Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust]] in 2006.
