An '''Alexanderson alternator''' is a [[alternator|rotating machine]] invented by [[Ernst Alexanderson]] in 1904 for the generation of high-frequency [[alternating current]] for use as a [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]].  It was one of the first devices capable of generating the [[Continuous wave|continuous radio waves]] needed for transmission of [[amplitude modulation]] (sound) by radio.  It was used from about 1910 in a few "superpower" [[longwave]] [[radiotelegraphy]] stations to transmit transoceanic message traffic by [[Morse code]] to similar stations all over the world.

Although obsolete by the early 1920s due to the development of [[vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] transmitters, the Alexanderson alternator continued to be used until [[World War II]].  It is on the [[list of IEEE Milestones]] as a key achievement in [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Alexanderson_Radio_Alternator,_1904 |title=Milestones:Alexanderson Radio Alternator, 1904 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Prior developments ===

After [[radio wave]]s were discovered in 1887, the first generation of [[radio transmitter]]s, the [[spark gap transmitter]]s, produced strings of ''[[damped wave]]s'', pulses of radio waves which died out to zero quickly. By the 1890s it was realized that damped waves had disadvantages; their energy was spread over a broad [[frequency]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] so transmitters on different frequencies interfered with each other,  and they could not be [[modulation|modulated]] with an audio signal to transmit sound.  Efforts were made to invent transmitters that would produce ''[[continuous wave]]s'', a sinusoidal alternating current at a single frequency.

In an 1891 lecture, [[Frederick Thomas Trouton]] pointed out that, if an electrical [[alternator]] were run at a great enough cycle speed (that is, if it turned fast enough and was built with a large enough number of magnetic poles on its armature) it would generate continuous waves at radio frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxh6n6;view=1up;seq=316 "Radiation of Electric Energy"] by Frederick Trouton, ''The Electrician'' (London), January 22, 1892, page 302.&lt;/ref&gt;   Starting with [[Elihu Thomson]] in 1889,&lt;ref name="Thomson1891"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:200-kw HF Alternator.jpg|thumb|right|Alexanderson 200-kW motor-alternator set installed at the US Navy's New Brunswick, NJ station, 1920.]]

=== Construction ===
In 1904, [[Reginald Fessenden]] contracted with [[General Electric]] for an alternator that generated a frequency of 100,000 hertz{{cita requerida|date=November 2018}} for continuous wave radio. The alternator was designed by [[Ernst Alexanderson]]. The Alexanderson alternator was extensively used for long-wave [[radio communication]]s by shore stations, but was too large and heavy to be installed on most ships. In 1906 the first 50-kilowatt alternators were delivered. One was to Reginald Fessenden at [[Brant Rock, Massachusetts]], another to [[John Hays Hammond, Jr.]] in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] and another to the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America| American Marconi Company]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].

Alexanderson would receive a patent in 1911 for his device. The Alexanderson alternator followed Fessenden's rotary spark-gap transmitter as the second radio transmitter to be [[amplitude modulation|modulated]] to carry the human voice. Until the invention of [[vacuum-tube]] (valve) [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s in 1913 such as the [[Armstrong oscillator]], the Alexanderson alternator was an important high-power [[radio]] [[transmitter]], and allowed [[amplitude modulation]] radio transmission of the human voice. The last remaining operable Alexanderson alternator is at the [[VLF transmitter Grimeton]] in Sweden and was in regular service until 1996. It continues to be operated for a few minutes on [[Alexanderson Day]], which is either the last Sunday in June or first Sunday in July every year.

=== US Navy stations during World War II ===

Starting in 1942 four stations were operated by US Navy: the station at Haiku, Hawaii until 1958, Bolinas until 1946, Marion, and Tuckerton (both until 1948). Two alternators were shipped to Hawaii in 1942, one each from Marion, MA and Bolinas, CA. Haiku received one. The other went to Guam but returned to Haiku after World War 2. Haiku began operation of the first 200&amp;nbsp;kW alternator in 1943. The second alternator went into operation at Haiku in 1949. Both alternators were sold for salvage in 1969, possibly to Kreger Company of California. The Marion station was transferred in 1949 to the US Air Force and used until 1957 for the transmission of weather forecasts to the arctic as well as for the Basen to Greenland, Labrador, and Iceland. One of the alternators was scrapped in 1961 and another one was handed over to the US office of standard{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, it now resides in a Smithsonian Institution warehouse. The two machines in Brazil were never used because of organizational problems there. They were returned to Radio Central after 1946.

== Design ==
[[Image:Rotor of Alexanderson alternator.jpg|thumb|Rotor of 200 kW alternator]]
[[Image:Alexanderson rotor closeup.jpg|thumb|Closeup of above rotor. It has 300 narrow slots cut through the rotor. The "teeth" between the slots are the magnetic poles of the machine.]]

The Alexanderson alternator works similarly to an AC electric generator, but generates higher-frequency current, in the very low frequency (VLF) radio frequency range.  The rotor has no conductive windings or electrical connections; it consists of a solid disc of high tensile strength magnetic steel, with narrow slots cut in its circumference to create a series of narrow "teeth" that function as magnetic poles. The space between the teeth is filled with nonmagnetic material, to give the rotor a smooth surface to decrease aerodynamic drag.  The rotor is turned at a high speed by an electric motor.

The machine operates by variable [[reluctance]] (similar to an electric [[guitar pickup]]), changing the [[magnetic field|magnetic flux]] linking two coils.  The periphery of the rotor is embraced by a circular iron stator with a C-shaped cross-section, divided into narrow poles, the same number as the rotor has, carrying two sets of coils.  One set of coils is energized with [[direct current]] and produces a magnetic field in the air gap in the stator, which passes axially (sideways) through the rotor.

As the rotor turns, alternately either an iron section of the disk is in the gap between each pair of stator poles, allowing a high magnetic flux to cross the gap, or else a non-magnetic slot is in the stator gap, allowing less magnetic flux to pass. Thus the magnetic flux through the stator varies sinusoidally at a rapid rate. These changes in flux induce a [[radio-frequency]] voltage in a second set of coils on the stator.

The RF collector coils are all interconnected by an output [[transformer]], whose secondary winding is connected to the antenna circuit. [[Modulation]] or [[Telegraphy|telegraph keying]] of the radio frequency energy was done by a [[magnetic amplifier]], which was also used for [[amplitude modulation]] and voice transmissions.

The [[frequency]] of the current generated by an Alexanderson alternator in [[hertz (unit)|hertz]] is the product of the number of rotor poles and the revolutions per second.  Higher radio frequencies thus require more poles, a higher rotational speed, or both.  Alexanderson alternators were used to produce radio waves in the [[very low frequency]] (VLF) range, for transcontinental wireless communication. A typical alternator with an output frequency of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz had 300 poles and rotated at 20,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) (330 revolutions per second).  To produce high power, the clearance between the rotor and stator had to be kept to only 1&amp;nbsp;mm.  The manufacture of precision machines rotating at such high speeds presented many new problems, and Alexanderson transmitters were bulky and very expensive.

=== Frequency control ===

The output frequency of the transmitter is proportional to the speed of the rotor.  To keep the frequency constant, the speed of the electric motor turning it was controlled with a feedback loop.  In one method, a sample of the output signal is applied to a high-Q [[tuned circuit]], whose [[resonant frequency]] is slightly above the output frequency.  The generator's frequency falls on the "skirt" of the LC circuit's impedance curve, where the impedance increases rapidly with frequency.  The output of the LC circuit is rectified, and the resulting voltage is compared with a constant reference voltage to produce a feedback signal to control the motor speed.  If the output frequency gets too high, the impedance presented by the LC circuit increases, and the amplitude of the RF signal getting through the LC circuit drops.  The feedback signal to the motor drops, and the motor slows down. Thus the alternator output frequency is "locked" to the tuned circuit resonant frequency.

The sets were built to operate at wavelengths of 10,500 to 24,000 meters (28.57 to 12.5 KHz) . This was accomplished by three design variables. The alternators were built with
1220 or 976 or 772 poles . Three gear boxes were available with ratios of 2.675- 2.973 and 3.324 and the 900 RPM driving motor was operated at slips of 4% to 20%, giving speeds of 864 to 720 RPM . Transmitters installed in Europe, operating on 50 cycle power, had a wavelength range of 12, 500 to 28, 800 meters because of the lower speed of the driving motor.

== Performance advantages ==

A large Alexanderson alternator might produce 500&amp;nbsp;kW of output radio-frequency energy and would be water- or oil-cooled.  One such machine had 600 pole pairs in the stator winding, and the rotor was driven at 2170 RPM, for an output frequency near 21.7&amp;nbsp;kHz. To obtain higher frequencies, higher rotor speeds were required, up to 20,000 RPM.

Along with the [[arc converter]] invented in 1903, the Alexanderson alternator was one of the first radio transmitters that generated [[continuous wave]]s.  In contrast, the earlier [[spark-gap transmitter]]s generated a string of [[damped wave]]s.  These were electrically "noisy"; the energy of the transmitter was spread over a wide frequency range, so they interfered with other transmissions and operated inefficiently.  With a continuous-wave transmitter, all of the energy was concentrated within narrow [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|frequency band]], so for a given output power they could communicate over longer distances.  In addition, continuous waves could be [[modulation|modulated]] with an [[audio signal]] to carry sound.  The Alexanderson alternator was one of the first transmitters to be used for [[amplitude modulation|AM]] transmission.

The Alexanderson alternator produced "purer" continuous waves than the arc converter, whose nonsinusoidal output generated significant [[harmonics]], so the alternator was preferred for long-distance telegraphy.

== Disadvantages ==
Because of the extremely high rotational speed compared to a conventional alternator, the Alexanderson alternator required continuous maintenance by skilled personnel. Efficient lubrication and oil or water cooling was essential for reliability which was difficult to achieve with the lubricants available at the time. In fact, early editions of the [[Royal Navy]]'s "Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy" cover this in considerable detail, mostly as an explanation as to why the navy did not use that particular technology. However, the US Navy did.

Other major problems were that changing the operating frequency was a lengthy and complicated process, and unlike a spark transmitter, the carrier signal could not be switched on and off at will. The latter problem greatly complicated  "listening through" (that is, stopping the transmission to listen for any answer). There was also the risk that it would allow enemy vessels to detect the presence of the ship.

Because of the limits of the number of poles and rotational speed of a machine, the Alexanderson alternator is capable of generating transmission frequencies up to around 600kHz in the lower [[Medium wave]] band, with [[Shortwave radio|Shortwave]] and higher frequencies being physically impossible.

'''All Power Labs''' (APL) is a [[renewable energy]] company based in [[Berkeley, California]]. APL designs and manufactures [[biomass]] [[Gasification|gasifiers]] and builds and markets small-scale (15 kW - 150 kW) electrical generators fueled by these gasifiers. In 2013, All Power Labs reached an installed base of 500 machines in approximately 40 countries.&lt;ref name="FastCompany"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Josh|title=Meet the Radical Berkeley Artist Whose Company is Turning Trash Into Electricity|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3027127/meet-the-radical-berkeley-artist-whose-company-is-turning-trash-into-electricity|website=Fast Company|accessdate=31 July 2015|language=English|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, APL employed 30 staff, including engineering, manufacturing, management, sales, and technical support staff, on the site of the former Shipyard, an approximately 20,000 sq.ft. facility that includes APL’s offices, R&amp;D, manufacturing and production facilities.&lt;ref name="Gigaom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fehrenbacher|first1=Katie|title=This Berkeley Startup &amp; its Energy Machines Are About to Take off|url=https://gigaom.com/2015/02/04/this-berkeley-startup-its-energy-machines-are-about-to-take-off/|website=Gigaom|publisher=Knowingly Inc.|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it established a board of directors to which it added [[Daniel Kammen]] and Tom Dinwoodie.&lt;ref name="SFChronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=David|title=Their site burns hot – and green|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Meet-the-Berkeley-burners-trying-to-hack-climate-6662070.php|accessdate=November 30, 2015|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 30, 2015|location=Section D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jim Mason and Jessica Hobbs founded APL in 2007 on the site of, and based on, the work of the former Shipyard. The Shipyard was a collaborative art-development space established in 2001 by Mason in a dozen shipping-container workspaces assembled around a small machine shop in West Berkeley. Containers were rented out to a mix of artists, engineers and scientists he selected mostly from among his collaborators on art projects for the Burning Man festival.&lt;ref name="Doherty2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Doherty|title=This Is Burning Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=799JDtofMpEC|date=3 September 2007|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-02892-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to get approval for a grid-power connection due to zoning issues,&lt;ref name=SFChronicle /&gt;  the Shipyard community assembled an off-grid power system combining 2 kW of used photovoltaic panels, a 4000 amp hour surplus telecommunication battery bank, a pair of used diesel generators running on biodiesel made in an on-site biodiesel-reactor facility, and began experimenting with [[Biomass]] [[Gasification]] as a potential power source.&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doherty|first1=Brian|title=Power from the People|url=http://reason.com/archives/2008/04/28/power-from-the-people/|website=reason.com|publisher=ReasonFoundation|accessdate=31 July 2015|language=English|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Ryan|title=Now What Episode 10: Trash Powered|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ryan-duffy/trash-powered-power-electricity_b_8813142.html|website=Huffington Post|language=English|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APL's initial goal was education and experimentation in open-source alternative energy technologies in an attempt to create a do-it-yourself (DIY) power-hacking culture. Within the first year, the company limited its focus to the open-source development of biomass gasification technology,&lt;ref name=reason /&gt; and began to design and manufacture a range of open-source DIY Gasifier Experimenters Kits (GEK), whose plans and cad files were made available online.&lt;ref name=FastCompany /&gt;

==Water Abundance XPRIZE==
During a 24 hour period ending on September 29, 2018, at the APL facility in Berkeley, California, APL along with the Skysource/Skywater Alliance, successfully won the $1.5 million Water XPRIZE by producing over 2,000 liters of water in one day at a final cost of less than 2 cents per liter using only renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grand Prize Winner In $1.75m Water Abundance Xprize Announced At Xprize Visioneering 2018 |url=https://water.xprize.org/prizes/water-abundance/articles/waxp-grand-prize-winner |website=Water Abundance XPRIZE |publisher=XPRIZE |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An APL PP30 Biomass Gasifier Genset powered three Skywater 300 [[atmospheric water generator]]s to extract water from the atmosphere and the additional residual moisture generated by the drying of the woodchips used to fuel the gasifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=XPrize-winning team sources fresh water from the air |url=https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/design-and-architecture/xprize-winning-team-sources-fresh-water-from-the-air |website=KCRW Design and Architecture Podcast |publisher=KCRW |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
In 2010, APL began to manufacture an integrated biomass gasifier-genset named the Power Pallet in 10 kW and 20 kW ratings. By the end of 2013 the GEK kits and 10 kW version were abandoned along with the company's open-source ethos with its release of a 20 kW unit using a proprietary gasifier design based on Mason’s patents.&lt;ref name=Gigaom /&gt; In late 2016, the company’s principle product was the PP30 Power Pallet 25 kW biomass genset which included [[Combined Heat and Power]] (CHP) and [[Grid-tied Electrical System]] features as standard equipment&lt;ref name=cnet&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terdiman|first1=Daniel|title=Carbon-negative Energy a Reality at Last,-- and Cheap Too|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/carbon-negative-energy-a-reality-at-last-and-cheap-too/|accessdate=31 July 2015|agency=cnet|issue=US Edition Sci Tech|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as optional accessories.

==Operation==

[[File:GEK Gasifier Process Flows.jpg|thumb|Material and Process Flows in a GEK Gasifier]]
[[Biomass]] [[Gasification]] uses high temperatures in an low-oxygen environment to covert woody feedstocks into a [[Syngas]] fuel composed predominantly of flammable hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) gases. When waste biomass is used as the feedstock and the [[biochar]] byproduct is sequestered, such as when used as a soil amendment, the operation results in [[Negative carbon dioxide emission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tuan|title=Carbon-Negative Energy Is Here!

The '''Antique Airplane Association, Inc.''' ('''AAA''') is the oldest antique airplane association in the world. The AAA formed in August 1953 by [[Robert L. Taylor (aviator)|Robert L. Taylor]],&lt;ref name = iahof&gt;"Iowa Aviation Hall of Fame: Inductees - 1994 - Robert L. Taylor." Iowa Aviation Museum. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 June 2010. &lt;http://www.flyingmuseum.com/halloffame.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; via a classified ad in [[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] magazine&lt;ref name = Taylor&gt;"What's the difference between the AAA and the APM?." Antique Airfield. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 June 2010. &lt;http://www.antiqueairfield.com/aaa/aaa_apm_difference.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few people with a deep-seated interest in old airplanes, for the purpose to fly, to preserve, to share and to promote the early flying machines.&lt;ref name = iahof/&gt;

The AAA operates from [[Antique Airfield]] in [[Blakesburg, Iowa]] and serves as the headquarters for its 50 chapter organizations and 7000 members from throughout the United States and 20 foreign countries.&lt;ref name = iahof/&gt;

Founder and president of the national Antique Airplane Association as well as current Chairman of the Board of the closely affiliated [[Airpower Museum]] Inc., Taylor states on the national club website "At that time (1953) no other association existed that had a specific interest in antique and classic airplanes. No aviation historical groups had yet been formed. The AAA was organized to "Keep the Antiques Flying" and this basic premise has always been our main interest and primary function. We do provide our membership with aviation history and memories of the important parts our own members have played in this fascinating subject."&lt;ref name = aaawebhome&gt;"Antique Aircraft Association." Antique Airfield. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 June 2010. &lt;http://www.antiqueairfield.com/aaa/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The AAA of the late 50s was incorporated by Ken Cook, at the time serving as the AAA vice president. During this time Cook published a new version of the ''AAA News'' and would later rename it the ''[[American Airman]]'' magazine. In 1961, Cook withdrew his involvement with the AAA.
In the 1960s, the remaining parts stock for [[LeBlond Aircraft Engine Corporation|LeBlond]] aircraft engines were sold to the AAA. There are a few parts left, but mostly what's left are engine drawings.&lt;ref name = rearwin&gt;"Rearwin Aircraft Engines." PilotFriend. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 June 2010. &lt;http://www.pilotfriend.com/aero_engines/engine_specs/Ken_Royce%20Motors/blank.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 the AAA Board of Directors approved the necessary changes required of the AAA in order to be chartered as a non-profit corporation in the state of Iowa and has operated as such since that time.&lt;ref name = Taylor/&gt;

'''Burn-in ovens''' are designed for dynamic and static burn-in of [[integrated circuit]]s and other electronic devices, including [[laser diode]]s. Typical sizes are from under ten to over {{convert|30|cuft|m3}}, with air or [[nitrogen]] configurations. Operating temperatures can go over {{convert|260|°C|°F}}, and can use both single and multiple temperature settings.

Burn-in oven applications can be used in numerous different applications such as high-dissipation forward bias, high-temperature reverse [[Biasing|bias]], dynamic and static [[burn-in]] of [[microprocessors]] and other [[semiconductor]] devices.

Burn-in ovens are considered a type of [[batch oven]]. Other types of batch ovens are [[Laboratory oven|bench/laboratory]], [[Reach-in oven|reach-in]], walk in/truck in, and [[Clean process oven|clean process]].

One company builds systems designed for burn-in of low power laser diodes up to 1A and high power laser diodes up to 300A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yelo burn-in system|url=http://www.yelo.co.uk/laser-diode-burn-in/laser-diode-burn-in.html|accessdate=6 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113100626/http://www.yelo.co.uk/laser-diode-burn-in/laser-diode-burn-in.html#|archive-date=2014-11-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CASA Logo Low Res EN.jpg|thumb|CASA was established in 1993 in response to an identified need for a national farm safety networking and coordinating agency to address problems of illness, injuries and accidental death in farmers, their families and agricultural workers.]]

The '''Canadian Agricultural Safety Association''' was established in 1993 in response to an identified need for a national farm safety networking and coordinating agency to address problems of illness, injuries and accidental death in farmers, their families and agricultural workers. Since then, CASA has worked to improve the health and safety conditions of those who live and work on Canadian farms.

CASA is funded by [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agr.gc.ca/ Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada] Access date 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; Renewal Chapter and has applied for similar support under the federal government's Growing Forward&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1200339470715&amp;lang=eng Growing Forward] Access date 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; program for 2009–2013.

In the past, CASA acted as facilitator and enabler.  For instance, in 2007-08, CASA extended $637,365 to 20 organizations for 24 farm safety projects, directly reaching more than 376,000 producers across Canada.

In the future, CASA will operate as a national health and safety initiator and service provider.

Canada's agricultural industry is one of the top three most hazardous industries in which to work.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett W, Hartling L, Brison RJ, Guernsey J (1999). Fatal farm injuries in Canada. Can. Med Assoc. J. 160:1843–1848&lt;/ref&gt;  And yet, farmers themselves believe their safety habits are better than fair.  [[Farm Credit Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc-fac.ca/ Farm Credit Canada] Access date 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; recently conducted a national survey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc-fac.ca/en/aboutus/media/news20090211_e.asp national survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706180332/http://www.fcc-fac.ca/en/aboutus/media/news20090211_e.asp# |date=2011-07-06 }} Access date 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; to determine farmer's attitudes toward safety.  The final report is a self-assessment of how farmers visualize their safety performance. They gave themselves a "B".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casa-acsa.ca/english/PDF/09-041-038-01%20E%20Farm%20Safety%20Report%20Card.pdf Farm Safety Report Card(2008).

|-
| 7. Develop and offer workplace safety training and instruction (AH&amp;S core competencies) to those working in the agricultural health and safety field
|-
| 8. Implement a national health and safety communication strategy
|-
| 9. Promote and implement national prevention initiatives across Canada, such as engineering solutions, case study training, farm safety plans, etc.
|-
|  10. Partner with [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/index-eng.php Public Health Agency of Canada] Access date 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate injury surveillance data and conduct injury analysis
|-
|  11. Continue to update machinery standards through the [[Canadian Standards Association]]&lt;ref name="Canadian Standards Association"&gt;[http://www.csa.ca/Default.asp?language=english Canadian Standards Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404011827/http://www.csa.ca/Default.asp?language=english# |date=2009-04-04 }} Access date 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| 12. Act as funding intermediary for Canadian Farmers with Disabilities
|-
| 13. Seek out additional funding sources.
|}

At CASA's Safety Summit of October 2008, in Saskatoon, there was consensus that CASA must move forward with the proposed strategic plan. Many of the participants committed, on behalf of their organizations, to support the strategy with time and resources.

==Recent Successes==

'''Contributing to a sector that is competitive and innovative:'''
*Return on investment  - every dollar allocated to CASA is matched in cash or in-kind.
*Credible central source of agricultural safety e.g. Discovery Channel.
*Agricultural Injury/Fatality data collected and compiled.  Reports produced.
*Contact list has grown to over 840 people and organizations.
*Two research centres now have a rural/agricultural component as part of their mandate and producing reports and recommendations.

==Canadian Agricultural Injury Reporting (CAIR)==

Canadian Agricultural Injury Reporting (CAIR) formerly the Canadian Agricultural Injury Surveillance Program (CAISP) - is an integrated national surveillance project of the Canadian Agricultural Safety Association that guides and informs the national agricultural health and safety agenda.

CAISP's latest national report Agricultural Injuries in Canada for 1990–2005 can be downloaded [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706170235/http://cair-sbac.ca/natrep2.html free].

It describes the occurrence of fatal agricultural injuries in Canada by age group and mechanism of injury. There were 1,769 agricultural fatalities in Canada from 1990 to 2005. Overall, more than half of the agricultural fatalities were due to four machine-related causes: machine rollovers, machine runovers, machine entanglements and traffic collisions. The top five causes of agricultural fatalities in Canada were machine rollovers (20.5%), machine runovers (18.6%), machine entanglements (8.3%), traffic collisions (7.3%), and being pinned or struck by a machine (7.0%).

Their recent fifteen-year summary reports on fatal agricultural rollovers, runovers, animal injuries, injuries to older adults and injuries to children can be downloaded [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706170309/http://cair-sbac.ca/tecrep.html here].

==Progressive Agriculture Safety Days==

CASA supports the Progressive Agriculture Safety Days&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressiveag.org/ Progressive Agriculture Safety Days] Access date 2009-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada.  This educational program has helped children across Canada learn about dangers and potential deadly outcomes of unsafe behaviour on the farm.

"When an individual or community partners with the Progressive Agriculture Safety Day program, they are provided planning resources to help each Safety Day become a success" says Susan Reynolds, Executive Director-Programs of the Progressive Agriculture Safety Day. "Through our program, each lead coordinator is provided training on how to organize a Safety Day, and is offered year-round support."

Each safety day is organized locally, allowing communities to meets local priorities in their area. Children rotate among different safety stations, allowing each child the opportunity to participate in interactive and engaging activities."

In 2009, 72 Safety Days are planned for Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick involving more than 13,000 youth and over 3000 adult volunteers!

Founded by The Progressive Farmer magazine in the U.S. in 1995, the program trains and provides the resources that local communities need to conduct one-day safety programs that are age-appropriate, hands-on, fun, and safe for children. While the basic program reaches children ages of 8 to 13, safety days may also be conducted for 4- to 7-year-olds or even entire families.

The mission of the Progressive Agriculture Safety Days is to make farm and ranch life safer and healthier for all children through education and training.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5723">'''Click Frenzy''' is an Australian online sales initiative inspired by and based on a similar format to the United States shopping event [[Cyber Monday]]. The inaugural Click Frenzy event was launched on Tuesday, 20 November 2012 with heavy media and online promotion in the lead up, with organisers arranging sales partnerships with many of Australia's leading retailers, and had given multiple assurances prior to the event that they would be able to support the anticipated heavy traffic of the event. However the event's website crashed within moments of launching at 7pm AEST and was unavailable for most of the night, leading to a backlash from frustrated customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/biztech/click-frenzy-website-crashes-as-online-sale-set-to-launch/story-fn5lic6c-1226520660974|title=Click Frenzy website crashes as online sale set to launch | work=News Limited Network | date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the inauspicious start, Click Frenzy events continue to be held in the years following,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2013/11/21/technology/click-frenzy-sale-exceeds-expections-founder | work=Australian Business Review | title=Click Frenzy sale exceeds expections: founder|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/click-frenzy-24hour-online-shopping-event-wont-be-repeat-of-clickfail/news-story/ed3aae69e346e857e814adc79c4d2970 | work=Herald Sun | title=Click Frenzy 24-hour online shopping event ‘won’t be repeat of #ClickFail’|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the event estimating $189 million in sales and the site receiving 1 million visitors in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/click-frenzy-hit-by-commbank-card-glitch-20151118-gl1nzu.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald | title=Click Frenzy hit by Commbank card glitch|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Click Frenzy 2012==

The inaugural Click Frenzy event was heavily promoted in Australian media including the major television networks and online newspapers. Numerous Australian and international retailers and brands were involved, including [[Myer]], [[Bing Lee]], [[Microsoft]], [[Toys R Us]], [[Dell]], [[Target Australia|Target]] and [[Priceline (Australia)|Priceline]]. Organisers boasted of their preparedness to deal with the expected popularity. "We're expecting up to 1 million site visits [to clickfrenzy.com.au] and we're prepared for this," the spokesperson said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/biztech/how-to-get-the-best-deals-in-click-frenzy/story-fn5lic6c-1226520380827#ixzz2CoVknexr | work=News.com.au | title=David Jones site crashes for several hours during Click Frenzy copycat sale | date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the site failed almost immediately after the sale period starting. There was a rapid backlash from the Australian public, with trending of the #clickfail hashtag on [[Twitter]] and creation of various memes mocking the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/ClickFrenzyFail|title=Click Frenzy Fail|work=Facebook|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reaction===

Click Frenzy co-founder Grant Arnott appeared on Channel 9's Today show the next morning expressing disappointment at the website's initial failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.au.msn.com/watch/video/click-frenzy-apologises-for-site-meltdown/xjzfkvm?cpkey=913ebea1-134f-4706-a932-e0d7b0ec85bb%257c%257c%257c%257c|title=Inside the country’s biggest police operation ever|publisher=Video.au.msn.com|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have suggested this incident could further damage the struggling Australian retail sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/frenzys-virtual-doors-fail-to-open-20121120-29o2d.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Frenzy's virtual doors fail to open|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also hurt the credibility of other online product and service providers. Speculation has been raised that the event was a scam to profit from the collection of users' personal information and premiums paid by participating retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/323664,resellers-fume-over-click-frenzy-fiasco.aspx|title=Resellers fume over Click Frenzy fiasco|work=CRN Australia|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction from retailers ===

Some retailers reportedly paid up to $33,000 for an advertisement at the site, and are asking for refunds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/retailers-on-failed-click-frency-website-begin-discussing-refunds/story-e6frfrnr-1226521002703 | work=News Limited Network | title=Retailers on failed Click Frenzy website begin discussing refunds | date=21 November 2012|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other retailers such as [[Windsor Smith]], [[Booktopia]] and [[EzyDVD]] have been very happy with the increase in sales and traffic that Click Frenzy has driven to their websites.  Although the Click Frenzy site itself failed, consumers bypassed the Click Frenzy site and shopped directly with the retailers involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/biztech/were-happy--frenzy-drives-traffic-to-retailers-20121121-29pan.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title='We're happy' - Frenzy drives traffic to retailers|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Cobra probe''' is a device to measure the [[pressure]] and [[velocity]] components of a moving [[fluid]]. It is a multi-holed pressure probe with rotational axis of the probe shaft coplanar with the measurement plane of the instrument.  Because of this geometry, when the instrument is rotated around the shaft's axis, the measurement elements of the probe remain in the same location.  The name cobra probe comes from the shape of the probe head which gives it this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=J|title=Cobra probe measurements of mean velocities, Reynolds stresses and higher-order velocity correlations in pipe flow|journal=Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science|date=May 2000|volume=21|issue=4|pages=206–217|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0894-1777(00)00004-2|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobra probes come in three-, four-, and five-hole configurations, the former used for two-dimensional flow measurement, the latter two for three-dimensional flow measurement.  In the three-hole kind of instrument, there are two [[Yaw angle|yaw]] direction tubes which are chamfered and [[silver]] soldered symmetrically on the two sides of a pitot tube. It is otherwise similar to the other kinds of [[yawmeter]]s.  In the four- and five-hole configurations, the central pitot tube is surrounded by three or four chamfered tubes, respectively.

The term '''defense industrial base''' (or DIB), also known as the '''defense industrial and technological base''', is used in [[political science]] to refer to a [[government]]'s industrial assets that are of direct or indirect importance for the production of equipment for a country's [[armed forces]]. It is loosely associated with [[Realism in international relations|realism]], which views the state as the preponderant guarantor of security, and frequently features as an element of [[grand strategy]] and [[defense policy]], as well as [[diplomacy]].

== United States ==
A commonly cited example of a defense industrial base is that of the United States, where, given the onset of the [[Cold War]] accompanied by the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the maintenance "of a peacetime defense industry of significant proportions was an unprecedented event."&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Barry D.: [http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008.10.15-Defense-Industrial-Base.pdf ''The US Defense Industrial Base: Past, Present and Future''], Strategy for the Long Haul. Washington, DC: [[CSBA]] 2010, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and public figures critical of close ties among legislators, militaries and the defense industrial base due to a government's monopoly on demand for products of the latter employ the concept of the [[military–industrial complex]] to critique these connections. Early studies of interest group representation in the US referred to these ties as exemplary of the [[Iron triangle (US politics)|iron triangle]] phenomenon.

'''The Ecuador composting method''' is a common [[composting]] practice in the lowlands of [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. The compost pile is embedded on the tree [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[pseudo trunk|banana stalks]], with a pale erected in the middle. [[Biomass|Organic matter]] is placed in layers on the trunks or stalks, each layer being covered by [[mud]], or inlaid via different types of organic matter. When the pile is about 1.2 meters high, it is watered and covered by big leaves. After some time, when the compost pile settles down, the central pale is removed for [[aeration]]. This composting method is typically done in a small-scale, by indigenous villagers.

[[Image:10base2 terminator.png|thumb|right|10BASE2 cable end signal terminator.]]

In [[electronics]], '''electrical termination''' is the practice of ending a [[transmission line]] with a device that matches the [[characteristic impedance]] of the line. This is intended to prevent signals from [[Signal reflection|reflecting]] off the end of the transmission line. Reflections at the ends of unterminated transmission lines cause [[distortion]] which can produce ambiguous [[digital signal]] levels and mis-operation of digital systems. Reflections in [[analog signal]] systems cause such effects as [[ghosting (television)|video ghosting]], or [[Power margin|power loss]] in radio transmitter transmission lines.

==Transmission lines==

[[Signalling (telecommunication)|Signal]] termination often requires the installation of a terminator at the beginning and end of a wire or cable to prevent an [[Radio frequency|RF]] signal from being reflected back from each end, causing [[Interference (communication)|interference]], or power loss.  The terminator is usually placed at the end of a [[transmission line]] or [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] [[Bus (computing)|bus]] (such as in [[SCSI]]), and is designed to [[impedance matching|match]] the [[Characteristic impedance|AC impedance]] of the cable and hence minimize signal [[Reflection (electrical)|reflections]], and power losses. Less commonly, a terminator is also placed at the driving end of the wire or cable, if not already part of the signal-generating equipment.

Radio frequency currents tend to reflect from discontinuities in the cable such as [[Electrical connector|connectors]] and joints, and travel back down the cable toward the source causing interference as primary reflections. Secondary reflections can also occur at the cable start, allowing interference to persist as repeated echoes of old data. These reflections also act as bottlenecks, preventing the signal power from reaching the destination.

Transmission line cables require [[impedance matching]] to carry electromagnetic signals with minimal reflections and power losses. The distinguishing feature of most transmission line cables is that they have uniform cross sectional dimensions along their length, giving them a uniform electrical [[characteristic impedance]]. Signal terminators are designed to specifically match the characteristic impedances at both cable ends. For many systems, the terminator is a [[resistor]], with a value chosen to match the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, and chosen to have acceptably low parasitic [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] at the frequencies relevant to the system. Examples include 75 ohm resistors often used to terminate 75-ohm video transmission coaxial cables.

Types of transmission line cables include balanced line such as [[ladder line]], and [[twisted pair]]s ([[Category 6 cable|Cat-6 Ethernet]], [[Parallel SCSI]], [[ADSL]], [[Plain old telephone service|Landline Phone]], [[Balanced line#Balanced and differential|XLR audio]], [[USB]], [[IEEE 1394|Firewire]], [[RS-485|Serial]]); and unbalanced lines such as [[coaxial cable]] (Radio antenna, [[Cable television|CATV]], [[10BASE5|10BASE5 Ethernet]]).

== Types of electrical and signal terminators ==

===Passive===
[[Electronic component#Passive components|Passive]] terminators often consist of a single [[resistor]], however significantly [[Electrical reactance|reactive]] loads may require other passive components such as inductors, capacitors, or transformers.

===Active===
[[Electronic component#Active components|Active]] terminators consist of a [[voltage regulator]] that keeps the voltage used for the terminating resistor(s) at a constant level.

====Forced perfect termination====
[[File:Electrical Termination, Forced Perfect Termination. or diode-clamped.svg|thumb|right|Forced Perfect Termination.]]
Forced perfect termination (FPT) can be used on [[Single-ended signalling|single ended]] buses where [[diode]]s remove [[Overshoot (signal)|over and undershoot]] conditions. The signal is locked between two actively regulated voltage levels, which results in superior performance over a standard active terminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.t10.org/ftp/x3t9.2/document.91/91-037r0.pdf |title=Forced Perfect Termination |publisher=[[IBM]] |date=1990-08-03 |access-date=2016-12-19}} "FPT is a terminator that [dynamically] self-terminates. One that matches itself to the line perfectly thereby removing all reflections at the endpoints&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signal Termination Applications ==
[[File:SCSI-terminator-exposed-hdr-0a.jpg|thumb|right|SCSI terminator.]]

===SCSI===
All parallel [[SCSI]] units use terminators. SCSI is primarily used for storage and backup. An '''active terminator''' is a type of single ended SCSI terminator with a built-in [[voltage regulator]] to compensate for variations in terminator power.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Controller Area Network===
[[Controller area network]], commonly known as CAN Bus, uses terminators consisting of a 120 ohm resistor.

===Dummy load===
{{Main|Dummy load}}
Dummy loads are commonly used in HF to EHF frequency circuits.

===Ethernet coaxial 50 ohm===
&lt;!--[[Ethernet terminator]] redirects here--&gt;
[[10BASE2]] networks absolutely must have proper termination with a 50 ohm [[BNC connector|BNC terminator]]. If the bus network is not properly terminated, too much power will be reflected, causing all of the computers on the bus to lose network connectivity.

===Antenna network 75 ohm===
A terminating resistor for a television [[coaxial cable]] is often in the form of a cap, threaded to screw onto an [[F connector]]. Antenna cables are sometimes used for internet connections; however RG-6 should not be used for 10BASE2 (which should use RG-58) as the impedance mismatch can cause phasing problems with the baseband signal.

===Unibus===
[[File:Unibus terminator card.jpg|thumb|[[Unibus]] terminator/bootstrap card from a [[PDP-11|PDP-11/34]].]]
The [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] minicomputer [[Unibus]] systems used terminator cards with 178&amp;nbsp;Ω pullup resistors on the multi-drop address and data lines, and 383&amp;nbsp;Ω on the single-drop signal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Unibus Specification
| date = 1979
| author = Digital Equipment Corporation
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIL-STD-1553===
'''Terminating''' resistors values of 78.7 ohms 2 watt 1% are used on the [[MIL-STD-1553]] bus. At the two ends of the bus, resistors connect between the positive (high) and negative (low) signal wires either in internally terminated bus couplers or external connectorized terminators.

The MIL-STD-1553B bus must be terminated at both ends to minimize the effects of signal reflections that can cause waveform distortion and disruption or intermittent communications failures.

Optionally, a high-impedance terminator (1000 to 3000 ohms) may be used in vehicle applications to simulate a future load from an unspecified device.

Connectorized terminators are available with or without safety chains.'''

A custom-made artificial palate is moulded to fit against a speaker's hard palate. The artificial palate contains [[electrodes]] exposed to the lingual surface. When contact occurs between the tongue surface and any of the electrodes, particularly between the lateral margins of the tongue and the borders of the hard palate, electronic signals are sent to an external processing unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baken|first1=R.J.|title=Clinical MEasurement of Speech and  Voice|date=1987|publisher=Taylor and Francis|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPG provides dynamic real-time visual feedback of the location and timing of tongue contacts with the hard palate.

This procedure can record details of tongue activity during speech. It can provide direct articulatory information that children can use in therapy to monitor and improve their articulation patterns. Visual feedback is very important in the success of treating deaf children.

==History of Electropalatography== 
[[File:Electropalate-vertical.jpg|thumb|Fig.1 Example of Electropalate]]
Electropalatography was originally conceptualized and developed as a tool for phonetics research to improve upon traditional palatography methods.  Both military and academic language researchers used early electropalatography tools to obtain accurate information regarding tongue-to-palate contact in a number of foreign languages.

Early EPG devices used direct current electricity to power the sensors, which were activated by moisture sensors on mouthpieces. Mouthpieces (electropalates) originally closely resembled modern dental impression plates. Mouthpieces became more customized over time, which allowed for more accurate research. Fig. 1 shows a typical electropalate from the Reading system.

EPG added significant insight into academic understanding of articulatory phonetics.  In the 1960s and 1970s a number of independent individuals and companies recognized EPG's potential for pedagogical and therapeutic applications.  Despite the multiple attempts to reverse engineer EPG tools for speech therapy, most companies failed to commercialize EPG effectively.  EPG tools remain fairly expensive tools for speech therapy and phonetics research, though the information they provide are difficult to obtain using other methods of visual feedback of articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Articulate Technologies|url=http://www.articulateinstruments.com/a-history-of-epg/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electropalatography in phonetic research==
Although much of the development of EPG has been dedicated to clinical applications, it has been used in a number of laboratory phonetic investigations. Stone (1997) lists three main areas of research:
*study of the physiology of consonant articulations involving lingual-palatal contact
*study of the size and shape of oral constrictions in the production of fricative consonants
*the effect of neighbouring vowels on consonants production ([[coarticulation]])&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M. (1979) Investigating Speech Articulation, in Hardcastle, W.J. and Laver, J. ''The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences'', pp 28-31, Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Epg-frames.JPG|thumb|Fig.2 Electropalatography printout]]
When electropalatography is used for speech research, the data from tongue-palate contact is sampled by the controlling computer at up to 100 frames per second, and can then be printed out. An example of the printout can be seen in Fig.2, where the sequence runs from top to bottom, and where the 'O' symbol indicates contact and '.' indicates no contact. The utterance shown is 'catkin' /kæt.kɪn/; the sample numbered 344 shows when the /t/ closure is complete, and at frame 350 there is a complete velar closure. The alveolar closure is released at 351. The articulatory overlap (which is inaudible) is thus clearly shown.&lt;ref&gt;Hardcastle, W.J. and Roach, P.J. (1979) `An instrumental investigation of coarticulation in stop consonant sequences' in H.H. and P. Hollien (eds.) Current Issues in the Phonetic Sciences, pp. 533-550, Amsterdam, John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;
Individual frames of EPG contact data may be used to illustrate descriptions of consonant articulations, and this is done by Cruttenden for all the English (RP) consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruttenden, A., ed. Gimson|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|date=2014|publisher=Arnold|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some research, multiple repetitions may be summed to produce graphical representations of tongue-palate contact in a way that minimizes effects of random variation on single tokens. This was done by Farnetani in studies of Italian and French coarticulation.&lt;ref&gt;Farnetani, E.(1989)'V-C-V lingual coarticulation and its spatiotemporal domain', in Hardcastle, W.J. and Marchal, A. (1989) ''Speech Production and Speech Modelling'', NATO ASI Series, 55, Kluwer ({{ISBN|0-7923-0746-1}}), pp 98-100 and 112-116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electropalatography Providers==
Three primary manufacturers of EPG tools exist: [[CompleteSpeech]] in the United States, [[Articulate Technologies]], and [[Rose Medical Solutions]] in Great Britain.  Completespeech is a private company that specializes in speech therapy oriented EPG tools, branded as The SmartPalate System. The SmartPalate System uses a standard size sensor sheet with 126 sensors that is fitted to individual mouthpiece molds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plauche |first=Tanner |title=What is SmartPalate |url=http://www.completespeech.com/speech/smartpalate1/what_is_a_smartpalate/ |publisher=CompleteSpeech |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514094750/http://www.completespeech.com/speech/smartpalate1/what_is_a_smartpalate/ |archivedate=2014-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articulate technologies provides both speech therapy and research oriented EPG mouthpieces, branded as The Reading Palate and The Articulate Palate.  Articulate technologies EPG sensors are places by hand for individual users' mouthpieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardcastle|first=William|url=http://www.articulateinstruments.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Information-for-making-plaster-impressions-4.pdf|publisher=Articulate Technologies|accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rose Medical system, branded as LinguaGraph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LinguaGraph Electropalatography System|url=http://www.rose-medical.com/electropalatography.html|publisher=Rose Medical Solutions|accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; also uses the Reading Palate.

==Effectiveness in Therapy==

Electropalatography has been studied in a variety of populations, including children with [[cleft palate]], children with [[Down syndrome]], children who are deaf, children with [[cochlear implants]], children with [[cerebral palsy]] and adults with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Therapy has proved to be successful in tested populations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} [[Longitudinal studies]] with large sample sizes are needed to determine the long-term success of therapy.

'''Fleksy''' is a third party [[virtual keyboard]] and [[input method]] for mobile devices, which is private and improves traditional tap-[[typing]] input speed and accuracy through enhanced [[Autocorrection|auto-correction]] and [[Gesture recognition|gesture]] control.  It uses [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting algorithms]] that analyze the region where the user touches the keyboard and feeds this through a [[language model]], which calculates and identifies the intended [[word]]. Swiping gestures are used to control common functions, such as space, delete, and word correction. [[Visual impairment|Blind and visually impaired]] [[User (computing)|users]] have utilized Fleksy for eyes-free typing through [[muscle memory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afb.org/afbpress/pub.asp?DocID=aw140203 "2012: A Technology Year in Review"] AFB AccessWorld, Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] &lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syntellia.fleksy.keyboard&amp;hl=en &lt;/ref&gt; and iOS, it was first commercially available on the [[iPhone]] as a download from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] in July 2012, and is available in more than 40 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/fleksy-happy-typing/id520337246?mt=8 "Fleksy - Happy Typing" ], App Store, Retrieved on 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With ‘on device profiling’ capable of mapping behaviours across any app, users' data is anonymous and remains private. 

Officially the world’s fastest keyboard by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/5/fastest-touch-screen-text-message-record-officially-broken-with-fleksy-keyboard-57380/]&lt;/ref&gt;, Fleksy offers instant access to content while typing, such as restaurants, music, videos and more. 

Fleksy was developed by Fleksy Inc., a company founded in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fleksy.com " Fleksy"], fleksy.com, Retrieved on 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, 2016, Fleksy announced that the team had moved on to [[Pinterest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fleksy.com/fleksy-acquired-by-pinterest|title=Fleksy Acquired by Pinterest – Fleksy|website=fleksy.com|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2017, the product is managed and developed by Thingthing, a competitor keyboard &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/fleksy-keyboard-to-get-major-reboot-under-thingthing-dev-team/|title=Fleksy gets major robot under ThingThing}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Software ==

Fleksy’s auto-correct [[algorithm]] functions by combining analysis of user typing patterns and [[Context (language use)|linguistic context]]. Analysis of tap locations (rather than letters selected) affords it the ability to remain tolerant of drifting errors and allows the user to type on an invisible keyboard or even off the keyboard in some instances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4422017 "Hacker News"] news.ycombinator.com, Retrieved on 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Fleksy has been embraced by the visually-impaired community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afb.org/afbpress/pub.asp?DocID=aw131105 "An App for Wayward Fingers and Thumbs: An Evaluation of the Fleksy App from Syntellia"] AFB AccessWorld, Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assistivetechnology.about.com/od/AccessibilityintheiPhone/a/Fleksy-App-Affords-Blind-Ios-Users-Top-Speed-Typing-Acces.htm "Fleksy Gives Blind iOS Users Top-Speed Typing Access"] About.com, Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assistivetechnology.about.com/b/2012/08/01/mistype-every-letter-fleksy-still-knows-what-keys-you-meant.htm "Mistype Every Letter &amp; Fleksy Still Knows What Keys You Meant"] About.com, Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/copingwithsightloss/youngpeople/mindseye/mindseyeblog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?id=27 "Fleksy app: Helping you to type faster"] Royal National Institute for the Blind, Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the [[software]] has been considered for the "Story of the Year" of the Technology Year in Review for 2012 by the [[American Foundation for the Blind]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afb.org/afbpress/pub.asp?DocID=aw140203 "2012: A Technology Year in Review"] AFB AccessWorld, Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that the software could potentially allow sighted people to blind-type on a touchscreen.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Quentin Stafford-Fraser]] said on his [[website]]: "I found I could type whole [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] immediately, without looking at the keyboard".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statusq.org/archives/2013/01/28/4797 "Being Accessible"] StatusQ, Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleksy not only offers next word predictions, as found in competitors such as [[Swype]], [[SwiftKey]] and other keyboards, but also next-service predictions, which is unique in the keyboard space.

Fleksy also utilizes a gesture-based [[User interface|interface]] that can be used for some common functions, such as [[deleting a word]], [[Space bar|space]], [[backspace]], and choosing a word correction.

== Availability ==
Fleksy is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. Its latest update made it available for iOS 10 and all Android versions. 

Fleksy is available on certain platforms in 40 [[List of language|languages]] and [[QWERTY]], [[AZERTY]], [[QWERTZ]], [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|DVORAK]], and [[Colemak]] layouts.

== Awards ==

'''GigaPan Systems''' is a global, privately held technology company that provides hardware, software, and services to create and share high-resolution, interactive [[gigapixel]] [[panoramic]] images. The company is headquartered in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=118318468|title=GigaPan Systems LLC: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
GigaPan Systems was founded in 2008 as a collaborative project between [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[NASA]]’s [[Ames Research Center]] with support from [[Google]]. The original GigaPan robotic hardware and related software were devised for NASA's Mars [[Spirit rover|Spirit]] and [[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]] Rovers, to capture high-definition panoramas of Mars. The development team was led by Randy Sargent, a senior systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon West and the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., and Illah Nourbakhsh, associate professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh.

The project has since grown into an independent company offering solutions for capturing gigapixel images.

==Technology==
GigaPan Systems combines high-definition images and panoramas with sharing, tagging and zooming capabilities. The company offers a solution for shooting, viewing and exploring high-resolution gigapixel images in a single system. The GigaPan system includes:

*Robotic Camera Mounts: The EPIC series of robotic camera mounts can capture HD, gigapixel photos using almost any digital camera.  By setting the upper left and lower right corners of the panorama desired, the EPIC works out how many photos the camera will need to take, and then automatically organizes them into rows or columns.
*GigaPan Stitch Software: GigaPan's [[image stitching]] technology automatically combines the hundreds or thousands of images taken with a digital camera using the GigaPan EPIC series into a single image. The software is available for both Mac and Windows.
*GigaPan Viewer: Lets people view images on GigaPan.com or on a third-party website using the GigaPan free, standalone viewer application.
*GigaTag: Allows users to share photos and tag themselves on Facebook within the gigapixel images

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6028">The '''handling course''' is a section of vehicle industry proving grounds which provides the possibility to examine vehicle behaviour, vehicle manoeuvrability, and technical settings under controlled no-traffic circumstances. This track, which typically forms a loop, is often compared to smaller racecourses; it is, however strictly designed for testing. The layout of its environment imitates motorway circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/products-and-services/mobility-services/proving-grounds/proving-ground-boxberg/|title=Proving ground Boxberg|website=www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://atppbg.de/en/products/teststrecken|title=ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH - Test Tracks|website=atppbg.de|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/products-and-services/mobility-services/proving-grounds/proving-ground-vaitoudden/|title=Proving ground Vaitoudden|website=www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://zalazone.hu/en/track-vision/track-elements/|title=Track elements - ZalaZone|work=ZalaZone|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
In most cases handling courses consist of two parts: low and high speed courses, both enable the same types of tests, only at differing speeds. Handling courses may also be categorised either as wet or dry courses according to the availability of the option for track wetting.

The alternative routes of the handling courses provide diverse track options for the tests. As the course sections have varying radius of curvature, handling courses are suitable for testing all vehicles types. Several types of specially paved shorter sections may also belong to handling courses depending on the given proving ground. These may be curved, straight or even wavy asphalt track sections, furthermore straight or curving sections with varying sideway slopes.  Occasionally even degraded surfaces requiring maintenance are built deliberately in order to increase the number of options; furthermore sections suitable for conducting [[aquaplaning]] tests may also be inserted. The option of wetting of the latter sections is usually provided by using nozzles. The safety of testing is ensured b the crash spaces designed around the curves.

== Goal and utilization ==
Vehicle behaviour or manoeuvrability refers to the testing of the connection between steering and the running gear, the different assistance appliances ([[Electronic stability control|ESP]], [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[Anti slip regulation|ASR]]), and other systems influencing the dynamics of vehicles. As testing options are unlimited, handling courses are suitable for all situations related to the dynamics of modern vehicles.

== Handling courses of existing proving grounds ==
Currently most proving grounds in [[Europe]] feature handling courses. The most well-known examples are the Boxberg Proving Ground constructed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ([[Germany]]) and the Vaitoudden Winter Test Centre in [[Sweden]]. A test track featuring a handling course is currently under construction in [[Zalaegerszeg]], [[Hungary]] as well.

=== Boxberg Proving Ground, Germany, Boxberg ===
The handling course at the Boxberg Proving Ground consists of two parts. One part is designed for higher speeds suitable for testing all vehicles types thanks to its radius of curvature varying between 48 m and 101 m. The other part is designed with radius of curvature varying between 15 m and 115 m, and has inclinations which increase its difficulty. Several sections of this part are wettable, and it also has a circular surface for drifting. It is not suitable for testing heavy-duty vehicles and buses, but it has a track unit imitating a mountain tunnel, which is suitable for simulating windy circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Vaitoudden Winter Test Centre, Sweden ===
The handling course at the Vaitoudden Winter Test Centre may be divided into two parts, one with snowy surface, the other with frozen. The total length of the snowy surface is 2470 m, its width is approx. 5 m, it contains 13 curves, and due to the snow its grip is medium (μ &lt;0,3). The frozen surface is also divided into two sections. The total length of the first section is approx. 1850 m, its width is approx. 5 m, it contains 8 curves, and the grip of the ice is medium (μ &lt;0,3). The second section is approx. 3000 m long and has the same width as the first section, it contains 30 curves and its grip is also the same as that of the first.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg GmbH, Germany ===
The handling course at the Papenburg Test Centre is a small scale replica of the racecourse at [[Hockenheim]] with a length of 2.6&amp;nbsp;km and a width of 10 m, and may be divided into two independent units.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Zala ZONE Vehicle Industry Test Track, Zalaegerszeg, Hungary ===
The handling course will be a basic component of the test track currently under construction near [[Zalaegerszeg]]. The external handling course designed for high speeds will have a total length of 2032 m and a width of 12 m. Its straight sections and curve radius enable reaching a speed of 120&amp;nbsp;km/h. The 1334 m long and 6 m wide internal handling course will be designed for the same tests at lower speeds of maximum 60&amp;nbsp;km/h.

Furthermore the handling course will contain several specially paved section inserts, such as pothole and eroded sections, basalt pavement, straight, curved and wavy pavements, hilly road sections and a section with a 5% sideway slope. A basalt pavement disc will also be built suitable for testing drifting and skidding, as well as a section insert which enables the simulation of sliding on a wet road.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Hip replacement''' is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure in which the [[hip]] joint is replaced by a prosthetic [[implant (medicine)|implant]], that is, a '''hip prosthesis'''. Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi (half) replacement. Such [[joint replacement]] [[orthopaedic surgery]] is generally conducted to relieve [[arthritis]] [[pain]] or in some [[hip fracture]]s. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) consists of replacing both the [[acetabulum]] and the femoral head while [[hemiarthroplasty]] generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is currently one of the most common orthopaedic operations, though patient satisfaction short- and long-term varies widely.  The average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, and about $7,700 to $12,000 in most European countries.&lt;ref name="ifhp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hushp.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/downloadable_files/IFHP%202012%20Comparative%20Price%20Report.pdf |title=2012 comparative price report|publisher=International Federation of Health Plans|format=PDF|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Total hip replacement is most commonly used to treat joint failure caused by [[osteoarthritis]]. Other indications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[avascular necrosis]], [[traumatic arthritis]], [[protrusio acetabuli]], certain [[hip fracture]]s, benign and malignant [[bone tumor]]s, arthritis associated with [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]]. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as [[physical therapy]] and pain medications, have failed.

==Modern process==
[[File:Hip prosthesis components.jpg|thumb|160px|Main components of a hip prosthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illumin.usc.edu/61/total-hip-replacement/|title=Total Hip Replacement|website=[[University of Southern California]]|author=Andrew Still|date=2002-11-02|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Hip prosthesis.jpg|thumb|right|A [[titanium]] hip prosthesis, with a [[ceramic]] head and [[polyethylene]] acetabular cup]]
The modern artificial joint owes much to the 1962 work of Sir [[John Charnley]] at Wrightington Hospital.  His work in the field of [[tribology]] resulted in a design that almost completely replaced the other designs by the 1970s.  Charnley's design consisted of three parts:
# [[Stainless Steel|stainless steel]] one-piece femoral stem and head
# [[polyethylene]] (originally [[Teflon]]), acetabular component, both of which were fixed to the bone using
# [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] (acrylic) [[bone cement]]

The replacement joint, which was known as the Low Friction [[Arthroplasty]], was lubricated with [[synovial fluid]]. The small femoral head ({{convert|7/8|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The ultra high [[molecular weight]] [[polyethylene]] or [[UHMWPE]] acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.

The Exeter hip stem was developed in the United Kingdom during the same time as the Charnley device. Its development occurred following a collaboration between Orthopaedic Surgeon [[Robin Ling]] and [[University of Exeter]] engineer [[Clive Lee]] and it was first implanted at the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/20/robin-ling-obituary|title=Robin Ling obituary|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 October 2017|first=A John|last=Timperley|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exeter Hip is a cemented device, but with a slightly different stem geometry. Both designs have shown excellent long-term durability when properly placed and are still widely used in slightly modified versions.

Early implant designs had the potential to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.

Initial hip designs were made of a one-piece femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.

To combat loosening caused by polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel materials for the acetabular liners. [[Ceramic]] heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE was introduced in the late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.

When currently available implants are used, cemented stems tend to have a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.

Once an uncommon operation reserved for frail patients with a limited life expectancy, hip replacement is now common, even among active [[Sportsperson|athletes]] including race car drivers [[Bobby Labonte]] and [[Dale Jarrett]], and the 8-time Major-winning American golfer [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], who shot a 67 in the opening round of the [[Masters Tournament]] in the year following his operation.

==Techniques==
There are several incisions, defined by their relation to the gluteus medius. The approaches are posterior (Moore), lateral (Hardinge or Liverpool),&lt;ref name="pmid9498150"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pai VS |title=A comparison of three lateral approaches in primary total hip replacement |journal=Int Orthop |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=393–398 |year=1997 |pmid=9498150 |doi=10.1007/s002640050193 |url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00264/bibs/8021006/80210393.htm |pmc=3619565 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020108155635/http://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00264/bibs/8021006/80210393.htm |archivedate=2002-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; antero-lateral (Watson-Jones),&lt;ref name="titleAnterolateral Approach to Hip Joint: (Watson Jones) - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/anterolateral_approach_to_hip_joint_watson_jones |title=Anterolateral Approach to Hip Joint: (Watson Jones) – Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |accessdate=2007-11-26 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; anterior (Smith-Petersen)&lt;ref name="titleAnterior Approach to the Hip (Smith Petersen) - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/anterior_approach_to_the_hip_smith_peterson |title=Anterior Approach to the Hip (Smith Petersen) – Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |accessdate=2007-11-26 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[greater trochanter]] osteotomy. There is no compelling evidence in the literature for any particular approach, but consensus of professional opinion favours either modified anterolateral (Watson-Jones) or posterior approach.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Posterior approach===
The ''posterior (Moore or Southern) approach'' accesses the joint and capsule through the back, taking [[piriformis muscle]] and the short external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the acetabulum and femur and preserves the hip [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abductors]] and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It has the advantage of becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics cite a higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, piriformis and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk.

===Lateral approach===
The ''lateral approach'' is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires elevation of the hip abductors ([[gluteus medius]] and [[gluteus minimus]]) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley),{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using [[surgical suture|sutures]]. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat.

=== Antero-lateral approach ===
The ''anterolateral approach'' develops the interval between the [[tensor fasciae latae]] and the gluteus medius. The Gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and hip capsule are detached from the anterior (front) for the greater trochanter and femoral neck and then repaired with heavy suture after the replacement of the joint.

=== Anterior approach ===
The ''anterior approach'' uses an interval between the [[sartorius muscle]] and tensor fasciae latae. Dr. Joel Matta and Dr. Bert Thomas have adapted this approach, which was commonly used for pelvic fracture repair surgery, for use when performing hip replacement. When used with older hip implant systems that had a small diameter head, dislocation rates were reduced compared to surgery performed through a posterior approach. With modern implant designs, dislocation rates are similar between the anterior and posterior approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maratt|first1=Joseph D.|last2=Gagnier|first2=Joel J.|last3=Butler|first3=Paul D.|last4=Hallstrom|first4=Brian R.|last5=Urquhart|first5=Andrew G.|last6=Roberts|first6=Karl C.|title=No Difference in Dislocation Seen in Anterior Vs Posterior Approach Total Hip Arthroplasty|journal=The Journal of Arthroplasty|date=September 2016|volume=31|issue=9|pages=127–130|doi=10.1016/j.arth.2016.02.071}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anterior approach has been shown in studies to variably improve early functional recovery, with possible complications of femoral component loosening and early revision compared to other approaches&lt;ref name="Direct Anterior Approach"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meneghini|first1=R.

=== Minimally invasive approaches ===
The dual incision approach and other minimally invasive surgery seeks to reduce soft tissue damage through reducing the size of the incision. However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures can be significantly impaired as the approaches get smaller. This can result in unintended fractures and soft tissue injury. The majority of current orthopedic surgeons use a "minimally invasive" approach compared to traditional approaches which were quite large comparatively.

[[Computer-assisted surgery]] and robotic surgery techniques are also available to guide the surgeon to provide enhanced accuracy. Several commercial CAS and robotic systems are available for use worldwide. Improved patient outcomes and reduced complications have not been demonstrated when these systems are used when compared to standard techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parsley|first1=Brian S.|title=Robotics in Orthopedics: A Brave New World|journal=The Journal of Arthroplasty|date=February 2018|doi=10.1016/j.arth.2018.02.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacofsky|first1=David J.|last2=Allen|first2=Mark|title=Robotics in Arthroplasty: A Comprehensive Review|journal=The Journal of Arthroplasty|date=October 2016|volume=31|issue=10|pages=2353–2363|doi=10.1016/j.arth.2016.05.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implants==
[[File:MetalonmetalhipreplaceMark.png|thumb|Metal on metal prosthetic hip]]
[[File:Hip-replacement.jpg|thumb|upright|Cement-free implant sixteen days after surgery. Femoral component is cobalt chromium combined with titanium which induces bone growth into the implant. Ceramic head. Acetabular cup coated with bone growth-inducing material and held temporarily in place with a single screw.]]
The prosthetic implant used in hip replacement consists of three parts: the acetabular cup, the femoral component, and the articular interface. Options exist for different people and indications. The evidence for a number of newer devices is not very good, including: ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular femoral necks, and uncemented monoblock cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nieuwenhuijse|first1=M. J.|last2=Nelissen|first2=R. G. H. H.|last3=Schoones|first3=J.

===Acetabular cup===
The acetabular cup is the component which is placed into the [[acetabulum]] (hip socket). Cartilage and bone are removed from the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either UHMWPE ([[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]]) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is held in place by a metal coating on the outside of the cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are [[sintering|sintered]] beads and a [[foam metal]] design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force.&lt;ref name="Amirouche"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amirouche|first1=Farid|title=Factors influencing initial cup stability in total hip arthroplasty|journal=Clinical Biomechanics|year=2014|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1177–85|doi=10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2014.09.006|pmid=25266242|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268003314002186. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a [[Morse taper]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Femoral component===
{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}The femoral component is the component that fits in the [[femur]] (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped to accept the femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There are two types of fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic [[bone cement]] to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a [[Morse taper]]. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.

===Articular interface===
{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}The articular interface is not part of either implant, rather it is the area between the acetabular cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and socket joint. Size, material properties and machining [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]] at the articular interface can be selected based on patient demand to optimise implant function and longevity whilst mitigating associated risks. The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are {{convert|28|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|32|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|36|mm|abbr=on}}. While {{convert|22.25|mm|frac=8|abbr=on}} was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54&amp;nbsp;mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled to reduce the amount of wear debris generated by friction. Typical pairings of materials include metal on polyethylene (MOP), metal on crosslinked polyethylene (MOXP), ceramic on ceramic (COC), ceramic on crosslinked polyethylene (COXP) and metal on metal (MOM). Each combination has different advantages and disadvantages.

==Configuration==
Post-operative [[projectional radiography]] is routinely performed to ensure proper configuration of hip prostheses.

The direction of the acetabular cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation.&lt;ref name=Watt/&gt; For this purpose, the ''acetabular inclination'' and the ''acetabular anteversion'' are measurements of cup angulation in the [[coronal plane]] and the [[sagittal plane]], respectively.

==Risks==
Risks and complications in hip replacement are similar to those associated with all [[Joint replacement#Risks and complications|joint replacements]]. They can include infection, dislocation, limb length inequality, loosening, impingement, osteolysis, metal sensitivity, nerve palsy, chronic pain and death. [[Bariatric surgery|Weight loss surgery]] before a hip replacement does not appear to change outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=TO|last2=Aboelmagd|first2=T|last3=Hing|first3=CB|last4=MacGregor|first4=A|title=Does bariatric surgery prior to total hip or knee arthroplasty reduce post-operative complications and improve clinical outcomes for obese patients?

===Infection===
Infection is one of the most common causes for revision of a total hip replacement, along with loosening and dislocation. The incidence of infection in primary hip replacement is around 1% or less in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bozic|first1=Kevin J|last2=Kurtz|first2=Steven M|last3=Lau|first3=Edmund|last4=Ong|first4=Kevin|last5=Vail|first5=Thomas P|last6=Berry|first6=Daniel J|title=The Epidemiology of Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty in the United States|journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume|date=January 2009|volume=91|issue=1|pages=128–133|doi=10.2106/JBJS.H.00155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors for infection include obesity, diabetes, smoking, immunosuppressive medications or diseases, and history of infection.

Modern diagnosis of infection around a total knee replacement is based on the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parvizi|first1=Javad|last2=Zmistowski|first2=Benjamin|last3=Berbari|first3=Elie F.|last4=Bauer|first4=Thomas W.|last5=Springer|first5=Bryan D.|last6=Della Valle|first6=Craig J.|last7=Garvin|first7=Kevin L.|last8=Mont|first8=Michael A.|last9=Wongworawat|first9=Montri D.|last10=Zalavras|first10=Charalampos G.|title=New Definition for Periprosthetic Joint Infection: From the Workgroup of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|date=22 September 2011|volume=469|issue=11|pages=2992–2994|doi=10.1007/s11999-011-2102-9|pmc=3183178}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

1.There is a sinus tract communicating with the prosthesis; or
2. A pathogen is isolated by culture from at least two separate tissue or fluid samples obtained from the affected prosthetic joint; 
or

Four of the following six criteria exist:

1.Elevated serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR&gt;30mm/hr) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP&gt;10&amp;nbsp;mg/L) concentration,

2.Elevated synovial leukocyte count,

3.Elevated synovial neutrophil percentage (PMN%),

4.Presence of purulence in the affected joint,

5.Isolation of a microorganism in one culture of periprosthetic tissue or fluid, or

6.Greater than five neutrophils per high-power field in five high-power fields observed from histologic analysis of periprosthetic tissue at ×400 magnification.

None of the above laboratory tests has 100% sensitivity or specificity for diagnosing infection. Specificity improves when the tests are performed in patients in whom clinical suspicion exists. ESR and CRP remain good 1st line tests for screening (high sensitivity, low specificity).  Aspiration of the joint remains the test with the highest specificity for confirming infection.

===Dislocation===
[[File:Dislocated hip replacement.jpg|thumb|upright|Dislocated artificial hip]]
[[File:Hip prosthesis liner creep and wear.png|thumb|160px|Liner wear, particularly when over 2 mm, increases the risk of dislocation.&lt;ref name=berry2012/&gt; Liner creep, on the other hand, is normal remoulding.&lt;ref name=Watt/&gt;]]

Dislocation is the most common complication of hip replacement surgery. The most common causes vary by the duration since the surgery.

Hip prosthesis [[joint dislocation|dislocation]] mostly occurs in the first 3 months after insertion, mainly because of incomplete scar formation and relaxed soft tissues.&lt;ref name=berry2012&gt;{{cite book|title=Surgery of the Hip|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=Kc-AhYLnIF4C&amp;pg=PA1035|author=Daniel J. Berry, Jay Lieberman|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2012|isbn=9781455727056|page=1035}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes eight to twelve weeks for the soft tissues injured or cut during surgery to heal. During this period, the hip ball can come out of the socket. The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the tissue cut is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used.

Dislocations occurring between 3 months and 5 years after insertion usually occur due to malposition of the components, or dysfunction of nearby muscles.&lt;ref name=berry2012/&gt;

Risk factors of late dislocation (after 5 years) mainly include:&lt;ref name=berry2012/&gt;
*Female gender
*Younger age at primary hip arthroplasty
*Previous [[subluxation]] without complete dislocation
*Previous trauma
*Substantial weight loss
*Recent onset or progression of [[dementia]] or a [[neurological disorder]]
*Malposition of the cup
*Wear of the liner, particularly when it causes movement of the head of more than 2&amp;nbsp;mm within the cup compared to its original position
*Prosthesis loosening with migration

Surgeons who perform more of the operations each year tend to have fewer patients dislocate. Doing the surgery from an anterior approach seems to lower dislocation rates when small diameter heads are used, but the benefit has not been shown when compared to modern posterior incisions with the use of larger diameter heads. The use of larger diameter head size does in it self decrease the risk of dislocation, even though this correlation is only found in head sizes up to 28&amp;nbsp;mm, thereafter no additional decrease in dislocation rate is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hailer|first=Nils P.|last2=Weiss|first2=Rüdiger J.|last3=Stark|first3=André|last4=Kärrholm|first4=Johan|date=October 2012|title=The risk of revision due to dislocation after total hip arthroplasty depends on surgical approach, femoral head size, sex, and primary diagnosis.

===Limb Length Inequality===
Most adults prior to a hip replacement have a limb length inequality of 0–2&amp;nbsp;cm which they were born with and which causes no clinical deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anatomic and functional leg-length inequality: A review and recommendation for clinical decision-making. Part I, anatomic leg-length inequality: prevalence, magnitude, effects and clinical significance|last1=Knutson|first1=Gary A|journal=Chiropractic &amp; Osteopathy|date=2005|volume=13|issue=1|pages=11|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-11|pmc=1232860}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for patients to feel a limb length inequality after total hip replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maloney|first1=William J|last2=Keeney|first2=James A|title=Leg length discrepancy after total hip arthroplasty|journal=The Journal of Arthroplasty|date=June 2004|volume=19|issue=4|pages=108–110|doi=10.1016/j.arth.2004.02.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the leg seems long immediately after surgery when in fact both are equal length. An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. This feeling usually subsides by 6 months after surgery as the body adjusts to the new hip joint. The cause of this feeling is variable, and usually related to abductor muscle weakness, pelvic obliquity, and minor lengthening of the hip during surgery (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;cm) to achieve stability and restore the joint to pre-arthritic mechanics. If the limb length difference remains bothersome to the patient more than 6 months after surgery, a shoe lift can be used. Only in extreme cases is surgery required for correction.

===Fracture===
Bones with internal fixation devices in situ are at risk of [[periprosthetic]] fractures at the end of the implant, an area of relative mechanical stress.  Post-operative femoral fractures are graded by the [[Vancouver classification]].

===Vein thrombosis===
[[Venous thrombosis]] such as [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] are relatively common following hip replacement surgery. Standard treatment with [[anticoagulant]]s is for 7–10 days; however treatment for more than 21 days may be superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobieraj|first=DM|author2=Lee, S |author3=Coleman, CI |author4=Tongbram, V |author5=Chen, W |author6=Colby, J |author7=Kluger, J |author8=Makanji, S |author9=Ashaye, AO |author10= White, CM |title=Prolonged versus standard-duration venous thromboprophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery: a systematic review|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=May 15, 2012|volume=156|issue=10|pages=720–7|pmid=22412039|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-156-10-201205150-00423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research from 2013 has on the other hand suggested that anticoagulants in otherwise healthy patients undergoing a so-called fast track protocol with hospital stays under five days, might only be necessary while in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jørgensen|first=Christoffer C.|last2=Jacobsen|first2=Michael K.|last3=Soeballe|first3=Kjeld|last4=Hansen|first4=Torben B.|last5=Husted|first5=Henrik|last6=Kjærsgaard-Andersen|first6=Per|last7=Hansen|first7=Lars T.|last8=Laursen|first8=Mogens B.|last9=Kehlet|first9=Henrik|year=2013|title=Thromboprophylaxis only during hospitalisation in fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty, a prospective cohort study|journal=BMJ Open|volume=3|issue=12|pages=e003965|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003965|issn=2044-6055|pmc=3863129|pmid=24334158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osteolysis===
Many long-term problems with hip replacements are the result of [[osteolysis]]. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.

===Metal sensitivity===
Concerns are being raised about the metal sensitivity and potential dangers of metal particulate debris.

It appears these masses are more common in women and these patients show a higher level of iron in the blood. The cause is unknown and is probably multifactorial. There may be a toxic reaction to an excess of particulate metal wear debris or a hypersensitivity reaction to a normal amount of metal debris.

Metal hypersensitivity is a well-established phenomenon and is common, affecting about 10–15% of the population.&lt;ref name=Hallab01&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hallab N, Merritt K, Jacobs JJ |title=Metal sensitivity in patients with orthopaedic implants |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=83-A |issue=3|pages=428–36 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11263649 |url=http://www.jbjs.org/article.aspx?volume=83-A&amp;page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with metals can cause immune reactions such as skin hives, eczema, redness and itching. Although little is known about the short- and long-term pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of circulating metal degradation products in vivo, there have been many reports of immunologic type responses temporally associated with implantation of metal components.  Individual case reports link hypersensitivity immune reactions with adverse performance of metallic clinical cardiovascular, orthopedic and plastic surgical and dental implants.&lt;ref name=Hallab01/&gt;

===Metal toxicity===
{{Main|Metallosis}}
Most hip replacements consist of cobalt and chromium alloys, or titanium. Stainless steel is no longer used. All implants release their constituent ions into the blood. Typically these are excreted in the urine, but in certain individuals the ions can accumulate in the body. In implants which involve metal-on-metal contact, microscopic fragments of [[cobalt]] and [[chromium]] can be absorbed into the patient's bloodstream. There are reports of cobalt toxicity with hip replacement patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/bulletins/docs/b2010_14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters-20120329/&gt;

===Nerve palsy===
Post operative sciatic nerve palsy is another possible complication. The incidence of this complication is low. Femoral nerve palsy is another but much more rare complication. Both of these will typically resolve over time, but the healing process is slow. Patients with pre-existing nerve injury are at greater risk of experiencing this complication and are also slower to recover.

===Chronic pain===
A few patients who have had a hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip ([[iliopsoas]]) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Incision made in the front of the hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).

===Death===
The rate of death for elective hip replacements is significantly less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Coté, John|title=Hip replacement is not viewed as high-risk surgery; Death is rare, but underlying medical condition a factor |agency= |work= |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |pages= |page= |date=July 22, 2007|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-07-22/news/17254067_1_hip-replacement-hip-replacement-surgery-blood-clot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/588980 Medscape Conference Coverage], American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2009 Annual Meeting, AAOS 2009: Certain Factors Increase Risk for Death After Total Hip Arthroplasty, Barbara Boughton, March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for patients presenting with signs of an allergic reactions, evaluation for sensitivity should be conducted. Removal of the device that is not needed should be considered, since removal may alleviate the symptoms.  Patients who have allergic reactions to cheap jewelry are more likely to have reactions to orthopedic implants.  There is increasing awareness of the phenomenon of metal sensitivity and many surgeons now take this into account when planning which implant is optimal for each patient.

On March 12, 2012, ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a study, based on data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales, finding that metal-on-metal hip implants failed at much greater rates than other types of hip implants and calling for a ban on all metal-on-metal hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith AJ, Dieppe P, Vernon K, Porter M, Blom AW |title=Failure rates of stemmed metal-on-metal hip replacements: analysis of data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales |journal=Lancet |volume=379 |issue=9822 |pages=1199–204 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22417410 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60353-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(12)60353-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of 402,051 hip replacements showed that 6.2% of metal-on-metal hip implants had failed within five years, compared to 1.7% of metal-on-plastic and 2.3% of ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants.

On February 10, 2011, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued an advisory on metal-metal hip implants, stating it was continuing to gather and review all available information about metal-on-metal hip systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/MetalonMetalHipImplants/default.htm |title=Metal-on-Metal Hip Implants |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27–28, 2012, an advisory panel met to decide whether to impose new standards, taking into account findings of the study in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref name=reuters-20120329&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/29/usa-fda-hips-idUSL3E8ET6X820120329 |title=FDA seeks more advice on metal hip implants |publisher=Reuters |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/ucm297884.htm |title=Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee Meeting Announcement |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |id=FDA-2012-N-0293 |date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FDA-summary-memo&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/OrthopaedicandRehabilitationDevicesPanel/UCM309302.pdf |title=FDA Executive Summary Memorandum – Metal-on-Metal Hip Implant System |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No new standards, such as routine checking of blood metal ion levels, were set, but guidance was updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/MetalonMetalHipImplants/ucm241604.htm |title=Concerns about Metal-on-Metal Hip Implants |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=17 January 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, FDA has not required hip implants to be tested in clinical trials before they can be sold in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/study-suggests-women-have-higher-risk-of-hip-implant-failure/|title=Study Suggests Women Have Higher Risk of Hip Implant Failure - For The Media - JAMA Network|author=|date=|website=media.jamanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, companies making new hip implants only need to prove that they are "substantially equivalent" to other hip implants already on the market.  The exception is metal-on-metal implants, which were not tested in clinical trials but because of the high revision rate of metal-on-metal hips, in the future the FDA has stated that clinical trials will be required for approval and that post-market studies will be required to keep metal on metal hip implants on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1206794 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1206794 |title=Delays and Difficulties in Assessing Metal-on-Metal Hip Implants |year=2012 |last1=Rising |first1=Joshua P. |last2=Reynolds |first2=Ian S. |last3=Sedrakyan |first3=Art |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=367 |pages=e1 |pmid=22716934 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives and variations==

===Conservative management===
The first line approach as an alternative to hip replacement is conservative management which involves a multimodal approach of oral medication, injections, activity modification and [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cibulka MT, White DM, Woehrle J, etal |title=Hip pain and mobility deficits—hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association |journal=J Orthop Sports Phys Ther |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=A1–25 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19352008 |pmc=3963282 |doi=10.2519/jospt.2009.0301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative management can prevent or delay the need for hip replacement.

=== Preoperative care ===
Preoperative education is currently an important part of patient care. There is some evidence that it may slightly reduce anxiety before hip or knee replacement, with low risk of negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonald|first=S|last2=Page|first2=MJ|last3=Beringer|first3=K|last4=Wasiak|first4=J|last5=Sprowson|first5=A|title=Preoperative education for hip or knee replacement|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|publication-date=13 May 2014|issue=5|pages=CD003526|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003526.pub3|pmid=24820247|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemiarthroplasty===
'''Hemiarthroplasty''' is a surgical procedure which replaces one half of the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a subcapital (just below the head) fracture of the neck of the femur (a [[hip fracture]]). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite [[prosthesis]]. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a [[composite material|composite]] of [[metal]] and [[HDPE]] which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because with the passage of time the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the [[acetabulum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=van der Meulen, M.C.H. |author2=Allen, W.A. |author3=Giddings, V.L. |author4=Athanasiou, K.A. |author5=Poser, R.D. |author6=Goodman, S.B. |author7=Smith, R.L. |author8=Beaupré, G.S. |title=Effect of hemiarthroplasty on acetabular cartilage |work=1996 Project Reports |publisher=VA Palo Alto Health Care System's Bone and Joint Rehabilitation Research and Development Center |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/rrd/96reports/96dev5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Hip resurfacing===
[[Hip resurfacing]] is an alternative to hip replacement surgery. It has been used in Europe for over seventeen years and become a common procedure. Health-related quality of life measures are markedly improved and patient satisfaction is favorable after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Koutras C, Antoniou SA, Talias MA, Heep H |title=Impact of Total Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty on Health-Related Quality of Life Measures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=J Arthroplasty. |date=19 May 2015 |pmid=26067708 |doi=10.1016/j.arth.2015.05.014 |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1938–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minimally invasive hip resurfacing]] procedure is a further refinement to hip resurfacing.

===Viscosupplementation===
Current alternatives also include viscosupplementation, or the injection of artificial lubricants into the joint.&lt;ref name="pmid17874246"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van den Bekerom MP, Lamme B, Sermon A, Mulier M |title=What is the evidence for viscosupplementation in the treatment of patients with hip osteoarthritis?

The cost of treatment is typically not covered by health insurance organizations.

Some believe that the future of osteoarthritis treatment is [[bioengineering]], targeting the growth and/or repair of the damaged, arthritic joint. Centeno et al. have reported on the partial regeneration of an arthritic human hip joint using mesenchymal [[stem cell]]s in one patient.&lt;ref name="pmid16886034"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Centeno CJ, Kisiday J, Freeman M, Schultz JR |title=Partial regeneration of the human hip via autologous bone marrow nucleated cell transfer: A case study |journal=Pain Physician |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=253–6 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16886034 |doi= |url=http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/linkout_vw.php?issn=1533-3159&amp;vol=9&amp;page=253 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212142425/http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/linkout_vw.php?issn=1533-3159&amp;vol=9&amp;page=253 |archivedate=2009-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is yet to be shown that this result will apply to a larger group of patients and result in significant benefits. The FDA has stated that this procedure is being practiced without conforming to regulations, but Centeno claims that it is exempt from FDA regulation.

Total hip replacement incidence varies in developed countries between 30 (Romania) and 290 (Germany) procedures per 100,000 population per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurtz SM, Ong KL, Lau E, Widmer M, Maravic M, Gómez-Barrena E, de Pina Mde F, Manno V, Torre M, Walter WL, de Steiger R, Geesink RG, Peltola M, Röder C |title=International survey of primary and revision total knee replacement |journal=Int Orthop |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=1783–9 |year=2011 |pmid=21404023 |pmc=3224613 |doi=10.1007/s00264-011-1235-5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 0.8% of Americans have undergone the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maradit Kremers H, Larson DR, Crowson CS, Kremers WK, Washington RE, Steiner CA, Jiranek WA, Berry DJ |title=Prevalence of Total Hip and Knee Replacement in the United States |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=97 |issue=17 |pages=1386–97 |year=2015 |pmid=26333733 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.N.01141 |pmc=4551172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Federation of Healthcare Plans, the average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, $11,889 in the United Kingdom, $10,987 in France, $9,574 in Switzerland, and $7,731 in Spain.&lt;ref name="ifhp"/&gt; In the United States, the average cost of a total hip replacement varies widely by geographic region, ranging from $11,327 (Birmingham, Alabama) to $73,927 (Boston, Massachusetts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcbs.com/healthofamerica/BCBS_BHI_Report-Jan-_21_Final.pdf|title=A study of cost variations for knee and hip replacement surgeries in the U.S.|publisher=Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|date=21 January 2015|format=PDF|accessdate=4 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022105614/http://www.bcbs.com/healthofamerica/BCBS_BHI_Report-Jan-_21_Final.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest recorded attempts at hip replacement were carried out in Germany in 1891 by [[Themistocles Gluck]] (1853–1942),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/1659480/|title=History of Artificial Joints -  ppt video online download|author=|date=|website=slideplayer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brand |first1=RA |last2=Mont |first2=MA |last3=Manring |first3=M |title=Biographical sketch: Themistocles Gluck (1853–1942) |journal=Clin.

On September 28, 1940 at Columbia Hospital in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], American surgeon Dr. Austin T. Moore (1899–1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/jointreplacement1/p/austinmoore.htm|title=What You Need to Know About Joint Replacement Surgery|author=|date=|website=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed the first metallic hip replacement surgery.  The original prosthesis he designed was a proximal femoral replacement, with a large fixed head made of the cobalt-chrome alloy [[Vitallium]].  It was about a foot in length and bolted to the resected end of the femoral shaft (hemiarthroplasty).  A later version, the so-called Austin Moore Prosthesis which was introduced in 1952, is still in use today, although rarely.  Like modern hip implants, it is inserted into the medullary canal of the femur, and depends on bone growth through a hole in the stem for long-term attachment.

A '''lead programmer''' is a [[software engineer]] in charge of one or more  [[Computer program|software]] projects.  Alternative titles include ''development lead'', ''technical lead'', ''lead software engineer'', ''software design engineer lead'' (SDE lead), ''software development manager'', ''software manager'', or ''lead application developer''.  When primarily contributing in a high-level enterprise software design role, the title ''software architect'' (or similar) is often used.

==Responsibilities==

A lead programmer's exact responsibilities vary from company to company, but in general he or she is responsible for the underlying [[Software architecture|architecture]] for the software program, as well as for overseeing the work being done by any other software engineers working on the project. A lead programmer will typically also act as a [[mentorship|mentor]] for new or lower-level software developers or [[programmer]]s, as well as for all the members on the development team.

Although the responsibilities are primarily technical, lead programmers also generally serve as an interface between the programmers and management, have ownership of development plans and have supervisorial responsibilities in delegating work and ensuring that software projects come in on time and under budget. Lead programmers also serve as technical advisers to management and provide programming perspective on requirements. Typically a lead programmer will oversee a development team of between two and ten programmers, with three to five often considered the ideal size. Teams larger than ten programmers tend to become unmanageable without additional structure. A lead programmer normally reports to a manager with overall project or section responsibility, such as a director or product unit manager (PUM).

==Qualifications==

Lead programmers are usually trained in software programming, although do not necessarily hold formal degrees in the subject, and may learn management responsibilities either on the job or through short courses.  Because their primary training is usually technical rather than managerial, lead programmers traditionally see themselves as part of the technical staff of a company rather than as part of management.

In June 2007, while preparing for an interview with [[Reuters]], Whitman allegedly shoved her subordinate, communications employee Young Mi Kim. Of the incident, Whitman related, "In any high-pressure working environment, tensions can surface." Kim also stated, "Yes, we had an unfortunate incident, but we resolved it in a way that speaks well for her and for eBay." The matter was resolved after a $200,000 settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, Seema (June 15, 2010).

Whitman resigned as CEO of eBay in November 2007, but remained on the board and served as an advisor to new CEO [[John Donahoe]] until late 2008. She was inducted into the U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2008. "I've said for some time that 10 years is roughly the right time to stay at the helm at a company like ours", she said in an interview with the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', adding that "it's time for new leadership, a new perspective and a new vision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whitman quits eBay CEO post as of March 31|first=Verne|last=Kopytoff|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ties to Goldman Sachs====
[[Goldman Sachs]], whose executives donated $100,000 to the Whitman campaign, manages a part of Whitman's fortune. As CEO of eBay, Whitman earned approximately $1.78&amp;nbsp;million resulting from a practice known as [[spinning (IPO)|spinning]] whereby executives who did business with Goldman Sachs could reap profits by getting early deals before the public on hot IPOs offered by the bank. Whitman later resigned from the Goldman Sachs board after some expressed concern over her receiving shares from Goldman Sachs. In commenting on Whitman's resignation from the Goldman Sachs board, eBay spokesman Henry Gomez told ''The Wall Street Journal'' at the time that, "If we wanted to use Goldman's services, she doesn't want there to be even the slightest perception of any conflict. She's doing this because she thinks quite highly of the firm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EBay CEO quits Goldman board|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/12/20/news/whitman/|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=7 August 2014|date=December 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Whitman was on Goldman Sachs' board, she served on the compensation committee, which approved multimillion-dollar bonus packages for then-CEO [[Henry Paulson]] and his top aides. Public domain documents reveal that Whitman has a multimillion-dollar stake in 21 investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.&lt;ref name="Lance Williams and Carla Marinucci"/&gt; Given Goldman Sachs' major investments in California state finances, all these ties to Goldman Sachs led to considerable controversy during the gubernatorial campaign.&lt;ref name="Lance Williams and Carla Marinucci"/&gt; In response, Whitman vowed to eliminate any potential conflicts of interest, and publicly stated that she would immediately sell her Goldman Sachs stock and put her Goldman Sachs-managed investments in a [[blind trust]] if elected governor.

==Political positions==
While running for governor, Whitman emphasized three major areas: job creation, reduced state government spending, and reform of the state's K-12 educational system. She argued that it is best to start only a few things and finish them, instead of starting a lot of things and finishing few of them.&lt;ref name=McLaughlin-20091116&gt;{{cite news|author=McLaughlin, Ken|title=Campbell takes Silicon Valley in new San Jose State poll|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/california-governors-race-2010/ci_13802741|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
Whitman said that if elected, on her first day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gardner, Michael|title=Emissions initiative in Whitman's cross hairs|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/oct/05/emissions-initiative-whitmans-cross-hairs/|date=October 5, 2009|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; she would have suspended AB 32, the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]], for a year to study its potential economic implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/sep/24/whitman-says-shed-suspend-8216green8217-initiative/|title=Whitman says she'd suspend 'green' initiative|date=September 24, 2009|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; AB 32 requires the state to cut [[greenhouse gas emissions]] by 30 percent by 2020.&lt;ref name=Young /&gt; At the state Republican Convention in March 2010, Whitman described California Republican Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s climate change bill as a "job-killer".&lt;ref&gt;Marinucci, Carla &amp; Garofoli, Joe{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/03/14/MNI91CFEOE.DTL&amp;sfgabt=ttmabtctopstories|title=Lots of tough talk at state GOP convention|date=March 14, 2010|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=March 15, 2010 | first1=Carla | last1=Marinucci | first2=Joe | last2=Garofoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman opposed [[California Proposition 23 (2010)|Proposition 23]], which would delay the global warming law AB 32 until California's unemployment falls to 5.5 percent and stays there for a year, stating that the proposition did not reasonably balance the need to protect jobs with the need to preserve environment.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite news|author=Young, Samantha |agency=Associated Press|title=Whitman opposes measure delaying Calif climate law|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9IDQKD80.htm|publisher=Bloomberg|work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On water issues, Whitman opposed further restrictions on water supply in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], and she suggested that President Obama should overturn a federal judge's ruling under provisions in the [[Endangered Species Act]] which reduced water supplies another 5% to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100820032423/http://www.megwhitman.com/story/202/meg-whitman-let-the-water-flow.html "Meg Whitman: Let the water flow"]. ''Fresno Bee''. June 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal immigration===
Whitman said that [[Arizona]]'s approach to illegal immigration with [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act|Arizona SB 1070]] is wrong and that there are better ways to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/whitman-in-spanish-im-against-arizonas-law/65236/|title=Whitman in Spanish: I'm Against Arizona's Law|first=Chris |last=Good|publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date =October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that, if she had lived in California in 1994, she would have voted against [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]] concerning illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="Dibble"&gt;

She stated that illegal immigrant students should be prohibited from attending state-funded institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/us/politics/19whitman.html New York Times, June 18, 2010, "The Ad Campaign"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="megwhitman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/speeches/44962052/meg-whitman-governor-california |title=Policy Pages – Other Priorities – Meg Whitman for Governor of California |publisher=Megwhitman.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, California state law permits this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2010/04/01/2648006/illegal-immigrants-less-than-1.html The Sacramento Bee, "Illegal immigrants college enrollment", August 6, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510205149/http://www.sacbee.com/2010/04/01/2648006/illegal-immigrants-less-than-1.html |date=May 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Whitman called for "a path to legalization" of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="Dibble"/&gt; In a 2010 interview on television station [[KTLA]], Whitman said, "I want to hold employers accountable for hiring only documented workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = In Case You Missed It: Meg Whitman's interview on KTLA| publisher=Meg Whitman for Governor| date = August 11, 2010| url = http://www.megwhitman.com/story/9561/in-case-you-missed-it-meg-whitmans-interview-on-ktla.html| archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100819214258/http://www.megwhitman.com/story/9561/in-case-you-missed-it-meg-whitmans-interview-on-ktla.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = August 19, 2010| accessdate =October 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage, abortion and marijuana===
During the 2010 California gubernatorial election, Whitman supported California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], which reversed ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' and defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman in the state. Whitman also criticized Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and [[California Attorney General|Attorney General]] Jerry Brown for not defending Proposition 8 in the federal judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Marinucci, Carla |author2=Garofoli, Joe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/20/MNKU1F18TF.DTL |title=Meg Whitman says state should defend Prop. 8 |work=San Francisco Chronicle  |date=August 21, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 26, 2013, Whitman confirmed that she had reversed that opinion. Whitman stated, "At the time, I believed the people of California had weighed in on this question and that overturning the will of the people was the wrong approach," and "The facts and arguments presented during the legal process since then have had a profound impact on my thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meg Whitman signs legal brief backing gay marriage in Prop. 8 case|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/meg-whitman-signs-legal-brief-supporting-gay-marriage-in-prop-8-case.html|accessdate=February 27, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman also believes that gay and lesbian couples should be permitted to adopt children.&lt;ref name=Finnegan&gt;{{cite news|author=Finnegan, Michael|title=GOP gubernatorial candidate Whitman outlines stands|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-whitman11-2009feb11,0,5416436.story|date=February 11, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=February 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman supports [[abortion rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marinucci, Carla|title=Meg Whitman makes case on how she's different|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/12/BACU15SUDJ.DTL|date=February 13, 2009|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=February 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitman has said that the legalization of [[marijuana]] is not what any law enforcement person would suggest for any reason and that "this is the worst idea [she has] ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meg Whitman to speak in Seal Beach|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/03/16/13041/meg-whitman-speak-seal-beach/|date=March 16, 2010|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
Whitman does not support the proposed and partially voter-funded [[California High-Speed Rail]] project. In a letter to the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2010/07/09/2878527/the-buzz-atherton-resident-meg.html |title=The Buzz: Atherton resident Meg Whitman not too keen on bullet train |work=Sacramento Bee |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719210211/http://www.sacbee.com/2010/07/09/2878527/the-buzz-atherton-resident-meg.html |archivedate=July 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman's spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said, "Meg believes the state cannot afford the costs associated with high-speed rail due to our current fiscal crisis." Her opponent Jerry Brown is in favor of the project.

Whitman has made monetary donations to various candidates and [[political action committee]]s (PAC). While these have gone to both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the donations are weighted to Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/ceo_political_donations/Meg_Whitman.php|title=Meg Whitman at|publisher=Newsmeat.com|date=May 19, 2010|accessdate=May 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205142144/http://newsmeat.com/ceo_political_donations/Meg_Whitman.php|archivedate=February 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Whitman has contributed to a few Democrats, including Senator [[Barbara Boxer]]; donating $4,000 to her campaign and serving on the "Friends of Boxer" committee in 2004, she donated more than $225,000 during the same period to Republicans, eBay's PAC and to Americans for a Republican Majority, the PAC of former [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Tom DeLay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=David|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/62382/meg-whitmans-donations-barbara-boxer-tom-delay|title=Washingtonindependent.com|publisher=Washingtonindependent.com|accessdate=May 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525004150/http://washingtonindependent.com/62382/meg-whitmans-donations-barbara-boxer-tom-delay|archivedate=May 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marinucci|first=Carla|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=48814#ixzz0Wx4GvMLs|title='&amp;#39;San Francisco Chronicle'&amp;#39;|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 2, 2009|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Whitman was the Commencement speaker for [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/april/whitman-commencement-speaker.html|title=Meg Whitman Named Commencement Speaker - News - Carnegie Mellon University|last=University|first=Carnegie Mellon|date=2017-04-13|work=|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen also helps maintain high [[Respiration rate|respiration rates]] of fresh produce, which contribute to shortened shelf life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frying of food : oxidation, nutrient and non-nutrient antioxidants, biologically active compounds and high temperatures|last=Boskou, D., Elmadfa, I.|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=9781439806821|edition=2nd|location=Boca Raton|pages=|oclc=466361000}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a microbiological aspect, oxygen encourages the growth of [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] [[Decomposition|spoilage]] [[Microorganism|microorganisms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, the reduction of oxygen and its replacement with other gases can reduce or delay oxidation reactions and microbiological spoilage. Oxygen scavengers may also be used to reduce browning due to lipid oxidation by halting the auto-oxidative chemical process.

The modification process generally lowers the amount of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the headspace of the package. Oxygen can be replaced with [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a comparatively inert gas, or [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A stable atmosphere of gases inside the packaging can be achieved using active techniques, such as gas flushing and compensated vacuum, or passively by designing “breathable” films.

== History ==
The first recorded beneficial effects of using modified atmosphere date back to 1821. Jacques Etienne Berard, a professor at the School of Pharmacy in Montpellier, France, reported delayed ripening of fruit and increased shelf life in low-oxygen storage conditions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirtil, E and Oztop, M.H.|first=|date=2016|title=Controlled and modified atmosphere packaging|url=|journal=Reference Module in Food Science|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-100596-5.03376-X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Controlled atmosphere|Controlled Atmosphere]] Storage (CAS) was used from the 1930's when ships transporting fresh apples and pears had high levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in their holding rooms in order to increase the shelf life of the product.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and applications of modified atmosphere packaging of foods|last=Blakistone|first=B.A.|publisher=Blackie Academic &amp; Professional|year=1998|isbn=0751403601|edition=2nd|location=London|pages=1-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s MA packages reached the stores when bacon and fish were sold in retail packs in Mexico. Since then development has been continuous and interest in MAP has grown due to consumer demand.

== Theory ==
Atmosphere within the package can be modified passively or actively.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Packaging Principles and Practice (2nd ed)|last=Robertson|first=G.L.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=0-8493-3775-5|location=Florida|pages=313-330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In passive modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), the high concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and low O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the package is achieved over time as a result of respiration of the product and gas transmission rates of the packaging film. This method is commonly used for fresh respiring fruits and vegetables. Reducing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; slows down respiration rate, conserves stored energy, and therefore extended shelf life.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modified atmosphere packaging for fresh-cut fruits and vegetables|last=Brody, A.L., Zhuang, H.|first=Han, J.H|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8138-1274-8|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=57-67}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, active MA involves the use of active systems such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scavengers or emitters, moisture absorbers, ethylene scavengers, ethanol emitters and gas flushing in the packaging film or container to modify the atmosphere within the package.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; 

The mixture of gases selected for a MAP package depends on the type of product, the packaging materials and the storage temperature. The atmosphere in an MA package consists mainly of adjusted amounts of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food processing technology: principles and practice (4th ed)|last=Fellows, P.J|first=|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-0-08-101907-8|location=Duxford, UK|pages=992-1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  promotes delay in deteriorative reactions in foods such as [[Lipid peroxidation|lipid oxidation]], [[Food browning|browning reactions]] and growth of spoilage organisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Low O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels of 3-5% are used to slow down respiration rate in fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the case of red meat, however, high levels of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (∼80%) are used to reduce oxidation of [[myoglobin]] and maintain an attractive bright red color of the meat.&lt;ref name=":622"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Djenane, D.|first=Roncales, P.|date=2018|title=Carbon monoxide in meat and fish packaging: advantages and limits|url=|journal=Foods|volume=7|pages=|via=DOI:  10.3390/foods7020012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meat color enhancement is not required for pork, poultry and cooked meats; therefore, a higher concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to extend the shelf life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Levels higher than 10% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are phytotoxic for fruit and vegetables, so CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is maintained below this level. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is mostly used as a filler gas to prevent pack collapse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition, it is also used to prevent oxidative rancidity in packaged products such as snack foods by displacing atmospheric air, especially oxygen, therefore extending shelf life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The use of noble gases such as [[Helium]] (He), [[Argon]] (Ar) and [[Xenon]] (Xe) to replace N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the balancing gas in MAP can also be used to preserve and extend the shelf life of fresh and minimally processed fruits and vegetables. Their beneficial effects are due to their higher solubility and diffusivity in water, making them more effective in displacing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from cellular sites and enzymatic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghidelli, C|first=Perez-Gago, M.B|date=2018|title=Recent advances in modified atmosphere packaging and edible coatings to maintain quality of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables.|url=|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=58|pages=662-679|via=DOI:10.1080/10408398.2016.1211087}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There has been a debate regarding the use of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) in the packaging of red meat due to its possible toxic effect on packaging workers.&lt;ref name=":622" /&gt; Its use results in a more stable red color of carboxymyoglobin in meat, which leads to another concern that it can mask evidence of spoilage in the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":622" /&gt;

== Effect on microorganisms ==
Low O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations in packages are effective in limiting the growth of Gram negative bacteria, molds and aerobic microorganisms, such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp. High O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combined with high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could have bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects by suppression of [[Aerobic organism|aerobes]] by high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobes]] by high O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the ability to penetrate bacterial membrane and affect intracellular pH. Therefore, lag phase and generation time of spoilage microorganisms are increased resulting in shelf life extension of refrigerated foods.&lt;ref name=":622" /&gt; Since the growth of spoilage microorganisms are suppressed by MAP, the ability of the pathogens to grow is potentially increased. Microorganisms that can survive under low oxygen environment such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Aeromonas hydrophila|Aeromonas hydophila]]'' are of major concern for MA packaged products.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Products may appear [[Organoleptic|organoleptically]] acceptable  due to the delayed growth of the spoilage microorganisms but might contain harmful [[Pathogen|pathogens]].&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; This risk can be minimized by use of additional hurdles such as temperature control (maintain temperature below 3 degrees C), lowering water activity (less than 0.92), reducing pH (below 4.5) or addition or preservatives such as nitrite to delay metabolic activity and growth of pathogens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Packaging materials ==
Flexible films are commonly used for products such as fresh produce, meats, fish and bread seeing as they provide suitable permeability for gases and water vapor to reach the desired atmosphere. Pre-formed trays are formed and sent to the food packaging facility where they are filled. The package headspace then undergoes modification and sealing. Pre-formed trays are usually more flexible and allow for a broader range of sizes as opposed to thermoformed packaging materials as different tray sizes and colors can be handled without the risk of damaging the package.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781444392180.ch10|title=Food and Beverage Packaging Technology|last=Mullan|first=Michael|last2=McDowell|first2=Derek|date=2011-03-17|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781444392180|location=Oxford, UK|pages=263–294|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444392180.ch10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermoformed packaging however is received in the food packaging facility as a roll of sheets. Each sheet is subjected to heat and pressure, and is formed at the packaging station. Following the forming, the package is filled with the product, and then sealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=F|date=2003-12-20|title=Modelling of infrared heating of thermoplastic sheet used in thermoforming process|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0924013603002917|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=143-144|pages=225–231|doi=10.1016/s0924-0136(03)00291-7|issn=0924-0136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages that thermoformed packaging materials have over pre-formed trays are mainly cost-related: thermoformed packaging uses 30% to 50% less material, and they are transported as rolls of material. This will amount in significant reduction of manufacturing and transportation costs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When selecting packaging films for MAP of fruits and vegetables the main characteristics to consider are gas permeability, water vapour transmission rate, mechanical properties, transparency, type of package and sealing reliability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Traditionally used packaging films like [[LDPE]] (low-density polyethylene), [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] (polyvinyl chloride), [[Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate|EVA]] (ethylene-vinyl acetate) and OPP (oriented [[polypropylene]]) are not permeable enough for highly respiring products like fresh-cut produce, mushrooms and broccoli. As fruits and vegetables are respiring products, there is a need to transmit gases through the film. Films designed with these properties are called [[permeable film]]s. Other films, called barrier films, are designed to prevent the exchange of gases and are mainly used with non-respiring products like meat and fish.

MAP films developed to control the humidity level as well as the gas composition in the sealed package are beneficial for the prolonged storage of fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs that are sensitive to moisture. These films are commonly referred to as [[modified atmosphere/modified humidity packaging]] (MA/MH)films.

== Equipment ==
In using form-fill-seal packaging machines, the main function is to place the product in a flexible pouch suitable for the desired characteristics of the final product. These pouches can either be pre-formed or thermoformed. The food is introduced into the pouch, the composition of the headspace atmosphere is changed within the package; it is then heat sealed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These types of machines are typically called pillow-wrap, which horizontally or vertically form, fill and seal the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Form-fill-seal packaging machines are usually used for large scale operations.

In contrast, chamber machines are used for batch processes. A filled pre-formed wrap is filled with the product and introduced into a cavity. The cavity is closed and vacuum is then pulled on the chamber and the modified atmosphere is inserted as desired. Sealing of the package is done through heated sealing bars, and the product is then removed. This batch process is labor intensive and thus requires a longer period of time; however, it is relatively cheaper than packaging machines which are automated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, snorkel machines are used to modify the atmosphere within a package after the food has been filled. The product is placed in the packaging material and positioned into the machine without the need of a chamber. A nozzle, which is the snorkel, is then inserted into the packaging material. It pulls a vacuum and then flushes the modified atmosphere into the package. The nozzle is removed and the package is heat sealed. This method is suitable for bulk and large operations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Products ==
Many products such as red meat, seafood, minimally processed fruits and vegetables, salads, pasta, cheese, bakery goods, poultry, cooked and cured meats, ready meals and dried foods are packaged under MA.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A summary of optimal gas mixtures for MA products are shown in Table 1.

'''Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems''' ('''NAV-[[carbon dioxide|CO2]] System''') were developed in Japan in the 1990s to sanitize hospitals and ambulances.
==Application==
The NAV-CO2 uses CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbon dioxide]]) as a propellant to dispense a 58% [[isopropyl alcohol]] solution in a heated stream. The procedure uses alcohol in an [[aerosol|atomized vapor]], and reaches nooks, crannies, and crevices that may be beyond the reach of other [[disinfectant|disinfecting]] methods.

==Safety==
The use of carbon dioxide as a propellant serves to displace ambient oxygen (one of the elements needed to support combustion) and eliminates the risk of explosion. The carbon dioxide and atomized alcohol evaporate at room temperature leaving no residue.

[[File:Electricaire Economaster 2400 Electric Oil Heater.jpg|thumb|right|The Electricaire Economaster 2400 electric oil heater]]
An '''oil heater''', also known as an '''oil-filled heater''', '''oil-filled radiator''', or '''column heater''', is a common form of [[convector heater|convection heater]] used in domestic [[heating]]. Although filled with [[oil]], it is [[electric heating|electrically heated]] and does not involve burning any oil [[fuel]]; the oil is used as a [[heat reservoir]] (buffer), not as a fuel.

==How it works==
Oil heaters consist of metal columns with cavities, inside which a heat transfer oil flows freely around the heater. A [[heating element]] at the base of the heater heats up the oil, which then flows around the cavities of the heater by [[convection]]. The oil has a relatively high [[specific heat capacity]] and high [[boiling point]]. The high specific heat capacity allows the oil to effectively transfer [[thermal energy]] from the heating element, while the oil's high boiling point allows it to remain in the [[liquid phase]] for the purpose of heating, so that the heater does not have to be a [[pressure vessel|high pressure vessel]].

The heating element heats the oil, which transfers heat to the metal wall through convection, through the walls via conduction, then to the surroundings via air convection and thermal radiation. The columns of oil heaters are typically constructed as thin fins, such that the surface area of the metal columns is large relative to the amount of oil and element which provides the heat. A large surface area allows more air to be in contact with the heater at any point in time, allowing for the heat to be transferred more effectively, which results in a surface temperature which is safe enough to touch. The relatively large specific heat capacity of the oil and metal parts means this type of heater takes a few minutes to heat up and cool down, providing a short-term thermal store.

==Efficiency==
Although oil heaters are more expensive to run and provide far less spatial heating than [[gas heater]]s, they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas heaters, especially when [[flue|unflued]], are not suitable for bedroom use - gas heaters cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced [[oxygen]], and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered heaters, such as oil heaters and [[fan heater]]s, as the only alternative.

Several efficiency metrics can be measured in regard to heaters, such as the efficiency of heating a room with a given amount of power, and the efficiency of the [[electrical generator]] which powers the heater and power loss from transporting the electricity over power lines. Measures may also consider how well a heater keeps the temperature of a space above a certain point. Such a measure would find inefficiencies in heating an already warm room. Many heaters (the majority of available models) are equipped with a [[thermostat]] to prevent this inefficient heating, which in turn reduces running costs. This feature was much more common in oil heaters than in the cheaper fan heaters until recently; thus many older oil heaters will be cheaper and more efficient to run than their contemporary fan heaters that lack the thermostat.

Typical oil heaters range in power consumption/output from 300 to 2400 [[watt]]s, and their length and number of columns is roughly proportional to their power rating. A 2400 watt oil heater is usually approximately 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length.

All [[electric heating|electric resistance]] heaters are 100% efficient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric resistance heating|url=https://energy.gov/energysaver/electric-resistance-heating|website=ENERGY.GOV|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with operating costs determined by their wattage and the length of operating time.&lt;ref name=nz&gt;http://www.energywise.govt.nz/products-and-appliances/heating/electric&lt;/ref&gt; A 500 watt heater will take twice as long to reach the same thermostat setting as a 1000 watt unit; the total consumption of electricity is the same for both.

By contrast, an electrical [[heat pump]] used for home heating typically has an efficiency well above 100%, expressed as its [[coefficient of performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Pumps|url=https://www.energywise.govt.nz/at-home/heating-and-cooling/types-of-heater/heat-pumps/|website=EECA|publisher=EECA|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and features==
The primary risk of oil heaters is that of fire and burns. In both regards they are generally more dangerous than [[hydronics]] and [[air conditioning]], but less dangerous than electric fan heaters or [[Electric heating#Radiant heaters|bar radiators]]; this is due to the surface temperature of each type of heater.

Most modern small heaters have some form of tilt sensor to cut power if they are knocked over or placed on an unstable surface. This can reduce the risk of fire if a heater is knocked over.

From a safety standpoint, it is best to avoid having any object within three feet of an oil heater. Using an oil heater to dry clothes is not recommended by any modern manufacturer. There is a substantial fire risk if flammable materials such as clothing or bedding are left near a heater, especially synthetic fabrics such as [[polyester]], which can melt or burn. Even though the surface temperature of the heater in normal operation is quite low, the extra thermal resistance of the clothing on the heater can cause its surface temperature to rise to the material's [[autoignition temperature]]. It should also be noted that some oil heaters contain strong warnings to avoid operation in damp areas (such as bathrooms or laundry rooms) because the moisture and humidity can damage components of the heater itself.

Oil heaters have been known to explode when their thermal fuses fail to shut them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil heater explodes, trial blown|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/551553|publisher=The Southland Times, New Zealand|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause fire, thick black smoke, unpleasant odors, oil on walls and other surfaces, and disfiguring scalding.

Some companies offer oil heaters with a fan, to increase the air flow over the heater. Since it is constantly bringing the colder air from the room into contact with the heater, that can improve the rate of heat flow from the heater into the room. The rate of heat flow from the heater into the air in contact with it is higher when there is a greater temperature difference between the heater and the air.

'''Paul Ambrose Oliver''' (July 18, 1831 &amp;ndash; May 17, 1912) was an [[United States|American]] [[explosive]]s inventor, [[American Civil War]] [[Union Army]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] and staff officer who was appointed to the [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] grade of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient.&lt;ref name="Eicher409"&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J.

Before the Civil War, he worked as a shipping merchant.&lt;ref name="Eicher409"/&gt;

== History ==
In 2001, the Stockholm chapter of the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation ({{lang-sv|SUF, Syndikalistiska Ungdomsförbundet}}) launched the campaign Planka.nu (literally, ''fare-dodge.now'') as a reaction to a rise in ticket prices by the [[Stockholm County Council]].&lt;ref name="planka-om"/&gt; The domain name [[.nu]], which belongs to the
{{convert|260|km²|adj=on}} island of [[Niue]] but is sold primarily to foreigners, was chosen because it means "now" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The standard [[top level domain]] for Sweden is [[.se]].
 
With growing membership and interest, the campaign was detached from the SUF to form an independent organization. Local organizations have since started up in [[Gothenburg]] in 2003, [[Östergötland]] in 2005 and [[Skåne]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=planka-om /&gt; A sister organization, ''pumm.it'' has been created in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="pummit"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, Planka.nu released [http://freepublictransports.com Freepublictransports.com], a global forum for the free public transport movement.  

Ticket fares in Stockholm have increased dramatically over time. By one measure&amp;mdash;single ticket price for a {{convert|10|km|adj=on}} journey&amp;mdash;Stockholm has the most expensive-to-use public transport in the world, as of March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14396066 |title=A fare price?| publisher=[[The Economist]]| date=September 24, 2009| accessdate=2009-09-24| quote=In Stockholm it costs $4.88 for a single journey of 10km on public transport, the highest cost in a study of 73 cities by [[UBS AG|UBS]], a Swiss bank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{see also|Free public transport#Criticism}}
Planka.nu and its organizers have seen substantial criticism, primarily by politicians and transportation companies in each city. The network has been reported to the police for [[incitement]] by [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]] (SL),&lt;ref name="dn-hermele"&gt;{{cite web

| quote       = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics believe that [[fare evasion]] leads to reduced funds and higher costs for public transport, which must be offset by higher prices for those who do pay their fares.&lt;ref name=gp-nystrom /&gt;&lt;ref name="dn-palmgren"&gt;{{citation

In [[cryptography]], the '''Polybius square''', also known as the '''Polybius checkerboard''', is a device invented by the Ancient Greeks Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and perfected by the [[Ancient Greek]] [[historian]] and scholar [[Polybius]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/10*.html#45.6 Hist. X.45.6&amp;nbsp;ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; for [[transposition cipher#Fractionation|fractionating]] [[plaintext]] characters so that they can be represented by a smaller set of symbols.

==Basic form==
The original square used the [[Greek alphabet]], but it can be used with any other alphabet. In fact, it has also been used with Japanese [[hiragana]] (see [[cryptography in Japan]]). With the modern [[English alphabet]], this is the typical form:

Each letter is then represented by its coordinates in the grid. For example, "BAT" becomes "12 11 44". Because 26 characters do not quite fit in a square, it is rounded down to the next lowest square number by combining two letters (usually C and K or sometimes I and J). (Polybius had no such problem because the Greek alphabet has 24 letters.) Alternatively, the ten digits could be added, and 36 characters would be put into a 6 &amp;times; 6 grid.

Such a larger grid might also be used for the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] (the most common variant has 33 letters, but some have fewer and some have up to 37).

==Telegraphy and steganography ==
Polybius did not originally conceive of his device as a cipher so much as an aid to [[telegraphy]]; he suggested the symbols could be signalled by holding up pairs of sets of [[torch]]es. It has also been used, in the form of the "[[knock code]]" to signal messages between cells in [[prison]]s by tapping the numbers on pipes or walls. 
It is said to have been used by [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]] prisoners of the [[Russia]]n [[Czar]]s and also by [[US]] [[prisoners of war]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

[[Arthur Koestler]] describes the code being used by political prisoners of [[Stalin]] in the 1930s in his anti-totalitarian novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''. (Koestler had been a prisoner-of-war during the [[Spanish Civil War]].) 
Indeed, it can be signalled in many simple ways (flashing lamps, blasts of sound, [[jungle drums|drums]], [[smoke signal]]s) and is much easier to learn than more sophisticated codes like the [[Morse code]]. However, it is also somewhat less efficient than more complex codes.

The simple representation also lends itself to [[steganography]]. The figures from one to five can be indicated by [[knot]]s in a string, stitches on a quilt, contiguous letters before a wider space or many other ways.

==Cryptography==
The Polybius cipher can be used with a [[Keyword cipher|keyword]] like the [[Playfair cipher]]. By itself the Polybius square is not terribly secure, even if used with a [[substitution cipher|mixed alphabet]]. The pairs of digits, taken together, just form a simple substitution in which the symbols happen to be pairs of digits. In this sense it is just another encoding which can be cracked with simple frequency analysis.
However a Polybius square offers the possibility of [[transposition cipher#Fractionation|fractionation]], leading toward [[Claude E. Shannon]]'s [[confusion and diffusion]]. As such, it is a useful component in several [[cipher]]s such as the [[ADFGVX cipher]], the [[Nihilist cipher]], and the [[bifid cipher]].

[[Image:Potluck06.jpg|thumb|300px|An assortment of different dishes at a church potluck]]
A '''potluck''' is a communal gathering where each guest or group contributes a different, often homemade [[dish of food]] to be shared.

Other names for a "potluck" include: potluck dinner, spread, Jacob's join,&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric and Paul Beale. ''A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, 8th ed.'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bachelor |first=Lisa |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |title=Surviving on a student budget |date=October 4, 2002 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/oct/04/studentfinance.creditanddebt2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob's supper, faith supper, covered-dish-supper, dish party, bring-and-share, shared lunch, pitch-in, bring-a-plate, dish-to-pass, fuddle, fellowship meal, and carry-in.

== Etymology ==
While there exists some disagreement as to its origin, two principal theories exist: the combination of the English "pot" and "luck" or the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American indigenous]] [[communal meal]] ''[[potlatch]]''.

The word ''pot-luck'' appears in the [[16th century England|16th century English]] work of [[Thomas Nashe]], and used to mean "food provided for an unexpected or uninvited guest, the luck of the pot." {{Cite quote|date=September 2013}} The modern execution of a "communal meal, where guests bring their own food," most likely  originated in the 1930s during the Depression &lt;ref&gt;Flora, Martin. [http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1933/01/27/page/14/article/potluck-meal-innovation-due-to-depression "Potluck Meal Innovation Due to Depression: Guests Chip in With Part of Dinner"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Chicago, 27 January 1933. Retrieved on 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The alternative origin of the word is associated with a tradition common to the [[Tlingit]] and other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, called a potlatch, and is considered by opponents of this theory to be an [[eggcorn]] or [[malapropism]].

== Description ==
Potluck dinners are events where the attendees bring a dish to a meal. Potluck dinners are often organized by religious or [[community]] groups, since they simplify the meal planning and distribute the costs among the participants. Smaller, more informal get-togethers with distributed food preparation may also be called potlucks. The only traditional rule is that each dish be large enough to be shared among a good portion (but not necessarily all) of the anticipated guests. In some cases each participant agrees ahead of time to bring a single course, and the result is a multi-course meal. Guests may bring in any form of food, ranging from the main course to desserts. In the United States, potlucks are associated with [[crockpot]] dishes, [[casserole]]s (often called [[hot dish]]es in the upper Midwest), dessert bars, and [[jello salad]]s. Traditionally, potlucks were a simple combination of dishes brought together by event attendees without a general theme. Recent times have seen the growth of themed dinners for parties or special occasions.

The '''RCA tape cartridge''' (also known as the ''Magazine Loading Cartridge'') is a [[magnetic tape]] audio format that was designed to offer [[stereo]] quarter-inch [[reel-to-reel tape]] recording quality in a convenient format for the consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richardhess.com/notes/formats/magnetic-media/magnetic-tapes/analog-audio/025-cartridges/ |title=Restoration Tips &amp; Notes » 0.25" cartridges |publisher=Richardhess.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in 1958, following four years of development. This timing coincided with the launch of the [[Stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] [[Gramophone record|phonograph record]]. It was introduced to the market by RCA in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumofmagneticsoundrecording.org/images/R2R/vinAd59RCA2.jpg RCA Victor Announces Major Break-Through in Recorded Sound]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of the RCA tape cartridge over reel-to-reel machines is convenience.&lt;ref name="pm-9-1960"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 Stereo Goes Back On Tape] Popular Mechanics, September 1960, P. 205&lt;/ref&gt; The user is not required to handle unruly tape ends and thread the tape through the machine before use, making the medium of magnetic tape more friendly to casual users. In addition, since the cartridge carries both supply and take-up reels, the cartridge does not have to be rewound before the tape is removed from the machine and stored. Because of these conveniences, the RCA tape cartridge system did see some success in schools, particularly in student language learning labs.

The same design concept would later be used in the more successful [[Compact Cassette]], introduced by [[Philips]] in 1962. 
Similar to the Compact Cassette, the RCA cartridges are reversible so that either side can be played. An auto-reverse mechanism in some models allows the tape to run continuously. Equal to [[8-track tape]] and [[Stereo-Pak]], the tape runs at a standard speed of 3.75 [[inches per second]] (IPS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsoletemedia.org/rca-sound-tape-cartridge/ RCA Sound Tape Cartridge (1958 – 1964)], Museum Of Obsolete Media, retrieved 22 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This is double the speed of the Compact Cassette and half of the top speed of consumer reel-to-reel tape recorders, which usually offer both 3.75 IPS and 7.5  IPS speeds. Such consumer reel-to-reel machines are capable of superior audio performance, but only at the faster speed.

The RCA tape cartridge format offers four discrete audio tracks that provide a typical playtime of 30 minutes of stereo sound per side, or double that for [[Monaural|monophonic]] sound. Some models can also play and record at 1.875 IPS, doubling playing time with a significant reduction in sound quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vintagecassettes.com/_history/history.htm Cartridges and Cassettes], Vintage Cassettes, retrieved 22 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This speed was of too low quality for music on these machines, but was acceptable for voice recording.

With two interleaved stereo pairs, the track format and speed of the RCA tape cartridge is the same as that of consumer reel-to-reel stereo tape recorders run at 3.75 IPS. It is possible to dismantle the cartridge, spool the tape onto an open reel, and play it on such a machine. In fact, RCA offered an adapter for their Sound Tape Cartridge machines to enable them to both play back and record traditional reels of tape up to 5 inches in reel diameter.

Unlike the Compact Cassette, the RCA tape cartridge incorporates a brake to prevent the tape hubs from moving when the cartridge is not in a player. Small slot windows extend from the tape hubs toward the outside of the cartridge so that the amount of tape visible on each spool can be seen.

Despite its convenience the RCA tape cartridge was not much of a success. RCA was slow to produce machines for the home market. They were also slow to license prerecorded music tapes for home playback. Cost was also an issue, with a single cartridge costing US$4.50 in 1960 (&lt;span&gt;${{Inflation|US|4.50|1960}}&lt;/span&gt; with inflation today) compared to a 1,200 foot (365 m) reel of tape, which cost $3.50  (&lt;span&gt;${{Inflation|US|3.50|1960}}&lt;/span&gt; today).&lt;ref name="pm-9-1960" /&gt; The format disappeared from retail stores by 1964.

The physical tape width and speed of the tape and even the size of the RCA tape cartridge is similar to, though incompatible with, Sony's [[Elcaset]] system, introduced in 1976. That system also failed to achieve much market acceptance and was soon withdrawn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">{{Further|Blowout (well drilling)|}} Relief wells are used both in the natural gas and [[petroleum industry]] and in flood control.

In the natural gas and petroleum industry, a '''relief well''' is drilled to intersect an [[oil well|oil or gas well]] that has experienced a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]. Specialized liquid, such as heavy (dense) [[drilling fluid|drilling mud]] followed by [[cement]], can then be pumped down the relief well in order to stop the flow from the reservoir in the damaged well.

In flood control, a different type of relief well is used adjacent to earthen [[levee]]s to relieve the pressure on the lake or river side of the levee and thus to prevent the collapse of the levee. The greater flow of water in the water source, typically during a flood, creates a pressure gradient such that more water infiltrates the soil of the levee. Water may then flow through the soil towards the dry side of the levee, resulting in [[sand boil]], [[liquefaction]] of the soil, and ultimately destruction of the levee. Relief wells act like valves to relieve the water pressure and allow excess water to be diverted safely, for example, to a canal. Relief wells can prevent sand boils from occurring by relieving the water pressure as described.

The first use of a relief well was in [[Texas]] in the mid-1930s when one was drilled to pump water into an oil well that had cratered and caught on fire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LeADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JJlxTqniIc_AtgfAoMD-CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Wild Oil Well Tamed by Scientific Trick" ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1934]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3911">The Nuclear Fuel Factory (FCN){{coord|22.504|S|44.646|W|}} is located near [[Resende, Rio de Janeiro|Resende]], [[state of Rio de Janeiro]], comprising three units, and has a production capacity of 280 tons of [[uranium]] per year. At present, FCN was modernized and produces at the Components and Assembly Unit the fuel rods and fuel elements needed for Brazilian [[nuclear reactors]]. The Reconversion and Pellets Production Unit is operating since 1999 with a capacity of 160 tons of UO2 pellets/year. The UO2 reconversion line uses the AUC process. The Nuclear Fuel Factory also produces other fuel element components, such as top and bottom nozzles, spacer grids and end plugs for export demands. Previously, [[Brazil]] supplied the uranium, which is transported to [[Canada]] where it’s converted into [[Uranium hexafluoride|hexafluoride gas]], and then to the [[United Kingdom]] for enrichment before it returns to Brazil for fabrication into fuel elements.

The unit has an in-house nuclear safety program and an external one, for environmental monitoring. A nuclear accounting system, internally implemented, required by the [[National Nuclear Energy Commission|Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission]] (CNEN) and supervised by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]] continuously performs a balance of the material in processing with a precision reaching tenths of milligrams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inb.gov.br/resendeElemento.asp Sobre a INB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a seventh cascade of centrifuges was inaugurated, increasing enrichment capacity by 25%. This gives the plant the capacity to produce about 50% of the annual fuel requirements of [[Angra Nuclear Power Plant]] unit&amp;nbsp;1. The new cascade is the first part of a ten cascade expansion plan.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180831&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Brazil-increases-uranium-enrichment-capacity |title=Brazil increases uranium enrichment capacity |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=31 August 2018 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IAEA Inspections==

By late 2003 the [[International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]] was negotiating with the Brazilian Government to ensure that the new uranium enrichment facility, due to begin operating in 2005, was properly safeguarded.

In April 2004 the Brazilian Government denied access for the [[IAEA]] inspectors to the uranium enrichment facility being built in Resende.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/04/04/brazil.nuclear/index.html CNN.com - Sources: Brazil blocks nuclear inspectors - Apr 4, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[plant]], scheduled to begin operation in October 2004, remains subject to [[IAEA]] inspections aimed at making sure it is not used for producing weapons-grade material. In February and March 2004 Brazil refused to let [[IAEA]] inspectors see equipment in the plant, citing a need to protect proprietary information. The IAEA had dispatched inspectors to [[Resende, Rio de Janeiro|Resende]] who found significant portions of the facility and its contents shielded from view. Walls had been built and coverings are draped over equipment.

By November 2004 the [[IAEA]] was able to reach an agreement in principle with the Brazilian government on a safeguards approach to verify the enrichment facilities in [[Brazil]], at the [[Resende, Rio de Janeiro|Resende]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asp.usatoday.com/community/utils/idmap/12538030.story USATODAY.com - Diplomats: IAEA, Brazil reach agreement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach would enable the IAEA to do credible inspections but at the same time take care of Brazil's need to protect certain commercial sensitivity inside the facility.

Roborior is roughly the size of a watermelon and can produce different hues of color ranging from blue, purple, and orange. The Roborior is also equipped with a digital video camera that can stream live video directly to the owner's cell phone if it detects an intruder. The Roborior can be controlled remotely with a hand set, much like a [[Remote control vehicle]], as well. It was introduced in Japan in late 2005 and was priced at 280,000 [[Japanese yen]]. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of robot and interior.

Network '''routing in a cellular network''' deals with the challenges of traditional [[telephony]] such as switching and call setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsp/article.php/3607381/Networking-101-Understanding-Routing.htm | title=Networking and Understanding Routing | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[cellular network]] routing issues in different cells can be attributed to the multiple access methods used for transmission. The location of each mobile phone must be known to reuse a given band of frequencies in different cells and forms [[space-division multiple access]] (SDMA).

==Networks==
[[FDMA]] is one of the multiple access methods used in cellular networks. 50&amp;nbsp;MHz blocks of communication channel are assigned, which lie in radio frequency range and contain an equal number of uplinks (terminal to base station) and downlinks (base station to terminal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenetworkencyclopedia.com/entry/frequency-division-multiple-access-fdma/ | title=Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and cellular phone technology | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more bidirectional channels are carried by 10-90 band pairs. The digital networks additionally make use of either [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] or [[Time-division multiple access|TDMA]] methods.

===Handover and roaming===
A special service called [[mobility management]] provides this application. Terminals (handsets) can move from one place to another during the call and therefore requires the call to be [[Handover|handed over]] from one channel to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://itsec.rwth-aachen.de/publications/dis_ulrike_meyer.pdf | title=Secure Roaming and Handover Procedures in Wireless Access Net works | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft handover uses the same frequency channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://morse.colorado.edu/~tlen5510/text/classwebch2.html | title=Cellular systems and frequency reuse | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same terminals can operate in the same area covered by different service providers, which is known as [[roaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ustudy.in/node/7179 | title=Roaming and Handoff | accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Whiddy Spim.jpeg|thumb|Single point mooring at [[Whiddy Island]], Ireland]]
[[Image:SBM01.jpg|thumb|Single-point mooring facility off [[Puthuvype]], [[Kochi]], [[India]]]]
[[Image:SBM02.jpg|thumb]]
[[Image:SBM03.jpg|thumb]]

A '''Single buoy mooring''' ('''SrM''') (also known as '''single-point mooring''' or '''SPM''') is a loading [[buoy]] anchored offshore, that serves as a mooring point and interconnect for [[tanker (ship)|tankers]] loading or offloading gas or liquid products. SPMs are the link between geostatic subsea manifold connections and weathervaning tankers. They are capable of handling any tonnage ship, even [[very large crude carrier]]s (VLCC) where no alternative facility is available.

In shallow water SPMs are used to load and unload crude oil and refined products from inshore and offshore oilfields or refineries, usually through some form of storage system. These buoys are usually suitable for use by all types of oil tanker. In deep water oil fields, SPMs are usually used to load crude oil direct from the production platforms, where there are economic reasons not to run a pipeline to the shore. These moorings usually supply to dedicated tankers which can moor without assistance.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt;

Several types of single point mooring are in use.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bevan, John|title=The Professional Divers's Handbook|edition=second|year=2005|publisher=Submex Ltd|location=5 Nepean Close, Alverstoke, GOSPORT, Hampshire PO12 2BH |language=English|isbn= 978-0950824260|page=41|chapter=Section 1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Configurations==
[[File:Thistle SALM.png|thumb|upright=0.3|left|Single anchor leg mooring]]
A commonly used configuration is the catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), which can be capable of handling very large crude carriers. This configuration uses six or eight heavy anchor chains placed radially around the buoy, of a tonnage to suit the designed load, each about {{convert|350|m|ft}} long, and attached to an anchor or pile to provide the required holding power. The anchor chains are pre-tensioned to ensure that the buoy is held in position above the PLEM. As the load from the tanker is applied, the heavy chains on the far side straighten and lift off the seabed to apply the balancing load. Under full design load there is still some {{convert|27|m|ft}} of chain lying on the bottom. The flexible hose riser may be in one of three basic configurations, all designed to accommodate tidal depth variation and lateral displacement due to mooring loads. In all cases the hose curvature changes to accommodate lateral and vertical movement of the buoy, and the hoses are supported at near neutral buoyancy by floats along the length. These are:&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt;
*Chinese lantern, in which two to four mirror symmetrical hoses connect the PLEM with the buoy, with the convexity of the curve facing radially outwards.
*Lazy-S, in which the riser hose leaves the PLEM at a steep angle, then flattens out before gradually curving upwards to meet the buoy approximately vertically, in a flattened S-curve.
*Steep-S, in which the hose first rises roughly vertically to a submerged float, before making a sharp bend downwards followed by a slow curve through horizontal to a vertical attachment to the buoy.

Less commonly used configurations include:
*Single anchor leg mooring (SALM), which can be used in both shallow and deep water.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt; see [[Thistle SALM]] as an example.
*Vertical anchor leg mooring, which is seldom used.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt;
*Two types of single point mooring tower:
:*Jacket type, which has a jacket piled to the seabed with a turntable on top which carries the mooring gear and pipework&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt;
:*Spring pile type, which has steel pipe risers in the structure&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt;
*Exposed location single buoy mooring (ELSBM). This configuration stores the mooring line and cargo hose on drums when not in use. Suitable for use in rough conditions&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt;
*Articulated loading platform (ALP). Also suited for rough conditions.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 1.10" /&gt;

==Parts==
There are four groups of parts in the total mooring system: the body of the buoy, mooring and anchoring elements, product transfer system and other components.

===Buoy body===
The buoy body may be supported on static legs attached to the seabed, with a rotating part above water level connected to the (off)loading tanker. The two sections are linked by a roller bearing, referred to as the "main bearing". Alternatively the buoy body may be held in place by multiple radiating anchor chains. The moored tanker can freely weather vane around the buoy and find a stable position due to this arrangement.

===Mooring and anchoring parts===
Moorings fix the buoy to the sea bed. Buoy design must account for the behaviour of the buoy given applicable wind, wave and current conditions and tanker tonnages. This determines the optimum mooring arrangement and size of the various mooring leg components. Anchoring points are greatly dependent on local soil condition.&lt;ref name="IALA Guideline 1066" /&gt;

====Mooring components====
*Anchors or piles - To connect the mooring to the seabed&lt;ref name="IALA Guideline 1066" /&gt;
*Sinker or anchor chain joint to buoy (SPM)&lt;ref name="IALA Guideline 1066" /&gt;
*Anchor chain&lt;ref name="IALA Guideline 1066" /&gt;
*Chain stoppers - To connect the chains to the buoy&lt;ref name="IALA Guideline 1066"&gt;IALA Guideline 1066 - The Design of FLoating Aid to Navigation Moorings - May 2009 - Revised June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawser arrangement====
A tanker is moored to a buoy by means of a hawser arrangement. [[Oil Companies International Marine Forum]] (OCIMF) standards are available for mooring systems.

The hawser arrangement usually consist of nylon rope, which is shackled to an integrated mooring uni-joint on the buoy deck. At the tanker end of the hawser, a chafe chain is connected to prevent damage from the tanker fairlead. A load pin can be applied to the mooring uni-joint on the buoy deck to measure hawser loads.

Hawser systems use either one or two ropes depending on the largest tonnage of vessel which would be moored to the buoy. The ropes would either be single-leg or grommet leg type ropes. These are usually connected to an OCIMF chafe chain on the export tanker side (either type A or B depending on the maximum tonnage of the tanker and the mooring loads). This chafe chain would then be held in the chain stopper on board the export tanker.

A basic hawser system would consist of the following (working from the buoy outwards):

Buoy-side shackle and bridle assembly for connection to the padeye on the buoy;
Mooring hawser shackle;
Mooring hawser;
Chafe chain assembly;
Support buoy;
Pick-up / messenger lines;
Marker buoy for retrieval from the water.

Under OCIMF recommendations, the hawser arrangement would normally be purchased as a full assembly from a manufacturer.

===Product transfer system ===
The heart of each buoy is the product transfer system. From a geostatic location, e.g. a [[pipeline end manifold]] (PLEM) located on the seabed, this system transfers products to the offtake tanker.

The basic product transfer system components are:
*Flexible subsea hoses, generally referred to as “risers” 
*Floating hose string(s)
*Marine Breakaway Coupling
*Product swivel, valves and piping

====Risers====
The risers are flexible hoses that connect the subsea piping to the buoy. Configuration of these risers can vary depending on water depth, sea conditions, buoy motions, etc.

====Floating hose string====
Floating hose string(s) connect the buoy to the offloading tanker. The hose string can be equipped with a breakaway coupling to prevent rupture of hoses/hawser and subsequent oil spills.

====Product swivel ====
The product swivel is the connection between the geostatic and the rotating parts of the buoy. The swivel enables an offloading tanker to rotate with respect to the mooring buoy. Product swivels range in size depending on the capacity of attached piping and risers. Product swivels can provide one or several independent paths for fluids, gases, electrical signals or power. Swivels are equipped with a multiple seal arrangement to minimise the possibility of leakage of product into the environment.

===Other components===
Other possible components of SPMs are:
*A boat landing, providing access to the buoy deck, 
*Fendering to protect the buoy, 
*Lifting and handling equipment to aid materials handling, 
*Navigational aids for maritime visibility, and fog horn to keep moving vessel alert.
*An electrical subsystem to enable valve operation and to power navigation aids or other equipment.

A '''stormwater detention vault''' is an underground structure designed to manage excess [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] on a developed site, often in an urban setting.  This type of [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]] may be selected when there is insufficient space on the site to [[infiltration basin|infiltrate]] the runoff or build a surface facility such as a [[detention basin]] or [[retention basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Department of Transportation. Federal Highway Administration|place=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/ultraurb/3fs6.htm |title=Stormwater Best Management Practices in an Ultra-Urban Setting: Selection and Monitoring|work=Fact Sheet – Detention Tanks and Vaults|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detention vaults manage stormwater ''quantity'' flowing to nearby [[surface water]]s. They help prevent [[flood]]ing and can reduce [[erosion#Water|erosion]] in rivers and streams.  They do not provide treatment to improve [[water quality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Atlanta Regional Commission|place=Atlanta, GA|url=http://documents.atlantaregional.com/gastormwater/GSMMVol2.pdf|title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. Section 3.4.3: Underground Detention|date=August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some are attached to a [[media filter]] bank to remove pollutants.

==Design and installation==
Underground stormwater detention allows for high volume storage of runoff in a small footprint area.  The storage vessels can be made from a variety of materials, including corrugated metal [[pipe (material)|pipe]], aluminum, steel, plastic, fiberglass, [[Precast concrete|pre-cast]] or poured-in-place [[concrete]].&lt;ref name="Duluth"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City of Duluth, Minnesota|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/stormwater/toolkit/underground.html|title=Tools for Stormwater Management: Underground Storage|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vault is typically buried under a [[parking lot]] or other open land on the site.  In the latter case, this underground vault may be preferable to a surface [[detention pond]] if other uses are intended for the land (e.g. a pedestrian plaza or park).  In other situations, a vault is used because installing a pond might pose other problems, such as attracting unwanted [[waterfowl]] or other animals.  In some sites, a vault may be installed in the basement of a building, such as a parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/owmitnet/mtb/runoff.pdf|title=Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: On-Site Underground Retention/Detention|date=September 2001|id=EPA-832-F-01-005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnels may be bored to serve as detention vaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wfpl.org/a-sewer-tunnel-and-a-brief-geologic-history-of-louisville/|title=MSD's New Sewer Tunnel Offers A Brief Geologic History Of Louisville|last=Velzer|first=Ryan Van|date=2018-08-15|work=89.3 WFPL News Louisville|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunnels may be cheaper than basins, as they do not require pumps to move the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2018/07/30/louisville-msd-cancels-basin-project-near-cherokee-park/862392002/|title=MSD was digging a huge basin near Jim Porter's but has abandoned the plan|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outlet is generally a restricted-flow drain from the detention vessel, with a weir for containing detritus.&lt;ref name="Duluth"/&gt; Detention vessels delay water's delivery downstream, and possibly creates a later water level peak post-rainfall.  It is important to consider timing of water release and the types of reservoirs feeding a waterway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://documents.atlantaregional.com/gastormwater/GSMMVol1.pdf | title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual | publisher=Atlanta Regional Commission | date=August 2001 | accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">'''Tech mining''' or '''technology mining''' refers to applying [[text mining]] methods to technical documents. For patent analysis purposes, it is named ‘'''patent mining'''’. Porter, as one of the pioneers in technology mining, defined ‘tech mining’ in his book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tech Mining: Exploiting New Technologies for Competitive Advantage|last1=Porter|first1=Alan L.|last2=Cunninghum|first2=Scott W.|date=2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-47567-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: “the application of text mining tools to science and technology information, informed by understanding of technological innovation processes.” Therefore, tech mining has two significant characteristics: 1) using ‘text mining tools’, 2) applying these tools to ‘technology management’. Also, technology mining can be considered as one of [[technology intelligence]] branches.

== Applications ==
Technology mining have many applications including R&amp;D portfolio selection, R&amp;D project initiation, [[new product development]], strategic technology planning, [[technology roadmapping]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Alan L.|date=2005|title=Tech Mining|url=https://www.thevantagepoint.com/resources/articles/CI%20Jan-Feb%2005%20Porter.pdf|journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine|volume=8|pages=30-37|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tech miner should communicate closely with target users what technological issue they have, and how they want to address the issues. The number of published papers and the number of citations in technology mining area illustrates a hyperbolically progress; there is a jump in the number of publications after 2005 and a huge rise in the number of citations after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madani|first=Farshad|date=2015|title=‘Technology Mining’ bibliometrics analysis: applying network analysis and cluster analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-015-1685-4|journal=Scientometrics|volume=105|pages=323–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the devices continue to shrink further into the sub-100&amp;nbsp;nm range following the trend predicted by [[Moore’s law]], the topic of thermal properties and transport in such nanoscale devices becomes increasingly important. Display of great potential by [[nanostructure]]s for [[Thermoelectricity|thermoelectric]] applications also motivates the studies of thermal transport in such devices.&lt;ref name = Ju&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Ju

==The effect of the limited length of structure==
In general two carrier types can contribute to thermal conductivity - [[electrons]] and [[phonons]]. In nanostructures phonons usually dominate and the phonon properties of the structure become of a particular importance for thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=Ju /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hone&gt;{{Cite journal

Unlike bulk materials, nanoscale devices have thermal properties which are complicated by boundary effects due to small size. It has been shown that in some cases phonon-boundary scattering effects dominate the thermal conduction processes, reducing thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=Ju /&gt;&lt;ref name= Li&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermal conductivity of individual silicon nanowires|journal=Applied Physics Letters|year=2003|first=D. |last=Li|author2=Y.

==Nanowires==

===Thermal conductivity measurements===
The first measurement of thermal conductivity in silicon nanowires was published in 2003.&lt;ref name=Li /&gt; Two important features were pointed out: 1) The measured thermal conductivities are significantly lower than that of the bulk Si and, as the wire diameter is decreased, the corresponding thermal conductivity is reduced. 2) As the wire diameter is reduced, the phonon boundary scattering dominates over phonon–phonon [[Umklapp scattering]], which decreases the thermal conductivity with an increase in temperature.

For 56&amp;nbsp;nm and 115&amp;nbsp;nm wires ''k ~ T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' dependence was observed, while for 37&amp;nbsp;nm wire ''k ~ T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' dependence and for 22&amp;nbsp;nm wire ''k ~ T'' dependence were observed. Chen ''et al.'' &lt;ref name = RChen&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermal Conductance of Thin Silicon Nanowires|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2008|first=R|last=Chen|author2=A. Hochbaum |author3=P. Murphy |author4=J. Moore |author5=P. Yang |author6=A. Majumdar |volume=101|pages=105501|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.105501|pmid=18851223|issue=10|bibcode=2008PhRvL.101j5501C}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the one-dimensional cross-over for 20&amp;nbsp;nm Si nanowire occurs around 8K, while the phenomenon was observed for temperature values greater than 20K. Therefore, the reason of such behaviour is not in the confinement experienced by phonons so that three-dimensional structures display two-dimensional or one-dimensional behavior.

===Theoretical models for nanowires===

====Different phonon modes contribution to thermal conductivity====
Assuming that Boltzmann transport equation is valid, thermal conductivity can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{1}{3}Cv_g\Lambda=\frac{1}{3}Cv_g^2\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where C is the heat capacity,  v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the group velocity and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the relaxation time. Note that this assumption breaks down when the dimensions of the system are comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of the phonons responsible for thermal transport. In our case, phonon wavelengths are generally in the 1&amp;nbsp;nm range &lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{Cite web |last = Pop |first = Eric |year = 2009 |title = Lecture 8 - Thermal Conductivity |url = http://poplab.ece.illinois.edu/files/ece598/L5L6L7_Phonons.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nanowires under consideration are within tens of nanometers range, the assumption is valid.

Different phonon mode contributions to heat conduction can be extracted from analysis of the experimental data for silicon nanowires of different diameters &lt;ref name=Ju /&gt; to extract the ''C·v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' product for analysis. It was shown that all phonon modes contributing to thermal transport are excited well below the Si [[Debye temperature]] (645 K).

From the thermal conductivity equation, one can write the product ''C·v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each isotropic phonon branch ''i''.

:&lt;math&gt;(Cv_g)_i=\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{2\hbar^3\pi^2}\int \frac{1}{v_{p,i}^2}\left[\frac{x^4 \exp(x)}{(\exp(x)-1)^2}\right]\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x = h\omega/k_{B}T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{p,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the phonon phase velocity, which is less sensitive to phonon dispersions than the group velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Many models of phonon thermal transport ignores the effects of transverse acoustic phonons (TA) at high frequency due to their small group velocity. (Optical phonon contributions are also ignored for the same reason.) However, upper branch of TA phonons have non-zero group velocity at the Brillouin zone boundary along the Γ-Κ direction and, in fact, behave similarly to the longitudinal acoustic phonons (LA) and can contribute to the heat transport.

Then, the possible phonon modes contributing to heat conduction are both LA and TA phonons at low and high frequencies. Using the corresponding dispersion curves, the ''C·v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' product can then be calculated and fitted to the experimental data. The best fit was found when contribution of high-frequency TA phonons is accounted as 70% of the product at room temperature. The remaining 30% is contributed by the LA and TA phonons at low-frequency.

====Using complete phonon dispersions====
Thermal conductivity in nanowires can be computed based on complete phonon dispersions instead of the linearlized dispersion relations commonly used to calculate thermal conductivity in bulk materials.&lt;ref name=Mingo&gt;{{cite journal|title=Calculation of Si nanowire thermal conductivity using complete phonon dispersion relations|journal=Phys. Rev. B|year=2003|first=N.|last=Mingo|volume=68|issue=11|pages=113308–12|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevB.68.113308|arxiv = cond-mat/0308587 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68k3308M |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233747/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the phonon transport is diffusive and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is valid, nanowire [[Thermal conductivity#Conductance|thermal conductance]] ''G(T)'' can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; G(T) \simeq \sum_{\alpha}{\int{ \frac{\lambda_a(k_z)}{L} \frac{\hbar \omega_{\alpha}(k_z)}{2\pi} \frac{df_b}{dT}v_z(\alpha,k_z)dk_z}} &lt;/math&gt;

where the variable α represents discrete quantum numbers associated with sub-bands found in one-dimensional phonon dispersion relations, ''f&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the Bose-Einstein distribution, ''v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the phonon velocity in the ''z'' direction and λ is the phonon relaxation length along the direction of the wire length.
[[Thermal conductivity]] is then expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;k(T)=\frac{1}{S} \sum{\alpha} {\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{a_z}} \lambda_\alpha (k_z) \frac{\hbar\omega_\alpha (k_z)}{2\pi}\frac{df_B}{dT}v_z(\alpha,k_z)\, dk_z}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S'' is the cross sectional area of the wire, ''a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the lattice constant.

It was shown &lt;ref name=Mingo /&gt; that, using this formula and atomistically computed phonon dispersions (with [[interatomic potential]]s developed in &lt;ref name =Harrison&gt;{{cite book
|last = Harrison
|first = Walter A.

|isbn = 0-486-66021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it is possible to predictively calculate lattice thermal conductivity curves for nanowires, in good agreement with experiments. On the other hand, it was not possible to obtain correct results with the approximated Callaway formula.&lt;ref name= Callaway&gt;{{cite journal|title=Model for Lattice Thermal Conductivity at Low Temperatures|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=1959|first=J.|last=Callaway|volume=113|issue=4|pages=1046–51|doi= 10.1103/PhysRev.113.1046|bibcode = 1959PhRv..113.1046C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results are expected to apply to ”nanowhiskers” for which phonon confinement effects are unimportant. Si nanowires wider than ~35&amp;nbsp;nm are within this category.&lt;ref name=Mingo /&gt;

====Very thin nanowires====
For large diameter nanowires, theoretical models assuming the nanowire diameters are comparable to the mean free path and that the mean free path is independent of phonon frequency have been able to closely match the experimental results. But for very thin nanowires whose dimensions are comparable to the dominant phonon wavelength, a new model is required. The study in &lt;ref name=RChen/&gt; has shown that in such cases, the phonon-boundary scattering is dependent on frequency. The new mean free path is then should be used:

:&lt;math&gt; l^{-1} = B \left(\frac{h}{d}\right)^2 \frac{1}{d} \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_D}\right)^2N(\omega) &lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''l'' is the mean free path (same as Λ). The parameter ''h'' is length scale associated with the disordered region, ''d'' is the diameter, ''N(ω)'' is number of modes at frequency ω, and ''B'' is a constant related to the disorder region.&lt;ref name=RChen/&gt;

Thermal conductance is then calculated using the Landauer formula:

:&lt;math&gt; G(T) = \int\limits_0^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d}\omega}{2 \pi} \, 
\left( \frac{N_1(\omega)}{1+L/l(\omega)} + 
       \frac{N_2(\omega)}{1+L/d} \right)
\frac{\hbar^2 \omega^2}{k_B T^2} 
\frac{\exp(\hbar \omega / k_B T)}{[\exp(\hbar\omega / k_BT) - 1]^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Carbon nanotubes==
As nanoscale graphitic structures, [[carbon nanotube]]s are of great interest for their thermal properties. The low-temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity show direct evidence of 1-D quantization of the phonon [[band structure]]. Modeling of the low-temperature specific heat allows determination of the on-tube phonon velocity, the splitting of phonon subbands on a single tube, and the interaction between neighboring tubes in a bundle.

Addition of nanotubes to epoxy resin can double the thermal conductivity for a loading of only 1%, showing that nanotube composite materials may be useful for thermal management applications.

===Theoretical models for nanotubes===
Thermal conductivity in CNT is mainly due to phonons rather than electrons &lt;ref name=Hone/&gt; so the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]] is not applicable.

In general, the thermal conductivity is a tensor quality, but for this discussion, it is only important to consider the diagonal elements:

:&lt;math&gt;k_{zz} = \sum C{v_z}^2\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where C is the specific heat, and ''v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are the group velocity and [[phonon scattering|relaxation time]] of a given phonon state.

At low temperatures (T is far less than Debye temperature), the relaxation time is determined by scattering of fixed impurities, defects, sample boundaries, etc. and is roughly constant. Therefore, in ordinary materials, the low-temperature thermal conductivity has the same temperature dependence as the specific heat. However, in anisotropic materials, this relationship does not strictly hold. Because the contribution of each state is weighted by the scattering time and the square of the velocity, the thermal conductivity preferentially samples states with large velocity and scattering time. For instance, in graphite, the thermal conductivity parallel to the [[basal plane]]s is only weakly dependent on the interlayer phonons. In SWNT bundles, it is likely that ''k(T)'' depends only on the on-tube phonons, rather than the intertube modes.

Thermal conductivity is of particular interest in low-dimensional systems. For CNT, represented as 1-D ballistic electronic channel, the electronic conductance is quantized, with a universal value of

:&lt;math&gt;G_0 = \frac{2e^2}{h} &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for a single ballistic 1-D channel, the thermal conductance is independent of materials parameters, and there exists a [[quantum of thermal conductance]], which is linear in temperature:&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;

In 2008, a colorized electron micrograph of one of the Caltech devices was acquired for the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.

At high temperatures, three-phonon Umklapp scattering begins to limit the phonon relaxation time. Therefore, the phonon thermal conductivity displays a peak and decreases with increasing temperature. Umklapp scattering requires production of a phonon beyond the Brillouin zone boundary; because of the high Debye temperature of diamond and graphite, the peak in the thermal conductivity of these materials is near 100 K, significantly higher than for most other materials. In less crystalline forms of graphite, such as carbon fibers, the peak in ''k(T)'' occurs at higher temperatures, because defect scattering remains dominant over Umklapp scattering to higher temperature.&lt;ref name=Heremans&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermal-conductivity and thermopower of vapor-grown graphite|journal=Phys.

The value ''k(T)'' peaks near 100 K, and then decreases with increasing temperature. The value of ''k(T)'' at the peak (37,000 W/(m·K)) is comparable to the highest thermal conductivity ever measured (41,000 W/(m·K) for an [[isotopically pure diamond]] sample at 104 K). Even at room temperature, the thermal conductivity is quite high (6600 W/(m·K)), exceeding the reported room-temperature thermal conductivity of isotopically pure diamond by almost a factor of 2.

In graphite, the interlayer interactions quench the thermal conductivity by nearly 1 order of magnitude {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. It is likely that the same process occurs in nanotube bundles {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Thus it is significant that the coupling between tubes in bundles is weaker than expected {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. It may be that this weak coupling, which is problematic for mechanical applications of nanotubes, is an advantage for thermal applications.

====Phonon density of states for nanotubes====
The phonon density of states is to calculated through band structure of isolated nanotubes, which is studied in Saito ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Saito08&gt;

When a graphene sheet is ‘‘rolled’’ into a nanotube, the 2-D band structure folds into a large number of 1-D subbands. In a (10,10) tube, for instance, the six phonon bands (three acoustic and three optical) of the graphene sheet become 66 separate 1-D subbands. A direct result of this folding is that the nanotube density of states has a number of sharp peaks due to 1-D [[Van Hove singularity|van Hove singularities]], which are absent in graphene and graphite. Despite the presence of these singularities, the overall density of states is similar at high energies, so that the high temperature specific heat should be roughly equal as well. This is to be expected: the high-energy phonons are more reflective of carbon–carbon bonding than the geometry of the graphene sheet.

==Thin films==
[[Thin films]] are prevalent in the micro and nanoelectronics industry for the fabrication of sensors, actuators and transistors; thus, thermal transport properties affect the performance and reliability of many structures such as transistors, solid-state lasers, sensors, and actuators. Although these devices are traditionally made from bulk crystalline material (silicon), they often contain thin films of oxides, polysilicon, metal, as well as superlattices such as thin-film stacks of GaAs/AlGaAs for lasers.

===Single-crystal thin films===
Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) films with silicon thicknesses of 0.05&amp;nbsp;µm to 10&amp;nbsp;µm above a buried silicon dioxide layer are increasingly popular for semiconductor devices due to the increased dielectric isolation associated with SOI/&lt;ref name=Asheghi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phonon-boundary scattering in thin silicon layers|journal=Applied Physics Letters|year=1997|first=M.|last=Asheghi|author2=Y. K. Leung |author3=S. S. Wong |author4=K. E. Goodson |volume=71|issue=13|pages=1798–800|doi= 10.1063/1.119402|bibcode = 1997ApPhL..71.1798A }}&lt;/ref&gt; SOI wafers contain a thin-layer of silicon on an oxide layer and a thin-film of single-crystal silicon, which reduces the effective thermal conductivity of the material by up to 50% as compared to bulk silicon, due to phonon-interface scattering and defects and dislocations in the crystalline structure. Previous studies by Asheghi ''et al.'', show a similar trend.&lt;ref name=Asheghi /&gt; Other studies of thin-films show similar thermal effects {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

===Superlattices===
Thermal properties associated with superlattices are critical in the development of semiconductor lasers. Heat conduction of superlattices is less understood than homogeneous thin films. It is theorized that superlattices have a lower thermal conductivity due to impurities from lattice mismatches and at the heterojunctions. Phonon-interface scattering at heterojunctions needs to be considered in this case; fully elastic scattering underestimates the heat conduction, while fully inelastic scattering overestimates the heat conduction.&lt;ref name=GChen&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conductivity and Heat Transfer in Superlattices|journal=Applied Physics Letters|year=1997|first=G.|last=Chen|author2=M. Neagu |volume=71|pages=2761–3|doi=10.1063/1.120126|bibcode = 1997ApPhL..71.2761C|issue=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermal Conductivity of Si-Ge Superlatices|journal=Applied Physics Letters|year=1997|first=S.|last=Lee|author2=D. Cahill |author3=R. Venkatasubramanian |volume=71|issue=22|pages=2957–9|doi= 10.1063/1.118755|bibcode = 1997ApPhL..70.2957L }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a Si/Ge thin-film superlattice has a greater decrease in thermal conductivity than an AlAs/GaAs film stack &lt;ref name=Yao&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermal Peroperties of AlAs/GaAs Superlattices|journal=Applied Physics Letters|year=1987|first=T.|last=Yao|volume=51|issue=22|pages=1798–800|doi= 10.1063/1.98526|bibcode = 1987ApPhL..51.1798Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to increased lattice mismatch. A simple estimate of heat conduction of superlattices is:

:&lt;math&gt; k_n = \left( \frac{C_1 v_1 C_2 v_2}{C_1 v_1 + C_2 v_2} \right) \left( \frac{d_1 + d_2}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the corresponding heat capacity of film1 and film2 respectively, ''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the acoustic propagation velocities in film1 and film2, and ''d1'' and ''d2'' are the thicknesses of film1 and film2. This model neglects scattering within the layers and assumes fully diffuse, inelastic scattering.&lt;ref name= Goodson&gt;{{cite journal|title=, Heat Conduction in Novel Electronic Films|journal=Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci.|year=1999|first=K. E.|last=Goodson|author2=S. Ju |volume=29|pages=261–93|doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.29.1.261|bibcode = 1999AnRMS..29..261G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polycrystalline films===
Polycrystalline films are common in semiconductor devices, as the gate electrode of a [[field-effect transistor]] is often made of polycrystalline [[silicon]]. If the polysilicon grain sizes are small, internal scattering from grain boundaries can overwhelm the effects of film-boundary scattering. Also, grain boundaries contain more impurities, which result in impurity scattering. Likewise, disordered or amorphous films will experience a severe reduction of thermal conductivity, since the small grain size results in numerous grain-boundary scattering effects.&lt;ref name=Zink&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermal Conductivity and Specific Heat of Thin-Film Amorphous Silicon|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2006|first=B. L.|last=Zink|author2=R. Petri |author3=F. Hellman |volume=96|issue=5|pages=055902–6|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.055902|pmid=16486955|bibcode=2006PhRvL..96e5902Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different deposition methods of amorphous films will result in differences in impurities and grain sizes.&lt;ref name =Goodson /&gt;

The simplest approach to modeling phonon scattering at grain boundaries is to increase the scattering rate by introducing this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_G^{-1}=B\frac{v}{d_G}&lt;/math&gt;

where B is a dimensionless parameter that correlates with the phonon reflection coefficient at the grain boundaries, ''d&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the characteristic grain size, and ''v'' is the phonon velocity through the material. A more formal approach to estimating the scattering rate is:

:&lt;math&gt; {\tau_G}^{-1} = \frac{2 \nu}{\pi d_G} \left[ 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{\pi^2}{4}\nu_G \right) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

where ''v&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the dimensionless grain-boundary scattering strength, defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \nu_G = \sum_{j} \sigma_j \nu_j &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\sigma_j&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-section of a grain-boundary area, and ''ν&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of the grain boundary area.&lt;ref name=Goodson /&gt;

===Measuring thermal conductivity of thin films===
There are two approaches to experimentally determine the thermal conductivity of thin films. The goal of experimental metrology of thermal conductivity of thin films is to attain an accurate thermal measurement without disturbing the properties of the thin-film.

'''Electrical heating''' is used for thin films which have a lower thermal conductivity than the substrate; it is fairly accurate in measuring out-of-plane conductivity. Often, a resistive heater and thermistor is fabricated on the sample film using a highly conductive metal, such as [[aluminium]]. The most straightforward approach would be to apply a steady-state current and measure the change in temperature of adjacent thermistors. A more versatile approach uses an AC signal applied to the electrodes. The third harmonic of the AC signal reveals heating and temperature fluctuations of the material.&lt;ref name=Goodson /&gt;

'''Laser heating''' is a non-contact metrology method, which uses picosecond and nanosecond laser pulses to deliver thermal energy to the substrate. Laser heating uses a pump-probe mechanism; the pump beam introduces energy to the thin-film, as the probe beam picks up the characteristics of how the energy propagates through the film. Laser heating is advantageous because the energy delivered to the film can be precisely controlled; furthermore, the short heating duration decouples the thermal conductivity of the thin film from the substrate {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

A '''tree spade''' is a specialized machine that [[mechanization|mechanizes]] the [[transplanting]] of large [[plant]]s whose [[manual labour|hand-powered]] transplanting (using traditional [[spade]]s, wagons, and other equipment) would be prohibitively laborious. These include large [[shrub|bushes]] and small or medium [[tree]]s. By bringing mechanized power to what was formerly only a manual process, tree spades do for transplanting what [[tractor]]s and [[combine harvester]]s do for [[agriculture]], and what [[excavator]]s and other [[heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]] do for [[construction]]. Today, tree spades are widely used in the tree nursery industry to increase production rates, and in the landscaping industry for tree removal and transplanting.

A typical machine consists of a number of blades (generally 3 or 4, but single or dual blade designs also exist) that encircle the tree, digging into the ground and then lifting the entire tree, including its roots and soil (in what is termed a "root ball"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dutchmantreespade.com/products/tree_spade/treespadeindex.php|title=Dutchman Tree Spades {{!}} Tree Spade|website=dutchmantreespade.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;), out of the ground and replanting or transplanting the whole tree in the designated area. Similar machines can also be used for placing trees in pots or baskets for commercial tree nursery operations. Tree spades are available in a wide variety of sizes and designs that are made to suit varied soil conditions and customer requirements. Typical design variations can include straight vs curved blades, root ball diameter, root ball depth, and root ball cone angle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The machines can be mounted on a tractor or loader for moving trees a short distance, or on the back of a truck&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DutchmanIndustries|title=100" Tree Spade(s) for Chase Farms|date=2012-01-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEkZk8dagzQ|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ranchotreecare.com/| title= Rancho Cucamonga tree removal }} Thursday, 23 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  for relocating trees over the highway a long distance away. For tree nursery operations, tree spades are also sometimes mounted on excavators, though this is less common due to the weight capacity requirements of manipulating the machine along with an excavated tree. For transport on public roads, the spade tilts the tree to a near-horizontal position in order to clear overhead bridges and cables.

The '''University of Montenegro Biotechnical Faculty''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: '''Biotehnički fakultet Univerziteta Crne Gore''' ''Биотехнички факултет Универзитета Црне Горе'') is one of the educational institutions of the [[University of Montenegro]]. The building is located in [[Podgorica]], at the University campus.

== History ==

Scientific research in agriculture in [[Montenegro]] was established in 1937, when the Ministry of Agriculture of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] decided to establish the experimental '''State Research Station for Southern Cultures''' in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]]. After [[World War II]], the founding of new institutions and renewal of previously existing ones followed, such as: 
* ''the Institute for Agricultural Research'' in Podgorica (1945)
* ''the Institute for Animal Husbandry (Livestock)'' in [[Nikšić]]
* ''the Institute for Southern Cultures and Viticulture'' in Bar (1947)
* ''Soil Testing Units'' in Bar (1949)
* ''Veterinary Diagnostic Units'' in [[Titograd]] (1950) and 
* ''the Centre for Fruit Growing'' in [[Bijelo Polje]] (1952).

The '''Agricultural Institute''' was established in 1961, as a result of merging the above-mentioned institutions. It functioned under that name until 1997, when it was transformed into the '''Biotechnical Institute''' by including the ''Forestry Sector'' into one unique scientific research institution. By establishing the Studies of Agriculture, in 2005, the Institute developed into a faculty, and in 2008 formally changed its name into the '''Biotechnical Faculty'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.btf.ac.me/btf/BTF_brosura.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

The Faculty of Biotechnology has adequately equipped classrooms and laboratories situated in the Faculty's buildings in [[Podgorica]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Bijelo Polje]], as well as experimental plots for a part of students’ professional practice and organization of Faculty production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucg.ac.me/eng/Faculty%20of%20Biotechnology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Undergraduate academic studies ===

The undergraduate academic studies are divided in two study groups:
* ''Plant production''
** Undergraduate applied studies of ''Continental fruit growing'' in [[Bijelo Polje]]
** Undergraduate applied studies of ''Mediterranean fruit growing'' in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]]
* ''[[Cattle breeding]]''

=== Specialist academic studies ===

The specialist academic studies at the Faculty have four study groups:
* ''Fruit and wine growing''
* ''Cultivation of soil and vegetable growing''
* ''Plant protection''
* ''Cattle breeding''

=== Master studies ===

The master studies of Plant production are organized on the following three groups:
* ''Fruit and wine growing''
* ''Cultivation of soil and vegetable growing''
* ''Plant protection''

      <comment>/* Etymology, translations, and cultural references */ Corrected misuse of the verb ‘substitute’. It could also have been written ‘…term is substituted for less-common loanwords…’. We replace old with new, or substitute new for old. We do not substitute the old; that’s both wrong and ambiguous.</comment>

'''Varenye'''  or '''varenie''' ({{lang-ru|варенье}}, {{lang-be|варэнне/варэньне}}, {{lang-uk|варення}}) is a traditional [[Fruit preserves|whole-fruit preserve]], widespread in [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Russian cuisine|Russia]], [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukraine]], [[Belarusian cuisine|Belarus]]), as well as the [[Baltic region]] ({{lang-lt|uogienė}}, {{lang-lv|ievārījums}}, {{lang-et|moos}}). It is made by cooking berries, other fruits, or more rarely [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[vegetables]], or [[flowers]], in sugar syrup.&lt;ref name=BE_Varenye&gt;[http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/ЭСБЕ/Варенье Варенье], Энциклопедический словарь Брокгауза и Ефрона, СПб., 1890–1907 (''Varenye'' in [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]], St. Petersburg, 1890–1907)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pokhlyobkin_Dict_Varenye&gt;В. В. Похлёбкин, ''Кулинарный словарь от А до Я'', статья ''[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/dic_culinary/383/варенье Варенье]'', изд. Центрполиграф, 2000, {{ISBN|5-227-00460-9}} ([[William Pokhlyobkin]], ''Culinary Dictionary'', Centrpoligraf publishing house, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/5767412/Russian-cuisine-Preserve-the-summer-with-fruity-varenye.html Russian cuisine: Preserve the summer with fruity varenye] by Irakli Iosebashvili, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In some traditional recipes, other sweeteners such as [[honey]] or [[treacle]] are used instead of or in addition to sugar.&lt;ref name=BE_Varenye /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pokhlyobkin_Dict_Varenye /&gt;

Varenye is similar to [[jam]] except the fruits are not macerated, and no [[gelling agent]] is added. It is characterized by a thick but transparent syrup having the natural colour of the fruits.

== Preparation ==
The making of varenye requires a careful balance between cooking, or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for just enough time to allow the flavor to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit, and cooking too long that fruit will break down and liquefy. Some fruits with tough skins require cooking for many hours, while others are suitable for making "five-minute varenye" ({{lang-ru|варенье-пятиминутка}}, ''varenye-pyatiminutka''). For the latter, dry sugar is spread over raw fruit in layers and left for several hours to steep into the fruit. The resulting mixture is then heated for just about five minutes.

The most popular types of varenye are made from locally available berries and fruits, such as sour cherries, strawberries, raspberries, apricots and apples. In general, virtually any kind of fruit, as well as some culinary vegetables, nuts, pine cones, and rose petals are used.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Usage ==

Varenye is enjoyed as a dessert and condiment, in particular as a topping for pancakes ([[bliny]], [[oladyi]], [[syrniki]]), as a filling for pies ([[pirog]]i and [[pirozhki]]), dumplings ([[vareniki]]), cakes and cookies, and as a sweetener for tea. It is also used as a [[spread (food)|spread]] on bread, though due to its liquid consistency it is not well suited for that. Finally, it is eaten on its own as a sweet.

== Etymology, translations, and cultural references ==
[[File:Vladimir Makovsky - Making Jam.JPG|thumb|[[Vladimir Makovsky]], "Making varenye", 1876]]

''Varenye'' is an old Slavic word which is used in [[East Slavic languages]] in a more general sense to refer to any type of sweet fruit preserve. The word has common etymological roots with the words denoting cooking, boiling, brewing, or stewing ({{lang-ru|варить}}, {{lang-be|варыць}}, {{lang-uk|варити}}).

In [[literary translation]]s, especially of children's books, into Russian, the term is often used to replace less-common loanwords, such as [[jam]], [[confiture]] or [[marmalade]]. Examples are the translations of [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]], [[Harry Potter]], [[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]], and the animated movies about [[Karlsson-on-the-roof]].

The same is true when translating ''from'' Russian. For instance, the making of [[raspberry]] varenie is described in [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (VI-2). In her classic translation, [[Constance Garnett]] refers to the activity as "jam-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1399/1399-h/1399-h.htm|title=Anna Karenina|first1=Leo|last1=Tolstoy|first2=Leo|last2=Tolstoy|work=gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the popular [[Soviet]] children's book ''A tale about a war secret, about the boy Nipper-Pipper, and his word of honour'' by [[Arkady Gaidar]] the [[antihero]] Little Baddun betrays his friends for "a barrel of varenye and a basket of biscuits" ({{lang-ru|бочка варенья и корзина печенья}}; again, in English translation ''jam'' is used instead of varenye).&lt;ref&gt;Arkadi Gaidar, ''A Tale About a War secret, About the Boy nipper-pipper, and His Word of Honour''. Translated from the Russian by Walter May. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase became an [[Idiom|idiomatic expression]] for betrayal or [[selling out]] in Russian, similar to [[thirty pieces of silver]].

The more general usage of the term varenye in Russian includes a number of related local specialties.

=== Raw varenye ===

In the preparation of "raw varenye" ({{lang-ru|сырое варенье}}, ''syroye varenye'') the heating is omitted completely. The recipes usually include grating of raw berries or other fruits and mixing them with sugar.

=== Dry varenye ===

In [[Russian Empire|pre-revolutionary Russia]], "dry varenye" ({{lang-ru|сухое варенье}}, ''sukhoe varenye'') referred to a local variety of [[candied fruit]]s ([[Confit#Fruit confit|fruit confit]]) obtained by extracting fruits from varenye syrup and drying them. [[Kiev]] (today the capital of Ukraine) was particularly famous for this delicacy.&lt;ref name=BE_Varenye /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pokhlyobkin_Dry_Varenye&gt;В. В. Похлёбкин, ''Большая энциклопедия кулинарного искусства'', статья ''[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_pohlebkin/1351/ВАРЕНЬЕ Варенье сухое (Киевское)]'', изд. Центрполиграф, 2008, {{ISBN|978-5-9524-3563-6}} ([[William Pokhlyobkin]], ''The Great Encyclopedia of Culinary Art'', Centrpoligraf, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volokh"&gt;Anne Volokh, ''The Art of Russian Cuisine'', Macmillan, 1983, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7052">In [[combustion]], the '''Williams spray equation''', also known as the '''Williams–Boltzmann equation''', describes the statistical evolution of sprays contained in another fluid, analogous to the [[Boltzmann equation]] for the molecules, named after [[Forman A. Williams]], who derived the equation in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. "Spray combustion and atomization." The physics of fluids 1.6 (1958): 541–545&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (1961, January). Progress in spray-combustion analysis. In Symposium (international) on Combustion (Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 50-69). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical description&lt;ref&gt;Williams, FA. "Combustion theory." (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;==
The sprays are assumed to be spherical with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, even though the assumption is valid for solid particles(liquid droplets) when their shape has no consequence on the combustion. For liquid droplets to be nearly spherical, the spray has to be dilute(total volume occupied by the sprays is much less than the volume of the gas) and the [[Weber number]] &lt;math&gt;We = 2r\rho_g|\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{u}|^2/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_g&lt;/math&gt; is the gas density, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the spray droplet velocity, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the gas velocity and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension of the liquid spray, should be &lt;math&gt;We \ll 10&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation is described by a number density function &lt;math&gt;f_j(r,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},T,t) \, dr \, d\mathbf{x} \, d\mathbf{v}\,dT&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the probable number of spray particles (droplets) of chemical species &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; total species), that one can find with radii between &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r+dr&lt;/math&gt;, located in the spatial range between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, traveling with a velocity in between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}+d\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, having the temperature in between &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T+dT&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then the spray equation for the evolution of this density function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f_j}{\partial t} + \nabla_x\cdot(\mathbf{v}f_j) + \nabla_v \cdot(F_jf_j) =- \frac{\partial }{\partial r}(R_jf_j) - \frac{\partial }{\partial T}(E_jf_j) + Q_j + \Gamma_j, \quad j = 1,2,\ldots,M. &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;F_j = \left(\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}\right)_j&lt;/math&gt; is the force per unit mass acting on the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray (acceleration applied to the sprays),

:&lt;math&gt;R_j=\left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of the size of the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray,

:&lt;math&gt;E_j=\left(\frac{dT}{dt}\right)_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of the temperature of the &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray due to heat transfer,&lt;ref&gt;Oguz Emre, Damien Kah, St´ephane Jay, Quang-Huy Tran, Anthony Velghe, et al.. Eulerian Moment Methods for Automotive Sprays. Atomization and Sprays, Begell House Inc., 2015, 25 (3), pp. 189–254&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_j&lt;/math&gt;  is the rate of change of number density function of &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray due to nucleation, liquid breakup etc.,

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of number density function of &lt;math&gt;j^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; species spray due to collision with other spray particles.

==A simplified model for liquid propellant rocket==
This model for the rocket motor was developed by Probert,&lt;ref&gt;Probert, R. P. "XV. The influence of spray particle size and distribution in the combustion of oil droplets." The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science 37.265 (1946): 94–105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forman A. Williams|Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. "Spray combustion and atomization." The physics of fluids 1.6 (1958): 541-545&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. "Introduction to Analytical Models of High Frequency Combustion Instability,”." Eighth Symposium (International) on Combustion. Williams and Wilkins. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tanasawa.&lt;ref&gt;Tanasawa, Y. "On the Combustion Rate of a Group of Fuel Particles Injected Through a Swirl Nozzle." Technology Reports of Tohoku University 18 (1954): 195–208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanasawa, Yasusi, and Tuneo Tesima. "On the theory of combustion rate of liquid fuel spray." Bulletin of JSME 1.1 (1958): 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt; It is reasonable to neglect &lt;math&gt;Q_j, \ \Gamma_j&lt;/math&gt;, for distances not very close to the spray atomizer, where major portion of combustion occurs. Consider a one-dimensional liquid-propellent rocket motor situated at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, where fuel is sprayed. Neglecting &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt;(density function is defined without the temperature so accordingly dimensions of &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; changes) and due to the fact that the mean flow is parallel to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis, the steady spray equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(R_jf_j) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(u_j f_j) + \frac{\partial }{\partial u_j}(F_jf_j) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction. Integrating with respect to the velocity results

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(\int R_j f_j \, d u_j \right) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \left(\int u_j f_j \, d u_j \right) + [F_jf_j]_0^\infty =0&lt;/math&gt;

The contribution from the last term (spray acceleration term) becomes zero (using [[Divergence theorem]]) since &lt;math&gt;f_j\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is very large, which is typically the case in rocket motors. The drop size rate &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt; is well modeled using vaporization mechanisms as

:&lt;math&gt;R_j = -\frac{\chi_j}{r^{k_j}}, \quad \chi_j \geq 0, \quad 0\leq k_j \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi_j&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, but can depend on the surrounding gas. Defining the number of droplets per unit volume per unit radius and average quantities averaged over velocities,

:&lt;math&gt;G_j = \int f_j \, du_j, \quad \bar{R}_j = \frac{\int R_j f_j \, d u_j}{G_j}, \quad \bar{u}_j = \frac{\int u_j f_j \, d u_j}{G_j}&lt;/math&gt;

the equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(\bar{R}_jG_j) + \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\bar{u}_j G_j) =0.&lt;/math&gt;

If further assumed that &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}_j&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, and with a transformed coordinate

&lt;math&gt;\eta_j = \left[r^{k_j+1} + (k_j+1) \int_0^x \frac{\chi_j}{\bar{u}_j} \, dx \right]^{1/(k_j+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

If the combustion chamber has varying cross-section area &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt;, a known function for &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and with area &lt;math&gt;A_o&lt;/math&gt; at the spraying location, then the solution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G_j(\eta_j) = G_{j,o}(\eta_j)\frac{A_o \bar{u}_{j,o}}{A\bar{u}_j} \left(\frac{r}{\eta_j}\right)^{k_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;G_{j,0} = G_j(r,0), \ \bar{u}_{j,0} = \bar{u}_j(x=0)&lt;/math&gt; are the number distribution and mean velocity at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; respectively.
