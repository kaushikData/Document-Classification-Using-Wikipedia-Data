'''Amos Glacier''' ({{Coord|77|49|S|163|39|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a {{convert|3|nmi|km|0|adj=on}} long [[glacier]] that flows southeast from [[Bettle Peak]] to a juncture with the [[Blue Glacier (Antarctica)|Blue Glacier]] (southeast of [[Hannon Hill]]), in [[Victoria Land]], [[Antarctica]]. It was named in 1992 by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] after [[Larry Leon Amos]], a civil engineer with the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), and a member of the USGS two man astronomic surveying team to [[South Pole Station]] and [[Byrd Station]] in the 1969–70 field season. Among other work, the team established the position of the [[Geographic South Pole]] (previously done 1956) and established a tie to the [[Byrd Ice Strain net]] which had been under study for several years.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

An '''Arrow security''' is an instrument with a fixed payout of one unit in a specified state and no payout in other states.&lt;ref&gt;Lengwiler, Yvan. Microfoundations of financial economics: an introduction to general equilibrium asset pricing.  Princeton University Press, 2009. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a type of hypothetical asset used in the Arrow market structure model.  In contrast to the [[Arrow-Debreu model|Arrow-Debreu market structure model]], an Arrow market is a market in which the individual agents engage in trading [[asset]]s at every time period t.  In an Arrow-Debreu model, trading occurs only once at the beginning of time.  An Arrow Security is an asset traded in an Arrow market structure model which encompasses a complete market.
Arrow Security is also called [[State Contingent Claim]], [[Supershare Option]].

Creating a '''cellular model''' has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]].
It involves developing efficient [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], [[Biological data visualization|visualization]] and communication tools to orchestrate the integration of large quantities of biological data with the goal of [[computer modeling]].

It is also directly associated with [[bioinformatics]], [[computational biology]] and [[Artificial life]].

It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a predictive model of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century.

==Overview==
The eukaryotic [[cell cycle]] is very complex and is one of the most studied topics, since its misregulation leads to [[cancer]]s.
It is possibly a good example of a mathematical model as it deals with simple calculus but gives valid results. Two research groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/lab_website/ |title=The JJ Tyson Lab|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellcycle.bme.hu/ |title=The Molecular Network Dynamics Research Group|publisher=[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have produced several models of the cell cycle simulating several organisms. They have recently produced a generic eukaryotic cell cycle model which can represent a particular eukaryote depending on the values of the parameters, demonstrating that the idiosyncrasies of the individual cell cycles are due to different protein concentrations and affinities, while the underlying mechanisms are conserved (Csikasz-Nagy et al., 2006).&lt;br /&gt;
By means of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s these models show the change in time ([[dynamical system]]) of the protein inside a single typical cell; this type of model is called a [[deterministic system|deterministic process]] (whereas a model describing a statistical distribution of protein concentrations in a population of cells is called a [[stochastic process]]).&lt;br /&gt;
To obtain these equations an iterative series of steps must be done: first the several models and observations are combined to form a consensus diagram and the appropriate kinetic laws are chosen to write the differential equations, such as [[Reaction rate|rate kinetics]] for stoichiometric reactions, [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics]] for enzyme substrate reactions and [[Goldbeter–Koshland kinetics]] for ultrasensitive transcription factors, afterwards the parameters of the equations (rate constants, enzyme efficiency coefficients and Michaelis constants) must be fitted to match observations; when they cannot be fitted the kinetic equation is revised and when that is not possible the wiring diagram is modified. The parameters are fitted and validated using observations of both wild type and mutants, such as protein half-life and cell size.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to fit the parameters the differential equations need to be studied. This can be done either by simulation or by analysis. &lt;br /&gt;
In a simulation, given a starting [[Array data structure|vector]] (list of the values of the variables), the progression of the system is calculated by solving the equations at each time-frame in small increments.&lt;br /&gt;
In analysis, the properties of the equations are used to investigate the behavior of the system depending of the values of the parameters and variables. A system of differential equations can be represented as a [[vector field]], where each vector described the change (in concentration of two or more protein) determining where and how fast the trajectory (simulation) is heading. Vector fields can have several special points: a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|stable point]], called a sink, that attracts in all directions (forcing the concentrations to be at a certain value), an [[unstable point]], either a source or a [[saddle point]] which repels (forcing the concentrations to change away from a certain value), and a limit cycle, a closed trajectory towards which several trajectories spiral towards (making the concentrations oscillate).&lt;br /&gt; A better representation which can handle the large number of variables and parameters is called a [[bifurcation diagram]] ([[bifurcation theory]]): the presence of these special steady-state points at certain values of a parameter (e.g. mass) is represented by a point and once the parameter passes a certain value, a qualitative change occurs, called a bifurcation, in which the nature of the space changes, with profound consequences for the protein concentrations: the cell cycle has phases (partially corresponding to G1 and G2) in which mass, via a stable point, controls cyclin levels, and phases (S and M phases) in which the concentrations change independently, but once the phase has changed at a bifurcation event ([[cell cycle checkpoint]]), the system cannot go back to the previous levels since at the current mass the vector field is profoundly different and the mass cannot be reversed back through the bifurcation event, making a checkpoint irreversible. In particular the S and M checkpoints are regulated by means of special bifurcations called a [[Hopf bifurcation]] and an [[infinite period bifurcation]].

==Molecular level simulations==
Cell Collective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cellcollective.org/ | title=Interactive Modeling of Biological Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a modeling software that enables one to house dynamical biological data, build computational models, stimulate, break and recreate models. The development is led by Tomas Helikar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://helikarlab.org/members.html | title=Helikar Lab - Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a researcher within the field of computational biology. It is designed for biologists, students learning about computational biology, teachers focused on teaching life sciences, and researchers within the field of life science. The complexities of math and computer science are built into the backend and one can learn about the methods used for modeling biological species, but complex math equations, algorithms, programming are not required and hence won't impede model building.

The mathematical framework behind Cell Collective is based on a common qualitative (discrete) modeling technique where the regulatory mechanism of each node is described with a logical function [for more comprehensive information on logical modeling, see &lt;ref&gt;Morris MK, Saez-Rodriguez J, Sorger PK, Lauffenburger DA.. Logic-based models for the analysis of cell signaling networks. Biochemistry (2010) 49(15):3216–24.10.1021/bi902202q

Model validation
The model was constructed using local (e.g., protein–protein interaction) information from the primary literature. In other words, during the construction phase of the model, there was no attempt to determine the local interactions based on any other larger phenotypes or phenomena. However, after the model was completed, verification of the accuracy of the model involved testing it for the ability to reproduce complex input–output phenomena that have been observed in the laboratory. To do this, the T-cell model was simulated under a multitude of cellular conditions and analyzed in terms of input–output dose–response curves to determine whether the model behaves as expected, including various downstream effects as a result of activation of the TCR, G-protein-coupled receptor, cytokine, and integrin pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Conroy BD, Herek TA, Shew TD, Latner M, Larson JJ, Allen L, et al.

In the July 2012 issue of [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], a team led by [[Markus W. Covert|Markus Covert]] at Stanford published the most complete computational model of a cell to date. The model of the roughly 500-gene ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' contains 28 algorithmically-independent components incorporating work from over 900 sources. It accounts for interactions of the complete [[genome]], [[transcriptome]], [[proteome]], and [[metabolome]] of the organism, marking a significant advancement for the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://covertlab.stanford.edu/publicationpdfs/mgenitalium_whole_cell_2012_07_20.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/july/computer-model-organism-071812.html | title=Stanford researchers produce first complete computer model of an organism| date=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most attempts at modeling cell cycle processes have focused on the broad, complicated molecular interactions of many different chemicals, including several [[cyclin]] and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] molecules as they correspond to the [[S phase|S]], [[M phase|M]], [[G1 phase|G1]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of the [[cell cycle]]. In a 2014 published article in PLOS computational biology, collaborators at [[University of Oxford]], [[Virginia Tech]] and Institut de Génétique et Développement de Rennes produced a simplified model of the cell cycle using only one cyclin/CDK interaction. This model showed the ability to control totally functional [[cell division]] through regulation and manipulation only the one interaction, and even allowed researchers to skip phases through varying the concentration of CDK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cell Cycle Control by a Minimal Cdk Network|journal = PLoS Comput Biol|date = 2015-02-06|pmc = 4319789|pmid = 25658582|pages = e1004056|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004056|first = Claude|last = Gérard|first2 = John J.|last2 = Tyson|first3 = Damien|last3 = Coudreuse|first4 = Béla|last4 = Novák}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model could help understand how the relatively simple interactions of one chemical translate to a cellular level model of cell division.

The '''chain fountain''' phenomenon, also known as the '''self-siphoning beads''' or the '''Mould effect''', is a [[counterintuitive]] physical phenomenon observed with a chain of beads placed inside a jar, when one end of the chain is yanked from the jar and is allowed to fall to the floor beneath. This establishes a self-sustaining flow of the chain of beads which rises up from the jar into an arch ascending into the air over and above the edge of the jar with a noticeable gap, and down to the floor or ground beneath it, as if being sucked out of the jar by an invisible [[siphon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Gravity-Defying, Self-Siphoning Metal Beads Explained [Video] |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2013/07/03/gravity-defying-self-siphoning-metal-beads-explained-video/ |magazine=Scientific American |first=Philip |last=Yam |date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
The effect is most pronounced when using a long [[ball chain]] with rigid links. The higher the jar is placed above the ground, the higher the chain will rise above the jar during the "siphoning" phase. As demonstrated in an experiment, when the jar is placed 30 meters above the ground and the chain is sufficiently long, the arch of the chain fountain can reach the height about {{val|2.1|u=meter}} above the jar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM4lnzhvzdE&amp;t=1800|title=第1期-刘谦郎朗被吊起“命悬一杯” 撒贝宁对大炮求虐【加油！向未来20160703】|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon was first brought to widespread public attention in a video made by science presenter [[Steve Mould]].&lt;ref name=gibney-nature&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/physicists-explain-gravity-defying-chain-trick-1.14523 |title=Physicists explain 'gravity-defying' chain trick |first=Elizabeth |last=Gibney |journal=Nature |date=January 15, 2014 |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.14523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
A variety of explanations have been proposed as to how the phenomenon can best be explained in terms of [[kinematic]] physics concepts such as [[energy]] and [[momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/see-physics-phenomenon-of-self-siphoning-beads/ |title=See physics phenomenon of self siphoning beads |first=William |last=Goodman |work=CBS News |date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/07/the-physics-of-that-gravity-defying-chain-of-metal-beads/ |title=The physics of that gravity-defying chain of metal beads |first=Aatish |last=Bhatia |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=January 15, 2014 |magazine=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bixler,Bob (Jul 14, 2016) "Bead Chain Physics".[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jQ2LAnRHQ0],&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific consensus has shown that the chain fountain effect is driven by upward forces which originate inside the jar. The origin of the upward force is related to the stiffness of the chain links, and the bending restrictions of each chain joint.&lt;ref name=gibney-nature/&gt;&lt;ref name = Royal&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biggins |first1=J. S. |last2=Warner |first2=M. |doi=10.1098/rspa.2013.0689 |title=Understanding the chain fountain |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |volume=470 |issue=2163 |pages=20130689 |year=2014|arxiv=1310.4056 |bibcode=2014RSPSA.47030689B }}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1310.4056 |first1=John Simeon |last1=Biggins |first2=Mark |last2=Warner |title=Understanding the Chain Fountain |year=2013 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2013.0689 |volume=470 |issue=2163 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |page=20130689|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47030689B }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a link of chain is pulled upward from the jar, it rotates like a stiff rod being picked up from one end. This rotation produces a downward force on the opposite end of the link, which in turn generates an upward reactive force. It is this upward reactive force that has been shown to drive the chain fountain phenomenon. Furthermore, because the beads of chain can drag laterally within the jar across other stationary links, the moving beads of the chain can bounce or jump vertically when they strike the immobile links.&lt;ref name = Royal/&gt; This effect contributes to the effect, but is not the primary driver.

'''Characterology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} "character" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is a method of character reading that attempted to combine revised [[physiognomy]], reconstructed [[phrenology]] and amplified [[pathognomy]], with [[ethnology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].  Developed by [[L. Hamilton McCormick]] in the 1920s, characterology was an attempt to produce a scientific, objective system to assess an individual's character.

Characterology attempted to resolve flaws in the phrenological systems of [[Franz Joseph Gall]] 
and [[Johann Spurzheim]]. McCormick tried to distance himself from those earlier systems, and wrote extensively about how his ideas improved upon them.

McCormick suggested possible applications for characterology, e.g., advice for [[parent]]s and [[educator]]s, guidance in [[military]] officer promotions, evaluating [[thinking]] patterns (i.e., [[reason]]-oriented or [[memory]]-oriented ), assessing  business associates and competitors, career counseling, and selecting [[marriage|marital partners]].

The '''circulation of elite''' is a theory of [[regime change]] described by Italian [[social scientist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923).

Changes of regime, [[revolution]]s, and so on occur not when rulers are overthrown from below, but when one [[elite]] replaces another. The role of ordinary people in such transformation is not that of initiators or principal actors, but as followers and supporters of one elite or another.

==Assumptions==
It is a basic [[axiom]] for Pareto that people are unequal physically, as well as intellectually and morally. In [[society]] as a whole, and in any of its particular strata and groupings, some people are more gifted than others. Those who are most capable in any particular grouping are the elite.

The term elite has no moral or honorific connotations in Pareto's usage. It denotes simply "a class of the people who have the highest indices in their branch of activity." Pareto argues that "It will help if we further divide that [elite] class into two classes: a [[governing elite]], comprising individuals who directly or indirectly play some considerable part in [[government]], and a non-governing elite, comprising the rest." His main discussion focuses on the governing elite.

==Ambiguity==
There is a basic [[ambiguity]] in Pareto's treatment of the notion of the elite. In some passages, as in the one quoted above, it would appear that those occupying elite positions are, by definition, the most qualified. But there are many other passages where Pareto asserts that people are assigned elite positions by virtue of being so labeled. That is, men assigned elite positions may not have the requisite capabilities, while others not so labeled may have them.

It would seem that Pareto believed that only in perfectly [[Open society|open societies]], those with perfect [[social mobility]], would elite position correlate fully with superior capacity. Only under such conditions would the governing elite, for example, consist of the people most capable of governing. The actual social fact is that obstacles such as [[inherited wealth]], family connections, and the like prevent the free circulation of individuals through the ranks of society, so that those wearing an elite label and those possessing highest capacity tend to diverge to greater or lesser degrees.

==Social mobility==
Given the likelihood of divergencies between ascribed elite position and actual achievement and capacity, Pareto is a passionate advocate of maximum social mobility and of [[career]]s open to all. He saw the danger that elite positions that were once occupied by men of real [[Aptitude|talent]] would in the course of time be preempted by men devoid of such talent.

When governing or nongoverning elites attempt to close themselves to the influx of newer and more capable elements from the underlying population, when the circulation of elites is impeded, [[social equilibrium]] is upset and the [[social order]] will decay. Pareto argued that if the governing elite does not "find ways to assimilate the exceptional individuals who come to the front in the subject classes," an imbalance is created in the [[body politic]] and the body social until this condition is rectified, either through a new opening of channels of mobility or through [[violent overthrow]] of an old ineffectual governing elite by a new one that is capable of governing.

==Governing elite==
Pareto introduced a social taxonomy that included six classes, Class I through Class VI.  Class I corresponds to the adventurous "foxes" in [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], and Class II to the conservative "lions," particularly in the governing elite.

Not only are [[intelligence]] and [[aptitude]]s unequally distributed among the members of society, but the residues as well. Under ordinary circumstances, the "conservative" residues of Class II preponderate in the masses and thus make them submissive. The governing elite, however, if it is to be effective, must consist of individuals who have a strong mixture of both Class I and Class II elements.

The ideal governing class contains a judicious mixture of lions and foxes, of men capable of decisive and forceful action and of others who are imaginative, innovative, and unscrupulous. When imperfections in the circulation of governing elites prevent the attainment of such judicious mixtures among the governing, regimes either degenerate into hidebound and ossified bureaucracies incapable of renewal and adaptation, or into weak regimes of squabbling [[lawyer]]s and [[rhetorician]]s incapable of decisive and forceful action. When this happens, the governed will succeed in overthrowing their rulers and new elites will institute a more effective regime.

==Speculators==
What applies to political regimes applies to the economic realm as well. In this field, "[[speculator]]s" are akin to the foxes and "[[rentier capitalism|rentiers]]" to the lions. Speculators and rentiers do not only have different interests but they reflect different temperaments and different residues. Neither is very good at using force, but they both otherwise fall roughly into the same dichotomous classes that explain political fluctuations.

In the speculator group Class I residues predominate, in the rentier group, Class II residues. . . . The two groups perform functions of differing utility in society. The [speculator] group is primarily responsible for change, for economic and social progress. The [rentier] group, instead, is a powerful element in stability, and in many cases counteracts the dangers attending the adventurous capers of the [speculators]. A society in which the [rentiers] almost exclusively predominate remains stationary and, as it were, crystallized. A society in which [the speculators] predominate lacks stability, lives in a state of shaky equilibrium that may be upset by a slight accident from within or from without.

Like in the governing elite where things work best when both residues of Class I and Class II are represented, so in the economic order maximum effectiveness is attained when both rentiers and speculators are present, each providing a balance by checking the excesses of the other. Pareto implies throughout that a judicious mixture in top elites of men with Class I and Class II residues makes for the most stable economic structure, as well as for the most enduring [[political structure]].

[[File:Interior Columbus module.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Schlegel]] working on outfitting ''Columbus'']]
[[File:An artist's concept showing the International Space Station-RapidScat instrument against the station..jpg|thumb|One instrument mounted on ''Columbus'' was ISS-RapidScat, and this graphic shows the location of ''Columbus'' and where that instrument was mounted on the Module. The instrument was installed in 2014 and operated until 2016.]]
'''''Columbus''''' is a science laboratory that is part of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and is the largest single contribution to the ISS made by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

Like the ''[[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]]'' and ''[[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]]'' modules, the ''Columbus'' laboratory was constructed in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] by [[Thales Alenia Space]]. The functional equipment and software of the lab was designed by [[EADS]] in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]. It was also integrated in Bremen before being flown to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in [[Florida]] in an [[Airbus Beluga]]. It was launched aboard [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] on February 7, 2008 on flight [[STS-122]]. It is designed for ten years of operation.  The module is controlled by the [[Columbus Control Centre]], located at the German Space Operations Centre, part of the [[German Aerospace Center]] in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] near [[Munich]], Germany.

The European Space Agency has spent [[Euro|€]]1.4 billion (about [[United States dollar|US$]]2 billion) on building ''Columbus'', including the experiments that will fly in it and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts122/080211fd5/index3.html| title=Station arm pulls Columbus module from cargo bay| first=William| last=Harwood| date=February 11, 2008| publisher=[[Spaceflightnow.com]]| accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The laboratory is a cylindrical module with two end cones. It is {{convert|4477|mm|ftin|abbr=on}} in external diameter and {{convert|6871|mm|ftin|abbr=on}} in overall length, excluding the projecting external experiment racks. Its shape is very similar to that of the [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]]s (MPLMs),
since both were designed to fit in the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle orbiter. The starboard end cone contains most of the laboratory's on-board computers. The port end cone contains the [[Common Berthing Mechanism]].

== Construction ==
ESA chose [[EADS Astrium Space Transportation]] as prime contractor for ''Columbus''. The ''Columbus'' flight structure, the micro-meteorite protection system, the active and passive thermal control, the environmental control, the harness and all the related ground support equipment were designed and qualified by [[Alcatel Alenia Space]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] as defined by the PICA – Principle (for definition see History below); the related hardware was pre-integrated and sent as PICA in September 2001 to Bremen. The lab was then fully integrated and qualified on system level at the EADS Astrium Space Transportation facilities in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], Germany.

== Launch, berthing and outfitting ==
[[File:STS-122 Columbus Loading.jpg|thumb|right|Columbus installed in ''Atlantis''{{'}}s payload bay in preparation for launch]]
[[File:STS-122 docked Columbus.jpg|thumb|Columbus docked to the starboard side of ''Harmony'']]
In November 2007, ''Columbus'' was moved out of the KSC [[Space Station Processing Facility]], and installed into the payload bay of the ''Atlantis'' orbiter for launch on ISS assembly flight 1E ([[STS-122]]).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html | title = Space Shuttle Mission STS-122: The Voyage of Columbus | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- nasa shuttle page changes often ... need better cite--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During cryo-filling of the space shuttle [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] (ET) with [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] prior to the first launch attempt on December 6, 2007, two of four LH2 ECO sensors failed a test. Mission rules called for at least three of the four sensors to be in working order for a launch attempt to proceed. As a result of the failure, the Launch Director Doug Lyons postponed the launch, initially for 24 hours. This was later revised into a 72-hour delay, resulting in a next launch attempt set for Sunday December 9, 2007. This launch attempt was scrubbed when one of the ECO sensors again failed during fuelling.

The ECO sensors external connector was changed on the space shuttle external tank, causing a two-month delay in the launch. ''Columbus'' was finally launched successfully on the third attempt at 2:45pm EST, February 7, 2008.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Once at the station, [[Canadarm2]] removed ''Columbus'' from the docked shuttle's cargo bay
and attached it to the starboard hatch of ''[[Harmony Module|Harmony]]'' (also known as Node 2),
with the cylinder pointing outwards on February 11, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = Node 2, Columbus, Japanese Experiment Module and Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) installation animation | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition14/exp14_msb_012607.html | publisher = NASA | date=   2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research activities and payloads ==
{{see also|Scientific research on the ISS|ELIPS: European Programme for Life and Physical Sciences in Space}}
Activities in the lab are controlled on the ground by the [[Columbus Control Center]] (at [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]] [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] in Germany) and by the associated User Support Operations Centres throughout Europe.

The laboratory can accommodate ten active [[International Standard Payload Rack]]s (ISPRs) for science payloads.
Agreements with NASA allocate to ESA 51% usage of the Columbus Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
ESA is thus allocated five active rack locations, with the other five being allocated to NASA.
Four active rack locations are on the forward side of the deck, four on the aft side, and two are in overhead locations.

== History ==
{{main|Columbus program}}
[[File:Columbus logo.svg|thumb|The Columbus logo]]

''Columbus'' was originally planned as part of the Columbus program, an [[European Space Agency|ESA]] program to develop an autonomous manned [[space station]] that could be used for a variety of microgravity experiments. The program ran from 1986 to 1991 and included three components: a ''[[Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer|Man-Tended Free Flyer]]'' (MTFF) element  serviced by the [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] shuttle, an ''Attached Pressurized Module'' (APM), and a Polar Platform (''PPF''). After several budget cuts and cancellation of Hermes shuttle, all that remained in the Columbus program was the APM, finally renamed to ''Columbus''.

When only the APM was left in the program there were not enough tasks for the two main contributors Germany and Italy represented by [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]]-[[Entwicklungsring Nord|ERNO]] and [[Thales Alenia Space|Alenia]] respectively. As compromise the PICA (Pre Integrated Columbus APM) – Principle was invented meaning a split responsibility where Alenia as a co-prime is responsible for the overall Columbus configuration, the mechanical and thermal/life support systems, HFE and harness design/manufacturing whereas [[EADS Astrium Space Transportation]] is responsible for the overall Columbus design and all Avionics systems including electrical harness design and software.&lt;ref&gt;''MBB-ERNO'' was renamed to ''Deutsche Aerospace'' then ''Daimler-Benz Aerospace'' then ''DaimlerChrysler Aerospace'' then ''Astrium'' then ''EADS SPACE Transportation'' and finally EADS Astrium Space Transportation&lt;/ref&gt; Splitting off systems engineering responsibility and harness design under separate fixed-price contracts was found not to be advantageous with respect to efficiency and fast decision making as financial reasonings were pre-dominant in the last phase of development and verification.

[[File:Columbus beluga.jpg|thumb|right|Loading of ''Columbus'' at the [[Bremen Airport|Bremen airport]] into an [[Airbus Beluga]]]]
[[File:ISS 1E Configuration.jpg|thumb|right|''Columbus''{{'}}s position on the ISS]]

The structure used  for ''Columbus'' is based on the MPLM module built for [[NASA]] by Thales Alenia Space. In 2000 the pre-integrated module (structure including harness and tubing) was delivered to Bremen in Germany  by the Co-prime contractor Alenia. The final integration and system testing was performed by the overall prime contractor EADS Astrium Space Transportation, after that the initial Payload was integrated and the overall complement checked-out.

On May 27, 2006 ''Columbus'' was flown from [[Bremen]], Germany to [[Kennedy Space Center]] on board an Airbus Beluga.

The final schedule was much longer than originally planned due to development problems (several caused by the complex responsibility splitting between the Co-prime and the Overall prime contractor) and design changes introduced by ESA but being affordable due to the Shuttle problems delaying the ''Columbus'' launch for several years. The main design change was the addition of the ''External Payload Facility'' (EPF), which was driven by the different European Payload organizations being more interested in outer space than internal experiments. Also the addition of a terminal for direct communications to/from ground, which could have been used also as back-up for the ''ISS'' system, was studied but not implemented for cost reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12234">A '''coronagraph''' is a [[Telescope|telescopic]] attachment designed to block out the direct light from a [[star]] so that nearby objects &amp;ndash; which otherwise would be hidden in the star's bright [[Glare (vision)|glare]] &amp;ndash; can be resolved. Most coronagraphs are intended to view the [[corona]] of the [[Sun]], but a new class of conceptually similar instruments (called ''stellar coronagraphs'' to distinguish them from ''solar coronagraphs'') are being used to find [[extrasolar planet]]s and [[circumstellar disk]]s around nearby stars.

[[File:Cp22liberationdaytransient.png|thumb|right|200px|Coronagraph image of the Sun]]

==Invention==
The coronagraph was introduced in 1931 by the French astronomer [[Bernard Lyot]]; since then, coronagraphs have been used at many [[Solar observatory|solar observatories]]. Coronagraphs operating within [[Earth's atmosphere]] suffer from scattered light in the [[sky]] itself, due primarily to [[Rayleigh scattering]] of sunlight in the upper atmosphere. At view angles close to the Sun, the sky is much brighter than the background corona even at high altitude sites on clear, dry days. Ground-based coronagraphs, such as the [[High Altitude Observatory]]'s [[Mark IV Coronagraph]] on top of [[Mauna Loa]], use [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] to distinguish sky brightness from the image of the corona: both coronal light and [[sky brightness]] are scattered [[sunlight]] and have similar spectral properties, but the coronal light is [[Thomson-scattered]] at nearly a [[right angle]] and therefore undergoes [[Polarization (waves)#Propagation, reflection and scattering|scattering polarization]], while the superimposed light from the sky near the Sun is scattered at only a glancing angle and hence remains nearly unpolarized.

==Design==
[[File:Wendelstein Solar Telescope.jpg|thumb|Coronagraph at the [[Wendelstein_(mountain)#Mountain_weather_station_and_observatory|Wendelstein Observatory]]]]
Coronagraph instruments are extreme examples of [[stray light]] rejection and precise [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] because the total brightness from the solar corona is less than one millionth (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;) the brightness of the Sun. The apparent surface brightness is even fainter because, in addition to delivering less total light, the corona has a much greater apparent size than the Sun itself.

During a [[Solar eclipse|total solar eclipse]], the [[Moon]] acts as an occluding disk and any camera in the eclipse path may be operated as a coronagraph until the eclipse is over. More common is an arrangement where the sky is imaged onto an intermediate [[focal plane]] containing an opaque spot; this focal plane is reimaged onto a detector. Another arrangement is to image the sky onto a mirror with a small hole: the desired light is reflected and eventually reimaged, but the unwanted light from the star goes through the hole and does not reach the detector. Either way, the instrument design must take into account scattering and [[diffraction]] to make sure that as little unwanted light as possible reaches the final detector.  Lyot's key invention was an arrangement of lenses with stops, known as [[Lyot stop]]s, and baffles such that light scattered by diffraction was focused on the stops and baffles, where it could be absorbed, while light needed for a useful image missed them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umbra.gsfc.nasa.gov/spartan/coronagraphs.html] NASA page with diagrams of coronagraphs&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, imaging instruments on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] offer coronagraphic capability.

===Band-limited coronagraph===
A ''band-limited coronagraph'' uses a special kind of mask called a ''band-limited mask''.&lt;ref name="band-limited"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/570/2/900/54598.html | author=Kuchner and Traub | title=A Coronagraph with a Band-limited Mask for Finding Terrestrial Planets | journal=The [[Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=570 | issue=2 | year=2002 | pages=900–908 | doi=10.1086/339625 | bibcode=2002ApJ...570..900K|arxiv = astro-ph/0203455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mask is designed to block light and also manage diffraction effects caused by removal of the light. The band-limited coronagraph has served as the baseline design for the canceled [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] coronagraph.  Band-limited masks will also be available on the [[James Webb Space Telescope]].

===Phase-mask coronagraph===
A phase-mask coronagraph (such as the so-called four-quadrant phase-mask coronagraph) uses a transparent mask to shift the phase of the stellar light in order to create a self-destructive interference, rather than a simple opaque disc to block it. See also: [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/317707] [http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2010/10/exoplanet-hunters.html]

===Optical vortex coronagraph===
{{main|Vortex coronagraph}}
An [[optical vortex]] coronagraph uses a phase-mask in which the phase-shift varies azimuthally around the center. Several varieties of optical vortex coronagraphs exist:

* the ''scalar'' optical vortex coronagraph based on a phase ramp directly etched in a dielectric material, like fused silica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.rit.edu/~grovers/Doc/Publications/OVC.pdf optical vortex coronagraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~grovers/ovc.html Optical vortex coronagraph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903215113/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~grovers/ovc.html |date=2006-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''vector(ial)'' vortex coronagraph employs a mask that rotates the angle of polarization of photons, and ramping this angle of rotation has the same effect as ramping a phase-shift. A mask of this kind can be synthesized by various technologies, ranging from [[liquid crystal polymer]] (same technology as in [[3D television]]), and micro-structured surfaces (using [[microfabrication]] technologies from the [[microelectronics]] industry). Such a vector vortex coronagraph made out of liquid crystal polymers is currently in use at the 200-inch [[Hale telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]]. It has recently been operated with [[adaptive optics]] to image [[extrasolar planets]].

This works with stars other than the sun because they are so far away their light is, for this purpose, a spatially coherent plane wave.  The coronagraph using interference masks out the light along the center axis of the telescope, but allows the light from off axis objects through.

==Satellite-based coronagraphs==
Coronagraphs in [[outer space]] are much more effective than the same instruments would be if located on the ground. This is because the complete absence of atmospheric scattering eliminates the largest source of glare present in a terrestrial coronagraph. Several space missions such as [[NASA]]-[[ESA]]'s [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], and NASA's SPARTAN, [[Solar Maximum Mission]], and [[Skylab]] have used coronagraphs to study the outer reaches of the solar corona. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) is able to perform coronagraphy using the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stsci.edu/hst/nicmos/performance/coronagraphy NICMOS Coronagraphy]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are plans to have this capability on the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) using its Near Infrared Camera ([[NIRCam]]) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI).

While space-based coronagraphs such as [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory#Instruments|LASCO]] avoid the sky brightness problem, they face design challenges in stray light management under the stringent size and weight requirements of space flight. Any sharp edge (such as the edge of an occulting disk or optical aperture) causes [[Fresnel diffraction]] of incoming light around the edge, which means that the smaller instruments that one would want on a satellite unavoidably leak more light than larger ones would. The LASCO C-3 coronagraph uses both an external occulter (which casts shadow on the instrument) and an internal occulter (which blocks stray light that is Fresnel-diffracted around the external occulter) to reduce this "leakage", and a complicated system of baffles to eliminate stray light scattering off the internal surfaces of the instrument itself.

==Extrasolar planets==
The coronagraph has recently been adapted to the challenging task of finding planets around nearby stars. While stellar and solar coronagraphs are similar in concept, they are quite different in practice because the object to be occulted differs by a factor of a million in linear apparent size. (The Sun has an apparent size of about 1900 [[arcsecond]]s, while a typical nearby star might have an apparent size of 0.0005 and 0.002 arcseconds.) Earth-like exoplanet detection requires 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; contrast [http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2188371?origin_id=x4323&amp;start_year=1963]. To achieve such contrast requires extreme [[optothermal stability]].

A stellar coronagraph concept was studied for flight on the canceled [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] mission. On ground-based telescopes, a stellar coronagraph can be combined with [[adaptive optics]] to search for planets around nearby stars [http://www.adaptiveoptics.org/News_0805_1.html].

[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2003/02/image/a This link] shows an HST image of a dust disk surrounding a bright star with the star hidden by the coronagraph. &lt;!-- It would be nice to reformat this. --&gt;

In November 2008, NASA announced that a planet was directly observed orbiting the nearby star [[Fomalhaut]].  The planet could be seen clearly on images taken by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys' coronagraph in 2004 and 2006 [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut.html].  The dark area hidden by the coronagraph mask can be seen on the images, though a bright dot has been added to show where the star would have been.

[[File:444226main exoplanet20100414-a-full.jpg|250px|thumb|Direct image of [[exoplanet]]s around the star [[HR8799]] using a [[vector vortex coronagraph]] on a 1.5m portion of the [[Hale telescope]]]]
Up until the year 2010, [[telescope#Research telescopes|telescopes]] could only [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Direct imaging|directly image]] exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, it is easier to obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than [[Jupiter]]), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from [[NASA]]s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] demonstrated that a vector vortex coronagraph could enable small telescopes to directly image planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36528711/ns/technology_and_science-space/ New method could image Earth-like planets]&lt;/ref&gt; They did this by imaging the previously imaged [[HR 8799]] planets using just a 1.5 m portion of the [[Hale Telescope]].

Here is a list of [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA) Standards. The EIA ceased operations on February 11, 2011, but the former sectors continue to serve the constituencies of EIA.  EIA designated ECA to continue to develop standards for interconnect, passive and electro-mechanical (IP&amp;E) electronic components under the ANSI-designation of EIA standards. All other electronic components standards are managed by their respective sectors. ECA is expected to merge with the National Electronic Distributors Association (NEDA) to form the Electronic Components Industry Association (ECIA). However, the EIA standards brand will continue for IP&amp;E standards within ECIA.  As currently authorized, any ANSI standard designated at ANSI EIA-xxx is developed and/or managed by ECA (and, in the future, ECIA).&lt;br /&gt;

'''Electrogravitics''' is claimed to be an unconventional type of effect or [[anti-gravity]] force created by an [[electric field]]'s effect on a [[mass]]. The name was coined in the 1920s by the discoverer of the effect, [[Thomas Townsend Brown]], who spent most of his life trying to develop it and sell it as a propulsion system. Through Brown's promotion of the idea it was researched for a short while by aerospace companies in the 1950s. Electrogravitics is popular with [[conspiracy theorists]] with claims that it is powering [[flying saucer]]s and the [[B-2 Stealth Bomber]].

Since apparatus based on Browns' ideas have often yielded varying and highly controversial results when tested within controlled vacuum conditions, the effect observed has often been attributed to the ion drift or [[ion wind]] effect instead of anti-gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Origins==
Electrogravitics had its origins in experiments started in 1921 by Thomas Townsend Brown (who coined the name) while he was still in high school. He discovered an unusual effect while experimenting with a [[Coolidge tube]], a type of [[X-ray]] vacuum tube where, if he placed on a [[balance scale]] with the tube’s positive electrode facing up, the tube's mass seemed to decrease, when facing down the tube's mass seemed to increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chipdesignmag.com/carter/2012/12/10/thomas-townsend-brown-part-iv-of-the-holiday-serial/  The Canonical Hamiltonian The Intersection Of Chip Design and Physics by Hamilton Carter, Thomas Townsend Brown: Part IV of the Holiday Serial]&lt;/ref&gt; Brown showed this effect to his college professors and even newspaper reporters and told them he was convinced that he had managed to influence gravity electronically. Brown developed this into large high-voltage capacitors that would produce a tiny propulsive force causing the capacitor to jump in one direction when the power was turned on. In 1929 Brown published "How I Control Gravitation,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/HowIControl.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Paraellel Universe of T. Townsend Brown (excerpt)]&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Science and Invention'' where he claimed the capacitors were producing a mysterious force that interacted with the pull of gravity. He envisions a future where, if his device could be scaled up, "Multi-impulse gravitators weighing hundreds of tons may propel the ocean liners of the future" or even "fantastic 'space cars'" to Mars.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; Somewhere along the way Brown came up with the name [[Biefeld–Brown effect]], named after his former teacher, professor of astronomy [[Paul Alfred Biefeld]] at [[Denison University]] in [[Ohio]]. Brown claimed Biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/13_NFTRH_3_hemadethingsup.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Paraellel Universe of T. Townsend Brown, 2005-2006-2007-2008 - Tanglewood Books, Chapter 13: Notes from the Rabbit Hole #3: "He Made Things Up" (online excerpts)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alienscientist.com/brown.html alienscientist.com, Biefeld-Brown Effect Controversy, Tajmar ESA Experiments]&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II Brown sought to develop the effect as a means of propulsion for [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]], demonstrating a working apparatus to an audience of scientists and military officials in 1952. A Cal-Tech physicist invited to observe Brown's disk device in the early 50s noted during the demonstration that its motivation force was the well known phenomenon of "electric wind", and not anti-gravity, saying “I’m afraid these gentlemen played hooky from their high school physics classes….”&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttbrown.com/defying_gravity/64_PipeDreams.html Paul Schatzkin, Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T. Townsend Brown, 2005-2006-2007-2008 - Tanglewood Books, Chapter 64: Flying Saucer Pipe Dreams (online excerpts)]&lt;/ref&gt; Research in the phenomenon was popular in the mid-1950s, at one point the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] placed advertisements looking for scientists who were "interested in gravity", but rapidly declined in popularity thereafter.

Since this effect could not be explained by known physics at the time, the effect has been believed to be caused by ionized particles that produces a type of ion drift or [[ionic wind]] that transfers its momentum to surrounding neutral particles, an [[electrokinetic phenomena]] or more widely referred to as ''[[electrohydrodynamics]]'' (EHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Claims==
Electrogravitics has become popular with [[unidentified flying object|UFO]], anti-gravity, and government conspiracy theorists&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; where it is seen as an example of something much more exotic than [[electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetics]], i.e. that electrogravitics is a true anti-gravity technology that can "create a force that depends upon an object’s mass, even as gravity does".&lt;ref name="jnaudin.free.fr"&gt;Thomas F. Valone, Progress in Electrogravitics and Electrokinetics for Aviation and Space Travel - Integrity Research Institute, Washington DC [http://jnaudin.free.fr/lifters/files/ElectrograviticsElectrokineticsValone.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There are claims that all major aerospace companies in the 1950s including Martin, Convair, Lear, Sperry, Raytheon were working on it, that the technology became highly classified in the early 1960s, that it is used to power the B-2 bomber,&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it can be used to generate "[[Free energy suppression|free energy]]".&lt;ref name="bibliotecapleyades.net"&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/lostjournals/lostjournals06.htm Chapter Six  UFOs and Electrogravity Propulsion, Did Tesla Discover the Secrets of Antigravity?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Berlitz]] devoted an entire chapter of his book on [[The Philadelphia Experiment]] (''The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility'') to a retelling of Brown's early work with the effect, implying the electrogravitics effect was being used by UFOs. The researcher and author Paul LaViolette has produced many self-published books on electrogravitics, making many claims over the years including his view that the technology could have helped to avoid another [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]].

===Criticism===
Many claims as to the validity of electrogravitics as an anti-gravity force revolve around research and videos on the internet purported to show lifter-style capacitor devices working in a vacuum, therefore not receiving propulsion from ion drift or [[ion wind]] being generated in air.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Valone, Electrogravitics II: Validating Reports on a New Propulsion Methodology,  Integrity Research Institute, page 52-58&lt;/ref&gt; Followups on the claims (R. L. Talley in a 1990 U.S. Air Force study, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell in a 2003 experiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Martin Tajmar]] in a 2004 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tajmar | first1 = M. | title = Biefeld-Brown Effect: Misinterpretation of Corona Wind Phenomena | journal = AIAA Journal | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 315 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.2514/1.9095|bibcode = 2004AIAAJ..42..315T }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have found that no thrust could be observed in a vacuum, consistent with the phenomenon of ion wind. Campbell pointed out to a [[Wired (magazine)|Wired magazine]] reporter that creating a true vacuum similar to space for the test requires tens of thousands of dollars in equipment.

[[Byron Preiss]] in his 1985 book on the current science and future of the Solar System titled ''The Planets'' commented that electrogravitics development seemed to be "much ado about nothing, started by a bunch of engineers who didn't know enough physics".  Preiss stated that electrogravitics, like [[exobiology]], is "a science without a single specimen for study".&lt;ref name=Priess&gt;{{cite book|title=The Planets|author=Byron Preiss|year=1985|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|isbn=0-553-05109-1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor version of the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|national coat of arms]] ([[armillary sphere]] and Portuguese shield) is entered over the boundary between the colours at equal distance from the upper and lower edges. The field colours, especially the green, originally represented a radical [[republicanism|republican]]-inspired change that broke the bond with the former religious monarchical flag. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandised as representing the hope of the nation (green) and the blood (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment.

The entered coat of arms of Serbia is double-headed white eagle and a red shield with a white cross surrounded by 4 firesteels ("ocila"), a symbol that draws roots from Byzantine coat of arms (where cross is surrounded by four Greek letters Beta) and from much deeper past of the Balkan peninsula, as it can be seen on 7000 years old Vinca culture&lt;ref&gt;[[Vinča culture]]&lt;/ref&gt; pottery and many other later traditional Balkan cultural remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://romaniatricolor.deviantart.com/art/CoA-Serbian-Cross_Ocilo-258495529 Infos on romaniatricolor.deviantart.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine horizontal stripes represent the traditional dioceses of Brittany into which the duchy was divided historically.

The flag is rectangular in form and is characterised by the presence of the ''[[Flag of Sicily|Trinacria]] ([[triskelion]])'' in the centre.  It features a softened image of the winged-head of [[Medusa]] and three ears of wheat (replacing snakeheads) representing the island's fertility.

The background of the flag is divided by a diagonal from left to right, and is coloured gold (lower left) and red-orange (upper right).  The colours represent the cities of Palermo and Corleone, respectively, the first two to found a confederation against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] rule.

'''''Hidden Figures''''' is a 2016 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Theodore Melfi]] and written by Melfi and [[Allison Schroeder]]. It is loosely based on the [[non-fiction]] book [[Hidden Figures (book)|of the same name]] by [[Margot Lee Shetterly]] about black female [[mathematician]]s who worked at the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) during the [[Space Race]]. The film stars [[Taraji P. Henson]] as [[Katherine Johnson]], a mathematician who calculated flight trajectories for [[Project Mercury]] and other missions. The film also features [[Octavia Spencer]] as NASA supervisor and mathematician [[Dorothy Vaughan]] and [[Janelle Monáe]] as NASA engineer [[Mary Jackson (engineer)|Mary Jackson]], with [[Kevin Costner]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Jim Parsons]], [[Glen Powell]], and [[Mahershala Ali]] in supporting roles.

Principal photography began in March 2016 in [[Atlanta]] and was wrapped up in May 2016. ''Hidden Figures'' had a limited release on December 25, 2016, by [[20th Century Fox]], before going wide in the United States on
January 6, 2017. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $236 million worldwide. It was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the top ten films of 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/2016/  |title=National Board of Review Announces 2016 Award Winners |publisher=[[National Board of Review]] |date=November 29, 2016 |accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for numerous awards, including three [[Academy Award|Oscar nominations]] ([[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Spencer), and two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]] ([[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]] for Spencer and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]). It also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]].

==Plot==
In [[1961 in the United States|1961]], mathematician [[Katherine Johnson|Katherine Goble]] works as a [[human computer]] in the [[sex segregation|gender segregated]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] division [[West Area Computers]] of the [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], alongside her colleagues, aspiring engineer [[Mary Jackson (engineer)|Mary Jackson]] and their unofficial acting-supervisor [[Dorothy Vaughan]].

Following the successful [[Soviet]] launch of [[Yuri Gagarin]], pressure to send American [[astronaut]]s into space increases. Supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrison's [[Space Task Group]], given her skills in [[analytic geometry]]. She becomes the first black woman on the team.

Katherine's new colleagues are initially dismissive and demeaning, especially head engineer Paul Stafford. Meanwhile, Mitchell informs Dorothy that she will not be promoted, as there are no plans to assign a "permanent supervisor for the colored group". Mary is assigned to the space capsule [[heat shield]] team, and immediately identifies a flaw. With encouragement from the team leader, a Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivor, she submits an application for an official NASA engineer position and begins to pursue additional engineering coursework, as she already has a mathematics and physical science degree, but needs additional certification courses offered only through the all-white nearby Hampton high school.  First, Mary successfully petitions a local judge to grant her legal authorization to attend the segregated all white school.

Katherine meets [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] Lt. Col. Jim Johnson at a barbecue, but she is disappointed when he voices skepticism about women's mathematical abilities. He later apologizes, and begins spending time with Katherine and her three daughters.

When Harrison invites his subordinates to solve a complex [[mathematical equation]], Katherine develops the solution, leaving him impressed. The [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] astronauts visit Langley and astronaut [[John Glenn]] is cordial to the West Area Computers.

Harrison is enraged when he finds out that Katherine is forced to walk a half-mile (800 meters) to another building to use the colored people's bathroom. Harrison abolishes bathroom segregation, knocking down the "Colored Bathroom" sign. Harrison allows Katherine to be included in their meetings, in which she creates an equation within that meeting to guide the space capsule during re-entry. Despite this, Katherine is forced to remove her name from the reports, which are credited solely to Stafford. Stafford said that computers cannot author such things. Meanwhile, Mary goes to court and convinces the judge to grant her permission to attend night classes in an all-white school to obtain her engineering degree.

Dorothy learns of the impending installation of an [[IBM 7090]] electronic computer that could replace human computers. She visits the computer room to learn about it, and successfully starts the machine. Later, she visits a public library, where the librarian scolds her for visiting the whites-only section, to borrow a book about [[Fortran]]. She stole that book and began studying on her own. After teaching herself programming and training her West Area co-workers, she is officially promoted to supervise the Programming Department, bringing 30 of her co-workers with her. Mitchell eventually addresses Dorothy as "Mrs. Vaughan," indicating her new-found respect.

As the final arrangements for [[Mercury-Atlas 6|John Glenn's launch]] are made, Katherine is reassigned back to West Area Computers. Harrison told her that they no longer needs computer in their department and it's beyond his decision. As a wedding and farewell gift from her colleagues (Katherine is now married to Jim Johnson), Katherine is given a pearl necklace, the only jewelry allowed under the dress code.

The day of the launch, discrepancies arise in the IBM 7090 calculations for the capsule's landing coordinates, and Astronaut Glenn requests that Katherine be called in to check them. She quickly does so, only to have the door slammed in her face after delivering the results to the control room. However, Harrison gives her a security pass so they can relay the results to Glenn together. 
After a successful launch and orbit, the space capsule has a heat shield problem. Mission control decides to land it after three orbits instead of seven. Katherine suggests that they leave the retro-rocket attached to the heat shield for reentry. The instructions prove correct, and [[Friendship 7]] successfully lands.

Following the mission, the mathematicians are laid off and ultimately replaced by electronic computers. Katherine is reassigned to the Analysis and Computation Division, Dorothy continues to supervise the Programming Department, and Mary obtains her engineering degree and gains employment at NASA as an engineer. At the end of the film, we see Stafford, showing a change of heart, bringing Katherine a cup of coffee and accepting that her name is included on the report.

An [[epilogue]] reveals that Katherine calculated the trajectories for the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Space Shuttle]] missions. In 2015 she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. The following year, NASA dedicated the [[Langley Research Center]]'s Katherine G. Johnson Computational Building in her honor.

==Historical accuracy==
The film, set at NASA Langley Research Center in 1961, depicts segregated facilities such as the West Area Computing unit, where an all-black group of female mathematicians were originally required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. However, in reality, Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to supervisor of West Computing in 1949, becoming the first black supervisor at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) and one of the few female supervisors. In 1958, when NACA became NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers transferred to the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/dorothy-vaughan-biography |title=Dorothy Vaughan Biography &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Jackson was the one who had to find her own way to a colored bathroom, which did exist on the East Side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidden Figures|last=Shetterly|first=Margot Lee|publisher=William Morrow|year=2016|isbn=978-0-06-236359-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Katherine (then Goble) was originally unaware that the East Side bathrooms were segregated, and used the unlabeled "whites-only" bathrooms for years before anyone complained.&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Amina |date=February 26, 2017 |title=Q&amp;A: Our interview with Katherine G.

"I didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job ... and play bridge at lunch. I didn't feel any segregation.

Mary Jackson did not have to get a court order to attend night classes at the whites-only high school. She asked the city of Hampton for an exception, and it was granted. The school turned out to be run down and dilapidated, a hidden cost of running two parallel school systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidden Figures|last=Shetterly|first=Margot Lee|publisher=William Morrow|year=2016|isbn=978-0-06-236359-6|pages=144–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She completed her engineering courses and earned a promotion to engineer in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/mary-jackson-biography |title=Mary Jackson Biography &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=December 2, 2016 |accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine Goble/Johnson carpooled with Eunice Smith, a nine-year West End computer veteran at the time Katherine joined NACA. Smith was her neighbor and friend from sorority and church choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidden Figures|last=Shetterly|first=Margot Lee|publisher=William Morrow|year=2016|isbn=978-0-06-236359-6|pages=120–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three Goble children were teenagers at the time of Katherine's marriage to Jim Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidden Figures|last=Shetterly|first=Margot Lee|publisher=William Morrow|year=2016|isbn=978-0-06-236359-6|pages=185, 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine Goble/Johnson was assigned to the Flight Research Division in 1953, a move that soon became permanent. When the Space Task Group was created in 1958, engineers from the Flight Research Division formed the core of the Group, and Katherine moved along with them. She coauthored a research report in 1960, the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography |title=Katherine Johnson Biography |last=Shetterly |first=Margot Lee |date=December 1, 2016 |website=NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=March 2, 2017 |quote=authored or coauthored 26 research reports.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine gained access to editorial meetings as of 1958 simply through persistence, not because one particular meeting was critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidden Figures|last=Shetterly|first=Margot Lee|publisher=William Morrow|year=2016|isbn=978-0-06-236359-6|pages=179, 181–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Johnson_Katherine.html |title=Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=School of Mathematics &amp; Statistics University of St Andrews, UK |publisher=School of Mathematics &amp; Statistics University of St Andrews, UK |accessdate=March 1, 2017 |quote=Excerpt from W.

The Space Task Group was led by [[Robert Gilruth]], not the fictional character Al Harrison, who was created to simplify a more complex management structure.

The scene where Harrison smashes the Colored Ladies Room sign never happened, as in real life Katherine refused to walk the extra distance to use the colored bathroom and, in her words, "just went to the White one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/story/oscar-nominated-hidden-figures-was-whitewashed-but-it-didnt-have-to-be |title=''Space So White'' - Oscar-nominated "Hidden Figures" was whitewashed — but it didn't have to be |publisher=Vice.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison also lets her into Mission Control to witness the launch. Neither scene happened in real life, and screenwriter Theodore Melfi said he saw no problem with adding the scenes, "There needs to be white people who do the right thing, there needs to be black people who do the right thing, and someone does the right thing. And so who cares who does the right thing, as long as the right thing is achieved?" Dexter Thomas of ''[[Vice News]]'' criticized Melfi's additions as creating the [[white savior narrative in film|white savior trope]], "In this case, it means that a white person doesn't have to think about the possibility that, were they around back in the 1960s South, they might have been one of the bad ones."&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Dexter |url=https://news.vice.com/story/oscar-nominated-hidden-figures-was-whitewashed-but-it-didnt-have-to-be |title=Space so white: The Oscar-nominated 'Hidden Figures' was whitewashed — but it didn't have to be |work=[[Vice News]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Megan Garber said that the film's "narrative trajectory" involved "thematic elements of the white savior".&lt;ref name="garber"&gt;{{cite news |last=Garber |first=Megan |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/hidden-figures-and-the-appeal-of-math-in-an-age-of-inequality/513434/ |title=''Hidden Figures'' and the Appeal of Math in an Age of Inequality |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=January 18, 2017 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |quote=''Hidden Figures''{{'}}s narrative trajectory involves not just progress that emerges, too often, from pettiness, but also thematic elements of the white savior, and of a culturally enforced tiara syndrome. All those things effectively temper the idealism of its message.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melfi said he found "hurtful" the "accusations of a 'white savior' storyline", saying, "It was very upsetting to me because I am at a place where I've lived my life colorless and I grew up in Brooklyn. I walked to school with people of all shapes, sizes, and colors, and that's how I've lived my life. So it's very upsetting that we still have to have this conversation. I get upset when I hear 'black film,' and so does Taraji P. Henson ... It's just a film. And if we keep labeling something 'a black film,' or 'a white film'— basically it's modern day segregation. We're all humans. Any human can tell any human's story. I don't want to have this conversation about black film or white film anymore. I wanna have conversations about film."

''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Zeba Blay said of Melfi's frustration, "His frustration is also a perfect example of how, when it comes to open dialogue about depictions of people of color on screen, it behooves white people (especially those who position themselves as 'allies') to listen ... the inclusion of the bathroom scene doesn't make Melfi a bad filmmaker, or a bad person, or a racist. But his suggestion that a feel-good scene like that was needed for the marketability and overall appeal of the film speaks to the fact that Hollywood at large still has a long way to go in telling black stories, no matter how many strides have been made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blay |first=Zeba |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hidden-figures-and-the-diversity-conversation-we-arent-having_us_58adc9bee4b0d0a6ef470492 |title='Hidden Figures' And The Diversity Conversation We Aren't Having |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 23, 2017 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author Margot Lee Shetterly has agreed that there are differences between her book and the movie, but found that to be understandable. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;For better or for worse, there is history, there is the book and then there's the movie. Timelines had to be conflated and [there were] composite characters, and for most people [who have seen the movie] have already taken that as the literal fact. ... You might get the indication in the movie that these were the only people doing those jobs, when in reality we know they worked in teams, and those teams had other teams. There were sections, branches, divisions, and they all went up to a director. There were so many people required to make this happen. ... It would be great for people to understand that there were so many more people. Even though Katherine Johnson, in this role, was a hero, there were so many others that were required to do other kinds of tests and checks to make [Glenn's] mission come to fruition. But I understand you can't make a movie with 300 characters. It is simply not possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/35145-hidden-figures-right-stuff-history.html |title='Hidden Figures': 'The Right Stuff' vs. Real Stuff in New Film About NASA History |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |date=December 27, 2016 |website=Space.com |publisher=Purch |accessdate=March 2, 2017 |quote=Shetterly was still writing her book when production of the film began — it was only just released in September — but she was also available to the filmmakers as they sought to condense a story spanning a few decades into their setting of just a couple of years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Glenn's flight was not terminated early as incorrectly stated in the movie's closing subtitles. The MA-6 mission was planned for three orbits and landed at the expected time. The press kit published before launch states that "The Mercury Operations Director may elect a one, two or three orbit mission." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mira.hq.nasa.gov/history/ws/hdmshrc/all/main/DDD/16286.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525123504/https://mira.hq.nasa.gov/history/ws/hdmshrc/all/main/DDD/16286.PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |title=Mercury Atlas 6 at a Glance, page 1 |publisher=NASA |date= |accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post mission report also shows that retrofire was scheduled to occur on the third orbit. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/mercury/ma-6/docs/ma-6-results.pdf |title=Results of the First United States Manned Orbital Space Flight, Table 6-II Sequence of Events During MA-6 Flight, Page 71 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott Carpenter's subsequent flight in May was also scheduled and flew for three orbits, and Walter Schirra's planned six-orbit flight in October required extensive modifications to the Mercury capsule's life support system to allow him to fly a nine-hour mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=David|title=The History of Manned Space Flight, page 137|year=1981 |publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn= 0-517-54377-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "go for at least seven orbits" that is in the mission transcript refers to the fact that the Atlas booster had placed Glenn's capsule into an orbit that would be stable for at least seven orbits, not that he had permission to stay up that long.

The Mercury Control Center was located at Cape Canaveral, Florida, not at the Langley Research Center in Virginia. The orbit plots displayed in the front of the room incorrectly show a six-orbit mission, which did not happen until Walter Schirra's MA-8 mission in October 1962. The movie also incorrectly shows NASA flight controllers monitoring live telemetry from the Soviet Vostok launch, which the Soviet Union would not have been sharing with NASA in 1961.

=== Charity screenings ===
After ''Hidden Figures'' was released on December 25, 2016, certain charities, institutions and independent businesses who regard the film as relevant to the cause of improving youth awareness in education and careers in the [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) fields, organized free screenings of the film in order to spread the message of the film's subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glamour.com/story/hidden-figures-inspiring-young-women-science-and-technology|title=The Hidden Figures Effect Is Real: How It's Inspiring Young Women to Seek Careers in Science and Technology|first=Marissa G.|last=Muller|date=January 30, 2017|work=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaborative effort between Western New York STEM Hub, [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] allowed more than 200 Buffalo Public School students, [[Girl Scouts]] and teachers to see the film. WBFO's Senior Reporter Eileen Buckley stated the event was designed to help encourage a new generation of women to consider [[Women in STEM fields|STEM careers]].

Also, the film's principal actors (Henson, Spencer, Monáe and Parsons), director (Melfi), producer/musical creator (Williams), and other non-profit outside groups have offered free screenings to ''Hidden Figures'' at several cinema locations around the world. Some of the screenings were open to all-comers, while others were arranged to benefit girls, women and the underprivileged. The campaign began as individual activism by Spencer, and made a total of more than 1,500 seats for ''Hidden Figures'' available, free of charge, to poor individuals and families. The end result was seven more screenings for people who otherwise might not have been able to afford to see the 20th Century Fox film - in Atlanta (sponsored by Monáe), in Washington, D.C. (sponsored by Henson), in Chicago (also Henson), in Houston (by Parsons), in Hazelwood, Missouri (by Melfi and actress/co-producer Kimberly Quinn), and in Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Virginia (both sponsored by Williams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/hidden-figures-free-screenings-1201971825/|title=Free Screenings of 'Hidden Figures' Go Wide: From L.A. to Australia|first=James|last=Rainey|date=January 27, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, [[AMC Theatres]] and 21st Century Fox announced that free screenings of ''Hidden Figures'' would take place in celebration of [[Black History Month]] in up to 14 select U.S. cities (including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami).

Following the 2017 ''Lego Ideas Contest'', Denmark-based toy maker [[The Lego Group]] announced that will manufacture a fan-designed ''Women of NASA'' figurine set of five female scientists, engineers and astronauts, as based on real women who have worked for the NASA Space Agency. The [[Lego minifigure|minifigure]]s set did not end up including any of the figures from the film. It had computer scientist [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]]; astronaut, physicist and educator [[Sally Ride]]; astronomer [[Nancy Grace Roman]]; and astronaut and physician [[Mae Jemison]] (who is also African American). The ''Women of NASA'' set was released November 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/01/hidden-figures-no-more-female-nasa-staff-to-be-immortalised-in-lego |title=Hidden figures no more: female Nasa staff to be immortalised in Lego |last=Malkin |first=Bonnie |date=February 28, 2017 |website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/trending-now/lego-set-to-honor-women-of-nasa-including-katherine-johnson-of-hidden-figures_/498510195 |title=Lego set to honor women of NASA, including Katherine Johnson of 'Hidden Figures' |last=Ewing |first=Michelle |date=March 1, 2017 |publisher=[[WSB-TV]] |access-date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/543b47ec-781a-4f32-a2f6-ca605c91f48b&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 262 reviews, with an [[average score]] of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "In heartwarming, crowd-pleasing fashion, ''Hidden Figures'' celebrates overlooked—and crucial—contributions from a pivotal moment in American history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hidden_figures/ |title=Hidden Figures (2017) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hidden-figures |title=Hidden Figures Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A+" on an A+ to F scale,&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CinemaScore/status/817600462119702528 |title=''Hidden Figures'' |author=[[CinemaScore]] on [[Twitter]] |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service to receive such a score.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Simon Thompson of [[IGN]] gave the film a rating of 9/10, writing, "''Hidden Figures'' fills in an all too forgotten, or simply too widely unknown, blank in US history in a classy, engaging, entertaining and hugely fulfilling way. Superb performances across the board and a fascinating story alone make ''Hidden Figures'' a solid, an accomplished and deftly executed movie that entertains, engages and earns your time, money and attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2016/12/14/hidden-figures-review|title=Hidden Figures|last=Thompson|first=Simon|date=14 December 2016|website=[[IGN]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote, "the film's made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them. Best of all, you come out of the movie knowing who Katherine Johnson and Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson are, and so do your daughters and sons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2017/01/04/hidden-figures-history-lesson-with-math-appeal/GPfea4Sr2lqUDdJAwT09jI/story.html|title='Hidden Figures' is a crowd-pleaser with math appeal|last=Burr|first=Ty|date=4 January 2017|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayton Davis of Awards Circuit gave the film 3.5 stars, saying "Precisely marketed as terrific adult entertainment for the Christmas season, ''Hidden Figures'' is a faithful and truly beautiful portrait of our country's consistent gloss over the racial tensions that have divided and continue to plague the fabric our existence. Lavishly engaging from start to finish, ''Hidden Figures'' may be able to catch the most inopportune movie-goer off guard and cause them to fall for its undeniable and classic storytelling. The film is not to be missed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awardscircuit.com/2016/12/11/film-review-hidden-figures-is-pure-goodness-featuring-a-stellar-cast/|title=Film Review: 'Hidden Figures' Is Pure Goodness Featuring a Stellar Cast|last=Davis|first=Clayton|date=11 December 2016|website=AwardsCircuit|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews criticized the film for its fictional embellishments and conventional, feel-good style. Tim Grierson, writing for Screen International, states that "Hidden Figures is almost patronisingly earnest in its depiction of sexism and racism. An air of do-gooder self-satisfaction hovers over the proceedings",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/hidden-figures-review/5111374.article|title='Hidden Figures': Review|last=Grierson|first=Tim|date=11 December 2016|website=[[Screen International]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jesse Hassenger at [[The A.V. Club]] comments that "lack of surprise is in this movie's bones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://film.avclub.com/good-performances-can-t-blast-hidden-figures-out-of-pre-1798189959|title=Good performances can't blast Hidden Figures out of prestige convention|last=Hassenger|first=Jese|date=20 December 2016|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric John of IndieWire argues that the film "trivializes history; as a hagiographic tribute to its brilliant protagonists, it doesn't dig into the essence of their struggles"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/hidden-figures-review-octavia-spencer-taraji-p-henson-nasa-1201756595/|title=Hidden Figures Review|last=Kohn|first=Eric|date=11 December 2016|website=[[IndieWire]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly, Paul Byrnes concludes that "When a film purports to be selling history, we're entitled to ask where the history went, even if it offers a good time instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/hidden-figures-review-these-trailblazing-women-deserve-better-20170214-gucbs5.html|title=Hidden Figures review: these trailblazing women deserve better|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|date=14 February 2017|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institutional model theory''' generalizes a large portion of [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[model theory]] to an arbitrary [[logical system]].

== Overview ==
The notion of "logical system" here is formalized as an [[Institution (computer science)|institution]]. Institutions constitute a model-oriented meta-theory on logical systems similar to how the theory of [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s and [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s constitute a meta-theory for classical [[linear algebra]]. Another analogy can be made with [[universal algebra]] versus [[Group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s etc. By abstracting away from the realities of the actual conventional logics, it can be noticed that institution theory comes in fact closer to the realities of non-conventional logics.

Institutional model theory analyzes and generalizes classical model-theoretic notions and results, like

* Elementary diagrams
* [[Elementary embedding]]s
* [[Ultraproduct]]s, [[Los' theorem]]
* [[Saturated model]]s
* [[Axiomatizable class|axiomatizability]]
* [[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]], [[Garrett Birkhoff|Birkhoff]] axiomatizability
* [[Craig interpolation]]
* [[Robinson's joint consistency theorem|Robinson consistency]]
* [[Evert Willem Beth|Beth]] definability
* [[Gödel]]'s [[completeness theorem]]

For each concept and theorem, the infrastructure and properties required are analyzed and formulated as conditions on institutions, thus providing a detailed insight on which properties of first-order logic they rely and how much they can be generalized to other logics.

The '''Jepson School of Leadership Studies''', founded in 1992 at the [[University of Richmond]], is dedicated to the academic study of [[leadership]].  The school is named for benefactors [[Robert S. Jepson, Jr.]], and his wife, Alice Andrews Jepson. The school opened as the first undergraduate school of [[leadership studies]] in the United States with a full-time multidisciplinary faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jepson.richmond.edu/about/history/index.html|title=Jepson School of Leadership Studies: History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{paraphrasing|date=June 2017}}
In 1987, Jepson School of Leadership Studies founders, Robert S.

The first dean of the school was Howard T. Prince, who developed leadership programs for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]] in West Point. [[James MacGregor Burns|James McGregor Burns]], a preeminent scholar in leadership studies, was named a senior fellow. The school's inaugural faculty included Joanne Ciulla, Richard Couto, Karin Klenke, William Howe,Gill Hickman, and J.

{{Infobox Telescope}}
'''KAT-7''' is a [[radio telescope]] constructed in the [[Northern Cape]] of [[South Africa]]. Part of the [[Karoo]] Array Telescope project, it is the precursor engineering test bed to the larger [[MeerKAT]] telescope, but it has become a science instrument in its own right. The construction was completed in 2011 and commissioned in 2012. It also served as a technology demonstrator for [[South Africa]]'s bid to host the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref name="cmen-April-2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/an-array-of-technology-spin-offs-emerges-as-the-meerkat-radio-telescope-gains-traction-2009-04-03|title=An array of technology spin-offs emerges as the ‘MeerKAT’ radio telescope gains traction |last=Campbell|first=Keith|date=2009-04-03|publisher=Martin Creamer Engineering News|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; KAT-7 is the first Radio telescope to be built with a composite reflector and uses a [[stirling pump]] for 75&amp;nbsp;K cryogenic cooling. The telescope was built to test various system for the MeerKAT array, from the [[ROACH]] [[correlators]] designed and manufactured in [[Cape Town]], now used by various telescopes internationally, to composite construction techniques.&lt;ref name="ROACH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/PAPER_Correlator|title=International Correlator Collaboration &amp;#124;|accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the short baselines the telescope is suited to observing diffuse sources, but will begin [[VLBI]] observation in 2013.

== Technical Specifications ==
KAT-7 consist of 7 dishes of 12 metres in diameter each a Prime Focus [[Reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="dishes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.ska.ac.za/kat-7|title=KAT-7|publisher=[[SKA South Africa Project]]|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MeerKAT supports a wide range of observing modes, including deep continuum, polarisation and [[spectral line]] imaging, [[pulsar timing]] and transient searches. A range of standard data products are provided, including an imaging pipeline. A number of "data spigots" are also available to support user-provided instrumentation. Significant design and qualification efforts are planned to ensure high reliability in order to achieve low operational cost and high availability.

A '''laboratory''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|l|ə|ˈ|b|ɒr|ə|t|ər|i}}, {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|l|æ|b|ər|ə|t|ɔːr|i}}; colloquially '''lab''') is a facility that provides controlled conditions in which [[science|scientific]] or technological research, [[experiment]]s, and [[measurement]] may be performed.

==Overview==
Laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering. A [[physics]] laboratory might contain a [[particle accelerator]] or [[vacuum chamber]], while a [[metallurgy]] laboratory could have apparatus for [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] or [[refining]] metals or for testing their [[strength of materials|strength]]. A [[chemistry|chemist]] or [[biology|biologist]] might use a [[wet laboratory]], while a [[psychology|psychologist's]] laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by [[computer scientist]]s, [[computer]]s (sometimes [[supercomputer]]s) are used for either [[computer simulation|simulations]] or the [[data analysis|analysis]] of [[data]]. Scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories. [[Engineers]] use laboratories as well to design, build, and test technological devices.

Scientific laboratories can be found as research room and [[learning space]]s in [[school]]s and [[university|universities]], [[industry]], [[government]], or [[military]] facilities, and even aboard [[ship]]s and [[spacecraft]].

Despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latour|first1=Bruno|title=Science in action: How to follow scientists and engineers through society|publisher=Cambridge: Harvard University Press|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the term "laboratory" is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as [[Living lab|Living Labs]], [[Fab lab|Fab Labs]], or [[Hackerspace]]s, in which people meet to work on societal problems or make [[prototype]]s, working collaboratively or sharing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Joe|title=Ford + TechShop: Getting Employees to Tinker|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/05/ford-techshop/|work=Wired|date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burress|first1=Charles|title=A Tinkerer's Paradise in Berkeley / Young, old inventors are offered tools, techniques and inspiration|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-Tinkerer-s-Paradise-in-Berkeley-Young-old-2788368.php|work=SF Chronicle|date=December 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Adam|title=Top 8 Tools for Building a Personal Prototyping Laboratory|url=https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?doc_id=1319407|work=EE Times|date=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is inspired by new, [[Participatory science|participatory approaches]] to science and innovation and relies on user-centred design methods&lt;ref&gt;ISO 13407:(1999), titled Human-centred design processes for interactive systems, is an ISO Standard providing Guidance on human-centred design activities throughout the life cycle of interactive computer-based systems.&lt;/ref&gt; and concepts like [[Open innovation]] or [[User innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;Von Hippel, E. (1986). Lead users: a source of novel product concepts. Management Science 32, 791–805.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chesbrough, H.W. (2003). Open Innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. One distinctive feature of work in Open Labs is phenomena of translation, driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fritzsche|first1=A|title=Corporate Foresight in Open Laboratories - A Translational Approach|journal=Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management|volume=30|issue=6|pages=646–657| date=2017 | doi=10.1080/09537325.2017.1380180}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

Early instances of "laboratories" recorded in English involved [[alchemy]] and the preparation of [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{OED | laboratory}}: "Originally: a room or building for the practice of alchemy and the preparation of medicines. Later: one equipped for carrying out scientific experiments or procedures, esp. for the purposes of research, teaching, or analysis; (also) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured."
&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[Big Science]] during [[World War II]] increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment, introducing [[particle accelerator]]s and similar devices.

=== The early laboratories ===

The earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of [[Pythagoras]] of Samos, the well-known Greek philosopher and scientist. This laboratory was created when [[Pythagoras]] conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=World's Oldest Laboratory|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=30 May 2012|volume=62|issue=13|pages=701A|doi=10.1021/ac00212a716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the painting of [[Louis Pasteur]] by [[Albert Edelfelt]] in 1885, [[Louis Pasteur]] is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand, and not wearing any [[personal protective equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schummer|first1=Joachim|last2=Spector|first2=Tami I|title=The Visual Image of Chemistry: Perspectives from the History of Art and Science|journal=HYLE International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry|date=July 2007|issue=1|pages=3–41|url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/13-1/schummer-spector.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Researching in teams started in the 19th century, and many new kinds of equipment were developed in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|title=Laboratory history: The chemistry chronicles|journal=Nature|date=27 May 2015|volume=521|issue=7553|pages=422|doi=10.1038/521422a|bibcode=2015Natur.521..422L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 16th century underground alchemical laboratory was accidentally discovered in the year 2002. [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] was believed to be the owner. The laboratory is called Speculum Alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Alchemy|url=http://www.alchemiae.cz/en|website=Speculum Alchemiae|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on [[natural sciences]] such as [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[physics]] to conduct an experiment, all of them follow the [[scientific method]]; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from [[laboratory glassware]] to electrical devices, and others require more specific or expensive supplies.

==Equipment and supplies==
[[File:Lab glassware.jpg|thumb|250px|Three [[beaker (glassware)|beakers]], an [[Erlenmeyer flask]], a [[graduated cylinder]] and a [[volumetric flask]]]]
Laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory:

The classical equipment includes tools such as [[Bunsen burner]]s and [[microscope]]s as well as specialty equipment such as [[operant conditioning chamber]]s, [[spectrophotometer]]s and [[calorimeter]]s.

;Chemical laboratories
* [[laboratory glassware]] such as the [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]] or [[reagent bottle]]
* Analytical devices as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] or [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s

Laboratory equipment is generally used to either perform an [[experiment]] or to take [[measurement]]s and gather [[data]]. Larger or more sophisticated equipment is generally called a [[scientific instrument]].

==Specialized types==
The title of ''laboratory'' is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories. These notably include:

* [[Film laboratory]] or [[Darkroom]]
* [[Chemistry|Clandestine lab]] for the production of [[illegal drug]]s
* [[Computer lab]]
* [[Crime lab]] used to process [[crime scene]] evidence
* [[Language laboratory]]
* [[Medical laboratory]] (involves handling of chemical compounds)
* [[Public health laboratory]]

[[Image:2008-07-02 Eye wash station.jpg|thumb|An [[eyewash]] station in a laboratory.]]
[[File:Geneetik Riin Tamm.jpg|thumb|Geneticist [[Riin Tamm]] wearing protective lab coat|246x246px]]

In many laboratories, hazards are present. Laboratory hazards might include [[poison]]s; [[infectious agent]]s; [[flammable]], [[explosive]], or [[radioactive]] materials; moving [[machinery]]; extreme [[temperature]]s; [[laser]]s, strong [[magnetic field]]s or [[high voltage]]. Therefore, [[safety]] precautions are vitally important. Rules exist to minimize the individual's risk, and [[safety equipment]] is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an [[emergency]].

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) in the United States, recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace, has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories. This standard is often referred to as the "Laboratory Standard". Under this standard, a laboratory is required to produce a '''Chemical Hygiene Plan''' (CHP) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location, and its approach to them.

In determining the proper Chemical Hygiene Plan for a particular business or laboratory, it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard, evaluation of the current safety, health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards. The CHP must be reviewed annually. Many schools and businesses employ safety, health, and environmental specialists, such as a '''Chemical Hygiene Officer''' (CHO) to develop, manage, and evaluate their CHP. Additionally, third party review is also used to provide an objective "outside view" which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit.

Inspections and audits like also be conducted on a regular basis to assess hazards due to chemical handling and storage, electrical equipment, [[biohazards]], [[hazardous waste management]], [[Chemical waste#Laboratory|chemical waste]], housekeeping and emergency preparedness, [[radiation safety]], ventilation as well as respiratory testing and [[indoor air quality]]. An important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to and/or work in the laboratory. Training is critical to the ongoing safe operation of the laboratory facility. Educators, staff and management must be engaged in working to reduce the likelihood of accidents, injuries and potential litigation. Efforts are made to ensure laboratory safety videos are both relevant and engaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael L. Matson |author2=Jeffrey P.

The '''law of truly large numbers''' (a [[Statistics|statistical]] adage), attributed to [[Persi Diaconis]] and [[Frederick Mosteller]], states that with a sample size large enough, any outrageous thing is likely to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Everitt|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because we never find it notable when likely events occur, we highlight unlikely events and notice them more. The law seeks to debunk one element of supposed [[supernatural]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. It is meant to make a statement about [[Probability|probabilities]].

==Example==
For a simplified example of the law, assume that a given event happens with a probability for its occurrence of 0.1%, within a single trial. Then, the probability that this so-called unlikely event does ''not'' happen (improbability) in a single trial is 99.9% (0.999).

In a sample of 1000 independent trials, however, the probability that the event ''does not'' happen in any of them, even once (improbability), is 0.999&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 36.8%. Then, the probability that the event does happen, at least once, in 1000 trials is {{nowrap|1=1 &amp;minus; 0.999&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.632}} or 63.2%. This means that this "unlikely event" has a probability of 63.2% of happening if 1000 independent trials are conducted, or over 99.9% for 10,000 trials.

The probability that it happens at least once in 10,000 trials is {{nowrap|1=1 &amp;minus; 0.999&lt;sup&gt;10000&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.99995 = 99.995%.}} In other words, a highly unlikely event, given enough trials with some fixed number of draws per trial, is even more likely to occur.

==In criticism of pseudoscience ==
The law comes up in criticism of [[pseudoscience]] and is sometimes called the [[Jeane Dixon effect]] (see also [[Postdiction]]). It holds that the more predictions a psychic makes, the better the odds that one of them will "hit". Thus, if one comes true, the psychic expects us to forget the vast majority that did not happen ([[confirmation bias]]).&lt;ref&gt;1980, Austin Society to Oppose Pseudoscience (ASTOP) distributed by [[International Cultic Studies Association|ICSA]] (former American Family Foundation) [http://www.icsahome.com/elibrary/studyguides/education/astoppsychicdetectives "''Pseudoscience Fact Sheets, ASTOP: Psychic Detectives''"]&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can be susceptible to this fallacy.

Another similar (to a small degree, see [[Psychologism]] and [[Anti-psychologism]]) manifestation of the law can be found in [[gambling]], where gamblers tend to remember their wins and forget their losses,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Freeman, Jason Freeman, 2009, London, ''"Know Your Mind: Everyday Emotional and Psychological Problems and How to Overcome Them"'' p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; even if the latter far outnumbers the former (though depending on a particular person's environment, behaviors, customs or habits, so the opposite may also be local truth&lt;ref name=Aasved_2002&gt;Mikal Aasved, 2002, Illinois, ''The Psychodynamics and Psychology of Gambling: The Gambler's Mind'' vol. I, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; – ''statistical prevalence not featured''). Mikal Aasved links it with "selective memory bias", allowing gamblers to mentally distance themselves from the consequences of their gambling&lt;ref name=Aasved_2002/&gt; by holding an inflated view of their real winnings (or losses in the opposite case).

'''List of archaeological excavations in Jerusalem''' is an incomplete list of [[archaeological excavation]]s in [[Jerusalem]].

== 19th Century ==
The nineteenth century saw much interest in Jerusalem develop. British Protestants, eager to find hard evidence for their Christian convictions, set out to dig the Holy City. Among them were [[Flinders Petrie]], [[Charles Warren]], [[Charles William Wilson]] and [[Montague Parker]].

== The British Mandate ==
During the Mandate, efforts to excavate Jerusalem continued with digs by [[R. A. Stewart Macalister]] in the [[City of David]].

== Jordanian Rule ==
Under Jordanian rule, [[Kathleen Kenyon]] excavated in the City of David, discovering numerous important finds including the [[proto-Ionic]] capital.

The currently accepted names and symbols of the [[chemical element]]s are determined by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), usually following recommendations by the recognized discoverers of each element. However the names of several elements have been the subject of controversies until IUPAC established an official name. In most cases the controversy was due to a priority dispute as to who first found conclusive evidence for the existence of an element, or as to what evidence was in fact conclusive.

==Element 23==
'''[[Vanadium]]''' (named after [[List of names of Freyja|Vanadis]], another name for [[Freyja]], the Scandinavian goddess of fertility) was originally [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Andrés Manuel del Río]] (a Spanish-born Mexican mineralogist) in Mexico City in 1801. He discovered the element after being sent a sample of "brown lead" ore (''plomo pardo de Zimapán'', now named [[vanadinite]]). Through experimentation, he found it to form salts with a wide variety of colors, so he named the element '''panchromium''' (Greek: all colors). He later renamed this substance '''erythronium''', since most of the salts turned red when heated. The French chemist [[Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils]] incorrectly declared that del Río's new element was only impure [[chromium]]. Del Río thought himself to be mistaken and accepted the statement of the French chemist that was also backed by del Río's friend [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref name=Cintas &gt;{{cite journal

In 1831, [[Nils Gabriel Sefström|Sefström]] of Sweden rediscovered vanadium in a new oxide he found while working with some [[iron]] ores. He chose to call the element '''vanadin''' in Swedish (which has become '''vanadium''' in other languages including German and English) after the Old Norse ''Vanadís'', another name for the Norse Vanr goddess Freyja, whose facets include connections to beauty and fertility, because of the many beautifully colored chemical compounds it produces. Later that same year [[Friedrich Wöhler]] confirmed del Río's earlier work.&lt;ref name=sefs&gt;{{cite journal

[[George William Featherstonhaugh]], one of the first US geologists, suggested that the element should be named "rionium" after del Río, but this never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = The Monthly American Journal of Geology and Natural Science |first = George William|last = Featherstonhaugh |title=New Metal, provisionally called Vanadium |year = 1831|page=69 | url = https://archive.org/stream/monthlyamericanj11831phil#page/68/mode/2up/search/rionium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements 41 ([[Niobium]] Nb) and 74  ([[Tungsten]] W)==
[[Charles Hatchett]] named element 41 '''columbium''' in 1801&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''Cb'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Eigenschaften und chemisches Verhalten des von Charlesw Hatchett entdeckten neuen Metalls, Columbium | first = Charles | last = Hatchett | authorlink = Charles Hatchett | language=German | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages =120–122| doi = 10.1002/andp.18020110507 | year = 1802|bibcode = 1802AnP....11..120H }}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the publication of the identity of columbium with tantalum by [[William Hyde Wollaston]] in 1802 the claims of discovery of Hattchet were refused.&lt;ref name="Wolla"&gt;{{cite journal  | title =  On the Identity of Columbium and Tantalum  | pages =  246–252 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | first = William Hyde | last = Wollaston  | issue =  0 |  authorlink = William Hyde Wollaston  | doi =   10.1098/rstl.1809.0017| jstor = 107264 | volume = 99 | year = 1809}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1846 [[Heinrich Rose]] discovered that tantalite contained an element similar to tantalum and named it niobium.&lt;ref name="Pelop"&gt;{{cite journal  | title =  Ueber die Zusammensetzung der Tantalite und ein im Tantalite von Baiern enthaltenes neues Metall | pages =  317–341 | journal = Annalen der Physik | authorlink  = Heinrich Rose  | language=German | first = Heinrich  | last = Rose  | doi =  10.1002/andp.18441391006 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15148n/f327.table | volume = 139  | issue = 10  | year =  1844|bibcode = 1844AnP...139..317R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | title =  Ueber die Säure im Columbit von Nordamérika  | language=German | pages =  572–577 | first = Heinrich | last = Rose | journal = Annalen der Physik | doi =  10.1002/andp.18471460410 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15155x/f586.table |year=1847| volume = 146  | issue = 4  | authorlink = Heinrich Rose|bibcode = 1847AnP...146..572R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements 70 ([[Ytterbium]] Yb) and 71 ([[Lutetium]] Lu)==
[[Gadolinite]], a mineral (from [[Ytterby]], a village in Sweden), consists of several compounds (oxides or earths): [[yttria]], [[erbia]] (sub-component as '''ytterbia''') and [[terbia]].

In 1878, [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]] assumed that '''ytterbia''' consisted of a new element he called '''ytterbium''' (but actually there were two new elements).
In 1907 [[Georges Urbain]] isolated element 70 and element 71 from '''ytterbia'''. He called element 70 '''neoytterbium''' ("new ytterbium") and called element 71 '''lutecium'''. 
At about the same time, [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]] also independently isolated these and proposed the names '''aldebaranium''' ('''Ad'''), after the star [[Aldebaran]] (in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]), for element 70 ('''ytterbium'''), and '''cassiopeium''' ('''Cp'''), after the [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|constellation Cassiopeia]], for element 71 ('''lutetium'''), but both proposals were rejected.

'''Neoytterbium''' (element 70) was eventually reverted to '''[[ytterbium]]''' (following Marignac) and in 1949 the spelling of '''lutecium''' (element 71) was changed to '''lutetium'''.

(Other elements, '''yttrium''' (element 39) and '''gadolinium''' (element 64), were also discovered in [[gadolinite]] and its components, but there was no controversy about their names.)

==Elements 103–109==
{{Main|Transfermium Wars}}

At the time of their discovery, there was an element naming controversy as to what (particularly) the elements from 103 to 109 were to be called. 
At last, a committee of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) resolved the dispute and adopted one name for each element. They also adopted a temporary [[systematic element name]].

===Element 103 ([[Lawrencium]] Lr)===
IUPAC ratified the name '''lawrencium''' ('''Lr''') in honor of [[Ernest Lawrence]] during a meeting in [[Geneva]]; the name was preferred by the [[American Chemical Society]].

===Element 104 ([[Rutherfordium]] Rf)===
The [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]] (then [[USSR]], today Russia) named element 104 '''kurchatovium''' ('''Ku''') in honor of [[Igor Kurchatov]], father of the Soviet atomic bomb. But the [[University of California, Berkeley]], US, named element 104 '''rutherfordium''' ('''Rf''') in honor of [[Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson|Ernest Rutherford]]. 
In 1997 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 104 be named '''rutherfordium'''.

===Element 105 ([[Dubnium]] Db)===
The [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]] (a Russian city north of Moscow), proposed naming element 105 '''nielsbohrium''' ('''Ns''') after [[Niels Bohr]], while the [[University of California, Berkeley]] suggested the name '''hahnium''' ('''Ha''') in honor of [[Otto Hahn]]. 
IUPAC recommended that element 105 be named '''dubnium''', after Dubna.

===Element 106 ([[Seaborgium]] Sg)===
The element was discovered almost simultaneously by two laboratories. In June 1974, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] team led by [[Georgy Flyorov|G. N. Flyorov]] at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] at [[Dubna]] reported producing the isotope &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;106, and in September 1974, an American research team led by [[Albert Ghiorso]] at the [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]] at the University of California, Berkeley reported creating the isotope &lt;sup&gt;263&lt;/sup&gt;106. 
Because their work was independently confirmed first, the Americans suggested the name '''seaborgium''' ('''Sg''') in honor of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], an American chemist. This name was extremely controversial because Seaborg was still alive.

An international committee decided in 1992 that the Berkeley and Dubna laboratories should share credit for the discovery. 
An element naming controversy erupted and as a result IUPAC adopted '''unnilhexium''' ('''Unh''') as a temporary, systematic element name.

In 1994 a committee of IUPAC adopted a rule that no element can be named after a living person.&lt;ref name=Yarris&gt;[http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/seaborgium-dispute.html Naming of element 106 disputed by international committee] Lynn Yarris, [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBL) Science Articles Archive, 1994 Oct.14&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was fiercely objected to by the [[American Chemical Society]].

Seaborg and Ghiorso pointed out that precedents had been set in the naming of elements 99 and 100 as '''[[einsteinium]]''' ('''Es''') and '''[[fermium]]''' ('''Fm''') during the lives of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Enrico Fermi]], although these names were not publicly announced until after Einstein and Fermi's deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-12/news/mn-49337_1_original-names Out of His Element : Discovery Won't Be Named for Chemist--Because He's Alive] Thomas H. Maugh II, Los Angeles Times, 1994 Oct.12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, as part of a compromise involving elements 104 to 108, the name '''seaborgium''' for element 106 was recognized internationally.

=== Element 107 ([[Bohrium]] Bh) ===
Some suggested the name '''nielsbohrium''' ('''Ns'''), in honor of [[Niels Bohr]] (this was separate from the proposal of the same name for element 105). IUPAC adopted '''unnilseptium''' ('''Uns''') as a temporary systematic element name. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named '''bohrium''' ('''Bh'''), also in honor of Niels Bohr but using his surname only. While this conforms to the names of other elements honoring individuals where only the surname is taken, it was opposed by many who were concerned that it could be confused with [[boron]], which is called ''borium'' in some languages including Latin. Despite this, the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997.

=== Element 108 ([[Hassium]] Hs) ===
IUPAC adopted '''unniloctium''' ('''Uno''') as a temporary, systematic element name.
In 1997 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named '''hassium''' ('''Hs'''), in honor of the German state of [[Hesse]] (or Hassia in Latin). This state includes the city of [[Darmstadt]], which is home to the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] where several new elements were discovered or confirmed. The element name was accepted internationally.

===Element 109 ([[Meitnerium]] Mt)===
IUPAC adopted '''unnilennium''' ('''Une''') as a temporary, systematic element name. While ''meitnerium'' was discussed in the naming controversy, it was the only proposal and thus never disputed. In 1997 a committee of IUPAC adopted the name '''meitnerium''' in honor of [[Lise Meitner]] ('''Mt''').

==Post-controversial namings==
Further elements were named without controversy, starting with elements 110 ([[darmstadtium|Ds]], darmstadtium) and 111 ([[roentgenium|Rg]], roentgenium), whose names were approved by IUPAC in 2003 and 2004 respectively. More elements followed in 2010 (112: [[copernicium|Cn]], copernicium), 2012 (114: [[flerovium|Fl]], flerovium; 116: [[livermorium|Lv]], livermorium), and 2016 (113: [[nihonium|Nh]], nihonium; 115: [[moscovium|Mc]], moscovium; 117, [[tennessine|Ts]], tennessine; and 118, [[oganesson|Og]], oganesson), completing the seventh row of the periodic table.

'''Mary Andross''' (1893-1968) was a Scottish food chemist. She was one of the leading pioneers of [[Dietitian|dietetics]].

== Early life ==
Andross was born on 15 March 1893 in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], Scotland. Her father, Henry Andross, was a cashier. He built a home for his family on Bank Street in 1901, where Mary lived for most of her life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naheritagetrails.co.uk/heritagetrails_irvine_maryandross.php|title=North Ayrshire Heritage Trails|website=www.naheritagetrails.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andross was an athletic child, but a car accident during her early years meant she lost much of the use of her legs. However, she continued to live an active life and enjoyed fishing on the island of Harris&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/665046168|title=Chemistry was their life : pioneering British women chemists, 1880-1949|last=F.|first=Rayner-Canham, Marelene|date=2008|publisher=Imperial College Press|others=Rayner-Canham, Geoffrey.|isbn=186094986X|location=London|oclc=665046168}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Academic career ==
Andross enrolled in the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1912. She studied various scientific subjects, including anatomy, organic chemistry, zoology, natural philosophy and physiology. She graduated in 1916 with a BSc in Science and Engineering&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0052&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of Mary Andross|website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After graduation she undertook some postgraduate work at the Technical College and then at the University of Glasgow. She taught at Irvine Royal Academy between 1916 and 1917, then worked at the Ministry of Munitions Inspections Department on poison gases from 1917 to 1919. Afterwards, she returned to the University of Glasgow to work as a Chemistry Assistant until 1923.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She eventually became the Head of the Science Department of the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science, where she remained for 40 years until she retired in 1965&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Andross became a Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1952-01-01|title=Proceedings of the Society of Public Analysts and other Analytical Chemists|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=an9527700333|journal=The Analyst|language=en|volume=77|issue=916|doi=10.1039/an9527700333|issn=1364-5528|bibcode=1952Ana....77..333.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1951, of the Institute of Food Science and Technology in 1964, and was a member of the Nutrition Society and the [[Society of Chemical Industry]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

== World War II efforts ==
During [[World War II]], Andross made three major contributions to the field of dietetics:
# Carried out research on the sources of [[vitamin C]], in particular [[Rose hip|rose hips]]. In order to encourage increased vitamin C intake among the general public, Andross developed recipes that could easily be prepared at home.
# Helped to organise a canteen for servicemen in [[St Enoch railway station|St Enoch Station]].
# Promoted the idea of preserving fruits and vegetables and helped to establish a service providing preserved foods to the general public. Andross herself canned, bottled and pickled foods, while also leading a team of staff who used their holiday time to deliver services in rural areas&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Death ==
Andross died on 22 February 1968&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3728">The '''Mattauch isobar rule''', formulated by [[Josef Mattauch]] in 1934, states that if two adjacent [[chemical element|elements]] on the [[periodic table]] have [[isotope]]s of the same [[mass number]], one of these [[isotopes]] must be [[radioactivity|radioactive]].&lt;ref name="rare-earth-handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holleman&amp;Wiberg"&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[nuclide]]s that have the same mass number ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobars]]) can both be stable only if their [[atomic number]]s differ by more than one (In fact, for currently [[observationally stable]] nuclides, the difference can only be 2 or 4, and in theory, two [[nuclide]]s that have the same mass number cannot be both stable (at least to [[beta decay]] or [[double beta decay]]), but many such nuclides which are theoretically unstable to double beta decay have not been observed to decay, e.g. Xe-134).&lt;ref name="rare-earth-handbook"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |last1=Thyssen |first1=Pieter |last2=Binnemans |first2=Koen |last3=Shinohara |first3=Hisanori |last4=Saito |first4=Yahachi |last5=Gulay |first5=Lubomir D. |last6=Daszkiewicz |first6=Marek |last7=Yan |first7=Chun-Hua |last8=Yan |first8=Zheng-Guan |last9=Du |first9=Ya-Ping |date=2011 |editor1-last=Gschneider |editor1-first=Karl A., Jr. |editor2-last=Bünzli |editor2-first=Jean-Claude |editor3-last=Pecharsky |editor3-first=Vitalij K. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] |isbn=978-0-444-53590-0 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SstnPFSzb0C&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this rule cannot make predictions on the [[half-life|half-lives]] of these [[radioisotope]]s.&lt;ref name="rare-earth-handbook" /&gt;

==Technetium and promethium==
A consequence of this rule is that [[technetium]] and [[promethium]] both have no stable isotopes as each of the elements just before and just after these two unstable elements on the periodic table ([[molybdenum]] and [[ruthenium]], and [[neodymium]] and [[samarium]], respectively) have a stable isotope for each mass number for the range in which the isotopes of the unstable elements usually would be stable to [[beta decay]] (note that although Sm147 is unstable, it is stable to beta decay, thus 147 is not a counterexample).&lt;ref name="rare-earth-handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holleman&amp;Wiberg"/&gt; These ranges can be calculated using the [[liquid drop model]] (for example the [[Isotopes of technetium#Stability of technetium isotopes|stability of technetium isotopes]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Thus no stable nuclides have [[proton number]] 43 or 61, by the same reason, no stable nuclides have [[neutron number]] 19, 21, 35, 39, 45, 61, 71, 89, 115, or 123.

==Exceptions==
The only known exceptions to the Mattauch isobar rule are the cases of [[antimony-123]] and [[tellurium-123]] and of [[hafnium-180]] and [[tantalum-180m]], where both nuclei are observationally stable. It is predicted that &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Te would undergo [[electron capture]] to form &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Sb, but this decay has not yet been observed; &lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta should be able to undergo [[isomeric transition]] to &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;Ta, [[beta decay]] to &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;W, electron capture to &lt;sup&gt;180&lt;/sup&gt;Hf, or [[alpha decay]] to &lt;sup&gt;176&lt;/sup&gt;Lu, but none of these decay modes have been observed.&lt;ref name="nuclideschart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/ |title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|author=Sonzogni, Alejandro|location=National Nuclear Data Center|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of war}}

'''Military organization''' or '''military organisation''' is the structuring of the armed forces of a [[State (polity)|state]] so as to offer such [[military capability]] as a [[national defense policy]] may require. In some countries [[paramilitary]] forces are included in a nation's armed forces, though not considered military{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}. Armed forces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, such as [[Insurgency|insurgent]] forces, often [[mimic]] military organizations, or use ''[[ad hoc]]'' structures, while formal military organization tends to use [[hierarchical]] forms.

== History ==
{{sectstub|date=July 2018}}
The use of formalized [[Military rank#Roman ranks|ranks]] in a hierarchical structure came into widespread use with the [[Roman Army]].

In modern times, executive control, management and administration of military organization is typically undertaken by governments through a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] within the structure of [[public administration]], often known as a [[Ministry of Defense]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], or [[Department of War]]. These in turn manage [[Armed Services]] that themselves command formations and units specialising in combat, [[combat support]] and [[combat service support | combat-service support]].

==Executive control, management and administration==
The usually civilian or partly civilian executive control over the national military organization is exercised in [[democracy|democracies]] by an elected political leader as a member of the government's [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], usually known as a Minister of Defense. (In presidential systems, such as the United States, the president is the commander-in-chief, and the cabinet-level defense minister is second in command.) Subordinated to that position are often Secretaries for specific major operational divisions of the armed forces as a whole, such as those that provide general support services to the Armed Services, including their dependants.

Then there are the heads of specific departmental agencies responsible for the provision and management of specific skill- and knowledge-based service such as [[Strategy]] advice, [[Military capability|Capability Development]] assessment, or [[Military science|Defense Science]] provision of research, and design and development of technologies. Within each departmental agency will be found administrative branches responsible for further agency [[business|business specialization]] work.

==Armed services== 
[[Image:USN-JASDF ship and aircraft formations during ANNUALEX 2008 081119-N-7047S-140.jpg|thumb|A mixed aircraft and ship formation of military vehicles during an exercise with [[United States Navy|USN]] and [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|JASDF]] vehicles.]]
In most countries the ''armed forces'' are divided into three or four [[Armed services]] (also: ''service, military service, or military branch''): [[army]], [[navy]], and [[air force]].

Many countries have a variation on the standard model of three or four basic [[Armed Services]]. Some nations also organize their [[Marines (military)|marines]], [[special forces]] or [[ballistic missile|strategic missile]] forces as independent armed services. A nation's [[coast guard]] may also be an independent [[military branch]] of its military, although in many nations the coast guard is a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or civil agency. A number of countries have no navy, for geographical reasons. Some other variations include:

In larger armed forces the culture between the different [[Armed Services]] of the armed forces can be quite different.

Most smaller countries have a single organization that encompasses all armed forces employed by the country in question. Third-world armies tend to consist primarily of infantry, while first-world armies tend to have larger units manning expensive equipment and only a fraction of personnel in infantry units.

It is worthwhile to make mention of the term ''[[Joint warfare|joint]]''.  In western militaries, a [[joint warfare|joint force]] is defined as a unit or formation comprising representation of combat power from two or more branches of the military.

===Internal security forces===
[[Gendarmerie]]s, including equivalents such as [[Internal Troops]], [[Paramilitary|Paramilitary Forces]] and similar, are an internal security service common in most of the world, but uncommon in Anglo-Saxon countries where civil police are employed to enforce the law, and there are tight restrictions on how the armed forces may be used to assist.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States it is a common misunderstanding that their armed forces are totally prohibited from doing so by the [[Posse Comitatus Act]]. This Act, which reserves to Congress the power to employ Federal military force to enforce law and order, refers specifically only to the [[US Army]] and [[US Air Force]]. The [[US Marines]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] are separately regulated, and the [[US Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] has a clear law enforcement role in its peacetime status. The state-controlled [[Army National Guard]] (technically a branch of the US Army) is also excluded from the Posse Comitatus Act. The [[Insurrection Act]] specifically permits the President to use Federal military force to restore public order in extreme emergency situations: this Act was implemented during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|"Rodney King Riots"]] in Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commands, formations and units==
{{Redirect|Military formation|the arrangement or deployment of moving military forces|Tactical formation}}

It is common, at least in the European and North American militaries, to refer to the building blocks of a military as commands, formations and units.

In a military context, a [[Command (military formation)|command]] is a collection of units and formations under the control of a single officer. Although during the [[Second World War]] a Command was also a name given to a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the [[US Army]], in general it is an administrative and executive [[military strategy|strategic]] [[headquarters]] which is responsible to the national government or the national military headquarters. It is not uncommon for a nation's services to each consist of their own command (such as Land Component, Air Component, Naval Component, and Medical Component in the [[Belgian Army]]), but this does not preclude the existence of commands which are not service-based.

{{Anchor|Formation}}A formation is defined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] as "two or more aircraft, ships, or units proceeding together under a commander".&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Defense]], [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html DOD Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223235143/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html |date=2008-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formin in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] emphasised its combined-arms nature: "Formations are those military organisations which are formed from different speciality Arms and Services troop units to create a balanced, combined combat force. The formations only differ in their ability to achieve different scales of application of force to achieve different strategic, operational and tactical goals and mission objectives."&lt;ref&gt;Fomin, N.N., Great Soviet Encyclopaedia ({{lang-ru|Большая Советская Энциклопедия}}), Moscow, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; It is a composite military organization that includes a mixture of integrated and operationally attached sub-units, and is usually combat-capable. Example of formations include: [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, [[battalion]]s, [[Wing (air force unit)|wings]], etc. Formation may also refer to [[tactical formation]], the physical arrangement or disposition of troops and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formation in such usage include: [[pakfront]], [[panzerkeil]], [[testudo formation]], etc.

A typical unit is a homogeneous military organization (either combat, [[Combat support|combat-support]] or non-combat in capability) that includes service personnel predominantly from a single arm of service, or a branch of service, and its administrative and command functions are self-contained. Any unit subordinate to another unit is considered its sub-unit or minor unit. It is not uncommon for unit and formation to be used synonymously in the United States. In Commonwealth practice, formation is not used for smaller organizations like battalions which are instead called "units", and their constituent [[platoon]]s or [[Company (military unit)|companies]] are referred to as sub-units. In the Commonwealth, formations are [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, etc.

Different [[armed forces]], and even different branches of service of the armed forces, may use the same name to denote different types of organizations. An example is the "squadron". In most navies a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] is a formation of several ships; in most air forces it is a unit; in the U.S. Army it is a battalion-sized [[cavalry]] unit; and in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armies a squadron is a company-sized sub-unit.

==Table of organization and equipment==
A [[table of organization and equipment]] (TOE or TO&amp;E) is a document published by the U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency that prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of Corps and Armies.

It also provides information on the mission and capabilities of a unit as well as the unit's current status. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as infantry) follow the same structural guidelines.

==Modern hierarchy==

{{Military units}}

=== Army hierarchy ===
{{Army units}}

The following table gives an overview of some of the terms used to describe army hierarchy in armed forces across the world. Whilst it is recognized that there are differences between armies of different nations, many are modeled on the [[British Army|British]] or [[United States Armed Forces|American]] models, or both. However, many military units and formations go back in history for a long time, and were devised by various military thinkers throughout European history.

For example, the modern ''Corps'' was first introduced in France about 1805 by Napoleon as a more flexible tactical grouping of two or more divisions during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

They have become part of the organization of most armies around the world.

Rungs may be skipped in this ladder: for example, typically NATO forces skip from battalion to brigade. Likewise, only large military powers may have organizations at the top levels and different armies and countries may also use traditional names, creating considerable confusion: for example, a British or Canadian armored regiment (battalion) is divided into [[Squadron (army)|squadron]]s (companies) and [[troop]]s (platoons), whereas an American cavalry squadron (battalion) is divided into troops (companies) and platoons.

[[Army]], [[army group]], [[region]], and [[theater (military)|theatre]] are all large formations that vary significantly between armed forces in size and hierarchy position.  While [[Division (military)|division]]s were the traditional level at which support elements (field artillery, hospital, logistics and maintenance, etc.) were added to the unit structure, since World War II, many brigades now have such support units, and since the 1980s, regiments also have been receiving support elements.  A regiment with such support elements is called a [[regimental combat team]] in US military parlance, or a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the UK and other forces.

During [[World War II]] the [[Red Army]] used the same basic organizational structure.  However, in the beginning many units were greatly underpowered and their size was actually one level below on the ladder that is usually used elsewhere; for example, a division in the early-WWII Red Army would have been about the size of most nations' regiments or brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armor.kiev.ua/army/hist/doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |title=Доклад НКО август 1939. doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |publisher=Armor.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=121&amp;sid=92105 |script-title=ru:Центральный государственный архив Советской армии (с июня 1992 г.

Путеводитель. 1993 |language=ru |publisher=Guides.rusarchives.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the ladder, what other nations would call an army group, the Red Army called a [[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]. By contrast, during the same period the German [[Wehrmacht]] Army Groups, particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], such as [[Army Group Centre]] significantly exceeded the above numbers, and were more cognate with the Soviet [[Strategic Direction]]s.

=== Naval hierarchy ===
Naval organization at the flotilla level and higher is less commonly abided by, as ships operate in smaller or larger groups in various situations that may change at a moment's notice.  However, there is some common terminology used throughout navies to communicate the general concept of how many vessels might be in a unit.

Navies are generally organized into groups for a specific purpose, usually strategic, and these organizational groupings appear and disappear frequently based on the conditions and demands placed upon a navy.  This contrasts with army organization where units remain static, with the same men and equipment, over long periods of time.

The five-star ranks of Admiral of the Fleet and Fleet Admiral have largely been out of regular use since the 1990s, with the exception of ceremonial or honorary appointments. Currently, all major navies are commanded by an admiral (four-star rank) or vice-admiral (three-star rank) depending on relative size. Smaller naval forces, such as the RNZN, or those navies that are effectively coastguards, are commanded by a rear-admiral (two-star rank), commodore (one-star rank) or even a captain.

Aircraft carriers are typically commanded by a captain. Submarines and destroyers are typically commanded by a captain or commander.  Some destroyers, particularly smaller destroyers such as [[frigate]]s (formerly known as [[destroyer escort]]s) are usually commanded by officers with the rank of commander.  [[Corvette]]s, the smallest class of warship, are commanded by officers with the rank of commander or lieutenant-commander. Auxiliary ships, including [[gunboat]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], [[patrol boat]]s, military [[riverboat|riverine craft]], [[Ship's tender|tenders]] and [[torpedo boat]]s are usually commanded by lieutenants, sub-lieutenants or warrant officers.  Usually, the smaller the vessel, the lower the rank of the ship's commander.  For example, patrol boats are often commanded by [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]s, while frigates are rarely commanded by an officer below the rank of commander.

Historical navies were far more rigid in structure.  Ships were collected in divisions, which in turn were collected in numbered squadrons, which comprised a numbered fleet.  Permission for a vessel to leave one unit and join another would have to be approved on paper.

The modern U.S. Navy is primarily based on a number of standard groupings of vessels, including the [[carrier strike group]] and the [[Expeditionary Strike Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/ US Navy]. GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 2009-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Naval organization continues aboard a single ship. The complement forms three or four departments (such as tactical and engineering), each of which has a number of divisions, followed by work centers.

=== Air Force hierarchy ===
The organizational structures of air forces vary between nations: some air forces (such as the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]) are divided into commands, groups and squadrons; others (such as the [[Soviet Air Force]]) have an Army-style organizational structure.  The modern [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] uses [[Air Division (disambiguation)|Air Division]] as the formation between wings and the entire air command.  Like the RAF, Canadian wings consist of squadrons.

==Task force==
A [[task force]] is a unit or formation created as a temporary grouping for a specific operational purpose.  Aside from administrative hierarchical forms of organization that have evolved since the early 17th century in Europe, fighting forces have been grouped for specific operational purposes into mission-related organizations such as the German [[Kampfgruppe]] or the U.S. Combat Team (Army) and Task Force (Navy) during the Second World War, or the Soviet [[Operational manoeuvre group]] during the Cold War. In the British and Commonwealth armies the [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] became the usual grouping of companies during the [[Second World War]] and the Cold War.

Within NATO, a [[Joint Task Force]] (JTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one armed service, a Combined Task Force (CTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one nation, and a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements of more than one armed service and more than one nation.

'''[[Computer vision]]''' &amp;ndash; [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from [[digital image]]s or [[video]]s. From the perspective of [[engineering]], it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.&lt;ref name="Ballard-Brown-1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonka-Hlavac-Boyle-2008" /&gt; Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring digital images (through [[image sensor]]s), [[image processing]], and [[image analysis]], to reach an understanding of digital images. In general, it deals with the extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information that the computer can interpret. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images.

'''Plant–soil feedback''' is a process where plants alter the [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] qualities of [[soil]] they grow in, which then alters the ability of plants to grow in that soil in the future.&lt;ref name="bever1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bever|first1=James D.|title=Feeback between Plants and Their Soil Communities in an Old Field Community|journal=Ecology|date=1 January 1994|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1965–1977|doi=10.2307/1941601|jstor=1941601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bever|first1=James D.|last2=Westover|first2=Kristi M.|last3=Antonovics|first3=Janis|title=Incorporating the Soil Community into Plant Population Dynamics: The Utility of the Feedback Approach|journal=The Journal of Ecology|date=October 1997|volume=85|issue=5|pages=561|doi=10.2307/2960528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative plant–soil feedback occurs when plants are less able to grow in soil that was previously occupied by a member of the same species, and positive plant–soil feedback occurs when plants are more able to grow in soil that was previously occupied by a member of the same species.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  Although it was originally assumed that negative plant–soil feedback was caused by plants depleting the soil of [[nutrient]]s, recent work has suggested that a major cause of plant–soil feedback is a buildup of soil-borne [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref name="bever1994" /&gt;  [[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] and [[allelopathy]] are also thought to cause plant–soil feedback.  Studies have shown that, on average, plant–soil feedback tends to be negative;&lt;ref name="kulmatiski_et_al_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulmatiski|first1=Andrew|last2=Beard|first2=Karen H.|last3=Stevens|first3=John R.|last4=Cobbold|first4=Stephanie M.|title=Plant-soil feedbacks: a meta-analytical review|journal=Ecology Letters|date=September 2008|volume=11|issue=9|pages=980–992|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there have been many notable exceptions, such as many invasive species.&lt;ref name="Klironomos2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klironomos|first1=John N.|title=Feedback with soil biota contributes to plant rarity and invasiveness in communities|journal=Nature|date=2 May 2002|volume=417|issue=6884|pages=67–70|doi=10.1038/417067a|pmid=11986666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative plant–soil feedback is thought to be an important factor in helping plants to [[coexistence theory|coexist]].  If a plant is over-abundant, then soil pathogens and other negative factors will become common, hurting its growth.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  Similarly, if a plant becomes overly rare, then so too will its soil pathogens and other negative factors, helping its growth.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  This [[negative feedback]] will help populations to stay in the community.  Negative plant–soil feedback has been called a particular case of the [[Janzen–Connell hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Petermann_et_al_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petermann|first1=Jana S.|last2=Fergus|first2=Alexander J. F.|last3=Turnbull|first3=Lindsay A.|last4=Schmid|first4=Bernhard|title=JANZEN-CONNELL EFFECTS ARE WIDESPREAD AND STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN DIVERSITY IN GRASSLANDS|journal=Ecology|date=September 2008|volume=89|issue=9|pages=2399–2406|doi=10.1890/07-2056.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring plant–soil feedback==

Plant–soil feedback is best measured using Bever's interaction coefficient, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  This value quantifies how much each plant's growth is limited by its own soil community compared to how much it limits others.  It is for two-species comparisons.  To measure this quantity, one must measure the growth of two plants, both in soil conditioned by members of their own species (''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(home) for species ''x''), and in soil conditioned by members of the other species (''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(away) for plant species ''x'').  Then, the interaction coefficient is calculated as

: &lt;math&gt;I_s=G_x(\mbox{home})+G_y(\mbox{home})-G_x(\mbox{away})-G_y(\mbox{away}). &lt;/math&gt;

If ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is negative, it means that both species grow worse in their own site compared to their competitor's soil, and therefore plant–soil feedback helps these species to coexist.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;

'''Prescriptive analytics''' is the third and final phase of [[business analytics]], which also includes descriptive and [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans,James R.  |author2=Lindner, Carl H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Business Analytics: The Next Frontier for Decision Sciences|journal=Decision Line|date=March 2012|volume=43|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"&gt;http://www.analytics-magazine.org/november-december-2010/54-the-analytics-journey{{cite journal|last=Lustig,Irv, Dietrich, Brenda, Johnson, Christer, and Dziekan, Christopher|title=The Analytics Journey|journal=Analytics|date=Nov–Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referred to as the "final frontier of analytic capabilities,"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globys.com/2013/06/gartner-terms-prescriptive-analytics-%E2%80%9Cfinal-frontier%E2%80%9D-analytic-capabilities&lt;/ref&gt; prescriptive analytics entails the application of [[mathematical sciences|mathematical]] and [[computational science]]s and suggests decision options to take advantage of the results of descriptive and predictive analytics.  The first stage of business analytics is descriptive analytics, which still accounts for the majority of all business analytics today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davenport,Tom |title=The three '..tives' of business analytics; predictive, prescriptive and descriptive|journal=CIO Enterprise Forum|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive analytics looks at past performance and understands that performance by mining historical data to look for the reasons behind past success or failure. Most management reporting – such as [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[Business operations|operations]], and [[finance]] – uses this type of post-mortem analysis.

[[File:Three Phases of Analytics.png|thumb|left|350px|Prescriptive Analytics extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes, and the interrelated effects of each decision]]The next phase is [[predictive analytics]]. Predictive analytics answers the question what is likely to happen. This is when historical data is combined with rules, [[algorithms]], and occasionally external data to determine the probable future outcome of an event or the likelihood of a situation occurring. The final phase is prescriptive analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas, Peter J., Maglio, Paul P., Selinger, Patricia G., and Tan, Wang-Chie|title=Data is Dead…Without What-If Models|journal=Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment|year=2011|volume=4|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which goes beyond predicting future outcomes by also suggesting actions to benefit from the predictions and showing the implications of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stewart, Thomas. R. |author2=McMillan, Claude, Jr.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Descriptive and Prescriptive Models for Judgment and Decision Making: Implications for Knowledge Engineering|journal=NATO AS1 Senes, Expert Judgment and Expert Systems|year=1987|volume=F35|pages=314–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen&lt;!-- There is no evidence nor citation supporting this statement. Furthermore, if prescriptive analytics analytics "not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen, then what is the role of predictive modelling, forecasting and causal modelling? --&gt;. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy&lt;!-- This lacks evidence and supporting citation. It does not follow that prediction accuracy improves as a result of re-predicting. --&gt; and prescribing better decision options. Prescriptive analytics ingests hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riabacke, Mona, Danielson, Mats, and Ekenber, Love |title=State-of-the-Art Prescriptive Criteria Weight Elicitation|journal=Advances in Decision Sciences|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three phases of analytics can be performed through professional services or technology or a combination.  In order to scale, prescriptive analytics technologies need to be adaptive to take into account the growing volume, velocity, and variety of data that most mission critical processes and their environments may produce.

One criticism of prescriptive analytics is that its distinction from [[predictive analytics]] is ill-defined and therefore ill-conceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bill Vorhies|url=http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/prescriptive-versus-predictive-analytics-distinction-without-difference/ |title=Prescriptive versus Predictive Analytics – A Distinction without a Difference?|journal=Predictive Analytics Times|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Components of Prescriptive Analytics.png|thumb|600px|The scientific disciplines that comprise Prescriptive Analytics]]

==History==

Prescriptive analytics incorporates both structured and unstructured data, and uses a combination of advanced analytic techniques and disciplines to predict, prescribe, and adapt. While the term prescriptive analytics was first coined by IBM&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"/&gt; and later trademarked by Ayata,&lt;ref&gt;http://trademarks.justia.com/852/06/prescriptive-analytics-85206495.html&lt;/ref&gt; the underlying concepts have been around for hundreds of years. The technology behind prescriptive analytics synergistically combines hybrid [[data]], business rules with [[mathematical model]]s and [[computational model]]s. The data inputs to prescriptive analytics may come from multiple sources: internal, such as inside a corporation; and external, also known as environmental data.  The data may be structured, which includes numbers and categories, as well as [[unstructured data]], such as texts, images, sounds, and videos. Unstructured data differs from [[structured data]] in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inmon|first=Bill|author2=Nesavich, Anthony|title=Tapping Into Unstructured Data|year=2007|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-236029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80% of the world's data today is unstructured, according to IBM.

In addition to this variety of data types and growing data volume, incoming data can also evolve with respect to velocity, that is, more data being generated at a faster or a variable pace. Business rules define the [[business process]] and include objectives constraints, preferences, policies, best practices, and boundaries. Mathematical models and computational models are techniques derived from mathematical sciences, computer science and related disciplines such as applied statistics, machine learning, operations research, natural language processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and signal processing. The correct application of all these methods and the verification of their results implies the need for resources on a massive scale including human, computational and temporal for every Prescriptive Analytic project. In order to spare the expense of dozens of people, high performance machines and weeks of work one must consider the reduction of resources and therefore a reduction in the accuracy or reliability of the outcome. The preferable route is a reduction that produces a probabilistic result within acceptable limits.

==Applications in Oil and Gas==

[[File:Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers.png|thumb|right|450px|Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers]]Energy is the largest industry in the world ($6 trillion in size). The processes and decisions related to oil and natural gas exploration, development and production generate large amounts of data. Many types of captured data are used to create models and images of the Earth’s structure and layers 5,000 - 35,000 feet below the surface and to describe activities around the wells themselves, such as depositional characteristics, machinery performance, oil flow rates, reservoir temperatures and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Basu, Atanu|title= How Prescriptive Analytics Can Reshape Fracking in Oil and Gas Fields|journal= Data-Informed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can help with both locating and producing hydrocarbons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=  Basu, Atanu |title= How Data Analytics Can Help Frackers Find Oil |journal= Datanami|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by taking in seismic data, well log data, production data, and other related data sets to prescribe specific recipes for how and where to drill, complete, and produce wells in order to optimize recovery, minimize cost, and reduce environmental footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mohan, Daniel |title= Machines Prescribing Recipes from 'Things,' Earth, and People |journal =Oil &amp; Gas Investor|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconventional Resource Development===

[[File:Varied datasets.png|thumb|right|450px|Examples of structured and unstructured data sets generated and by the oil and gas companies and their ecosystem of service providers that can be analyzed together using Prescriptive Analytics software]]With the value of the end product determined by global commodity economics, the basis of competition for operators in upstream E&amp;P is the ability to effectively deploy capital to locate and extract resources more efficiently, effectively, predictably, and safely than their peers.  In unconventional resource plays, operational efficiency and effectiveness is diminished by reservoir inconsistencies, and decision-making impaired by high degrees of uncertainty.   These challenges manifest themselves in the form of low recovery factors and wide performance variations.

Prescriptive Analytics software can accurately predict production and prescribe optimal configurations of controllable drilling, completion, and production variables by modeling numerous internal and external variables simultaneously, regardless of source, structure, size, or format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Basu, Mohan, Marshall, &amp; McColpin |title=The Journey to Designer Wells |journal=Oil &amp; Gas Investor |date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option so the operations managers can proactively take appropriate actions, on time, to guarantee future exploration and production performance, and maximize the economic value of assets at every point over the course of their serviceable lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mohan, Daniel |title=Your Data Already Know What You Don't |journal=E&amp;P Magazine |date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oilfield Equipment Maintenance===

In the realm of oilfield equipment maintenance, Prescriptive Analytics can optimize configuration, anticipate and prevent unplanned downtime, optimize field scheduling, and improve maintenance planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Presley, Jennifer |title=ESP for ESPs |journal=Exploration &amp; Production |date=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to General Electric, there are more than 130,000 electric submersible pumps (ESP's) installed globally, accounting for 60% of the world's oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/electric_submersible_pumping_systems/}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prescriptive Analytics has been deployed to predict when and why an ESP will fail, and recommend the necessary actions to prevent the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wheatley, Malcolm |title=Underground Analytics |journal=DataInformed |date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[Health, Safety and Environment|Health, Safety, and Environment]], prescriptive analytics can predict and preempt incidents that can lead to reputational and financial loss for oil and gas companies.

===Pricing===

Pricing is another area of focus. [[Natural gas prices]] fluctuate dramatically depending upon supply, demand, [[econometrics]], [[geopolitics]], and weather conditions. Gas producers, pipeline transmission companies and [[Utility companies|utility firms]] have a keen interest in more accurately predicting gas prices so that they can lock in favorable terms while hedging downside risk. Prescriptive analytics software can accurately predict prices by modeling internal and external variables simultaneously and also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Watson, Michael|title=Advanced Analytics in Supply Chain - What is it, and is it Better than Non-Advanced Analytics?|journal=Supply Chain Digest|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in healthcare==

Multiple factors are driving [[healthcare]] providers to dramatically improve business processes and operations as the [[Health care in the United States|United States healthcare]] industry embarks on the necessary migration from a largely fee-for service, volume-based system to a fee-for-performance, value-based system. Prescriptive analytics is playing a key role to help improve the performance in a number of areas involving various stakeholders: payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies.

Prescriptive analytics can help providers improve effectiveness of their clinical care delivery to the population they manage and in the process achieve better patient satisfaction and retention.  Providers can do better population health management by identifying appropriate intervention models for risk stratified population combining data from the in-facility care episodes and home based telehealth.&lt;!-- It's unclear how the definition of prescriptive analytics provides distinguishes itself from the well established area of EBM (evidence based medicine) --&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can also benefit healthcare providers in their capacity planning by using analytics to leverage operational and usage data combined with data of external factors such as economic data, population demographic trends and population health trends, to more accurately plan for future capital investments such as new facilities and equipment utilization as well as understand the trade-offs between adding additional beds and expanding an existing facility versus building a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster, Roger|title=Big data and public health, part 2: Reducing Unwarranted Services|journal=Government Health IT|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can help pharmaceutical companies to expedite their drug development by identifying patient cohorts that are most suitable for the clinical trials worldwide - patients who are expected to be compliant and will not drop out of the trial due to complications.  Analytics can tell companies how much time and money they can save if they choose one patient cohort in a specific country vs. another.

In provider-payer negotiations, [[Health care provider|providers]] can improve their negotiating position with health insurers by developing a robust understanding of future service utilization. By accurately predicting utilization, providers can also better allocate personnel.

'''Project Genie''' was a [[computer]] research project started in 1964 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. 
It produced an early [[time-sharing]] system including the [[Berkeley Timesharing System]], which was then commercialized as the [[SDS 940]].

==History==
Project Genie was funded by [[J. C. R. Licklider]], the head of DARPA at that time.  The project was a smaller counterpart to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Project MAC]].

The [[Scientific Data Systems]] SDS 940 was created by modifying an SDS 930 24-bit commercial computer so that it could be used for timesharing. The work was funded by [[DARPA|ARPA]] and directed by Melvin W. Pirtle at and Wayne Lichtenberger at UC Berkeley. [[Butler Lampson]], [[Chuck Thacker]], and [[L. Peter Deutsch]] were among the young technical leaders of that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Project Genie: Berkeley’s piece of the computer revolution |publisher= [[University of California, Berkeley]] Engineering |author= Paul Spinrad and Patti Meagher |url= http://coe.berkeley.edu/news-center/publications/forefront/archive/forefront-fall-2007/features/berkeley2019s-piece-of-the-computer-revolution |accessdate= April 16, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719144454/http://coe.berkeley.edu/news-center/publications/forefront/archive/forefront-fall-2007/features/berkeley2019s-piece-of-the-computer-revolution |archivedate= July 19, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When completed and in service, the first 940 ran reliably in spite of its array of tricky mechanical issues such as a huge disk drive driven by hydraulic arms. It served about forty or fifty users at a time and still managed to drive a graphics subsystem that was quite capable for its time. &lt;!-- [[Scientific Data Systems]], was later named ''Xerox Data Systems''. --&gt;

When SDS realized the value of the time sharing system, and that the software was in the [[public domain]] (funded by the US federal government), they came back to Berkeley and collected enough information to begin manufacturing. Because  SDS manufacturing was overloaded with the 9 series production and the startup of the Sigma Series production, it could not incorporate the 940 modifications into the standard production line.  Instead, production of the 940s  was turned over to the Systems Engineering Department, which manufactured systems customised to user requirements.  To produce a 940, the Systems Engineering Department ordered a 930 from SDS manufacturing, installed the modifications developed by the Berkeley engineers, and shipped machine to the SDS customer as a 940.

Project Genie pioneered several computer hardware techniques, such as commercial time-sharing which allowed end-user programming in [[machine language]], separate protected user modes, memory paging, and [[protected memory]]. Concepts from Project Genie influenced the development of the [[TOPS-20|TENEX]] operating system for the [[PDP-10]], and [[Unix]], which inherited the concept of [[Fork (system call)|process forking]] from it&lt;ref name=" Ritchie"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritchie |first1=Dennis M. |authorlink1=Dennis Ritchie |last2=Thompson |first2=Ken |title=The UNIX Time-Sharing System |journal=Bell System Tech. J. |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=1905–1929 |publisher=AT&amp;T |date=July 1978 |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cacm.pdf |accessdate = 22 April 2014 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1978.tb02136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Unix co-creator [[Ken Thompson (computer programmer)|Ken Thompson]] worked on an SDS 940 while at Berkeley).  An SDS 940 [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] was used by [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s [[NLS (computer system)|OnLine System]] at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] and was the first computer used by the Community Memory Project at Berkeley.

A follow-on project was called CalTSS for a dual-processor [[CDC 6400]] which ended quickly in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Overview of the CAL Time-Sharing System |author= [[Butler Lampson]] |publisher= University of California |date= October 1969 |url= http://bitsavers.org/pdf/univOfCalBerkeley/Cal_TSS_Overview_Oct69.pdf |accessdate= April 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several members of project Genie such as Pirtle, Thacker, Deutsch and Lampson left UCB to form the Berkeley Computer Corporation (BCC), which produced one prototype, the BCC-500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berkeley Computer Corporation |author= [[Butler Lampson]] |publisher= Microsoft Research |url= http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/Systems.html#bcc|accessdate= April 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After BCC went bankrupt after the [[recession of 1969–70]], the BCC-500 was transferred to the [[University of Hawaii]], where it continued in use through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Design Features of the BCC 500 CPU |author= Charles F. Wall |work= Technical Report R-1 |publisher= University of Hawaii  |date= January 3, 1974 |url= http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/univOfHawaii/R-1_BCC500_DesignFeatures_Rev_Mar74.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became part of the [[ALOHAnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Frank F. Kuo |date= January 1995 |volume=25 |title= The ALOHA system |journal= ACM Computer Communication Review |url= http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-kuo.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several BCC employees became the core of [[Xerox PARC]]'s computer research group (Deutsch, Lampson and Thacker) in 1970. Lichtenberger went to the University of Hawaii, and was an early employee at [[Cisco Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ECE alumnus Wayne Lichtenberger donates a piece of computing history to the University |publisher= [[University of Illinois]] Engineering |author= Shawn Adderly |date= November 29, 2010 |url= http://www.ece.illinois.edu/mediacenter/article.asp?id=1179 |accessdate= April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirtle became technical director for the [[ILLIAC IV]] project at NASA [[Ames Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Oral History of Charles (Chuck) Thacker |author= Interviewed by Al Kossow |date= August 29, 2007 |work= Reference no: X4148.2008 |publisher= [[Computer History Museum]] |url= http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/Oral_History/102658126.05.01.acc.pdf |accessdate= April 20, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110811174603/http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/Oral_History/102658126.05.01.acc.pdf |archivedate= August 11, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">[[Image:Sophus mads jorgensen.jpg|thumb]]'''Sophus Mads Jørgensen''' (4 July 1837 – 1 April 1914) was a Danish chemist. He is considered one of the founders of [[coordination chemistry]], and is known for the debates which he had with [[Alfred Werner]] during 1893-1899. While Jørgensen's theories on coordination chemistry were ultimately proven to be incorrect, his experimental work provided much of the basis for Werner's theories. Jørgensen also made major contributions to the chemistry of [[platinum]] and [[rhodium]] compounds.

Jørgensen was a board member of the [[Carlsberg Foundation]] from 1885 until his death in 1914, and was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1899.

The 1975 [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] version of the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] ('''Soyuz 7K-TM''') served as a technological bridge to the third generation [[Soyuz-T]]  (T - транспортный, ''Transportnyi'' meaning transport) spacecraft (1976–1986). 

The Soyuz ASTP spacecraft was designed for use during the [[Apollo Soyuz Test Project]] as [[Soyuz 19]]. It featured design changes to increase compatibility with the American craft. The Soyuz ASTP featured new solar panels for increased mission length, an [[APAS-75#APAS-75|APAS-75]] docking mechanism instead of the standard male mechanism and modifications to the environmental control system to lower the cabin pressure to 0.68 atmospheres (69 kPa) prior to docking with Apollo. The ASTP Soyuz backup craft flew as the [[Soyuz 22]] mission, replacing the docking port with a camera.

[[File:Stale bread.jpg|thumb|Stale bread]]
'''Staling''', or "'''going stale'''", is a chemical and physical process in [[bread]] and other foods that reduces their palatability.  '''Stale''' bread is dry and leathery.

==Mechanism and effects==
Staling is not, as is commonly believed, simply a [[desiccation|drying-out]] process due to [[evaporation]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}  Bread will stale even in a moist environment, and stales most rapidly at temperatures just above freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |last=McGee |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold McGee |year=2004 |isbn=0-684-80001-2 |edition=2nd |publisher=Scribner |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bread stored in the refrigerator will have increased staling rates, and therefore bread should be kept at room temperature. However, refrigeration delays the growth of mold and extends the shelf life of bread.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

One important mechanism is the migration of moisture from the [[starch]] granules into the interstitial spaces, [[retrogradation (starch)|degelatinizing]] the starch. The starch [[amylose]] and [[amylopectin]] molecules realign themselves causing recrystalisation. This results in stale bread's leathery, hard texture. Additionally, pleasant "fresh" flavor is lost to the air, and often unpleasant flavor is absorbed from it as well, especially in a confined space with other food such as when in a [[refrigerator]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Countermeasures==
Anti-staling agents used in bread include [[Gluten|wheat gluten]], [[enzymes]], and [[Lipid#Glycerolipids|glycerolipids]], mainly [[monoglyceride]]s and [[diglyceride]]s.

==Culinary uses==
Stale bread is an important ingredient in many dishes, some of which were invented for the express purpose of using up otherwise unpalatable stale bread.  Examples include [[bread sauce]], [[Dumpling#Central European cuisine|bread dumplings]], and [[flummadiddle]], an early American savoury pudding. A sweet dish is [[bread pudding]].

There are many types of [[bread soup]]s such as [[gazpacho]] (in [[Spanish cuisine]]), [[wodzionka]] (in [[Silesian cuisine]]), [[ribollita]] (in [[Italian cuisine]]).

Stale bread can be used to "stretch" meat in dishes such as [[haslet]] (a type of meatloaf in [[American cuisine]]) and [[garbure]] (a stew in [[French cuisine]]). It can be a subsidiary ingredient in dishes such as [[fattoush]] (a type of salad in [[Levantine cuisine]]). Stale bread can be used as a base for dips such as [[skordalia]] (in [[Greek cuisine]]), or substituted with another ingredient. 

Cubes of stale bread can be dipped in cheese [[fondue]], or seasoned and baked in the oven to become [[crouton]]s, suitable for scattering in salads or on top of soups. Slices of stale bread soaked in an egg and milk mixture and then fried turn into [[French toast]] (known in French as ''pain perdu'' - lost bread).

Sometimes the same word can have different meanings in different countries. ''[[Migas]]'', in Spanish and Portuguese cuisines, is a breakfast dish using stale bread, and ''[[leblebi]]'', in Tunisian cuisine, is a soup of chickpeas and stale bread.

In [[medieval cuisine]], slices of stale bread, called [[trencher (tableware)|trencher]]s, were used instead of plates.

==Destaling==
Stale bread can be partially destaled by heating to 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F) in a [[conventional oven]] or [[microwave oven]]. However, if not eaten before it cools or dries, the bread is even worse than before due to the moisture loss.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence, this is an opinion|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">In [[algebraic number theory]], a '''supersingular prime''' is a [[prime number]] with a certain relationship to a given [[elliptic curve]].  If the curve ''E'' defined over the [[rational number]]s, then a prime ''p'' is '''supersingular for ''E''''' if the [[Good reduction#G|reduction]] of ''E'' modulo&amp;nbsp;''p'' is a [[supersingular elliptic curve]] over the [[residue field]]&amp;nbsp;'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.

{{Harvtxt|Elkies|1987}} showed that any elliptic curve over the rational numbers has infinitely many supersingular primes.  However, the set of supersingular primes has asymptotic density zero. {{harvtxt|Lang|Trotter|1976}} conjectured that the number of supersingular primes less than a bound ''X'' is within a constant multiple of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{X}}{\ln X}&lt;/math&gt;, using heuristics involving the distribution of eigenvalues of the Frobenius endomorphism. {{As of|2012}}, this conjecture is open.{{Update inline|?=yes|date=May 2016}}

More generally, if ''K'' is any [[global field]]—i.e., a [[finite extension]] either of '''Q''' or of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')—and ''A'' is an [[abelian variety]] defined over ''K'', then a '''supersingular prime &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; for ''A''''' is a [[finite place]] of ''K'' such that the reduction of ''A'' modulo &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is a supersingular [[abelian variety]].

'''The Millennium Dial Armillary''' is one of six pieces of [[List of public art in Sutton|public art]] located in the [[Sutton High Street|town centre]] of [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] in [[Greater London]], England. The others include the [[Sutton heritage mosaic]], the [[Sutton twin towns mural]] and the [[The Messenger (sculpture in Sutton)|Messenger statue]]. 

The [[armillary]] was dedicated to the town in 2000 by the [[Rotary Club]], and is in the form of an historical timepiece. It serves three purposes: firstly, simply to tell the time; secondly, to commemorate time through various inscriptions including the Rotary motto "Service Above Self" and distances to nearby areas such as Kingston upon Thames; and thirdly, to commemorate the work which the Rotary Club has done.&lt;ref name="Sutton council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sutton.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6991&amp;p=0|title=London Borough of Sutton document|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723132023/http://www.sutton.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6991&amp;p=0|archivedate=23 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotary Armillary

This Armillary was presented to the people of the London Borough of Sutton in grateful thanks for their generosity in supporting Rotary Charities and to mark the new Millennium. The Rotary Club of Cheam has joined with the Rotary Clubs of Carshalton, Carshalton Beeches, Sutton, Sutton Nonsuch and Wallington.
December 2000

The Project was made possible by the following Sponsors:
Securicor plc.
Holiday Inn Sutton London.
The Crown Agents.
South Sutton Neighbourhood Association.
Sutton &amp; Cheam Society.
The London Borough of Sutton.}}

The brief history of the Sutton armillary is that, in the years leading up to the new millennium, the [[London Borough of Sutton]] expressed its wish for time-related millennium projects. The Rotary Club responded to this by conceiving, planning and jointly funding the armillary. It was designed to last for years to come, and was originally positioned as the central feature of a Millennium Garden. It was slightly re-positioned in 2011, following a repaving of the pedestrianised High Street area, since when it has stood on the edge of the new  central square in the town, directly in front of the [[Waterstones]] bookshop. When deciding on the new position, the Rotary Club and the local council had to take account of the need for an adequate supply of  sunlight.&lt;ref name="Sutton council"/&gt;  

The armillary also had to be removed temporarily in November 2012, when it came off its plinth – this received coverage in the local press in a column headed "Time stops in Sutton High Street after Armillary removed".&lt;ref name="Time Stops"/&gt;

==Benefits to town==
[[File:Armillary in Trinity Square Sutton, Surrey, Greater London.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The armillary with the [[Sutton High Street#Other features of interest|Sutton Green Wall]] in the background]]
The armillary's installation has provided a focus for the [[Sutton High Street|town centre]], and it will remain as a permanent memorial, marking both the new millennium and the important role the Rotary has played in the welfare of Sutton since 1923.&lt;ref name="Sutton council"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=10262 Sutton Council Modern Gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Global 2000 Report to the President''''' &lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald O. Barney]], Study Director, The Global 2000 Report to the President, US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1980 report on [[sustainable development|sustainable societal development]], commissioned by President [[Jimmy Carter]] on May 23, 1977.  The report was released at a press conference in the White House on July 24, 1980. The report sold 1.5 million copies in 9 languages. There were many [http://www.geraldbarney.com/G2000Page.html editions of the report].

The Global 2000 project was directed by [[Gerald O. Barney]], and the main conclusion of the report was:  

::If present trends continue, the world in 2000 will be more crowded, and more vulnerable to disruption than the world we live in now. Serious stresses involving population, resources, and environment are clearly visible ahead. Despite greater material output, the world's people will be poorer in many ways than they are today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald O. Barney]], Study Director, The Global 2000 Report to the President, Vol. I, US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global 2000 Report was based on the best data and models available from 14 participating government agencies plus the [[World Bank]].  Projections were made using  [[computer model]]s.  {{cns|date=April 2018|text=No other country has ever undertaken a comparable study of the future of the world.}}

The Global 2000 project produced a report, but the Global 2000 project was more than a report.  It was the {{cns|date=April 2018|text=first (and to date the only)}} effort by a nation to prepare a 20-year outlook on probable changes in the world’s population, resources, economy, and environment.  {{cns|date=April 2018|text=It was the first and only}} time the long-term global professionals of an entire national government were assembled as a team to look at the future of the entire world.  {{cns|date=April 2018|text=It was the first and only}} time that sector-specific global policy models (population, energy, agriculture, forestry, economy, minerals, non-fuel minerals, water, etc.) were assembled and consistency assessed as the “foundation for longer-term planning” that they in fact are.&lt;ref&gt;"Analysis of the Projection Tools: The Government's Global Model," Chapters 14-23, Gerald O. Barney, Study Director, The Global 200 Report to the President, Vol. II, US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; It was {{cns|date=April 2018|text=the first and only}} time that all previous global studies were assembled and reviewed for their insights and recommendations.

Global 2000 was not the first computer-based global study.  The first computer-based global study, ''[[The Limits to Growth]]''&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, Meadows, Randers, and Behrens, The Limits to Growth, Universe Books, New York, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1972.  ''Limits'' questioned growth as the answer to all development and social problems and started a global discussion of [[global warming]], energy [[scarcity]], human [[population growth]], plant and species extinctions {{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, genetic diversity {{Clarify|date=July 2011}}, and a global economic system based on unlimited human wants in contrast to [[Earth]]'s finite resources, etc. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  {{cns|date=April 2018|text=Nothing in the Global 2000 report refutes or contradicts the conclusions of ''Limits to Growth''.}}

'''The National Marriage Project''' is a research project based in the U.S. that investigates how American marriages are formed, maintained and ended, and how society is affected. The project gathers statistical information and analyzes it to provide education to the public, and to formulate recommendations for the future. The project was started in 1997 by David Popenoe, a sociologist at [[Rutgers University]]. Since 2009 it has been based at the [[University of Virginia]] under the direction of sociologist [[W. Bradford Wilcox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/marriageproject/history.html |title=History |publisher=The National Marriage Project |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jzx6DkKOPIcC&amp;pg=PA201 |title=War Over the Family |page=201 |last=Popenoe |first=David |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |year=2008 |isbn=1-4128-0810-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation: Identity, Emotions, and Foreign Policy''''' is a 2006 book by Jacques E. C. Hymans, published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060901fabook85528/jacques-e-c-hymans/the-psychology-of-nuclear-proliferation-identity-emotions-and-foreign-policy.html  The Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation: Identity, Emotions, and Foreign Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112710/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060901fabook85528/jacques-e-c-hymans/the-psychology-of-nuclear-proliferation-identity-emotions-and-foreign-policy.html |date=2008-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Hymans draws on the humanities and social sciences to build a  model of decision-making that links identity to emotions and ultimately to [[nuclear energy policy]] choices.

==Education and career==
He was born in [[West Hartlepool]] and educated at the local grammar school. He began a brilliant career as zoologist, palaeontologist, but primarily a geologist, when he entered Armstrong College at the age of 17 by means of an open entrance scholarship in 1929. Armstrong College went on eventually to become Newcastle University. He gained a BSc in geology in 1932 and a PhD in 1934 from research on Permian fishes. His association with Newcastle University was to endure throughout his life, his central interest being the study of fossil fish. He was head of department from 1948 until his retirement in 1977. In retirement he remained as a research fellow and Chairman of Convocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/obits/obits_alpha/westoll_thomas.pdf|title = Thomas Stanley Westoll|publisher = The Royal Society of Edinburgh|accessdate = 20 July 2010|location = Edinburgh|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004123112/http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/obits/obits_alpha/westoll_thomas.pdf|archivedate = 4 October 2006|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March 1952.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660-2007ll |publisher=The Royal Society |accessdate=20 July 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324095152/http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |archivedate=March 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The citation on his application read: "''Westoll is a palaeontologist who by his description of new materials and by the introduction of new and fertile ideas into the interpretation of the structure of early fossil vertebrates has greatly increased our understanding of the problems they present. He has introduced new views about the origins of the pectoral fins of craniates and of the Tetrapod limb. He has clarified our ideas about the homologies of the dermal skull bones of vertebrates and made a new and convincing comparison between the skulls of Amphibia and Fish. He has made important contributions towards the solution of the old problems of the origin of the mammalian palate and ear. His monograph of the Haplolepidae sets a new standard for taxonomic work on fossil fish".'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27EC%2F1952%2F24%27&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl|title=Library and Archive Catalog|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=20 July 2010|location=London}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was on the council of the [[Royal Society]] and from 1972 to 1974 was President of the Geological Society of London.

He died in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1995.

==Research interests==
His research interests were wide-ranging, but he is best known for his work on the [[evolution of fish]]. The development of the [[tetrapod]] limb and issues with the [[Silurian]]-[[Devonian]] boundary were some of the topics which occupied him. Throughout a long academic career he made forceful and important contributions in these and other fields

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4224">The '''user illusion''' is the illusion created for the user by a [[human-computer interface|human–computer interface]], for example the [[desktop metaphor|visual metaphor of a desktop]] used in many [[graphical user interfaces]]. The phrase originated at [[Xerox PARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Tognazzini|authorlink=Bruce Tognazzini|title=Tog on Software Design|isbn=0-201-48917-1|year=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKBQAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]] have argued that [[consciousness]] is a form of user illusion. This notion is explored by [[Tor Nørretranders]] in his 1991 Danish book ''Mærk verden'', issued in a 1998 English edition as ''The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor Nørretranders|authorlink=Tor Nørretranders|title=The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size|isbn=0-670-87579-1|year=1998|publisher=Viking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwMwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced the idea of [[exformation]] in this book.  Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has also embraced the view that human consciousness is a "user-illusion."&lt;ref&gt;"Human consciousness is unlike all other varieties of animal consciousness in that it is a product in large part of cultural evolution . . . creating thereby a cognitive architecture unlike the ‘bottom-up’ minds of animals. . . . [T]his architecture furnishes each of us with . . . a user-illusion” (Daniel C. Dennett, ''From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds'' (2017), p. 370).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this picture, our experience of the world is not immediate, as all sensation requires processing time. It follows that our conscious experience is less a perfect reflection of what is occurring, and more a simulation produced unconsciously by the brain. Therefore, there may be phenomena that exist beyond our peripheries, beyond what consciousness could create to isolate or reduce them.

== Criticism ==
Critics of the idea of consciousness being a device for justifying preconceptions argue that such a device would consume [[nutrient]]s without producing any useful results, since it would not change the outcome of any decisions. These critics argue that the existence of  [[social insect]]s with extremely small brains [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the notion that social behavior requires consciousness, citing that insects have too small [[brain]]s to be conscious and yet there are observed behaviors among them that for all functional intents and purposes match those of complex social cooperation and manipulation (including hierarchies where each individual has its place among [[paper wasp]]s and [[Jack Jumper]] [[ant]]s and [[honey bee]]s sneaking when they lay eggs). These critics also argue that since social behavior in insects and other extremely small-brained animals have [[convergent evolution|evolved multiple times independently]], there is no evolutionary difficulty in simple reaction sociality to impose selection pressure for the more nutrient-consuming path of consciousness for sociality. These critics do point out that other evolutionary paths to consciousness are possible, such as critical evaluation that enhances plasticity by criticizing [[fallibility|fallible]] notions, while pointing out that such a critical consciousness would be quite different from the justificatory type proposed by Nørretranders, differences including that a critical consciousness would make individuals more capable of changing their minds instead of justifying and persuading.&lt;ref&gt;How the body shapes the way we think: A new view of intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information Processing in Social Insects: Claire Detrain, Jean L.

{{Lowercase title}}
[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Embryology theories of [[Ernst Haeckel]] (following [[Johann Friedrich Meckel|Meckel]]) and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] compared. Von Baer denied any recapitulation of whole adult forms, though individual structures might be recapitulated.]]
'''Von Baer's laws of embryology''' (or '''laws of development''') are four rules discovered by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] to explain the observed pattern of [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]] in different species.&lt;ref name=abz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abzhanov|first1=Arhat|title=von Baer's law for the ages: lost and found principles of developmental evolution |journal=Trends in Genetics|date=2013|volume=29|issue=12|pages=712–722|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2013.09.004|pmid=24120296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Baer formulated the laws in the book ''Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere'' ("''On the Developmental History of Animals''"), published in 1828, while working at the [[University of Königsberg]]. He specifically intended to rebut [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s 1808 [[recapitulation theory]]. According to that theory, embryos pass through successive stages that represent the adult forms of less complex organisms in the course of development, and that ultimately reflects ''scala naturae'' (the [[great chain of being]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=John M. |last2=Schultka |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Göbbel |first3=Luminita |title=Meckel on developmental pathology |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |date=2006 |volume=140A |issue=2 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31043}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Baer believed that such linear development is impossible. He posited that instead of linear progression, embryos started from one or a few basic forms that are similar in different animals, and then developed in a branching pattern into increasingly different organisms. Defending his ideas, he was also opposed to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[Natural selection|common ancestry and descent with modification]], and particularly to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s revised recapitulation theory with its slogan "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garstang |first1=Walter |authorlink=Walter Garstang |title=The Theory of Recapitulation: A Critical Re-statement of the Biogenetic Law |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=1922|volume=35 |issue=232 |pages=81–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1922.tb00464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovtrup |first1=Soren |title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1978 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=348 |doi=10.2307/2412887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The laws==

Von Baer's laws are a series of statements generally summarised into four points. As translated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in his ''Scientific Memoirs'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Thomas Henry |authorlink=Thomas Huxley |editor1-last=Henfrey |editor1-first=Arthur |title=Scientific memoirs, selected from the transactions of foreign academies of science, and from foreign journals. Natural history |year=1853 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.28029 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/70597#page/186/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The more general characters of a large group appear earlier in the embryo than the more special characters.
# From the most general forms the less general are developed, and so on, until finally the most special arises.
# Every embryo of a given animal form, instead of passing through the other forms, rather becomes separated from them.
# The embryo of a higher form never resembles any other form, but only its embryo.

==Description==

Von Baer discovered the [[blastula]] (the early hollow ball stage of an embryo) and the development of the [[notochord]] (the stiffening rod along the back of all [[chordate]]s, that forms after the blastula and [[gastrula]] stages). From his observations of these stages in different vertebrates, he realised that [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] must be wrong. For example, he noticed that the [[yolk sac]] is found in [[bird]]s, but not in [[frog]]s. According to the recapitulation theory, such structures should invariably be present in frogs because they were assumed to be at a lower level in the evolutionary tree. Von Baer concluded that while structures like the notochord are recapitulated during embryogenesis, whole organisms are not.&lt;ref name="matthen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthen |first1=Mohan |last2=Stephens |first2=Christopher |title=Philosophy of Biology |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-080-47124-2 |pages=444–445 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bVww2ZPO258C&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that (as translated):

{{quote|The embryo successively adds the organs that characterize the animal classes in the ascending scale. When the human embryo, for instance, is but a simple vesicle, it is an infusorian; when it has gained a liver, it is a mussel; with the appearance of the osseous system, it enters the class of fishes; and so forth, until it becomes a mammal and then a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ospovat |first1=D. |title=The influence of Karl Ernst von Baer's embryology, 1828–1859: A reappraisal in light of Richard Owen's and William B. Carpenter's "Palaeontological application of 'von Baer's law'" |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |year=1976 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1007/BF00129171}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of taxonomic hierarchy, according to von Baer, characters in the embryo are formed in top-to-bottom sequence, first from those of the largest and oldest taxon, the [[phylum]], then in turn class, order, family, genus, and finally species.&lt;ref name="matthen"/&gt;

==Reception==

The laws received a mixed appreciation. While they were criticised in detail, they formed the foundation of modern [[embryology]].&lt;ref name=abz/&gt; The British zoologist [[Adam Sedgwick (zoologist)|Adam Sedgwick]] studied the developing embryos of [[Squalus|dogfish]] and [[chicken]], and in 1894 noted a series of differences, such as the green yolk in the dogfish and yellow yolk in the chicken, absence of embryonic rim in chick embryos, absence of [[blastopore]] in dogfish, and differences in the gill slits and gill clefts. He concluded:

{{quote|There is no stage of development in which the unaided eye would fail to distinguish between them with ease... A blind man could distinguish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sedgwick |first1=Adam |authorlink=Adam Sedgwick (zoologist) |title=Memoirs: On the Law of Development commonly known as von Baer's Law; and on the Significance of Ancestral Rudiments in Embryonic Development |journal=Journal of Cell Science |date=1894 |volume=s2-36 |pages=35–52 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s2-36/141/35}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most important supporter of von Baer's laws was Charles Darwin, who wrote in his ''[[Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|[The] adult [animal] differs from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |title=On the Origin of Species |date=1859 |publisher=John Murray|location=London |page=338 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Darwin took up the concept of common descent which formed part of his theory of evolution. But von Baer was a vociferous anti-Darwinist, devoting much of his scholarly effort to criticising Darwinism. His criticism culminated with his last work ''Über Darwins Lehre'' ("''On Darwin's Doctrine''"), published in the year of his death in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vucinich |first1=Alexander |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |date=1988 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-52-006283-3 |page=93 |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5290063h&amp;chunk.id=d0e2212&amp;toc.id=d0e2205&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;
