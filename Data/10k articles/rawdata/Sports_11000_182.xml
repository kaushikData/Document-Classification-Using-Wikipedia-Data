==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* [[Tom Cribb]] retains his English championship, defeating American [[Tom Molineaux]] on 28 September in the 11th round of a highly anticipated return bout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Cribb] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gVUt4ZMo?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}.

'''Events'''

* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Thomas Howard (English cricketer)|Thomas Howard]] 8

==[[Horse racing]]==

Claims are made on behalf of Mace that he is also the holder of the American Championship and this fight was the first world heavyweight championship bout.

The scheduled Intercollegiate Tournament was held and was won by Lieutenant John O. Matheson of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]].&lt;ref name="CR-V1N9"&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Kashdan|editor-first=Isaac|author-link=Isaac Kashdan|title=Picking Up the News|periodical=[[Chess Review|The Chess Review]]|date=September 1933|volume=1|issue=9|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1934 British Empire Games''' were the second of what is now known as the [[Commonwealth Games]], held in England, from 4–11 August 1934. The host city was [[London]], with the main venue at [[Wembley Park]], although the track cycling events were in [[Manchester]]. Seventeen national teams took part, including the [[Ireland at the Commonwealth Games|Irish Free State]] (the only Games in which they participated, although at the [[1930 British Empire Games|1930 Games]], a team representing the whole of Ireland competed).

The 1934 Games had originally been awarded to [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, but the venue was later changed to London due to concerns regarding the treatment of black and Asian athletes by South African officials and fans.

Six sports were featured in the Games: athletics in [[White City Stadium]]; boxing, wrestling, and aquatics (swimming and diving) in the [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool and Arena, Wembley]]; cycling in [[Fallowfield Stadium]], Manchester; and [[lawn bowls]] at [[Paddington]] and [[Temple, London|Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/body-line-barred |title=BODY- LINE BARRED - On the greens at Paddington and Temple take place the less strenuous contest of Empire Games.  |publisher=Pathé News |date=9 August 1934 |accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's events in athletics were held for the first time; the previous games had women's events only in swimming and diving.

'''AND1''' is an American footwear and clothing company specializing in basketball shoes, clothing and sporting goods. AND1 was founded on August 13, 1993, on the grounds of "All ball, nothing more". AND1 focuses strictly on basketball. It is currently a subsidiary of the Sequential Brands Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.sequentialbrandsgroup.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=856388|title=Sequential Brands Group Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Galaxy Brand Holdings (NASDAQ:SQBG)|website=ir.sequentialbrandsgroup.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sold nationally and around the world by Sporting Goods retailers. AND1 continues to sponsor NBA athletes, as well as numerous High School and AAU teams in America.

==Company history==

=== 1993 - 2000 ===
In 1993, AND1 began as a graduate school project [[partnership]] of Jay Coen Gilbert, Seth Berger, and Tom Austin while they were graduate students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wharton School]]. The company name is derived from a phrase used by [[basketball]] [[Sports presenter|broadcasters]]: when a player is [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouled]] during shooting and makes the basket, they're given the points "and 1" shot at the [[free throw]] line. The brand started by selling T-shirts out of the back of a car, but caught fire right away. Early advertising strategies, used to distinguish their products from others, included other basketball [[slogans]] and [[trash talk]], such as "Pass. Save Yourself The Embarrassment". It marketed itself towards the “ballers”, those who hone their craft on streets and always think they’re the best player on the court. The t-shirts started off in Foot Locker and within the second year of launching it reached 1,500 stores across America.

In mid of 1996, NBA star [[Stephon Marbury]] became the first spokesman for AND1. With Marbury’s signing, AND1 launched its first pair of basketball sneakers, officially expanding the brand into the footwear category. Marbury was named to the All-Rookie Team in ‘97.
[[File:Taichissw.jpg|thumb|202x202px|A pair of AND1 basketball shoes]]
In late 1998, a [[videotape]] containing [[streetball]] stunts was delivered to AND1 by Marquise Kelly, coach of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo High School|Benjamin Cardozo High school]] team in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The tape contained low quality camera moves, poor resolution and nearly indecipherable audio featuring a [[streetballer]] by the name of [[Rafer Alston]]. At the time, Alston was a student at [[California State University, Fresno|Fresno State]] who had entered the [[1998 NBA Draft]]. The videotape would soon be known as the "Skip tape", referring to Alston's streetball nickname "Skip to my Lou".   Alston later signed on with AND1.

In 1999 at [[Haverford College]] in [[Philadelphia]], AND1 shot their first series of [[commercials]] and [[print ad]]s incorporating [[NBA]] players [[Darrell Armstrong]], [[Rex Chapman]], [[Ab Osondu]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Toby Bailey]], and [[Miles Simon]]. When the traditional marketing campaign proved unsuccessful, a strategy was formed to use the "Skip tape". It was edited and reprinted into 50,000 copies and over the next eight weeks, distributed across basketball camps, clinics, record labels. The tape would become the first "Mix Tape", and quickly made Alston into a celebrity. When AND1 became a product partner with [[Foot Locker|FootAction]], this strategy evolved into a national program.

Starting in the summer of 1999, a free AND1 Mix Tape was given with any purchase. Approximately 200,000 tapes were distributed in the span of 3 weeks, making this [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] one of the most successful in U.S. retail history. Filmmakers were then sent across the country to capture and find the next streetball legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|work=Chicago Sports Review |url=http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/redesign/inprint/contentview.asp?c%3D167978 |title=Chicago Sports Review   -RIP Flash 1975-2004- |accessdate=2006-12-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015616/http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/redesign/inprint/contentview.asp?c=167978 |archivedate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000 - 2010 ===
Beginning with the Marbury signing and the Rafer Alston discovery two years later, AND1 began to recruit more and more NBA players to wear their product, a major power play in competing with the bigger brands, such as Nike and Adidas. Players like Latrell Sprewell, Kevin Garnett and Jamal Crawford brought AND1 into the national spotlight and helped them secure shelf space in major footwear retailers, such as Foot Locker and FootAction. By the 2001 season, AND1 was second only to Nike in market share among NBA endorsees, a big part of them soon becoming the second largest basketball brand in the United States, only eight years after their inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2014/08/fascinating-look-history-b-corp-movement/|title=A Look at the History of the B Corp Movement|date=2014-08-19|website=Triple Pundit: People, Planet, Profit|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AND1 is famous for the shoe known as the Tai Chi, famously worn by Vince Carter during the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest, where he put on one of the greatest NBA Slam Dunk Contest showings of all time.

The AND1 summer tours had already been going on from 1999, but in 2002, with the release of Mixtape 3, AND1 officially expanded their annual streetball tours into the Mixtape Tour. Legendary streetballers such as “Hot Sauce” and “The Professor” would go from court to court to challenge the greatest streetballers in one-on-one’s, entertaining fans and providing much of the footage for the ensuing Mixtapes. The streetballers who prevailed through the very end of the summer tours would receive endorsement deals from AND1. From 2002 through 2008, the tours were televised live on ESPN under the name “Streetball” and competed with ESPN’s “SportsCenter” for the highest ratings. The summer tours began in America but soon branched into more than 30 countries, giving them international fame and promoting the sale of their products in 130 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/redesign/inprint/contentview.asp?c=167978 |title=The Chicago Sports Review {{!}} CHISPORT.COM |date=2007-03-11 |access-date=2016-05-06 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015616/http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/redesign/inprint/contentview.asp?c=167978 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prominent appearances of AND1’s sneakers, aside from Vince’s dunk contest, was when Detroit Piston Chauncy Billups took home the MVP honors during the 2004 NBA Finals, wearing the AND1 Rise’s. The mid-top sneakers’ clean and aggressive look matched “Mr. Big Shot” Billups’ game perfectly. In the Rises, Billups would average 21 points and 5 rebounds in the series, leading the Pistons to their first championship in 14 years and picking up the MVP award in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2013/06/the-sneakers-worn-by-the-last-25-nba-finals-mvps|title=The Sneakers Worn by the Last 25 NBA Finals MVPs|website=Complex|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AND1 apparel and footwear had first appeared in the digital arena on Street Hoops in 2002, but in 2006 the brand officially made its entrance into the category, partnering with UBISOFT to release its first video game, AND1 Streetball. A mobile version was also released by Gameloft. The game featured a story mode mirroring AND1’s "Streetball" series on ESPN, where players were able to create their own basketball player and enter him in the AND 1 Mix Tape Tour in order to get a contract with the AND 1 team. Along the way, players were able to create their own stylized trick moves and pull them off with a two-analog stick system called "I BALL". The games were available on both PlayStation 2 and Xbox and received positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/and-1-streetball-ps2/|title=And 1® Streetball|website=Playstation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, AND1’s longest-tenured endorsee Rafer “Skip 2 My Lou” Alston would lead the Orlando Magic to the NBA Finals versus the Kobe Bryant led Los Angeles Lakers. Skip wore the AND1 Cubics throughout the ‘09 season, all the way through the NBA finals. After another one of his high-scoring playoff games, Magic teammate Dwight Howard said this about Skip: “He wasn’t Rafer Alston [tonight], he was the playground legend ‘Skip 2 My Lou”. When he plays like the playground legend, he’s tough to guard. The Magic ultimately lost the series in five games, but Skip’s presence in the finals brought great acclaim to AND1, as his AND1 background story was covered numerous times in the papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105248463|title=Bouncing From Street Ball To The NBA|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/07/sports/sp-streetballer7|title=From 'Skip' to Rafer -- his ultimate crossover|last=Wharton|first=David|date=2009-06-07|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 - Present ===
Following a short hiatus, the AND1 Mixtape Tour would return in 2010, now known as the AND1 Live Streetball Tour. The tour continued to expand globally as the AND1 team toured the world, meeting success against most international teams and scoring wins over adversaries as diverse as Chile and Angola. They remaining undefeated outside the United States until they lost to the debuting Puerto Rico Streetballers in 2012.

Over the years, AND1 has changed hands a few times, first being bought out by American Sporting Goods in 2005 and subsequently sold to [[Brown Shoe Company]] in February 2011. On August 25, 2011, AND1 was sold to Galaxy Brands, a brand management company based in New York. The company later merged with Sequential Brands Group, a publicly traded brand management company, but the personnel managing AND1 never changed. Under Sequential, AND1 has reconnected with its roots, signing marquee NBA players and sponsoring tournaments worldwide. 

In November 2012, AND1 signed then-[[Indiana Pacers|Pacer]] [[Lance Stephenson]] to an endorsement deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slamonline.com/kicks/lance-stephenson-signs-endorsement-deal-with-and-1/#EwOiwETzGOODREiU.97|title=Lance Stephenson Signs Endorsement Deal With AND 1 {{!}} SLAMonline|website=SLAMonline|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson had won the NYC basketball championships in all four years of high school, and became New York State's all-time leading scorer in high school basketball, named [[Mr. New York Basketball]] after his senior year. He would soon sign a multi-year deal with the [[Indiana Pacers]], with AND1 signing him during his rookie season. Born Ready fit the AND1 streetball personality with his aggressive never-back-down attitude, which was put on national display during the 2014 NBA Conference Finals. Stephenson, who had led the league in triple-doubles that year and led the Pacers past the Knicks in the round prior, was paired against the [[Miami Heat]]’s [[LeBron James]]. From trash-talking to “mind games,” to even blowing in James ear at one point, Stephenson did whatever he could to get into James’ head and under his skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/29/lance-stephenson-blow-ear-lebron-james_n_5410487.html|title=GIF: Lance Stephenson Got Weird With LeBron|date=2014-05-29|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In celebration of their 20-year anniversary, the brand hosted the AND1 Labor Day Summer Remix, a $100,000 winner-take-all basketball tournament in August 2013. The tournament took place in [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia, and also included a $10,000 dunk contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehoopdoctors.com/2013/08/and1-hosts-100000-winner-take-all-basketball-tournament-at-temple-university-in-philly/|title=AND1 Hosts $100,000 Basketball Tournament Labor Day Weekend|website=The Hoop Doctors|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paying homage to Brooklyn streetball culture, AND1 partnered with ''[[Slam (magazine)|SLAM]]'' magazine to host numerous events surrounding the [[2015 NBA All-Star Game]] (played at the [[Barclays Center]] in downtown Brooklyn). Various charity events with two of New York's greatest streetball legends Lance Stephenson and [[Rafer Alston|Rafer "Skip to My Lou" Alston]] were followed by the launch of an exclusive pop-up retail lounge on Flatbush Avenue across from Barclays Center.&lt;ref name=IR&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.sequentialbrandsgroup.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=895849|title=AND1(R) Teams Up With ''SLAM'' magazine to pay tribute to Brooklyn Streetball and New York City Basketball Culture During NBA All-Star Weekend (NASDAQ:SQBG)|website=ir.sequentialbrandsgroup.com|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently over one hundred AND1 High School and AAU teams playing across America in various tournaments and leagues, and an AND1 circuit in the making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://respect-mag.com/2016/02/and-1/|title=And 1 To Host Wellington March Madness Tournament {{!}} RESPECT.|date=2016-02-26|website=RESPECT.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slamonline.com/college-hs/high-school/and1-announces-tyba-3-session-circuit/|title=AND1 Announces TYBA 3-Session Circuit for 2016|date=2016-04-13|website=SLAMonline|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AND 1 is currently distributed at [[Walmart]] stores.  The company's annual overall revenue is approximately $140 million.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

In February 2015, AND1 signed a lease to operate a retail store at 172 Flatbush Ave in Brooklyn, directly across the street from the [[Barclays Center]]. This is the company's first street retail location.&lt;ref name=IR /&gt;

==AND1 Mixtape Tour==
[[Image:Team1 huddle and1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The AND1 team]] The [[AND1 Mixtape Tour]] has featured [[streetball]] players of fame, including [[Rafer Alston|Skip to My Lou]], [[Waliyy Dixon|Main Event]], [[Grayson Boucher|The Professor]], [[Philip Champion|Hot Sauce]], [[Dennis Chism|Spyda]], [[Robert Martin (basketball)|50]], and [[Aaron Owens|AO]]. AND1 players have made annual tours around America to recruit the next streetball legend. This recruiting has since been edited for airing as ''Street Ball'' on [[ESPN]] and [[ESPN2]]. It is also parodied in the movie ''[[Like Mike 2: Streetball]]'' as "Game On".

The tour was televised in half-hour "Streetball" segments on [[ESPN2]], and were compiled into highlight reels, offered under the mark AND1 Mixtape, which were sold on [[DVD]]. AND1 has released 10 volumes. The first mixtape was ''AND1 Mixtape Volume 1'' (1998) and the most recent is ''AND1 Mixtape X'' (2008).

Following a short hiatus, the AND1 Mixtape Tour would return in 2010, now known as the AND1 Live Streetball Tour. The AND1 team has toured the world, meeting success against most international teams and scoring wins over adversaries as diverse as Chile and Angola, remaining undefeated outside the United States until they lost to the debuting [[Streetball in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico Streetballers]] in 2012.&lt;sup&gt;[[AND1 Live Tour|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Video games==
[[EA Sports]]' ''[[NBA Street (video game)|NBA Street]]'', published in 2001, featured dunks and passes in AND1 fashion, but was licensed from the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. In 2002, [[Activision]] announced the first AND1 video game called ''[[Street Hoops]]'', featuring AND1 players.  [[Gameloft]] has also released a mobile game based on the AND1 franchise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3765">'''Amin al-Hindi''' (1940 &amp;ndash; August 17, 2010) was an intelligence chief of the [[Palestinian Authority]]. Hindi was a leader of the [[Black September (group)|Black September]] movement and was suspected of involvement in the [[Munich massacre]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] that resulted in the deaths of 11 [[Israel]]i athletes and coaches.
[[File:Connollystraße 31 - Gedenktafel.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque commemorating the eleven Israeli athletes killed during the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre.]]

Hindi was born in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in 1940 and was actively involved with [[Yasir Arafat]] in the [[Fatah]] movement that Arafat created in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;[[Isabel Kershner|Kershner, Isabel]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/world/middleeast/19hindi.html "Amin al-Hindi, Former Palestinian Intelligence Chief, Dies at 70"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 2010. Accessed August 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its obituary, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Hindi as being "widely suspected of having played an organizing role" in the Black September attack in [[Munich]] that led to the deaths of 11 athletes and coaches representing the Israeli Olympic team at the 1972 Summer Games who had been taken as hostages at the Olympic village on the morning of September 5, 1972. Israeli security forces carried out a series of killings of individuals believed to have been involved with the massacre. Hindi never acknowledged his involvement in the attack and may have been the last living person involved with plotting the attack following the death of [[Abu Daoud]], the Palestinian terrorist known as the planner, architect and mastermind of the Munich massacre.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Staff. [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jTqUyte9OUr_c6MMHle99xJT1Bcw "Last Palestinian tied to 1972 Munich attack dies"], [[Agence France-Presse]], August 18, 2010.

Israel permitted him to return from exile in the 1990s following the [[Oslo Accords]]. He became a senior official in the Palestinian Authority and served as commander of the Palestinian General Security and Intelligence Service until 2005. In that role he had frequent contact with Israeli military and security forces.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

The Palestinian news agency [[Wafa]] reported that al-Hindi had died at age 70 on August 17, 2010, in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], due to [[liver cancer]] and [[pancreatic cancer]]. His body was transported from Jordan to the [[West Bank]] where ceremonies honoring him were held at the presidential headquarters of [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. His body was then transferred through [[Israel]] for burial in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

[[Image:Sidi shoes.jpg|thumb|Sidi women's road cycling shoe using three-bolt cleat]]
'''Cycling shoes''' are [[shoe]]s purpose-built for [[cycling]]. There are a variety of designs depending on the type and intensity of the [[cycling]] for which they are intended. Key features include rigidity, for more-efficient transfer of power from the cyclist to the pedals, weight, a method of attaching the shoe firmly to the pedal and adaptability for use on and off the bicycle. Most high-performance cycling shoes can be adjusted while in use, via a quick-adjusting system that has largely replaced laces.

==Pedal systems==
{{Main|Bicycle pedal}}
Modern cycling shoes are designed to work with [[bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedal]] systems. Such systems temporarily connect the shoe to the pedal like a [[ski binding]] system for maximal efficiency of power-transfer using a cleat on the bottom of each shoe and a matched fitting on the pedal. Several manufacturers produce these systems; consequently, modern shoes usually have threaded holes in the sole in various arrangements to attach cleats from different manufacturers.

Broadly there are two styles of clipless pedals: road and MTB. Mountain bike style use a small cleat that sits up inside the sole of the shoe. It enables reasonable walking/running when dismounted. Road pedals use a wide cleat that makes walking difficult but gives good power transfer and is comfortable on long rides.

An older system is the [[bicycle pedal#Toe-clip|toe-clip]] and toestrap. A toeclip is a metal cage attached to the front of the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the clipless pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic shoe plate or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with toe clip and strap keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback is that a rider had to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take his foot out of the pedal and for this reason toeclips have been made largely obsolete by clipless pedals. The second is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or a non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage of the rider's feet not being firmly attached to the pedals but had the advantage of being able to release from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand, and also any shoe can be used.

==Sole material and shoe quality==

Soles for cycling shoes are usually divided into three categories.  Inexpensive shoes mostly use an injection-molded plastic sole, which is economical but heavier and prone to flexing.  Mid-range shoes may use a combination of plastic and [[carbon fibre]], plastic and fibreglass, or an all carbon fibre sole.  All manufacturers' high-end competition level shoes manufactured post-2002 use carbon fibre soles.  The sole material and amount of tread used in a shoe affects its weight; an expensive pair of road shoes with carbon fibre soles can weigh as little as 400&amp;nbsp;grams, while a budget-priced  pair of mountain bike shoes might weigh 850 to 900&amp;nbsp;grams.

Some mountain bike shoes have a little engineered flex in the toe area forward of the cleat mount.  This assists in walking and in climbing obstacles while carrying the bike.  More expensive shoes usually have less frontal flex.

==Variety==
Cycling shoes come in numerous variants: road racing, track racing, winter, casual cycling, touring, off-road or [[mountain biking]], and indoor cycling or [[Spinning (cycling)|spinning]]. Though many cycling shoe suppliers will have a conversion to American, English, French or even Japanese sizing, most cycling shoes are measured in European sizing.  The available sizes range from European 35 to as large as 52.  A few cycling shoe suppliers offer selected models wider than the standard "D" width.  There are a small number of custom cycling shoe makers that will tailor a shoe to a cyclist's exact foot size and shape.

===Road===
[[Image:Sidi Super Cycle shoe 43.5.jpg|thumb|1980s cycling shoe with leather and nylon mesh uppers, leather sole, and adjustable shoeplate, for use with quill pedals]]
These have a mostly smooth, rigid and inflexible sole, bent slightly at the ball of the foot.  This, and the cleat attached to the shoe bottom, make a clicking sound when they come together and results in the waddle of the walking cyclist.  These shoes are designed to function while the user is on the bike and little attention is paid to off-bike use.  Most road shoes have a raised and generally different material from the outsole at the toe and heel to make stopping and short walks a little easier. Some road shoe outsoles have additional holes which are claimed to assist in ventilation. Quality can be measured by the shoe's fit, rigidity, durability, construction quality and lightness. Road shoes have molded holes with threaded inserts inside to allow for the attachment of an external cleat.  As of 2010, nearly all cycling shoes use a three-hole system for attaching the cleat which is sometimes called a "Look pattern" after the company that popularized the clipless pedal in the middle 1980s.  Lake, DMT and Sidi now offer a purpose designed, Speedplay pedal compatible shoe. These cleats attach to a clipless pedal making them even more unsuitable for walking. The 2010 price range for a road cycling shoe in the US is from $70 to over $450.  Sizes available range from 35 to 52, with most companies offering sizes ranging from 39 to 46. Most companies offer models in European half sizes in the middle and largest selling size range, and a rare few offer shoes in wider than "D" width in limited models.

===Triathlon===
[[Triathlon]]-specific shoes are usually a variant of road shoes. The key features include: quick foot entry and exit, sockless, and good drainage. During a triathlon, the athlete needs to change quickly from the swim to bike phase and from bike to run phase. At competitive levels, there is no time for socks or fiddly buckles. The shoes are usually pre-clipped to the pedals and feet are inserted after mounting. The shoes have a single big velcro fastening as opposed to laces or 3 velcro/ratchet straps.

===Track===
[[Velodrome]] or [[Track cycling|track racing]] is popular in the UK, Australia, parts of the US and the traditional cycling countries of Europe.  In the past few years companies have developed track-specific shoes to address the very specialized needs of the track racer.  These shoes tend to be very simple and almost traditional with lace closures for best fit with pedal straps yet they frequently use the lightest and most rigid materials.  All that allows the riders to apply all their force to their pedals without worrying about the shoes stretching, coming off or coming unclipped.  [[Keirin]] riders, [[Sprint (cycling)|sprinters]] and [[Track time trial|kilo]] riders and some others prefer a track specific shoe to a standard cycling shoe. Riivo, Bont, DMT, Suplest, and Exustar offer track-specific shoes.

===Touring===
The traditional cycling tourist usually used toe clips and straps, but touring shoes designed for use with clipless pedals are now also common, usually with a recessed cleat so that the rider can both walk and cycle effectively. Touring shoes typically sacrifice some rigidity for traction and add treads.

===Casual===
This type of shoe generally has a soft outsole (as compared with a road shoe) and a molded internal midsole. They are shaped more like a street or trail shoe with a less exaggerated "rocker" allowing a more normal gait.  The outsole usually has a lugged pattern which is like a day hiking boot and is a compromise between an aggressive off shoe and an old-style touring shoe.  These shoes have a molded midsole which protects the rider's foot from the pedal and transfers energy more evenly without a pressure point at the exact shoe/pedal contact points. It also allows for the attachment of a clipless pedal cleat and can be more or less walked in normally.  There is almost always a rectangular cutout in the outsole where a piece of the outsole material is removed by the purchaser or bicycle store, under which is the midsole and two oval slots where the cleats are bolted on.  Most of these cleats follow [[Shimano]]'s "SPD" system.  Other two-bolt cleat and pedal systems for use with casual cycling and MTB shoes are produced by Crank Brothers, Speedplay and Ritchey, to name a few.  Casual cycling shoes normally have a US retail price of under $100.  Sizes range from 35 to 50 in European sizing.

===Sandals===
Usually a subcategory of Casual, sandals follow Shimano's "SPD" system. Manufacturers include [[Keen (shoe company)|Keen]], Shimano, and [[Nashbar]].

===Mountain bike===
[[Image:But rowerowy SPD.jpg|thumb|Adidas mountain cycling shoe using two-bolt SPD-style cleat for clipless pedal]]
These shoes also use the two-slot cleat mounting system like casual cycling shoes but have a more aggressive, lugged outsole for better performance when the rider has to get off the bike to run or to push or carry the bike.  Most of these shoes also allow for attachment of two screw-in spikes in the toe area for even more traction in mud or steep trails. The cleats used on mountain bike shoes are also depressed below the treads of the sole, keeping them safe from contact with the ground. Injection-molded nylon midsoles reinforced with [[fiberglass]], carbon fiber-reinforced injection molded nylon and hand-laid carbon fiber midsoles can be found depending on manufacturer and price range.  Prices in the US in 2010 range from $70 to well over $350 for the most expensive models.  Sizes are available from 35 to 50, with some companies offering a wider model or two.

===Indoor===
Often called Spinning shoes, after the company that popularized fitness club classes led by an instructor using stationary bicycles. A few companies have developed shoe models intended to cater to the indoor cyclist, including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], Lake, [[SIDI]], [[Specialized Bicycle Components|Specialized]], Exustar and others. These shoes have not been widely accepted due to their limited availability and a fragmented consumer market. US retail prices as of 2010 are generally under $90, with the normal range of sizes available.

===Winter===
Cycling shoes with insulated, over-the-ankle coverage have been available for a number of years from Lake, Sidi, [[Northwave (sportswear)|Northwave]], Exustar, Gaerne and others.  Some of these companies offer both road and off-road versions of their shoes, and some offer more than one model, with varying degrees of protection from cold, wind and moisture.  Lake shoes have been used by riders who have won the Iditabike, which is an extreme adventure race in Alaska.

==Overshoes==
Overshoes (or "booties") are flexible waterproof shoe coverings for use in wet weather. They are typically made from rubber or a stretchy synthetic and have a zip on the inside of the ankle. The fabric continues under the sole but is not intended for walking on, which would wear it out quickly. Most overshoes have a hole in the sole for clipless pedals. Overshoes are not to be confused with [[cleat covers]]. Overshoes go on the top of the shoes, while cleat covers go on the bottom.

{{Wiktionary|dead ball}} 
'''Dead ball''' is a term in many [[ball sport]]s in which the ball is deemed temporarily not playable, and no movement may be made with it or the players from their respective positions of significance. Depending on the sport, this event may be quite routine, and often occurs between individual plays of the game.

==Gridiron football==
In [[gridiron football]], a dead ball is a condition that occurs between [[football play]]s, after one of the following has occurred:

* The player with the ball runs out of bounds
* The player with the ball is downed, either by being [[Tackle (football move)|tackled]] to the ground or by deliberately downing him/herself ([[quarterback kneel|"taking a knee"]])
* A forward pass touches the ground or travels out of bounds without being caught ([[incomplete pass]])
* Any kick travels out of bounds and/or hits the goal post or crossbar in flight
* The ball is fumbled out of bounds
* A scoring play occurs
* A kickoff or free kick is recovered by the kicking team
* In certain situations, depending on specific league rules, following a punt, for example if the punt enters the end zone without being touched (an automatic touchback), the punt is successfully fair caught, or downed by the kicking team before being touched by the receivers

The ball remains dead until it is snapped to begin the next play. During the time in which the ball is dead, the offensive team may not attempt to advance it and no change of possession can take place. The clock may or may not be stopped during this time, depending on the circumstances.

In the past, in the [[NFL]], the ball was also dead if it came into the possession of the defense for any reason during the try after a touchdown.  This rule was changed for the 2015 season, allowing the ball to remain live so that the defense could attempt to return it for a defensive two-point conversion.

==Baseball==
{{main|Live ball (baseball)}}

In [[baseball]], when the [[baseball (object)|ball]] is dead, no runners may advance beyond the respective bases they are entitled to, and no runners may be put out.  The ball becomes dead when:&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Field Guide: An In-Depth Illustrated Guide to the Complete Rules of Baseball by Dan Formosa, Da Capo Press; Rev Upd edition (April 7, 2008), {{ISBN|0-306-81653-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A batter is touched by a pitch or a batted ball (''[[hit by pitch]]'')
* The plate [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] hinders a [[catcher]]'s throw attempt and the throw does not directly retire a runner
* A ball is illegally batted, such as when a batter hits the ball while outside of the batter's box
* A [[foul ball]] is not caught
* A [[fair ball]] touches a [[baserunner|runner]] or an umpire on [[fair territory]] before it touches an [[infielder]] (including the pitcher)
* A fair ball touches a runner or an umpire before it has passed an infielder other than the pitcher
* A live ball lodges in the umpire's or catcher's equipment or in a fence or in another object on the field
* Any legal pitch touches a runner trying to score
* A live ball passes out of the playing field (unless it hits or crosses over a base on the ground)
* A runner or spectator commits [[interference (baseball)|interference]]
* The defense leaves the field after the half inning or game ends
* The venue's [[ground rules]] call for a dead ball ruling for a ball striking an above-ground obstruction (usually involving the roof of a domed or retractable-roofed stadium), such as the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]'s [[Tropicana Field#Catwalks|Tropicana Field, regarding the catwalks and overhanging speakers]] above the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/rays/ballpark/information/ground-rules|title=Tropicana Field Ground Rules|work=[[MLB.com]]|publisher=Tampa Bay Rays|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/sports/baseball/06catwalks.html|title=Tropicana Field’s Problems Will Be Reduced With New Ground Rules|last=Branch|first=John|date=5 October 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/watch-rays-adeiny-hechavarria-suffers-bizarre-injury-thanks-to-ball-off-tropicana-field-catwalk/|title=WATCH: Rays' Adeiny Hechavarria suffers bizarre injury thanks to ball off Tropicana Field catwalk|last=Blackburn|first=Pete|date=9 May 2018|work=[[CBS Sports]].com|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, overhead dead ball ground rules also existed for the [[Kingdome]] in Seattle and Minneapolis's [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]]
* An umpire calls '''time.''' Umpires typically call "time" after being asked to do so by a participant. An umpire in chief (plate umpire) will also call "time" when:
** Weather, darkness or similar conditions make play impossible or dangerous
** Light failure makes it difficult or impossible for the umpires to follow the play
** An accident incapacitates a player or an umpire
** The umpire wishes to examine the ball, to consult with either [[manager (baseball)|manager]], or for any similar cause.
** An umpire orders a player or any other person removed from the playing field.
** A [[balk]] or [[obstruction (baseball)|obstruction]] is committed and immediate ensuing play ends
** The catcher interferes with the batter before the [[time of pitch]]
** An umpire declares "no pitch" after debris or a flying object ([[:File:Bird Beanball.png|such as a bird]]) collides with the pitched ball.

In general, the ball does not automatically become dead after playing action ends.  So, for example, although the recording of a third out generally winds down a half inning, the ball is not automatically dead.  If it is to the advantage of the defense to attempt to record a [[fourth out]] for any reason, the ball is live and such a play is permitted.

After a dead ball, the ball becomes [[live ball (baseball)|alive]] again when the pitcher stands on the [[pitcher's plate]] ready to pitch, the batter, catcher and umpire are ready, and the umpire calls or signals "Play."

Players and coaches may ask an umpire for "time," but they themselves may not call "time" and cause the [[baseball (object)|ball]] to become dead.  Nevertheless, "time" is usually granted by the umpire when asked, and thus, colloquially, it is often said that players or coaches indeed can "call time."  Unlike sports which have clocks to time the play, the phrase "time out" is not used in baseball. Likewise, there is no limit to the number of times a team can "call time."

In baseball, the term "dead ball" is also used in the context of the [[dead-ball era]], a phase during the early history of the game in the early 1900s.  In this context, the ball was not actually "dead" but for various reasons tended to be difficult to hit for distance, resulting in low scores and few home runs by modern standards.

==Cricket==
In [[cricket]], a dead ball is a particular state of play in which the players may not perform any of the active aspects of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-20-dead-ball/ |title=Law 20 – Dead ball |publisher=MCC |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, [[batsman|batsmen]] may not score runs and [[fielding positions in cricket|fielders]] may not attempt to get batsmen out.

The ball, referring to the [[cricket ball]], becomes ''live'' when the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] begins his run up in preparation to [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] at the batsman. In the live state, play occurs with the batsmen able to score runs and get out.

The ball then becomes dead when any of the following situations occur:
*The [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire]] is satisfied that, with adequate reason, the batsman is not ready for the delivery of the ball.
*The ball passes the batsman, is gathered by the [[wicket-keeper]], and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take runs.
*The ball is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or the bowler, and the batsmen obviously decline to attempt to take any more runs.
*The umpire feels that both the fielding team and the batsmen consider the ball no longer to be in play.
*The ball reaches the [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary]] and [[four (cricket)|four runs]] or [[six (cricket)|six runs]] are scored.
*Either batsman is out.
*The ball lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batsman or [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]].
*The ball lodges in a protective helmet worn by a fielder.
*The batsmen attempt to run [[leg bye]]s, and, in the umpire's opinion, no attempt was made either to hit the ball with the bat or to evade it. This nullifies the leg byes.
*The umpire intervenes in the occurrence of injury or unfair play.

Umpires may also call dead ball at their discretion, in the case of a series for events for which there is no provision in either the [[Laws of Cricket]] or agreements made prior to the match. This happened on 9 October 2005, when Australian batsman [[Michael Hussey]] hit the retracted roof at the [[Telstra Dome]]. What would have been [[Six (cricket)|six]] in an open stadium was ruled a dead ball, and no runs were awarded.

Note that the ball becomes dead as soon as a batsman is out, so it is not possible to dismiss the other batsman immediately. Thus the [[baseball]] concept of a [[double play]] cannot occur in cricket.

If necessary to make it clear to the players that the umpire considers the ball to be dead, the umpire signals ''dead ball'' by crossing and uncrossing his arms in front of his body.

==Association football==
{{main article|Ball in and out of play}}
In [[association football]] (soccer), the term "dead ball" refers to a situation when the ball is not in play, e.g. when play has not been restarted after the ball has gone out of bounds or a foul has been committed. It also applies before each kick-off, either at the start of each half or after a goal has been scored. In a dead ball situation, players can position the ball with their hands prior to restarting play. Furthermore, even though the ball is not in play, the referee may still issue cautions or ejections (yellow or red cards) for any incident that occurs off the ball. Fouls, on the other hand, can occur only while the ball is in play.

==Basketball==
In [[basketball]], most or any time play is stopped the ball is considered dead, such as when a foul has been committed and called by a referee, a foul shot has been attempted and another one is yet to be attempted, or the ball has gone out of bounds.  Player substitutions may then be made.
Section IV of the NBA rule book contains the official definition of a dead ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Rulebook|url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_6.html?nav=ArticleList|work=NBA Rulebook|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=5 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.expert/Glossary/Entertainment/Basketball/Dead_Ball.html|title= Dead Ball|accessdate= December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mimi.hu|url=http://en.mimi.hu/basketball/dead_ball.html|work=Mimi.hu|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flag football==
Times when it can be a dead ball:
*anytime the ball hits the ground (also called a fumble)
*the ball is blocked, not caught, by usually the defender. If the ball is caught, the defender can make a run for touchdown.
*the ball carrier's flag is pulled or somehow falls to the ground.
*the ball carrier falls to the ground. If any other part of the body of the ball carrier, other than the hands and feet, touch the ground, it is a dead ball.
''See more information in [[flag football]]''

==Rugby league==
Each end of a rugby league field has a dead ball line, when the ball (or player in possession) crosses or touches this line, the ball is said to have gone dead. This results in a goal line drop out if the defending team had caused the ball to go dead; otherwise, a 20-metre restart ensues.

The '''Eclipse Stakes''' is a [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at [[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]] over a distance of 1 mile, 1 furlongs and 209 yards (2,002 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early July.

==History==
The event is named after [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]], a celebrated 18th-century racehorse. It was established in 1886, and the inaugural running was won by [[Bendigo (horse)|Bendigo]]. At that time, it was Britain's richest ever race.&lt;ref name="Guardian20030704"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/04/horseracing.gregwood|title=Nayef heads 14 rivals in Eclipse|last=Wood|first=Greg |date=4 July 2003|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize fund of £10,000 was donated by [[Leopold de Rothschild]] at the request of General Owen Williams, a co-founder of Sandown Park.

The Eclipse Stakes was contested by high-quality fields from its inception. It was won by Ayrshire, the previous year's [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] winner, in 1889. The first three finishers in 1903 — [[Ard Patrick]], [[Sceptre (horse)|Sceptre]] and [[Rock Sand]] — had won seven [[British Classic Races|Classics]] between them.

The race has been sponsored by [[Ladbrokes Coral|Coral]] since 1976, and it is now familiarly known as the "Coral-Eclipse". The most recent Classic winner to achieve victory was [[Golden Horn (horse)|Golden Horn]] in 2015.

'''''Everybody's All-American''''' is a 1988 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (genre)|drama film]], released internationally as '''''When I Fall in Love''''', directed by [[Taylor Hackford]] and based on the novel ''[[Everybody's All-American]]'' by longtime ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' contributor [[Frank Deford]].

The film covers 25 years in the life of a college football hero. It stars [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Timothy Hutton]] and [[John Goodman]].

==Plot==
Gavin Grey ([[Dennis Quaid]]) is a 1950s star athlete known by the moniker "The Grey Ghost," who plays football at Louisiana University. His campus girlfriend Babs Rogers ([[Jessica Lange]]), cousin Donnie ([[Timothy Hutton]]) who also goes by the nickname "Cake," and teammate Ed Lawrence ([[John Goodman]]) adore his personality and charm. During the [[Sugar Bowl]] game, Gavin's play,  defining his competitiveness throughout his career, causes a player from the opposing team to fumble the ball, which he returns to score a game-winning touchdown.

As his college days come to an end, Gavin ends up marrying Babs, starts a family, and gets drafted by the Washington Redskins. Lawrence opens a popular sports bar in [[Baton Rouge]]. Everyone is pleased for Gavin, including his friendly rival Narvel Blue ([[Carl Lumbly]]), who might have achieved professional stardom had he chosen an athletic career path. Reality quickly sets in for Gavin as life in the [[NFL]] is difficult, competition fierce, and the schedule grueling. Gavin is a respectable running back for the [[Washington Redskins]], but hardly the idol worshipped by everyone back home during his school years. Concurrently, Lawrence has accrued a number of gambling debts. He is later murdered by unidentified attackers, creating more debts for Gavin and Babs, who had invested in Lawrence's business.

Babs does her best to keep up with her husband's career and mood swings, and in doing so inherits the role of the wage earner in their household. A sympathetic Donnie finds her frustrated and lonely, as his lifetime attraction to her brings them together for a brief [[extramarital affair]]. Gavin's financial setbacks encourage Babs to seek a job from Narvel to manage his restaurant.

After a brief retirement, money issues convince Gavin to accept a comeback offer from the Denver Broncos. The new NFL has passed him by though and Gray is forced to accept that his playing days are over. He enters a failed business relationship with entrepreneur Bolling Kiely ([[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]]), whom he despises, spending countless hours telling old college football stories to clients. Donnie moves on with his life, becoming an author and getting engaged to a sophisticated woman named Leslie Stone ([[Patricia Clarkson]]), while supporting Gavin and Babs through a marital breakdown. A despaired figure in the end, Gavin mends his relationship with Babs as he spends his withdrawal from professional sports reminiscing about his famed athletic youth.

==Production==
* Filming was stopped for weeks when [[Dennis Quaid]] had his collarbone broken by former [[New England Patriots]] cornerback [[Tim Fox (American football)|Tim Fox]] during filming. Footage of Quaid rolling in pain on the sidelines of the snow game appears in the finished film.
* A key scene featuring a candlelight parade involving large numbers of extras was filmed, on the steps of the [[Louisiana State Capitol]], when snow started falling. Despite the beauty of the scene, director [[Taylor Hackford]] elected to reshoot the scene, as snow in [[Baton Rouge]] in November was such a rare event that he was worried it would be seen as a special effects goof in the film.
* The game scenes were shot in [[Louisiana State University|LSU]]'s [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] during the halftimes of actual LSU games. The goalposts were altered to resemble the vintage "H" posts as needed during filming. Vertical posts were moved in place for the bottom portion of the H, and a multi-colored fabric covering was used to conceal the center upright. Upon completion of filming, the vertical posts and fabric were retracted so as not to interfere with the LSU games. In late 1993, LSU installed an updated model of the vintage posts permanently in the stadium.
* Some of the filming of the football scenes took place during halftime of the 1987 LSU-[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] game. The producers wanted to continue shooting some scenes following the game, so they requested that the LSU fans remain after the game so that they could finish the scenes. However, Alabama won in an upset, and ten minutes after the game, the only fans still in the bleachers were wearing crimson, forcing the producers to finish shooting the following week following LSU's game vs. [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]].
* [[Michael Apted]] was all set to direct [[Thomas Rickman (writer)|Thomas Rickman]]'s script in 1982 until Warner Bros. balked at the $16 million price tag, leading man [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and the fact that American football movies never do any business overseas. During its 6 years in [[development hell]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Robert Redford]] and [[Robert De Niro]] all circled the project.
*Despite the fact that the novel was written about the [[University of North Carolina]], when it was filmed at LSU, rumors started that Gavin Grey was based on the former LSU All-American [[Billy Cannon]], who won the 1959 [[Heisman Trophy]] and played 11 seasons for three professional teams, but served two and a half years in federal prison in the mid-1980s for his role in a counterfeiting ring; Deford himself denies this, saying: "Never met Cannon and knew nothing about him personally," he says. "Gavin was strictly a composite of many athletes from several sports that I had covered."
*The film contains a much more hopeful and upbeat ending than the book, where Gavin takes his own life after trying to kill Babs as well.

The '''G. Rollie White Coliseum''' was an on-campus arena at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]], in the [[United States]].  Often referred to as the "Jollie Rollie" or "The Holler House on the Brazos", the arena was the home of Texas A&amp;M's Aggie [[volleyball]] team, which played there since its inception in 1975 until 2009. Before the building of [[Reed Arena]] in 1998, G. Rollie White was also the home to the men's and women's [[basketball]] teams. Demolition of the Coliseum in August, 2013 made way for the redevelopment of [[Kyle Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aggieathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=27300&amp;ATCLID=208765870|title=Kyle Field Redevelopment Timeline|publisher=''[[Texas A&amp;M Athletics]]''|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was built in 1954, and was located directly to the northeast of Kyle Field.  The "U"-shaped building seated 7,800 in the main grandstand on three sides, with a small auxiliary bleacher section on the flat end of the building. The [[sandstone]] exterior was originally visible outside the northern corner of the field.

The renovation of the [[Memorial Student Center (MSC)]], directly to the north of where the coliseum stood, required the relocation of the campus bookstore, which occupied the arena floor at G. Rollie from the summer of 2009 until April 2012 when the MSC reopened.  G. Rollie White hosted the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] volleyball tournament ten times.

In November 2012, the [[request for proposal]] to renovate Kyle Field called for the demolition of G. Rollie White.&lt;ref&gt;http://esbd.cpa.state.tx.us/docs/710/103364_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Began in August 2013, the demolition resulted in the removal of nine dual basketball-volleyball courts, fourteen racquetball-handball courts, four activity rooms, several classrooms, meeting rooms, and offices, although some of these were from the adjacent Read Building, which was also razed.&lt;ref name=theeagle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeagle.com/news/local/article_e5059deb-30f7-54ec-852d-f20214a1142e.html|title=Kelly Brown, "Aggies reminisce on G. Rollie White ahead of demolition"|publisher=''[[Bryan-College Station Eagle]]''|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John David Crow]], former Aggie football player and athletic director, regarded the demise of G. Rollie White as a farewell to an old friend: "I hate to see anything demolished." Crow was present when G. Rollie White opened to replace [[DeWare Field House]].&lt;ref name=theeagle/&gt;

'''Alonzo Herndon Stadium''', named for [[Alonzo Herndon]], is a 15,011-seat stadium on the campus of [[Morris Brown College]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]]. It is the only two-sided stadium in the [[Atlanta University Center]]. It is one block over from the locally known [[Herndon Home]], and sits above the [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] East-West rail line.

During the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], Herndon Stadium hosted [[Field hockey at the 1996 Summer Olympics|field hockey]]. It was also used as the stand-in for the demolished [[Fairfield Stadium]] in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] during filming of the 2006 movie ''[[We Are Marshall]]''.

The stadium was the home to the former Georgia Mustangs and the former [[Atlanta Beat (WUSA)|Atlanta Beat]] women's [[soccer]] club of the defunct [[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]] league.

As of October 2015, the stadium is in an extreme state of disrepair.

The '''Kamuzu Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]], [[Malawi]].  It is currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches.  The stadium holds 65,000&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africaranking.com/top-10-largest-stadiums-in-africa/2/&lt;/ref&gt; people, maximum for football. This can be limited for safety reasons. [[Big Bullets]] are tenants.

==History==
The stadium was originally named Rangeley Stadium during the colonial era to commemorate British civil servant William H. J. Rangeley.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Kalinga, ''The Historical Dictionary of Malawi'', page 411.&lt;/ref&gt; It later became known as Kamuzu Stadium, after Malawi's first President, [[Hastings Kamuzu Banda]], when Malawi gained independence from Britain. After Kamuzu's presidency, the name was changed to '''Chichiri Stadium''' under President [[Bakili Muluzi]]; however, under Muluzi's successor, [[Bingu wa Mutharika]], the name Kamuzu Stadium was restored in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-13370512_ITM "Malawian president orders three facilities named after founding father Banda"], BBC Monitoring International Reports, September 15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA through its GOAL programme has sponsored the renovation of the natural grass pitch into a synthetic football pitch.  This artificial turf field, called Xtreme Turf, has been manufactured and installed by Act Global.

President [[Peter Mutharika]]'s inauguration ceremony was held at Kamuzu Stadium on 2 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Zawadi Chilunga, [http://www.nyasatimes.com/2014/06/02/mutharika-regrets-jbs-snub-in-power-handover-muluzi-cheered/ "Mutharika regrets JB's snub in power handover: Muluzi cheered"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606212425/http://www.nyasatimes.com/2014/06/02/mutharika-regrets-jbs-snub-in-power-handover-muluzi-cheered/ |date=2014-06-06 }}, ''Nyasa Times'', 2 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''L'Àgora''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈlaɣoɾa|langva}}, {{IPA-ca|ˈlaɣuɾə|ec}}; {{lang-es|El Ágora}}, "The Agora") is a multifunctional covered space designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]] located in the ''[[City of Arts and Sciences|Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències]]'' (City of Arts and Sciences) complex, [[Valencia, Spain]]. The building has a height of 80&amp;nbsp;m and occupies 5,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of [[elliptic]] space. Depending on the configuration of the space, a maximum [[seating capacity]] for 6,075 people can be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=S.L.|first1=Unidad Editorial Internet,|title=Así será el Ágora de Valencia {{!}} elmundo.es|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/01/05/valencia/1231148187.html|website=www.elmundo.es|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Àgora was officially inaugurated in November 2009 to host the [[Valencia Open 500]] [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tournament, although the construction works were not completely finished.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavanguardia.es/free/edicionimpresa/res/20091106/53818490214.html?urlback=http://www.lavanguardia.es/premium/edicionimpresa/20091106/53818490214.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leamington Road''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Blackburn]] in [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] between 1881 and 1890.

==History==
Blackburn Rovers moved to Leamington Road from their [[Alexandra Meadows]] ground in 1881.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p75, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ground developed, a 600-seat stand was built on the north-eastern touchline and a pavilion constructed in the eastern corner of the ground. The perimeter of the pitch was surrounded with [[duckboards]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

[[England national football team|England]] played two internationals at Leamington Road, drawing with [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in 1885 and losing to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 1887. In 1888 Blackburn became members of [[the Football League]], and the first Football League game played at Leamington Road on 15 September 1888 saw Blackburn draw 5–5 with local rivals [[Accrington F.C.|Accrington]] in front of 5,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The highest League attendance recorded at Leamington Road was 15,000 for a match against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 2 November 1889. The club moved to [[Ewood Park]] in 1890, with the last League match played at Leamington Road on 4 January when Blackburn beat [[Stoke F.C.|Stoke]] 8–0. The site was developed for housing shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

'''McCurdy Field''', located in [[Frederick, Maryland]], is the former home of the Frederick Hustlers, Warriors, and [[Frederick Keys]], a class A minor league affiliate of the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. The current stadium structure is largely an aluminum superstructure with dual brick buildings on the sides. The field first opened in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McCurdy's hosted everyone from Redskins to locals|author=Stan Goldberg|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/archives/display_detail.htm?StoryID=71915|newspaper=Gettsyburg Times|date=2007-08-19|accessdate=2010-12-21|page=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328175314/http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/archives/display_detail.htm?StoryID=71915|archivedate=2012-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCurdy Field was the home of the Frederick teams of the minor league baseball [[Blue Ridge League]] from 1924 to 1930.

On Monday, September 6, 1937, the [[Washington Redskins]] played their first Washington-area game following their move from [[1936 Boston Redskins season|Boston]]. Washington beat an American Legion All-Star team by a score of 50-0 before a crowd of 1,000 at McCurdy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballarchives.com/1937nflwas.html|title=1937 Washington Redskins (NFL)|author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Pro Football Archives |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, professional baseball teams conducted spring training in the north. The [[International League]] [[Syracuse Chiefs]] held spring training at McCurdy in 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Army In Great Britain Plans Seven Baseball Leagues, World Series|author= |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1871297652.html?FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+26%2C+1943&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&amp;desc=Army+In+Great+Britain+Plans+Seven+Baseball+Leagues%2C+World+Series&amp;pqatl=google|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=1943-03-26 |accessdate=2010-12-22|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Philadelphia Athletics also held spring training in Frederick in 1944 and 1945 and played their exhibition games at McCurdy Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/springtraining1944.htm |title=Spring Training 1944 |author=Bob Warrington |date= |work= |publisher=Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society |accessdate=2010-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127103044/http://philadelphiaathletics.org/history/springtraining1944.htm |archivedate=2010-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lights were installed in 1947. In 1968, the old wooden grandstand was condemned. It was torn down in 1971, leaving just the field. Bob Marendt led an effort to renovate the park, raising $50,000 in donations, and federal and state government paid for the balance. A renovated concrete and steel park opened in 1974, with metal bleachers that sat 1,500 and clubhouse facilities to host the Babe Ruth League 13-year-old national tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mysite.verizon.net/charliesballparks/stadiums/mccurdy.htm |title=McCurdy Field, Frederick, Maryland|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Charlie O’Reilly |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18275">{{ For|the 2002 film|The Slaughter Rule}}
A '''mercy rule''',  '''slaughter rule''', '''knockout rule''', or '''skunk rule''' ends a two-competitor [[sports competition]] earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable [[Score (sport)|scoring]] lead over the other. It is called the ''mercy'' rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser. It is common in [[youth sports]] in [[North America]], where [[running up the score]] is considered unsporting. It is especially common in  [[baseball]] and [[softball]] in which there is no [[game clock]] and a dominant team could in theory continue an [[inning]] endlessly.

The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all [[youth sports]] leagues and [[high school sports]] associations and many [[college sports]] associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football.

However, mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game (like the second half of an association football game). Thus, one team, particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent, can still "run up the score" before the rule takes effect. For instance, in [[American football]], one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half; in baseball, the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning, but the game would still continue.

==Baseball and softball==
International competitions are sanctioned by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC), formed by the 2013 merger of the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF) and [[International Softball Federation]] (ISF).

In international baseball competition and the [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC), games are ended when one team is ahead by 10 runs, once at least seven completed innings are played by the trailing team. In women's competition, the same applies after five innings of a seven-inning game.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Baseball Federation]] (2008). [http://s29178.gridserver.com/pdf/International_Rules_ENG.pdf IBAF Official Competitions Technical/Organisational Norms - Valid only for 2008]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Rule C7.8, "Run difference Rule". Accessed on 2008-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 World Baseball Classic|inaugural WBC]] in 2006 followed the IBAF mercy rule, with an additional rule stopping a game after five innings when a team is ahead by at least 15 runs.&lt;ref&gt;World Baseball Classic, Inc. [http://ww2.worldbaseballclassic.com/2006/about/index.jsp?sid=wbc 2006 World Baseball Classic: FAQ]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Accessed on 2008-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The mercy rules applied to the round-robin (now double-elimination) matches only, not to the semi-finals or final.

In a six-inning game such as [[Little League Baseball|Little League Baseball and Softball]], rules call for the game to end if the winning team is ahead by 15 runs after three innings played or 10 runs after four innings played by the trailing team.

Softball rules are different for fast/modified fast pitch and slow pitch. In WBSC-sanctioned competitions, the run ahead rule (the WBSC terminology) is, for fast or modified fast pitch, 20 runs after three innings, 15 after four, or 7 after 5. In slow pitch, the margin is 20 runs after four innings or 15 after five.&lt;ref name=ISF&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Softball Federation]] |author=International Softball Federation Playing Rules Committee |url=http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/Rulebook_2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Rules of Softball (Revised 2005) Rule 5, Sec. 5, "Run Ahead Rule" |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218104659/http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/Rulebook_2002.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCAA has also adopted the rule.

In regular season or conference tournament [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] college baseball, the IBAF rule may be implemented. Most NCAA conferences limit the rule to the final day of a series, for travel reasons, or primarily during conference tournaments where four to five games are played in a day, in order to allow the next game to start. The rule is not allowed in NCAA tournament play (regionals, super regionals and College World Series), in which all games must be at least nine innings.

In NCAA softball, the rule is invoked if one team is ahead by at least eight runs after five innings and, unlike with college baseball, applies in the NCAA tournament as well with the exception of the championship series. In American high school softball, most states use a mercy rule of 20 runs ahead in three innings or 10 in five innings. (In either case, if the home team is ahead by the requisite number of runs, the game will end after the top half of the inning.)

Most state high school associations (where games are seven innings) use the IBAF Women's rule after five innings have been played by the trailing team; some associations further the rule by ending a game after either three or four innings if the lead is at least 15 runs. For softball, the rule is 12 after three innings and 10 after five. However, since the home team has the last at-bat, the rules usually allow visiting teams to score an unlimited number of runs in the top half of an inning. That can be prevented by invoking the rule only after the home team has completed its half of the inning.

Due to the untimed nature of innings, some leagues either impose caps on the number of runs that can be scored in one inning (usually in the 4-8 range) or limit the number of plate appearances in an inning (typically, such a limit will consist of one rotation of the batting order).  Such rules ensure that games will complete in a reasonable length of time, but it can also mean that a lead of a certain size becomes insurmountable by the cap, which can be prevented by not invoking the rule in such circumstances.

== American football ==

===Middle and high school football===
At the middle- or high-school level, 34 states use a mercy rule that may involve a "continuous clock" (the clock continues to operate on most plays when the clock would normally stop, such as an incomplete pass) once a team has a certain lead (for example, 35 points) during the second half. That greatly decreases the amount of time taken for a game to complete, which reduces the leading team's chances to score more and the time that the trailing team must spend in facing an insurmountable deficit. In most states, the clock stops only for scores, timeouts (officials', injury, or charged), or the end of the quarter. Plays that would normally stop the clock, such as penalties, incomplete passes, going out of bounds, or change of possession, would not stop the clock. The rule varies by state; for example, the clock does not stop upon a score in Colorado, [[Kansas State High School Activities Association|Kansas]] (regular-season games only), or [[Missouri State High School Activities Association|Missouri]] (fourth quarter only). 

In most states, once the point differential is reduced to below the mercy rule-invoking amount, normal timing procedures resume until either the end of the game or the mercy rule-invoking point differential is re-established; in Colorado and Kansas, the clock continues to run even if the differential falls below the threshold. Most states that have mercy rules waive this rule for a championship game.

In some states, coaches and game officials may choose to end a game at their own discretion at any time during the second half if the continuous clock rule is in effect; that usually happens if a lopsided margin continues to increase or if threatening weather is imminent. Sometimes the coach of the team that is losing agrees to shorten the length of a quarter in addition to the continuous clock rule. Although it is rare, some states or high school conferences have rules in which the team with a very large lead may not run a certain play for the rest of the game, such as a deep pass or outside run.

In some states (where [[Eight-man football|8-man]] and [[Six-man football|6-man football]] is widely used), the rules call for a game to end when one team is ahead by a certain score (like 45 or 50 points) at halftime or any time thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfhs.org/core/contentmanager/uploads/2007MERCYRULE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921023325/http://www.nfhs.org/core/contentmanager/uploads/2007MERCYRULE.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other states with 6- or 8-man football, continuous clock rules are used, and the rule may be modified; for instance, in Iowa, the rule goes into effect if the 35-point differential is reached at any time after the first quarter.

In a variant on the mercy rule used in [[Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference|Connecticut high school football]] from 2006 to 2016, the team's coach was issued a one-game suspension (i.e., for the team's next game) if at any point the team had a 50-point lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/20160627/ciac-eliminates-50-point-rule-in-high-school-football|title=CIAC eliminates 50-point rule in high school football|last=Poole|first=Owen|work=The Bulletin|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was replaced with a running clock rule.

===College football===
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s mercy rule provides,  "Any time during the game, the playing time of any remaining period or periods and the intermission between halves may be shortened by mutual agreement of the opposing head coaches and the referee." (NCAA Football Rule 3-2-2-a)&lt;ref&gt;http://amarefs.org/FR16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; NCAA Football Approved Ruling 3-2-2-I cites an example: "At halftime the score is 56–0. The coaches and the referee agree that the third and fourth quarters should be shortened to 12 minutes each. The coaches also request that the second half be played with a 'running clock' i.e., that the game clock not be stopped." The NCAA Football Rules Committee determined, "The remaining quarters may be shortened to 12 minutes each. However, the 'running clock' is not allowed; normal clock rules apply for the entire game." &lt;ref&gt;http://amarefs.org/FR16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent example of an NCAA football game shortened by invoking this rule occurred September 1, 2018 during a game Georgia played against Austin Peay in Athens Georgia.  With the score 45-0 in the 3rd quarter and a high heat index, the Austin Peay Coach Will Healy suggested to Georgia head coach Kirby Smart that they play a 10 minute fourth quarter instead of the typical 15 minute fourth quarter.  The coaches and referee agreed and the game was shortened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/georgia-opens-season-with-rout-austin-peay/oRmlUq5gQFE8rwmdsGHQ2K/|title=Georgia opens its season with a rout of Austin Peay|work=ajc|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

September 24, 2016 the [[2016 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri Tigers]] led [[2016 Delaware State Hornets football team|Delaware State]] 58–0 at halftime. The coaches agreed to shorten the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 10 minutes each, shortening the total game time from 60 minutes to 50 minutes. Missouri added three touchdowns in the abbreviated second half to make the final score 79–0, setting team records for the most points scored in a game (79), the greatest margin of victory (79), and the largest number of touchdowns scored (11). (Missouri would have scored 80 points, but it had missed an extra point early in the game).

Also in 2016, the game between [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] and [[2016 South Carolina State Bulldogs football team|South Carolina State]] had both the third and fourth quarters shortened from 15 minutes to 12 as a result of  Clemson leading the game at half 45-0.  The final score of the game was 59-0. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-college-football-shortening-games-spt-20160918-story.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in 2016, the game between [[2016 Texas State Bobcats football team|Texas State]] and [[2016 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] saw the fourth quarter shortened to 10 minutes when severe thunderstorms were approaching [[Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium]]. Arkansas led 42–3 at the end of the third quarter, and the final period was scoreless.  A similar scenario took place in 2017 in the game between [[2017 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] and [[2017 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas]], where the coaches agreed to a running clock for the final 12:49 of the game due to severe thunderstorms approaching [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]].

In a 2013 game, [[2013 Old Dominion Monarchs football team|Old Dominion University]] (ODU) was losing to the [[2013 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|University of North Carolina]] (UNC) 80–20 when ODU coach [[Bobby Wilder]] asked for the fourth quarter to be shortened by five minutes, which UNC coach [[Larry Fedora]] agreed to. Fedora also directed his quarterback to take a knee on fourth and goal with 1:53 remaining to not run up the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tarheels score 80 in 3 quarters|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1862918-old-dominion-vs-north-carolina-shortened-as-tar-heels-score-80-in-3-quarters/|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 game, [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]] coach [[Glen Mason]] asked if a running clock could be used after his team trailed 49–0 at halftime to the [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]]. Auburn coach [[Pat Dye]] and the officials agreed, and Auburn ended up a 56–7 winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004441/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Look, Toto! | date=1992-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the NCAA Football Rules Committee's subsequent ruling (A.R. 3-2-2-I) that a "running clock" is not permitted, a continuous clock was used September 5, 2013, beginning in the fourth quarter when the [[2013 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] had a 63–0 lead against the [[2013 Elon Phoenix football team|Elon Phoenix]]. That was at the request of Elon coach [[Jason Swepson]] and agreed upon by Georgia Tech coach [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]]. Georgia Tech won the game 70–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sugiura|first=Ken|title=Johnson on Duke, Elon, no-huddle|url=http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/georgia-tech/2013/sep/04/johnson-duke-elon-no-huddle/|work=The Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the Mississippi Association of Community and Junior Colleges, a running clock is allowed if the team is ahead by 38 points or more. This rule was instituted in 2013.

==Amateur boxing==
If a boxer trails by more than 20 points, the referee stops the fight and the boxer that is leading automatically wins; bouts which end this way may be noted as "RSC" (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH).

While a boxer who loses on the mercy rule is scored RSCO and would be similar to a technical [[knockout]] in [[professional boxing]], it is not scored a loss by knockout, and the 28-day suspension for losing on a knockout does not apply.

==Association football (soccer)==
[[International Blind Sports Federation]] rules require that any time during a game in which one team has scored ten (10) more goals than the other team that game is deemed completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibsa.es/eng/deportes/goalball/IBSA%20Goalball%20Rules%202006-2010.txt International Blind Sports Federation: Goalball Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712075230/http://www.ibsa.es/eng/deportes/goalball/IBSA%20Goalball%20Rules%202006-2010.txt |date=2007-07-12 }} Section 17.7&lt;/ref&gt; In US high school soccer, most states use a mercy rule that ends the game if one team is ahead by 10 or more goals at any point from halftime onward. Youth soccer leagues use variations on the rule.

==Basketball==
In high school basketball, many states have a "continuous clock" rule, similar to American football, which takes effect in the second half after a lead grows to a prescribed point (in Iowa, 35 points or more; in Kansas, 30 points or more but only in the fourth quarter). The clock stops only for charged, officials' or injury time-outs; or at the end of the third quarter. The clock would not stop when would normally stop, such as for fouls, free throws, out-of-bounds plays or substitutions.

The rules vary when normal timing procedures take effect after a lead is diminished (such as because of the trailing team's rally); for instance, in Iowa, normal timing procedures are enforced if the lead is lowered to 25 points but re-instituted once the lead grows back to 35 or more points. By comparison, in Kansas, if the running clock is triggered, it will not stop except for a timeout or an injury even if the differential is reduced to under 30 points. As with other sports, some states offer provisions to allow a team to end the game early by mutual decision of the coaches (for instance, if a large lead continues to grow and the talent disparity is obvious).

==Collegiate wrestling==
In American [[collegiate wrestling]] and high school wrestling, a wrestler wins by [[technical fall]], and the match ends, if he builds a 15-point lead. If a wrestler gains a 15-point lead by having his opponent in a near-fall, the referee will allow the offensive wrestler the opportunity to win by fall without liability to be reversed and pinned. The bout ends when a fall is awarded or the near-fall ends.

'''Rugby union in Ecuador''' is a minor, but growing sport.

==Governing body==
The governing body is the Federación Ecuatoriana de Rugby, which became affiliated to [[CONSUR]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rugbyworldcup-argentina2023.blogspot.com/2010/12/ecuador-to-join-consur-in-2011.html|title=Ecuador to join CONSUR in 2011 |date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not yet to the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]].

==History==
[[Rugby union]] is found to some extent in Ecuador, with teams in Guayaquil,&lt;ref&gt;[http://monosrugbygye.blogspot.com/ Monos Rugby Club]&lt;/ref&gt; Quito,&lt;ref&gt;[http://quitorugby.tripod.com/ Quito Rugby Football Club]&lt;/ref&gt; and Cuenca.

One out of two Spanish countries in South America still to compete under CONSUR's arm (the other one being Bolivia), Ecuador rugby story dates back to the 1930s when newspapers specified the presence of English merchants playing the game that they would eventually take to Puná island, along the coast of Guayas river, to play rugby criollo with the natives.

Rugby was first played in Ecuador in the 1930s, when it was introduced by British merchants to [[Puná Island]] on the [[Guayas River]].&lt;ref name=Unveil&gt;[http://www.heavensgame.com/global-news/view-from-the-americas/unveiling-rugby-in-ecuador.html UNVEILING RUGBY IN ECUADOR] revealed 5 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salisbury Racecourse''' is a [[Flat racing|flat racecourse]] in the United Kingdom featuring [[thoroughbred horse racing]], {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]], England. Fifteen race meetings a year are held there between early May and mid-October.

==History==
There has been racing at the race course located three miles from Salisbury since the mid-16th century. Many great horses have won at the track, including [[Gimcrack]] (1768), [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]] (1769), [[Sun Chariot (horse)|Sun Chariot]] (1941),&lt;ref name=Glueckstein&gt;{{cite book|author=Glueckstein, Fred|title=Churchill and Colonist II: The Story of Winston Churchill and His Famous Race Horse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kTiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25 |year=2014|publisher=iUniverse |isbn=978-1-4917-4973-9 |pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mill Reef]] (1970) and [[Brigadier Gerard (horse)|Brigadier Gerard]] (1970).  [[Sir Percy]], winner of the 2006 Derby, and [[Look Here (horse)|Look Here]], winner of the 2008 Oaks, had both won at Salisbury the previous year.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; [[Jockey]] [[Lester Piggott]] first rode in public at Salisbury when he was aged twelve; that was in 1948 when he was an apprentice jockey and weighed just five stone.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; American jockey [[Steve Cauthen]] made his British debut at the course in 1979 when he rode Marquee Universal to victory here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-cauthen-finds-bluegrass-is-greener-1183121.html|title=Racing: Cauthen finds bluegrass is greener|last=Richard Edmondson|date=6 November 1998|work=The Independent|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was here in 1949 that [[Winston Churchill]] first raced his Colonist II in the one mile Upavon Stakes. The horse won, and went on to win the [[Ribblesdale Stakes]] at Ascot later that year.&lt;ref name=Glueckstein/&gt;

==The racecourse==
About sixteen race meetings take place at Salisbury Racecourse each year between early May and mid-October. It is a downland flat-racing course with no jumps. There is a mix of race types with the majority being handicaps, where horses of similar ability race against each other, and maidens, where horses which have yet to win a race compete. The course is also renowned for its races for two-year-olds, and many of these young horses have gone on to achieve great things.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salisburyracecourse.co.uk/salisburyracecourse/visiting/faqs.html |title=Racegoers Guide |publisher=Salisbury Racecourse |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Save-On-Foods]] Memorial Centre''' (SOFMC) is an indoor arena located in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, and is the largest arena in British Columbia outside of Vancouver. It is primarily used for [[ice hockey]], previously the home arena of the [[Victoria Salmon Kings]] of the [[ECHL]], and currently the home of the [[Victoria Royals]] of the [[Western Hockey League]]. It is also used for concerts and other special events such as figure skating, curling, plays, trade shows and conferences.  It is also opened for public ice skating on special occasions; the public skated with the former Victoria Salmon Kings players after some of the games. The building also features a fine dining restaurant (Lion's Den Restaurant), retail &amp; meeting space. [[Shaw Communications]] has a TV studio on the main floor and itgroove Professional Services shares office space with the arena and [[Victoria Royals]] personnel. It occupies the site of the former [[Victoria Memorial Arena]] as its successor facility. It is located within 10–15 minutes walking distance from the other [[Downtown Victoria]] landmarks such as: [[Chinatown, Victoria|Chinatown]], the [[Bay Centre]] shopping centre and [[Market Square, Victoria|Market Square]].

It was completed in 2005 and has a maximum [[seating capacity]] of 7,400. It replaced the aging and outdated [[Victoria Memorial Arena|Memorial Arena]], also known as the "Barn on Blanshard" (rectangular with a curved roof, resembled a [[barn]] or [[aircraft hangar]]) which had been constructed in 1949. The first event to be held at the new arena was a [[Rod Stewart]] concert, one in which Rod and his performers came out on stage in hardhats and orange safety vests, poking fun at the fact the arena wasn't totally completed at the time.

The SOFMC was developed and is operated by RG Properties Ltd., a Vancouver-based development/entertainment company with commercial, recreational and entertainment facilities throughout BC. RG Properties Ltd. was the corporate owner of the former Victoria Salmon Kings hockey team and owns the [[Victoria Royals]].  There are 26 luxury suites at the arena.

==Notable concerts &amp; events held==
The arena has hosted many musical and performance acts, as well as guest speakers, sporting tournaments, trade shows and other events.  The following is a partial list of some of the more well-known guests and events to appear during the first decade of the arena's existence:

Opened in 1986, it has a capacity of 900 spectators.  It is named for [[Hap Spuhler|Raymond H. "Hap" Spuhle]]r, the first head coach of George Mason's baseball program.&lt;ref name=facil&gt;{{cite web|title=Spuhler Field|url=http://www.gomason.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=25200&amp;ATCLID=205054705|work=Go Mason|accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311160449/http://www.gomason.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=25200&amp;ATCLID=205054705|archivedate=2012-03-11|date=13 December 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Spuhler Field was opened in 1986.  Prior to its opening, George Mason baseball used several area venues as temporary home fields.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

The field received several awards in the early 2000s for the quality of its playing surface.  In 1999-2000, the Beam Clay College Baseball Diamond of the Year Award ranked Spuhler Field third, and in 2000-2001, it ranked the field second.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite web|title=Spuhler Field Rated Third in the Nation|url=http://gazette.gmu.edu/articles/1860|work=The Mason Gazette|accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65CklJejV?url=http://gazette.gmu.edu/articles/1860|archivedate=2012-02-04|date=25 May 2000|quote=Raymond H.

In 2003, the field's playing surface was renovated.  A Bermuda turf grass surface replaced the field's bluegrass/rye mixture.  In addition, a new drainage system and [[artificial turf]] collar around [[home plate]] were installed.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

== Features ==
Features of the field include [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s, [[bullpen]]s, a sprinkler system, a [[batting cage]], and an electronic scoreboard.  A practice infield lies adjacent to the field on the [[first base]] side.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated adjacent to the [[South London Line|South London railway line]] originating at {{stn|London Bridge}}, and a quarter-of-a-mile from [[The Old Den]], which it replaced in 1993. Built on a previous site of housing, a church and the Senegal Fields playgrounds, it has an all-seated capacity of 20,146, with the highest match attendance during the [[2017-18 Millwall F.C. season|2017-18 season]] being 17,614.

The Den is the sixth ground that Millwall have occupied since their formation in the [[Millwall]] area of the [[Isle of Dogs]] in 1885.

==History==
The New Den, as it was initially known to distinguish it from its predecessor, was the first new all-seater stadium in England to be completed after the [[Taylor Report]] on the [[Hillsborough disaster]] of 1989. It was designed with effective crowd management in mind (particularly given Millwall's crowd problems at The Old Den), with the escape routes being short and direct. After chairman Reg Burr decided that it would not be viable to redevelop The Old Den as an all-seater stadium, he announced in 1990 that the club would relocate to a new stadium in the Senegal Fields area in south Bermondsey. Originally, it was planned to have a seating capacity of between 25,000 and 30,000, however, the club opted to wait so the capacity was kept to just over 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millwall-history.co.uk/the_den5.htm Moving On: The New Den&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MillwallvCharltonAthletic2010.JPG|thumb|left|View from the west lower stand during a 4–0 win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] during the [[2009–10 Football League One|2009–10 season]]]]
Millwall played their final game at The Old Den on 8 May 1993 after 83 years and then moved to the new stadium a quarter-of-a-mile away from Cold Blow Lane. The £16 million New Den was opened by [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and of [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|the Opposition]] at the time, on 4 August 1993 prior to a prestigious friendly against [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting Portugal]], which Sporting won 2–1. The Den was the first new stadium constructed for a professional football team in London since 1937.

Millwall have experienced mixed fortunes since relocating to The Den. Their first season at the stadium ([[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]]) saw them finish third in Division One — their highest finish since relegation from the top flight four years earlier. However, their dreams of [[Premier League]] football were ended by a defeat in the playoffs and they were relegated to Division Three in 1996, not winning promotion from that level until 2001. They came close to reaching the Premier League again in 2002, finishing fourth but once again losing in the playoffs. The Lions reached the [[FA Cup final]] for the first time in 2004, and despite a 3–0 defeat by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] they qualified for a European competition for the first time in their history. Millwall have been relegated twice since then; going down in 2006 and 2015, but have also won promotion in 2010 and 2017. However, the stadium has yet to host Premier League football - Millwall had played in the old First Division for two seasons from 1988 during their final few years at their previous stadium.

In September 2016 [[Lewisham London Borough Council|Lewisham Council]] approved a [[compulsory purchase order]] of land surrounding The Den rented by Millwall, as part of a major redevelopment of the "New Bermondsey" area. The plans are controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by [[Offshore company|offshore companies]] with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall's car-park and the highly acclaimed and well recognised Millwall Community Trust - to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no council housing and less than 15% of 'affordable housing'. Millwall had submitted their own plans for regeneration centred around the football club itself, but the council voted in favour of Renewal's plans.&lt;ref name="Renewal"&gt;{{cite news| title = Millwall Football Club 'to fight' compulsory purchase order
| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37306839| work=BBC News| date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 ''[[Private Eye]]'' reported how Renewal had been founded by a former Lewisham Council leader and senior officer, suggesting potential bias, and that the decision to approve Renewal's plans may have been made as long ago as 2013 despite the fact that no due diligence had been able to be carried out by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] due to "poor" and "limited" access to information and management at Renewal, which is registered in the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=9 December 2016 |title=Pitch battle |magazine=[[Private Eye]] |location=London |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stands==
On 20 January 2011 the east stand of The Den was renamed as the Dockers Stand, paying tribute to Millwall's earlier history and supporter-base of [[River Thames|Thames]] dockers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millwallfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10367~2272083,00.html The Dockers stand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124030731/http://www.millwallfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10367~2272083%2C00.html |date=24 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The south stand is known as the Cold Blow Lane stand, which was the name of the road which led into The Old Den. The north stand is for visiting supporters and the west stand was renamed the Barry Kitchener stand, named after Millwall's longest serving player. It houses Millwall's family enclosure, press box and executive seats.

* A Traffic officer stopping the scientist's car on the grounds of it being unregistered and unsafe was shot with the enhancer.  The officer ended up - after doing several super-fast star-jumps - uncontrollably running away from the scene faster than his motorcycle.
* A high-diver shot with the enhancer ended up crashing through the ceiling, and flying for quite a distance - surprising the passengers of an NAC Boeing 737 - before landing in a river some miles away from the stadium.

'''Viking Stadion''' (currently named '''SR-Bank Arena''' for sponsorship purposes), is a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium in [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]]. It was inaugurated in May 2004 and cost 160 million [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] (€20 million) to build. 50 million NOK, plus the lot it was built on, was a gift from the municipality. It replaced [[Stavanger Stadion]] as the home stadium of [[Viking FK]].
[[Image:Viking Stadion.JPG|thumb|left|Viking Stadion 17 September 2006]]

In 2006, the stadium was expanded beyond the original capacity of 15,300 to 16,600. The capacity was later reduced to 16,300 in 2012 to make room for two giant screens.

The record attendance is 16,600 from 24 June 2007, when Viking met [[SK Brann|Brann]].&lt;ref name=VikingFK/&gt;

[[Jåttåvågen Station|Jåttåvågen railway station]], which serves the [[Jæren Commuter Rail]], is located right outside the stadium.

The venue has hosted the [[Norway national under-21 football team]] on four occasions, playing 1–0 against [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spain]] on 31 May 2006, 1–1 against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-21 football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 6 September 2006, 2–2 against [[Slovakia national under-21 football team|Slovakia]] on 10 June 2009 and 2–2 against [[Belgium national under-21 football team|Belgium]] on 10 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotball.no/System-pages/TabellTermin/?tournamentId=39901 |title=Norge Menn U21 |publisher=[[Football Association of Norway]] |language=Norwegian |archivedate=26 November 2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63UG3Ayfy?url=http://www.fotball.no/System-pages/TabellTermin/?tournamentId=39901 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 survey carried out by the [[Norwegian Players' Association]] among away-team captains, Viking Stadion was found to be the league's fourth-best stadium, with a score of 4.27 on a scale from one to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |title=Lerkendal nest beste fotballbane |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CYl4tTGG?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=30 November 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium can also host large music concerts and events. Among the artists who have played at Viking Stadion are [[Bryan Adams]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]] &amp; [[Plácido Domingo]], [[The Eagles]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Robbie Williams]] and [[Ylvis]].

==Future expansion==

In 2009, Viking planned a further permanent expansion of the stadium. By adding a new upper tier to the south and east stands, the capacity would be increased to 22,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/norsk/artikkel.php?artid=572204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fotball.aftenbladet.no/eliteserien/article136174.ece Slik blir Viking Stadion | Aftenbladet.no] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426203758/http://fotball.aftenbladet.no/eliteserien/article136174.ece |date=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://link-signatur.no/no/nyheter/utvidelse-av-viking-stadion/ LINK arkitektur AS]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to have the expansion completed by 2016.

A decline in Viking's attendances did not deter plans in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p4.no/story.aspx?id=351673&lt;/ref&gt; Local politicians were skeptical about the expansion, but decided to commence a formal planning process.&lt;ref&gt;http://fotball.itromso.no/eliteserien/article158851.ece{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, a continuing decline in attendances had made it obvious that the plans were not immediately viable.&lt;ref&gt;http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article237857.ece{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Artimex Sport.jpg|thumb| Wall bars FIBO 2010]]
'''Gymnastics wall bars''' (also known as a '''gymnastics ladder''', '''Swedish ladder''' or as '''stall bars''') were invented at the beginning of the 19th century by the Swedish teacher [[Per Henrik Ling]] who, when suffering from [[arthritis]], realized the therapeutic potential of wall-bars exercise.

With the support of the Swedish king, Ling founded The Royal Institute for Gymnastics, where he taught [[gymnastics]] as an art, which later became the working system in whole Europe. He later invented the [[vaulting box]].

With the arrival of emigrants in America, the wall bars were quickly adopted in the USA.

Gymnastics wall bars are a multifunction device, made of [[lamellar]] and beech timber.  They can be manufactured in different sizes, from the recovery, for children up to the double, which may have a size of 2.50 x1, 70 m. The parallel bars are made of beech or maple wood and commonly number 7, 14, or 16 pieces.

The top bar is extended further than the other bars to facilitate exercises where the user hangs vertically. The bars are 40&amp;nbsp;mm thick and oval shape. 
An incline board or pull-up bar can be attached to the bars. 

For spine disorders such as [[scoliosis]], it is advisable to consult an [[orthopedist]] before performing any exercises at the wall bars.

==Uses==
[[File:Bloomers.png|thumb|right|Gymnasts using the wall bars]]
The wall bars have many uses and are widely used in gyms and schools.  They are used simply for climbing and for coordination skills, particularly in primary school education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broomfield|first=Lindsay|title=Complete Guide to Primary Gymnastics|year=2011|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=0736086587}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also used by more advanced gymnasts for resistance training, flexibility training or abdominal exercises.  Gymnasts can hang from a higher bar with their back facing the bar and perform abdominal exercises, or hang facing the bar to stretch their back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rhythmical Gymnastics|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wall bars are also useful for parkour training.  They provide several different heights to jump to and provide an area to jump off from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rochhausen|first=Sascha|title=Teaching Parkour Sports in School Gymnastics|year=2011|publisher=Books on Demand|isbn=3842375646}}&lt;/ref&gt;
