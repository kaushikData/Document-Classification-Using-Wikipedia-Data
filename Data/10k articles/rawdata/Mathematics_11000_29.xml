'''175''' ('''one hundred [and] seventy-five''') is the [[natural number]] following [[174 (number)|174]] and preceding [[176 (number)|176]].

==In mathematics==
175 is an [[odd number]], a [[composite number]], and a [[deficient number]]. It is a [[decagonal number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001107|title=Sloane's A001107 : 10-gonal (or decagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[polygonal number|19-gonal number]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A051871|title=Sloane's A051871 : 19-gonal (or enneadecagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[centered number|centered 29-gonal number]].

175 is an [[Ulam number]], and a [[Zuckerman number]]. It is the [[magic constant]] of the ''n''&amp;times;''n'' normal [[magic square]] and [[Eight queens puzzle|n-Queens Problem]] for n = 7.

In [[base 10]], raising the digits of 175 to powers of successive integers equals itself: {{nowrap|1=175 = 1&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.}}  [[135 (number)|135]], [[518 (number)|518]], [[598 (number)|598]], and [[1000_(number)#1300 to 1399|1306]] also have this property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[differential geometry]], the '''affine geometry of curves''' is the study of [[curve]]s in an [[affine space]], and specifically the properties of such curves which are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under the [[special affine group]] &lt;math&gt; \mbox{SL}(n,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

In the classical [[Euclidean geometry of curves]], the fundamental tool is the [[Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret frame]].  In affine geometry, the Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret frame is no longer well-defined, but it is possible to define another canonical [[moving frame]] along a curve which plays a similar decisive role.  The theory was developed in the early 20th century, largely from the efforts of [[Wilhelm Blaschke]] and [[Jean Favard]].

== The affine frame ==

Let '''x'''(''t'') be a curve in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume, as one does in the Euclidean case, that the first ''n'' derivatives of '''x'''(''t'') are [[linearly independent]] so that, in particular, '''x'''(''t'') does not lie in any lower-dimensional affine subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the curve parameter ''t'' can be normalized by setting [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\det \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\dots, &amp;{\mathbf{x}}^{(n)} \end{bmatrix} = \pm 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Such a curve is said to be parametrized by its ''[[affine arclength]]''.  For such a parameterization,

:&lt;math&gt;t\mapsto [\mathbf{x}(t),\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t),\dots,\mathbf{x}^{(n)}(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

determines a mapping into the special affine group, known as a special affine frame for the curve.  That is, at each point of the quantities &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}},\dots,\mathbf{x}^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; define a special [[affine frame]] for the affine space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, consisting of a point '''x''' of the space and a special linear basis &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}},\dots,\mathbf{x}^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; attached to the point at '''x'''.  The [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the [[Maurer&amp;ndash;Cartan form]] along this map gives a complete set of affine structural invariants of the curve.  In the plane, this gives a single scalar invariant, the [[affine curvature]] of the curve.

==Discrete invariant==
The normalization of the curve parameter ''s'' was selected above so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\det \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\dots, &amp;{\mathbf{x}}^{(n)} \end{bmatrix} = \pm 1.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''n''≡0 (mod 4) or ''n''≡3 (mod 4) then the sign of this determinant is a discrete invariant of the curve.  A curve is called '''dextrorse''' (right winding, frequently ''weinwendig'' in German) if it is +1, and '''sinistrorse''' (left winding, frequently ''hopfenwendig'' in German) if it is&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1.

In three-dimensions, a right-handed [[helix]] is dextrorse, and a left-handed helix is sinistrorse.

==Curvature==
Suppose that the curve '''x''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is parameterized by affine arclength.  Then the '''[[affine curvature]]s''', ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; of '''x''' are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^{(n+1)} = k_1\dot{\mathbf{x}} +\cdots + k_{n-1}\mathbf{x}^{(n-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

That such an expression is possible follows by computing the derivative of the determinant

:&lt;math&gt;0=\det \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\dots, &amp;{\mathbf{x}}^{(n)} \end{bmatrix}\dot{}\, = \det \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\dots, &amp;{\mathbf{x}}^{(n+1)} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so that '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;(''n''+1)&lt;/sup&gt; is a linear combination of '''x'''′, …, '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;(''n''&amp;minus;1)&lt;/sup&gt;.

Consider the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]

:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}\dot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}, &amp;\dots, &amp;{\mathbf{x}}^{(n)} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

whose columns are the first ''n'' derivatives of '''x''' (still parameterized by special affine arclength).  Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;0\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;1\\
k_1&amp;k_2&amp;k_3&amp;k_4&amp;\cdots&amp;k_{n-1}&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}A = CA.&lt;/math&gt;
In concrete terms, the matrix ''C'' is the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the Maurer&amp;ndash;Cartan form of the special linear group along the frame given by the first ''n'' derivatives of '''x'''.

The '''algebra of sets''' defines the properties and laws of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], the set-theoretic [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] of [[union (set theory)|union]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], and [[complement (set theory)|complementation]] and the [[binary relation|relations]] of set [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] and set [[subset|inclusion]]. It also provides systematic procedures for evaluating expressions, and performing calculations, involving these operations and relations.

Any set of sets closed under the set-theoretic operations forms a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with the join operator being ''union'', the meet operator being ''intersection'', the complement operator being ''set complement'', the bottom being &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and the top being the [[universe (mathematics)|universe set under consideration]].

==Fundamentals==

The algebra of sets is the set-theoretic analogue of the algebra of numbers. Just as arithmetic [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] are [[associativity|associative]] and [[commutativity|commutative]], so are set union and intersection; just as the arithmetic relation "less than or equal" is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]], so is the set relation of "subset".

It is the algebra of the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection and complementation, and the relations of equality and inclusion.  For a basic introduction to sets see the article on [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], for a fuller account see [[naive set theory]], and for a full rigorous [[axiom]]atic treatment see [[axiomatic set theory]].

==The fundamental laws of set algebra==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Subset]] --&gt;

The [[binary operation]]s of set [[Union (set theory)|union]] (&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;) and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] (&lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt;) satisfy many [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]. Several of these identities or "laws" have well established names.

:[[commutative operation|Commutative]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = B \cup A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = B \cap A&lt;/math&gt;
:[[associativity|Associative]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)&lt;/math&gt;
:[[distributivity|Distributive]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)&lt;/math&gt;

The union and intersection of sets may be seen as analogous to the addition and multiplication of numbers. Like addition and multiplication, the operations of union and intersection are commutative and associative, and intersection ''distributes'' over union.  However, unlike addition and multiplication, union also distributes over intersection.

Two additional pairs of laws involve the special sets called the [[empty set]] Ø and the [[universe (mathematics)|universe set]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;; together with the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] operator (&lt;math&gt;A^C&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This can also be written as &lt;math&gt;A^'&lt;/math&gt;, read as A prime).  The empty set has no members, and the universe set has all possible members (in a particular context).

:Identity laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup \varnothing = A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap U = A&lt;/math&gt;
:Complement laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup A^C = U&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap A^C = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

The identity laws (together with the commutative laws) say that, just like 0 and 1 for addition and  multiplication, Ø and '''U''' are the [[identity element]]s for union and intersection, respectively.

Unlike addition and multiplication, union and intersection do not have [[inverse element]]s. However the complement laws give the fundamental properties of the somewhat inverse-like [[unary operation]] of set complementation.

The preceding five pairs of laws&amp;mdash;the commutative, associative, distributive, identity and complement laws&amp;mdash;encompass all of set algebra, in the sense that every valid proposition in the algebra of sets can be derived from them.

Note that if the complement laws are weakened to the rule &lt;math&gt; (A^C)^C = A &lt;/math&gt;, then this is exactly the algebra of propositional [[linear logic]]{{clarify|reason=Explain which set operator corresponds to which linear-logic operator. Linear logic seems to have much more operators than a boolean algebra, but the section 'Algebraic semantics' of the 'linear logic' article is still unwritten.|date=August 2013}}.

==The principle of duality==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Duality principle for sets]] --&gt;
{{See also|Duality (order theory)}}
Each of the identities stated above is one of a pair of identities such that each can be transformed into the other by interchanging ∪ and ∩, and also Ø and '''U'''.

These are examples of an extremely important and powerful property of set algebra, namely, the '''principle of duality''' for sets, which asserts that for any true statement about sets, the '''dual''' statement obtained by interchanging unions and intersections, interchanging '''U''' and Ø and reversing inclusions is also true.  A statement is said to be '''self-dual''' if it is equal to its own dual.

== Some additional laws for unions and intersections ==

The following proposition states six more important laws of set algebra, involving unions and intersections.

'''PROPOSITION 3''': For any [[subset]]s ''A'' and ''B'' of a universe set '''U''', the following identities hold:
:[[idempotent]] laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup A = A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap A = A&lt;/math&gt;
:domination laws:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup U = U&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:[[absorption law]]s:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cup (A \cap B) = A&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap (A \cup B) = A&lt;/math&gt;

As noted above, each of the laws stated in proposition 3 can be derived from the five fundamental pairs of laws stated above&lt;!---in proposition 1 and proposition 2---&gt;.  As an illustration, a proof is given below for the idempotent law for union.

''Proof:''
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;A \cup A&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cup A) \cap U&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law of intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cup A) \cap (A \cup A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for union
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A \cup (A \cap A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the distributive law of union over intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A \cup \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law for union
|}
The following proof illustrates that the dual of the above proof is the proof of the dual of the idempotent law for union, namely the idempotent law for intersection.

''Proof:''
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;A \cap A&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cap A) \cup \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law for union
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=(A \cap A) \cup (A \cap A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for intersection
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A \cap (A \cup A^C)&lt;/math&gt;
|by the distributive law of intersection over union

|&lt;math&gt;=A \cap U&lt;/math&gt;
|by the complement law for union
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=A&lt;/math&gt;
|by the identity law for intersection
|}

Intersection can be expressed in terms of set difference :

&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = A \setminus (A \setminus B) &lt;/math&gt;

== Some additional laws for complements ==

The following proposition states five more important laws of set algebra, involving complements.

'''PROPOSITION 4''': Let ''A'' and ''B'' be [[subset]]s of a universe '''U''', then:
:[[De Morgan's laws]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;(A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C&lt;/math&gt;
:double complement or [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] law:
::*&lt;math&gt;{(A^{C})}^{C} = A&lt;/math&gt;
:complement laws for the universe set and the empty set:
::*&lt;math&gt;\varnothing^C = U&lt;/math&gt;
::*&lt;math&gt;U^C = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the double complement law is self-dual.

The next proposition, which is also self-dual, says that the complement  of a set is the only set that satisfies the complement laws.  In other words, complementation is characterized by the complement laws.

'''PROPOSITION 5''': Let ''A'' and ''B'' be subsets of a universe '''U''', then:
:uniqueness of complements:
::*If &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = U&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B = A^C&lt;/math&gt;

==The algebra of inclusion==

The following proposition says that [[Subset|inclusion]], that is the [[binary relation]] of one set being a subset of another, is a [[partial order]].

'''PROPOSITION 6''': If ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are sets then the following hold:

:[[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;

:[[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;

:[[transitive relation|transitivity]]:
::*If &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;

The following proposition says that for any set ''S'', the [[power set]] of ''S'', ordered by inclusion, is a [[lattice (order)|bounded lattice]], and hence together with the distributive and complement laws above, show that it is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].

'''PROPOSITION 7''': If ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are subsets of a set ''S'' then the following hold:

:existence of a [[greatest element|least element]] and a [[greatest element]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;\varnothing \subseteq A \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;

:existence of [[lattice (order)|joins]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A \cup B&lt;/math&gt;
::*If &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A \cup B \subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;

:existence of [[lattice (order)|meets]]:
::*&lt;math&gt;A \cap B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
::*If &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq A \cap B&lt;/math&gt;

The following proposition says that the statement &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to various other statements involving unions, intersections and complements.

'''PROPOSITION 8''': For any two sets ''A'' and ''B'', the following are equivalent:
:*&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = A&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \cup B = B&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \smallsetminus B = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;B^C \subseteq A^C&lt;/math&gt;

The above proposition shows that the relation of set inclusion can be characterized by either of the operations of set union or set intersection, which means that the notion of set inclusion is axiomatically superfluous.

== The algebra of relative complements ==

The following proposition lists several identities concerning [[Complement (set theory)|relative complements]] and set-theoretic differences.

'''PROPOSITION 9''': For any universe '''U''' and subsets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' of '''U''', the following identities hold:
:*&lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cap B) = (C \setminus A) \cup (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;C \setminus (A \cup B) = (C \setminus A) \cap (C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;C \setminus (B \setminus A) = (A \cap C)\cup(C \setminus B)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cap C = (B \cap C) \setminus A = B \cap (C \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A) \cup C = (B \cup C) \setminus (A \setminus C)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \setminus A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\varnothing \setminus A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \setminus \varnothing = A&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;B \setminus A = A^C \cap B&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;(B \setminus A)^C = A \cup B^C&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;U \setminus A = A^C&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;A \setminus U = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

In [[number theory]], a [[natural number]] is called '''almost prime''' if there exists an absolute constant ''K'' such that the number has at most ''K'' [[prime factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sándor | first1 = József | last2 = Dragoslav | first2 = Mitrinović S. | last3 = Crstici | first3 = Borislav | title = Handbook of Number Theory I | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2006 | page = 316 | url = https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007%2F1-4020-3658-2 | isbn = 978-1-4020-4215-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On the representation of an even number as the sum of a single prime and single almost-prime number | first = Alfréd A. | last = Rényi | authorlink = Alfréd Rényi | journal = Izvestiya Rossiiskoi Akademii Nauk.

More formally, a number ''n'' is ''k''-almost prime if and only if [[arithmetic function#Ω(n), ω(n), νp(n) – prime power decomposition|Ω]](''n'') = ''k'', where Ω(''n'') is the total number of primes in the [[prime factorization]] of ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega(n) := \sum a_i \qquad\mbox{if}\qquad n = \prod p_i^{a_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

A natural number is thus [[prime number|prime]] if and only if it is 1-almost prime, and [[semiprime]] if and only if it is 2-almost prime. The set of ''k''-almost primes is usually denoted by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The smallest ''k''-almost prime is [[Power of two|2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;]]. The first few ''k''-almost primes are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9113">In [[mathematics]], '''Arakelov theory''' (or '''Arakelov geometry''') is an approach to [[Diophantine geometry]], named for [[Suren Arakelov]]. It is used to study [[Diophantine equation]]s in higher dimensions.

==Background==
Arakelov geometry studies a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'' over the ring of integers '''Z''', by putting [[Hermitian metric]]s on [[holomorphic vector bundle]]s over ''X''('''C'''), the complex points of ''X''.  This extra Hermitian structure is applied as a substitute for the failure of the scheme Spec('''Z''') to be a [[complete variety]].

==Results==

{{harvs|authorlink=Suren Arakelov|last=Arakelov|year1=1974|year2=1975|txt}} defined an [[intersection theory]] on the [[arithmetic surface]]s attached to smooth projective curves over number fields, with the aim of proving certain results, known in the case of function fields,
in the case of number fields. {{harvs|txt=yes|first=Gerd |last=Faltings|authorlink=Gerd Faltings|year=1984|txt}} extended Arakelov's work by establishing results such as a Riemann-Roch theorem, a Noether formula, a Hodge index theorem and the nonnegativity of the self-intersection of the dualizing sheaf in this context.

Arakelov theory was used by [[Paul Vojta]] (1991) to give a new proof of the [[Mordell conjecture]], and by {{harvs|txt=yes|first=Gerd |last=Faltings|authorlink=Gerd Faltings|year=1991}} in his proof of [[Serge Lang]]'s generalization of the Mordell conjecture.

{{harvs|txt=yes|first=Pierre |last=Deligne|authorlink=Pierre Deligne|year=1987}} developed a more general framework to define the intersection pairing defined on an arithmetic surface over the [[spectrum of a ring]] of integers  by Arakelov.

Arakelov's theory was generalized by [[Henri Gillet]] and [[Christophe Soulé]] to higher dimensions. That is, Gillet and Soulé defined an intersection pairing on an arithmetic variety. One of the main results of Gillet and Soulé is the '''arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem''' of {{harvtxt|Gillet|Soulé|1992}}, an extension of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] to arithmetic varieties. 
For this one defines arithmetic [[Chow ring|Chow group]]s CH&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') of an arithmetic variety ''X'', and defines [[Chern class]]es for Hermitian vector bundles over ''X'' taking values in the arithmetic Chow groups. 
The arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem then describes how the Chern class behaves under pushforward of vector bundles under a proper map of arithmetic varieties. A complete proof of this theorem was only published recently by Gillet, Rössler and Soulé.

Arakelov's intersection theory for arithmetic surfaces was developed further by {{harvs|txt|first=Jean-Benoît|last=Bost|year=1999}}. The theory of Bost is based on the use of [[Green's function|Green function]]s which, up to logarithmic singularities, belong to the Sobolev space &lt;math&gt;L^2_1&lt;/math&gt;. In this context Bost obtains an arithmetic Hodge index theorem and uses this to obtain Lefschetz theorems for arithmetic surfaces.

==Arithmetic Chow groups==
An '''arithmetic cycle''' of codimension ''p'' is a pair (''Z'',&amp;nbsp;''g'') where ''Z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is a ''p''-cycle on ''X'' and ''g'' is a Green current for ''Z'', a higher-dimensional  generalization of a Green function. The '''arithmetic Chow group''' &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathrm{CH}}_p(X)&lt;/math&gt; of codimension ''p'' is the quotient of this group by the subgroup generated by certain "trivial" cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Manin &amp; Panchishkin (2008) pp.400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem==
The usual [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] describes how the [[Chern character]] ch behaves under pushforward of sheaves, and states that ch(''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''E''))= ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(ch(E)Td&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''f'' is a proper morphism from ''X'' to ''Y'' and ''E'' is a vector bundle over ''f''. The arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem is similar except that the [[Todd class]] gets multiplied by a certain power series. 
The arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem states
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathrm{ch}}(f_*([E]))=f_*(\hat{\mathrm{ch}}(E)\widehat{\mathrm{Td}}^R(T_{X/Y}))&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''X'' and ''Y'' are regular projective arithmetic schemes.
*''f'' is a smooth proper map from ''X'' to ''Y''
*''E'' is an arithmetic vector bundle over ''X''.
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathrm{ch}}&lt;/math&gt; is the arithmetic Chern character.
*T&lt;sub&gt;X/Y&lt;/sub&gt; is the relative tangent bundle
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathrm{Td}}&lt;/math&gt; is the arithmetic Todd class 
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathrm{Td}}^R(E)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathrm{Td}}(E)(1-\epsilon(R(E)))&lt;/math&gt;
*''R''(''X'') is the additive characteristic class associated to the formal power series
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{{m&gt;0 \atop m\text{ odd}}} \frac{X^m}{m!}\left[2\zeta^\prime(-m)+\zeta(-m)\left({1\over 1}+{1\over 2}+\cdots+{1\over m}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

'''Bayesian probability''' is an [[Probability interpretations|interpretation of the concept of probability]], in which, instead of [[frequentist probability|frequency]] or [[propensity probability|propensity]] of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cox |first=R.

The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of [[propositional logic]] that enables reasoning with hypotheses, i.e., the propositions whose [[truth value|truth or falsity]] is uncertain. In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under [[frequentist inference]], a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability.

Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies some [[prior probability]], which is then updated to a [[posterior probability]] in the light of new, relevant [[data]] (evidence).&lt;ref name="paulos"&gt;{{cite web |author-link=John Allen Paulos |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=thomas%20bayes&amp;st=cse |title=The Mathematics of Changing Your Mind [by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne] |department=Book Review |newspaper=New York Times |date=5 August 2011 |access-date=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.

The term ''Bayesian'' derives from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century mathematician and theologian [[Thomas Bayes]], who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical [[data analysis]] using what is now known as [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref name="HOS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stigler|first1=Stephen M.|title=The history of statistics|date=March 1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674403413|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} Mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] pioneered and popularised what is now called Bayesian probability.&lt;ref name="HOS" /&gt;{{rp|97–98}}

==Bayesian methodology==
Bayesian methods are characterized by concepts and procedures as follows:
* The use of [[random variable]]s, or more generally unknown quantities,&lt;ref name="rbp"/&gt; to model all sources of uncertainty in statistical models including uncertainty resulting from lack of information (see also [[Uncertainty quantification#Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty|aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty]]).
* The need to determine the prior probability distribution taking into account the available (prior) information.
* The sequential use of [[Bayes' formula]]: when more data become available, calculate the posterior distribution using Bayes' formula; subsequently, the posterior distribution becomes the next prior.
* While for the frequentist a [[null hypothesis|hypothesis]] is a [[Proposition#Treatment in logic|proposition]] (which must be [[principle of bivalence|either true or false]]), so that the frequentist probability of a hypothesis is either 0 or 1, in Bayesian statistics the probability that can be assigned to a hypothesis can also be in a range from 0 to 1 if the truth value is uncertain.

==Objective and subjective Bayesian probabilities==
Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations on Bayesian probability. For ''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivists]]'', interpreting probability as extension of [[logic]], ''probability'' quantifies the reasonable expectation everyone (even a "robot") sharing the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by [[Cox's theorem]].&lt;ref name="ghxaib" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "vkdmsn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Richard T.|title=The algebra of probable inference|date=1961|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press ; Oxford University Press [distributor]|location=Baltimore, Md. : London|isbn=9780801869822|edition=[Repr.].|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Subjectivism|subjectivists]]'', ''probability'' corresponds to a personal belief.&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974" /&gt; Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the [[Dutch book]] argument or by the [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974" /&gt; The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.

==History==
{{Main|History of statistics#Bayesian statistics}}

The term ''Bayesian'' refers to [[Thomas Bayes]] (1702–1761), who proved a special case of what is now called [[Bayes' theorem]] in a paper titled "[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]".&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch. (2011). {{Google books|_Kx5xVGuLRIC|''The Theory That Would Not Die,'' p. 10.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that special case, the prior and posterior distributions were [[Beta distribution]]s and the data came from [[Bernoulli trial]]s. It was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) who introduced a general version of the theorem and used it to approach problems in [[celestial mechanics]], medical statistics, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, Stephen M. (1986) ''The history of statistics.'' Harvard University press. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's [[principle of insufficient reason]], was called "[[inverse probability]]" (because it [[Inductive reasoning|infer]]s backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes).&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006&gt;Fienberg, Stephen. E. (2006) [http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf ''When did Bayesian Inference become "Bayesian"?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910070556/http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf |date=September 10, 2014 }} ''Bayesian Analysis'', 1 (1), 1–40. See page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1920s, "inverse probability" was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called [[frequentist statistics]].&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006/&gt;

In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace developed in two directions, giving rise to ''objective'' and ''subjective'' currents in Bayesian practice.
[[Harold Jeffreys]]' ''Theory of Probability'' (first published in 1939) played an important role in the revival of the Bayesian view of probability, followed by works by [[Abraham Wald]] (1950) and [[Leonard J. Savage]] (1954). The adjective ''Bayesian'' itself dates to the 1950s;  the derived ''Bayesianism'', ''neo-Bayesianism'' is of 1960s coinage.&lt;ref&gt;
"The works of [[Abraham Wald|Wald]], ''Statistical Decision Functions'' (1950) and [[Leonard J. Savage|Savage]], ''The Foundation of Statistics'' (1954) are commonly regarded starting points for current Bayesian approaches";
"Recent developments of the so-called Bayesian approach to statistics"
Marshall Dees Harris, ''Legal-economic research'', University of Iowa. Agricultural Law Center (1959), p. 125 (fn. 52); p. 126.

"This revolution, which may or may not succeed, is neo-Bayesianism. Jeffreys tried to introduce this approach, but did not succeed at the time in giving it general appeal."  ''Annals of the Computation Laboratory of Harvard University'' 31 (1962), p. 180.
"It is curious that even in its activities unrelated to ethics, humanity searches for a religion. At the present time, the religion being 'pushed' the hardest is Bayesianism."
Oscar Kempthorne, 'The Classical Problem of Inference—Goodness of Fit', ''Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability''  (1967), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IC4Ku_7dBFUC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the objectivist stream, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed.&lt;ref name=Bernardo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernardo | first1 = J.M. | authorlink = José-Miguel Bernardo | year = 2005 | title = Reference analysis | url = | journal = Handbook of statistics | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 17–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No subjective decisions need to be involved. In contrast, "subjectivist" statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case.

In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods and the consequent removal of many of the computational problems, and to an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, R.L. (2004) ''A conversation with James O. Berger'', Statistical science, 9, 205–218&lt;/ref&gt; While frequentist statistics remains strong (as seen by the fact that most undergraduate teaching is still based on it &lt;ref&gt;[[José-Miguel Bernardo|Bernardo, José M.]] (2006) [http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/ICOTS7/Proceedings/PDFs/InvitedPapers/3I2_BERN.pdf ''A Bayesian mathematical statistics primer'']. ICOTS-7&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}), Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, e.g., in the field of [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bishop, C.M. ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.'' Springer, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification of Bayesian probabilities==
The use of Bayesian probabilities as the basis of [[Bayesian inference]] has been supported by several arguments, such as [[Cox's theorem|Cox axioms]], the [[Dutch book|Dutch book argument]], arguments based on [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].

===Axiomatic approach===
[[Richard Threlkeld Cox|Richard T. Cox]] showed that&lt;ref name = "vkdmsn" /&gt; Bayesian updating follows from several axioms, including two [[functional equations]] and a hypothesis of differentiability. The assumption of differentiability or even continuity is controversial; Halpern found a counterexample based on his observation that the Boolean algebra of statements may be finite.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. ''A counterexample to theorems of Cox and Fine'', Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 10: 67–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Other axiomatizations have been suggested by various authors with the purpose of making the theory more rigorous.&lt;ref name="rbp"&gt;Dupré, Maurice J., Tipler, Frank J. [http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ba/1340369856 ''New Axioms For Rigorous Bayesian Probability''], Bayesian Analysis (2009), Number 3, pp. 599–606&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch book approach===
The Dutch book argument was proposed by de Finetti; it is based on betting. A [[Dutch book]] is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit, no matter what the outcome of the bets. If a [[bookmaker]] follows the rules of the Bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds, a Dutch book cannot be made.

However, [[Ian Hacking]] noted that traditional Dutch book arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. For example, [[Ian Hacking|Hacking]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (1967, Section 3, page 316), Hacking (1988, page 124)&lt;/ref&gt; "And neither the Dutch book argument, nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms, entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. Salt could lose its savour."

In fact, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on "[[probability kinematics]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skyrms|first=Brian|date=1987-01-01|title=Dynamic Coherence and Probability Kinematics|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1086/289350|jstor=187470}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the publication of [[Richard Jeffrey|Richard C. Jeffreys]]' rule, which is itself regarded as Bayesian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayes-theorem/|title=Bayes' Theorem|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The additional hypotheses sufficient to (uniquely) specify Bayesian updating are substantial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21329-8_15|title=Probability in Physics|last=Fuchs|first=Christopher A.|last2=Schack|first2=Rüdiger|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783642213281|editor-last=Ben-Menahem|editor-first=Yemima|series=The Frontiers Collection|location=|pages=233–247|language=en|arxiv=1103.5950|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-21329-8_15|editor-last2=Hemmo|editor-first2=Meir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not universally seen as satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas van Fraassen|van Frassen, B.]] (1989) ''Laws and Symmetry'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-824860-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision theory approach===
A [[statistical decision theory|decision-theoretic]] justification of the use of Bayesian inference (and hence of Bayesian probabilities) was given by [[Abraham Wald]], who proved that every [[admissible decision rule|admissible]] statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Abraham. ''Statistical Decision Functions.'' Wiley 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, every Bayesian procedure is [[admissible decision rule|admissible]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo, José M., Smith, Adrian F.M. ''Bayesian Theory.'' John Wiley 1994. {{ISBN|0-471-92416-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors==
Following the work on [[expected utility]] [[optimal decision|theory]] of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]],  decision-theorists have accounted for [[optimal decision|rational behavior]] using a probability distribution for the [[Agent-based model|agent]]. Johann Pfanzagl completed the ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility, a task left uncompleted by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution, as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1967, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by Oskar Morgenstern: "Von Neumann and I have anticipated...[the question whether probabilities] might, perhaps more typically, be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities (cf. p. 19 of The [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]). We did not carry this out; it was demonstrated by Pfanzagl ... with all the necessary rigor".&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern (1976, page 65)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] noted that the individual agent's probability distribution could be objectively studied in experiments. The role of judgment and disagreement in science has been recognized since [[Aristotle]] and even more clearly with [[Francis Bacon]]. The objectivity of science lies not in the psychology of individual scientists, but in the process of science and especially in statistical methods, as noted by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=Stephen M. |year=1978 |authorlink=Stephen Stigler |title=Mathematical statistics in the early States |journal=Annals of Statistics |volume=6 |issue=March |pages=239–265 esp. p. 248 |publisher= |doi=10.1214/aos/1176344123 |jstor=2958876 |mr=483118 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344123 |accessdate= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that the objective methods for falsifying propositions about personal probabilities have been used for a half century, as noted previously. Procedures for [[statistical hypothesis testing|testing hypotheses]] about probabilities (using finite samples) are due to [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1931) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]] (1931, 1937, 1964, 1970).

The "Ramsey test" for evaluating probability distributions is implementable in theory, and has kept experimental psychologists occupied for a half century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson et al. (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;
This work demonstrates that Bayesian-probability propositions can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]], and so meet an empirical criterion of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]], whose work inspired Ramsey. (This [[falsifiability]]-criterion was popularized by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProDem "Karl Popper" in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T76Zd20IYlgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logic+of+scientific+discovery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eGfU8COmAA&amp;sig=W8TTt29x5sG8aCGpYuWnonDFH8M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=crC3TJKND46ssAPp06jkCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=falsifiability&amp;f=false ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''] 2nd Edition, Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-27843-0}} (Reprint of 1959 translation of 1935 original) Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Modern work on the experimental evaluation of personal probabilities uses the randomization, [[double blind|blinding]], and Boolean-decision procedures of the Peirce-Jastrow experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce &amp; Jastrow (1885)
&lt;/ref&gt; Since individuals act according to different probability judgments, these agents' probabilities are "personal" (but amenable to objective study).

Personal probabilities are problematic for science and for some applications where decision-makers lack the knowledge or time to specify an informed probability-distribution (on which they are prepared to act). To meet the needs of science and of human limitations, Bayesian statisticians have developed "objective" methods for specifying prior probabilities.

Indeed, some Bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines ''the'' (unique) prior probability-distribution for "regular" statistical problems; cf. [[well-posed problem]]s. Finding the right method for constructing such "objective" priors (for appropriate classes of regular problems) has been the quest of statistical theorists from Laplace to [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]]. These theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing "objective" priors (Unfortunately, it is not clear how to assess the relative "objectivity" of the priors proposed under these methods):
* [[principle of maximum entropy|Maximum entropy]]
* [[Haar measure|Transformation group analysis]]
* [[José-Miguel Bernardo|Reference analysis]]

Each of these methods contributes useful priors for "regular" one-parameter problems, and each prior can handle some challenging [[statistical model]]s (with "irregularity" or several parameters). Each of these methods has been useful in Bayesian practice. Indeed, methods for constructing "objective" (alternatively, "default" or "ignorance") priors have been developed by avowed subjective (or "personal") Bayesians like [[James Berger (statistician)|James Berger]] ([[Duke University]]) and [[José-Miguel Bernardo]] ([[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]), simply because such priors are needed for Bayesian practice, particularly in science.&lt;ref name="refa"&gt;Bernardo, J. M. (2005). [http://www.uv.es/~bernardo/RefAna.pdf ''Reference Analysis'']. ''Handbook of Statistics'' 25 (D. K. Dey and [[C. R. Rao]] eds). Amsterdam: Elsevier, 17–90&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for "the universal method for constructing priors" continues to attract statistical theorists.&lt;ref name="refa" /&gt;

Thus, the Bayesian statistician needs either to use informed priors (using relevant expertise or previous data) or to choose among the competing methods for constructing "objective" priors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">In [[topology]], the '''Bing metrization theorem''', named after [[R. H. Bing]], characterizes when a [[topological space]] is [[metrizable]].
==Formal statement==
The theorem states that a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is metrizable if and only if it is [[regular space|regular]] and '''[[Kolmogorov axiom|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]''' and has a σ-discrete [[basis (topology)|basis]]. A family of sets is called σ-discrete when it is a union of countably many discrete collections, where a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called discrete, when every point of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a neighborhood that intersects at most one member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. 

==History==
The theorem was proven by [[RH Bing|Bing]] in 1951 and was an independent discovery with the [[Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem|Nagata-Smirnov metrization]] theorem that was proved independently by both [[Jun-iti Nagata|Nagata]] (1950) and Smirnov (1951). Both theorems are often merged in the Bing-Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem. It is a common tool to prove other [[metrization theorem]]s, e.g. the Moore metrization theorem: a [[collectionwise normal]], [[Moore space (topology)|Moore space]] is metrizable, is a direct consequence.

==Comparison with other metrization theorems==
Unlike the Urysohn's [[metrization theorem]] which provides a sufficient condition for metrization, this theorem provides both a necessary and sufficient condition for a [[topological space]] to be [[metrizable]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18949">In [[computer science]], the '''Boolean data type''' is a [[data type]] that has one of two possible values (usually denoted ''true'' and ''false''), intended to represent the two [[truth value]]s of [[logic]] and [[Boolean algebra]]. It is named after [[George Boole]], who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century. The Boolean data type is primarily associated with [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional]] statements, which allow different actions by changing [[control flow]] depending on whether a programmer-specified Boolean ''condition'' evaluates to true or false. It is a special case of a more general ''logical data type (see [[probabilistic logic]])—''logic need not always be Boolean.

== Generalities ==
In [[programming language]]s with a built-in Boolean data type, such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the [[comparison operator]]s such as &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;≠&lt;/code&gt; are usually defined to return a Boolean value. [[if-then-else|Conditional]] and [[while loop|iterative]] commands may be defined to test Boolean-valued expressions.

Languages with no explicit Boolean data type, like [[ANSI C#C90|C90]] and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], may still represent truth values by some other data type. [[Common Lisp]] uses an empty list for false, and any other value for true. The C programming language uses an [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] type, where relational expressions like &lt;code&gt;i &gt; j&lt;/code&gt; and logical expressions connected by &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; are defined to have value 1 if true and 0 if false, whereas the test parts of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, etc., treat any non-zero value as true.&lt;ref name="k&amp;r1e"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Brian W |last1= Kernighan |authorlink1= Brian Kernighan |first2= Dennis M |last2= Ritchie |authorlink2= Dennis Ritchie |page= 41 |title= [[The C Programming Language]] |edition= 1st |publisher= [[Prentice Hall]] |year= 1978 |location= [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] |ISBN= 0-13-110163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=86–93 |first1= PJ |last1= Plauger |authorlink1= P. J. Plauger |first2= Jim |last2= Brodie |title= ANSI and ISO Standard C Programmer's reference |publisher= [[Microsoft Press]] |origyear= 1989 |year= 1992 |ISBN= 1-55615-359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a Boolean variable may be regarded (and implemented) as a numerical variable with one binary digit ([[bit]]), which can store only two values. The implementation of Booleans in computers are most likely represented as a full [[Word (computer architecture)|word]], rather than a bit; this is usually due to the ways computers transfer blocks of information.

Most programming languages, even those with no explicit Boolean type, have support for Boolean algebraic operations such as [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] (&lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;), [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] (&lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;), [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]] (&lt;code&gt;EQV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;), [[exclusive or]]/non-equivalence (&lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NEQV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;), and [[negation]] (&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;).

In some languages, like [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Smalltalk]], and [[Alice (software)|Alice]] the ''true'' and ''false'' values belong to separate [[Class (computer programming)|classes]], i.e., &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, so there is no one Boolean ''type''.

In [[SQL]], which uses a [[three-valued logic]] for explicit comparisons because of its special treatment of [[Null (SQL)|Null]]s, the Boolean data type (introduced in [[SQL:1999]]) is also defined to include more than two truth values, so that SQL ''Booleans'' can store all logical values resulting from the evaluation of predicates in SQL. A column of Boolean type can also be restricted to just &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; though.

== ALGOL and the built-in boolean type ==
One of the earliest programming languages to provide an explicit ''boolean'' data type was [[ALGOL 60]] (1960) with values ''true'' and ''false'' and logical operators denoted by symbols '&lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;' (and), '&lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;' (or), '&lt;math&gt;\supset&lt;/math&gt;' (implies), '&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;' (equivalence), and '&lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;' (not).  Due to input device and [[character set]] limits on many computers of the time, however, most compilers used alternative representations for many of the operators, such as &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'AND'&lt;/code&gt;.

This approach with ''boolean'' as a built-in (either [[Primitive data type|primitive]] or otherwise predefined) [[data type]] was adopted by many later programming languages, such as [[Simula]] 67 (1967), [[ALGOL 68]] (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/Algol68-Report.pdf |title=Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 68, Section 10.2.2. |date=August 1968 |format=PDF |access-date=30 April 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406061108/http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/Algol68-Report.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (1970), [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] (1980), [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (1995), and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (2000), among others.

== Fortran ==
The first version of [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] (1957) and its successor FORTRAN II (1958) had no logical values or operations; even the conditional &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statement took an arithmetic expression and branched to one of three locations according to its sign; see [[arithmetic IF]].  FORTRAN IV (1962), however, followed the ALGOL 60 example by providing a Boolean data type (&lt;code&gt;LOGICAL&lt;/code&gt;), truth literals (&lt;code&gt;.TRUE.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.FALSE.&lt;/code&gt;), Boolean-valued numeric comparison operators (&lt;code&gt;.EQ.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GT.&lt;/code&gt;, etc.), and logical operators (&lt;code&gt;.NOT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.AND.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.OR.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;!-- , &lt;code&gt;.XOR.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.EQV.&lt;/code&gt;--&gt;).  In &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statements, a specific control character ('&lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;') was provided for the parsing or formatting of logical values.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Equipment Corporation, ''DECSystem10 FORTRAN IV Programmers Reference Manual''. Reprinted in ''Mathematical Languages Handbook''.

== Lisp and Scheme ==
The language [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] (1958) never had a built-in Boolean data type. Instead, conditional constructs like &lt;code&gt;cond&lt;/code&gt; assume that the logical value ''false'' is represented by the empty list &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, which is defined to be the same as the special atom &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NIL&lt;/code&gt;; whereas any other [[s-expression]] is interpreted as ''true''. For convenience, most modern dialects of Lisp predefine the atom &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; to have value &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, so that &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; can be used as a mnemonic notation for ''true''.

This approach (''any value can be used as a Boolean value'') was retained in most Lisp dialects ([[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Emacs Lisp]]), and similar models were adopted by many [[scripting language]]s, even ones having a distinct Boolean type or Boolean values; although which values are interpreted as ''false'' and which are ''true'' vary from language to language. In Scheme, for example, the ''false'' value is an atom distinct from the empty list, so the latter is interpreted as ''true''.

== Pascal, Ada, and Haskell ==
The language [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (1970) introduced the concept of programmer-defined [[enumerated type]]s. A built-in &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; data type was then provided as a predefined enumerated type with values &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;. By definition, all comparisons, logical operations, and conditional statements applied to and/or yielded &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; values.  Otherwise, the &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt; type had all the facilities which were available for enumerated types in general, such as ordering and use as indices. In contrast, converting between &lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;s and integers (or any other types) still required explicit tests or function calls, as in ALGOL 60. This approach (''Boolean is an enumerated type'') was adopted by most later languages which had enumerated types, such as [[Modula]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

== C, C++, Objective-C, AWK ==
Initial implementations of the language [[C (programming language)|C]] (1972) provided no Boolean type, and to this day Boolean values are commonly represented by integers (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s) in C programs. The comparison operators (&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) are defined to return a signed integer (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) result, either 0 (for false) or 1 (for true). Logical operators (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and condition-testing statements (&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;) assume that zero is false and all other values are true.

After enumerated types (&lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;s) were added to the [[American National Standards Institute]] version of C, [[ANSI C]] (1989), many C programmers got used to defining their own Boolean types as such, for readability reasons. However, enumerated types are equivalent to integers according to the language standards; so the effective identity between Booleans and integers is still valid for C programs.

Standard [[C (programming language)|C]] (since [[C99]]) provides a boolean type, called &lt;code&gt;_Bool&lt;/code&gt;. By including the header &lt;code&gt;stdbool.h&lt;/code&gt;, one can use the more intuitive name &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; and the constants &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. The language guarantees that any two true values will compare equal (which was impossible to achieve before the introduction of the type). Boolean values still behave as integers, can be stored in integer variables, and used anywhere integers would be valid, including in indexing, arithmetic, parsing, and formatting. This approach (''Boolean values are just integers'') has been retained in all later versions of C.

[[C++]] has a separate Boolean data type &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;, but with automatic conversions from scalar and pointer values that are very similar to those of C. This approach was adopted also by many later languages, especially by some [[scripting language]]s such as [[AWK]].

[[Objective-C]] also has a separate Boolean data type &lt;code&gt;BOOL&lt;/code&gt;, with possible values being &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NO&lt;/code&gt;, equivalents of true and false respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/FoundationTypesandCollections/FoundationTypesandCollections.html|title=Guides and Sample Code|author=|date=|website=developer.apple.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907013839/http://developer.apple.com/library/iOS/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/FoundationTypesandCollections/FoundationTypesandCollections.html|archivedate=7 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Objective-C compilers that support C99, C's &lt;code&gt;_Bool&lt;/code&gt; type can be used, since Objective-C is a [[superset]] of C.

== Perl and Lua ==
[[Perl]] has no boolean data type. Instead, any value can behave as boolean in boolean context (condition of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement, argument of &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). The number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, the strings &lt;code&gt;"0"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt;, the empty list &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, and the special value &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; evaluate to false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Truth-and-Falsehood |title=perlsyn - Perl Syntax / Truth and Falsehood |access-date=10 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826100652/http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Truth-and-Falsehood |archivedate=26 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All else evaluates to true.

[[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] has a boolean data type, but non-boolean values can also behave as booleans. The non-value &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to false, whereas every other data type always evaluates to true, regardless of value.

== Tcl ==
[[Tcl]] has no separate Boolean type. Like in C, the integers 0 (false) and 1 (true - in fact any nonzero integer) are used.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title= PEP 285 -- Adding a bool type |date= 4 May 2011 |url= https://wiki.tcl.tk/16235 |access-date= 28 March 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180328231245/https://wiki.tcl.tk/16235 |archivedate= 28 March 2018 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of coding:

&lt;code&gt;
set v 1
if { $v } { puts "V is 1 or true" }
&lt;/code&gt;

The above will show "V is 1 or true" since the expression evaluates to '1'

&lt;code&gt;
set v ""
if { $v } ....
&lt;/code&gt;

The above will render an error as variable 'v' cannot be evaluated as '0' or '1'

== Python, Ruby, and JavaScript ==
[[Python (programming language)|Python]], from version 2.3 forward, has a &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; type which is a [[Subclass (computer science)|subclass]] of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, the standard integer type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Van Rossum |first= Guido |authorlink= Guido van Rossum |title= PEP 285 -- Adding a bool type |date= 3 April 2002 |url= https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0285/ |access-date= 15 May 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130501225326/http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0285/ |archivedate= 1 May 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two possible values: &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, which are ''special versions'' of 1 and 0 respectively and behave as such in arithmetic contexts. Also, a numeric value of zero (integer or fractional), the null value (&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;), the empty [[String (computer science)|string]], and empty containers (i.e. [[List (computing)|lists]], [[Set (computing)|sets]], etc.) are considered Boolean false; all other values are considered Boolean true by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/expressions.html |title= Expressions |website= Python v3.3.2 documentation |access-date= 15 May 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130522082703/http://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/expressions.html |archivedate= 22 May 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes can define how their instances are treated in a Boolean context through the special method &lt;code&gt;__nonzero__&lt;/code&gt; (Python 2) or &lt;code&gt;__bool__&lt;/code&gt; (Python 3). For containers, &lt;code&gt;__len__&lt;/code&gt; (the special method for determining the length of containers) is used if the explicit Boolean conversion method is not defined.

In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], in contrast, only &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; (Ruby's null value) and a special &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; object are ''false'', all else (including the integer 0 and empty arrays) is ''true''.

In [[JavaScript]], the empty string (&lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[NaN]]&lt;/code&gt;, +0, [[−0]] and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf |title=ECMAScript Language Specification |page=43 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412040502/http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SQL ==
The [[SQL:1999]] standard introduced a BOOLEAN data type as an optional feature (T031). When restricted by a &lt;code&gt;NOT NULL&lt;/code&gt; constraint, a SQL BOOLEAN behaves like Booleans in other languages. However, in SQL the BOOLEAN type is nullable by default like all other SQL data types, meaning it can have the special [[Null (SQL)|null]] value also. Although the SQL standard defines three [[Literal (computer programming)|literals]] for the BOOLEAN type – TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN – it also says that the NULL BOOLEAN and UNKNOWN "may be used interchangeably to mean exactly the same thing".&lt;ref name="Date2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3273">'''Boris Vladimirovich Gnedenko''' ({{lang-ru|Бори́с Влади́мирович Гнеде́нко}}; January 1, 1912 – December 27, 1995) was a  [[USSR|Soviet]]  mathematician and a student of [[Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov]]. He was born in [[Simbirsk]] (now [[Ulyanovsk]]), [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and died in [[Moscow]]. He is perhaps best known for his work with Kolmogorov, and his contributions to the study of [[probability theory]], particularly [[extreme value theory]], with such results as the [[Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem]]. Gnedenko was appointed as Head of the Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry Section of the [[Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] in 1949, and also became Director of the Kiev Institute of Mathematics in the same year.

Gnedenko was a leading member of the Russian school of probability theory and statistics. He also worked on applications of statistics to reliability and quality control in manufacturing. He wrote a history of mathematics in Russia (published 1946) and with O. B. Sheynin the section on the history of probability theory in the history of mathematics by [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] and [[Adolph P. Yushkevich]] (published 1992). In 1958 he was a [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Edinburgh with a talk entitled "Limit theorems of probability theory".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5067">'''Carleman's inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] in [[mathematics]], named after [[Torsten Carleman]], who proved it in 1923&lt;ref&gt;T. Carleman, ''Sur les fonctions quasi-analytiques'', Conférences faites au cinquième congres des mathématiciens Scandinaves, Helsinki (1923), 181-196.&lt;/ref&gt; and used it to prove the Denjoy&amp;ndash;Carleman theorem on [[quasi-analytic]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=2040885|last1=Duncan|first1=John|last2=McGregor|first2=Colin M.|title=
Carleman's inequality|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly |volume=110|year=2003|issue=5|pages= 424&amp;ndash;431|doi=10.2307/3647829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|mr=1820809|last1=Pečarić|first1=Josip|last2=Stolarsky|first2=Kenneth B.|title=Carleman's inequality: history and new generalizations|journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]|volume=61| year=2001|issue=1&amp;ndash;2|pages=49&amp;ndash;62|doi=10.1007/s000100050160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==

Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... be a [[sequence]] of [[non-negative]] [[real number]]s, then

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n\right)^{1/n} \le e \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The constant ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' in the inequality is optimal, that is, the inequality does not always hold if ''e'' is replaced by a smaller number. The inequality is strict (it holds with "&amp;lt;" instead of "&amp;le;") if some element in the sequence is non-zero.

==Integral version==

Carleman's inequality has an integral version, which states that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \exp\left\{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \ln f(t) dt \right\} dx \leq e \int_0^\infty f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt;

for any ''f''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.

==Carleson's inequality==

A generalisation, due to [[Lennart Carleson]], states the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.|last= Carleson|title=A proof of an inequality of Carleman|journal=Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.|volume=5|year=1954|pages=932&amp;ndash;933|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1954-005-06/S0002-9939-1954-0065601-3/S0002-9939-1954-0065601-3.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9939-1954-0065601-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

for any convex function ''g'' with ''g''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and for any -1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty x^p e^{-g(x)/x} dx \leq e^{p+1} \int_0^\infty x^p e^{-g'(x)} dx. &lt;/math&gt;

Carleman's inequality follows from the case ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Proof==

An elementary proof is sketched below. From the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] applied to  the numbers &lt;math&gt;1\cdot a_1,2\cdot a_2,\dots,n \cdot a_n&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MG}(a_1,\dots,a_n)=\mathrm{MG}(1a_1,2a_2,\dots,na_n)(n!)^{-1/n}\le \mathrm{MA}(1a_1,2a_2,\dots,na_n)(n!)^{-1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

where MG stands for geometric mean, and MA &amp;mdash; for arithmetic mean. The [[Stirling formula|Stirling-type]] inequality &lt;math&gt;n!\ge  \sqrt{2\pi n}\, n^n e^{-n}&lt;/math&gt; applied to &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;(n!)^{-1/n} \le \frac{e}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n\ge1.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;MG(a_1,\dots,a_n) \le \frac{e}{n(n+1)}\,  \sum_{1\le k \le n}   k a_k   \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

whence

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\ge1}MG(a_1,\dots,a_n) \le\,  e\, \sum_{k\ge1} \bigg( \sum_{n\ge k}  \frac{1}{n(n+1)}\bigg) \, k a_k =\, e\, \sum_{k\ge1}\,  a_k  \,  ,&lt;/math&gt;

proving the inequality. Moreover, the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; non-negative numbers is known to be an equality if and only if all the numbers coincide, that is, in the present case, if and only if &lt;math&gt;a_k= C/k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;. As a   consequence, Carleman's inequality is never an equality for a convergent series, unless all &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; vanish, just because the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] is divergent.

One can also prove Carleman's inequality by starting with [[Hardy's inequality]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left (\frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots +a_n}{n}\right )^p\le \left (\frac{p}{p-1}\right )^p\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^p&lt;/math&gt;

for the non-negative numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...  and ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1,  replacing each ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''a''{{su|b=n|p=1/''p''}}, and letting ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33734">[[File:Cobordism.svg|thumb|A cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'').]]
In [[mathematics]], '''cobordism''' is a fundamental  [[equivalence relation]] on the class of [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]s of the same dimension, set up using the concept of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] (French ''[[wikt:bord#French|bord]]'', giving ''cobordism'') of a manifold. Two manifolds of the same dimension are ''cobordant'' if their [[disjoint union]] is the ''boundary'' of a compact manifold one dimension higher.

The boundary of an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[manifold]] ''W'' is an ''n''-dimensional manifold ∂''W'' that is closed, i.e., with empty boundary. In general, a closed manifold need not be a boundary: cobordism theory is the study of the difference between all closed manifolds and those that are boundaries. The theory was originally developed by [[René Thom]] for [[smooth manifold]]s (i.e., differentiable), but there are now also versions for [[#Cobordism of piecewise linear and topological manifolds|piecewise-linear and topological manifolds]].

A ''cobordism'' between manifolds ''M'' and ''N'' is a compact manifold ''W'' whose boundary is the disjoint union of ''M'' and ''N'', &lt;math&gt;\partial W=M \sqcup N&lt;/math&gt;.

Cobordisms are studied both for the equivalence relation that they generate, and as objects in their own right. Cobordism is a much coarser equivalence relation than [[diffeomorphism]] or [[homeomorphism]] of manifolds, and is significantly easier to study and compute. It is not possible to classify manifolds up to [[diffeomorphism]] or [[homeomorphism]] in dimensions ≥ 4 – because the [[word problem for groups]] cannot be solved – but it is possible to classify manifolds up to cobordism. Cobordisms are central objects of study in [[geometric topology]] and [[algebraic topology]]. In geometric topology, cobordisms are [[#Connection with Morse theory|intimately connected]] with [[Morse theory]], and [[h-cobordism|''h''-cobordisms]] are fundamental in the study of high-dimensional manifolds, namely [[surgery theory]]. In algebraic topology, cobordism theories are fundamental [[extraordinary cohomology theories]], and [[#Categories of cobordisms|categories of cobordisms]] are the domains of [[topological quantum field theory|topological quantum field theories]].

== Definition ==
===Manifolds===
Roughly speaking, an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] ''M'' is a [[topological space]] [[neighborhood (mathematics)|locally]] (i.e., near each point) [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an open subset of [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^n.&lt;/math&gt; A [[manifold with boundary]] is similar, except that a point of ''M'' is allowed to have a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of the [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]

:&lt;math&gt;\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \R^n \mid x_n \geqslant 0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Those points without a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space are the boundary points of  &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;; the boundary of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\partial M&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, a [[closed manifold]] is, by definition, a [[compact space|compact]] manifold without boundary (&lt;math&gt;\partial M=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.)

===Cobordisms===
An &lt;math&gt;(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional ''cobordism'' is a [[quintuple]] &lt;math&gt;(W; M, N, i, j)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of an &lt;math&gt;(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional compact differentiable manifold with boundary, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;; closed  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-manifolds  &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;; and [[embedding]]s &lt;math&gt;i\colon M \subset \partial W&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j\colon N \subset\partial W&lt;/math&gt; with disjoint images such that

:&lt;math&gt;\partial W = i(M) \sqcup j(N)~.&lt;/math&gt;

The terminology is usually abbreviated to &lt;math&gt;(W; M, N)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;The notation "&lt;math&gt;(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional" is to clarify the dimension of all manifolds in question, otherwise it is unclear whether a "5-dimensional cobordism" refers to a 5-dimensional cobordism between 4-dimensional manifolds or a 6-dimensional cobordism between 5-dimensional manifolds.&lt;/ref&gt; ''M'' and ''N'' are called ''cobordant'' if such a cobordism exists. All manifolds cobordant to a fixed given manifold ''M'' form the ''cobordism class'' of&amp;nbsp;''M''.

Every closed manifold ''M'' is the boundary of the non-compact manifold ''M''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1); for this reason we require ''W'' to be compact in the definition of cobordism. Note however that ''W'' is ''not'' required to be connected; as a consequence, if ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∂''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∂''W''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''M'' and ''N'' are cobordant.

===Examples===
The simplest example of a cobordism is the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0, 1]. It is a 1-dimensional cobordism between the 0-dimensional manifolds {0}, {1}. More generally, for any closed manifold ''M'', (''M'' × ''I''; {0}, {1}) is a cobordism from ''M'' × {0} to ''M'' × {1}.

[[File:Pair of pants cobordism (pantslike).svg|thumb|right| A cobordism between a single circle (at the top) and a pair of disjoint circles (at the bottom).]]

If ''M'' consists of a [[circle]], and ''N'' of two circles, ''M'' and ''N'' together make up the boundary of a [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pair of pants]] ''W'' (see the figure at right). Thus the pair of pants is a cobordism between ''M'' and ''N''. A simpler cobordism between ''M'' and ''N'' is given by the disjoint union of three disks.

The pair of pants is an example of a more general cobordism: for any two ''n''-dimensional manifolds ''M'', ''M''′, the disjoint union &lt;math&gt;M \sqcup M'&lt;/math&gt; is cobordant to the [[connected sum]] &lt;math&gt;M\#M'.&lt;/math&gt; The previous example is a particular case, since the connected sum &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1\#\mathbb{S}^1&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1.&lt;/math&gt; The connected sum &lt;math&gt;M\#M'&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from the disjoint union &lt;math&gt;M \sqcup M'&lt;/math&gt; by surgery on an embedding of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^0 \times \mathbb{D}^n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M \sqcup M'&lt;/math&gt;, and the cobordism is the trace of the surgery.

===Terminology===
An ''n''-manifold ''M'' is called ''null-cobordant'' if there is a cobordism between ''M'' and the empty manifold; in other words, if ''M'' is the entire boundary of some (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-manifold. For example, the circle is null-cobordant since it bounds a disk. More generally, a ''n''-sphere is null-cobordant since it bounds a (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-disk. Also, every orientable surface is null-cobordant, because it is the boundary of a [[handlebody]]. On the other hand, the 2''n''-dimensional [[real projective space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^{2n}(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is a (compact) closed manifold that is not the boundary of a manifold, as is explained below.

The general ''bordism problem'' is to calculate the cobordism classes of manifolds subject to various conditions.

Null-cobordisms with additional structure are called [[Symplectic filling|fillings]]. "Bordism" and "cobordism" are used by some authors interchangeably; others distinguish them. When one wishes to distinguish the study of cobordism classes from the study of cobordisms as objects in their own right, one calls the equivalence question "bordism of manifolds", and the study of cobordisms as objects "cobordisms of manifolds".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The term "bordism" comes from French {{lang|fr|[[wikt:bord|bord]]}}, meaning boundary. Hence bordism is the study of boundaries. "Cobordism" means "jointly bound", so ''M'' and ''N'' are cobordant if they jointly bound a manifold, i.e., if their disjoint union is a boundary. Further, cobordism groups form an extraordinary ''cohomology theory'', hence the co-.

===Variants===
The above is the most basic form of the definition. It is also referred to as unoriented bordism. In many situations, the manifolds in question are [[orientability|oriented]], or carry some other additional structure referred to as [[G-structure]]. This gives rise to [[#Oriented cobordism|"oriented cobordism"]] and "cobordism with G-structure", respectively. Under favourable technical conditions these form a [[graded ring]] called the '''cobordism ring''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega^G_*&lt;/math&gt;, with grading by dimension, addition by disjoint union and multiplication by [[cartesian product]]. The cobordism groups &lt;math&gt;\Omega^G_*&lt;/math&gt; are the coefficient groups of a [[#Cobordism_as_an_extraordinary_cohomology_theory|generalised homology theory]].

When there is additional structure, the notion of cobordism must be formulated more precisely: a ''G''-structure on ''W'' restricts to a ''G''-structure on ''M'' and ''N''. The basic examples are ''G'' = O for unoriented cobordism, ''G'' = SO for oriented cobordism, and ''G'' = U for [[complex cobordism]] using ''stably'' [[complex manifold]]s. Many more are detailed by [[Robert Evert Stong|Robert E. Stong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | last = Stong | first = Robert E. | authorlink=Robert Evert Stong|title=Notes on cobordism theory |location=Princeton, NJ|  year = 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, a standard tool in [[surgery theory]] is surgery on [[normal invariants|normal maps]]: such a process changes a normal map to another normal map within the same [[bordism]] class.

Instead of considering additional structure, it is also possible to take into account various notions of manifold, especially [[Piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear (PL)]] and [[topological manifold]]s. This gives rise to bordism groups &lt;math&gt;\Omega_*^{PL}(X), \Omega_*^{TOP}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, which are harder to compute than the differentiable variants.{{citation-needed|date=September 2018}}

==Surgery construction==
Recall that in general, if ''X'', ''Y'' are manifolds with boundary, then the boundary of the product manifold is ∂(''X'' × ''Y'') = (∂''X'' × ''Y'') ∪ (''X'' × ∂''Y'').

Now, given a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'' = ''p'' + ''q'' and an [[embedding]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi : \mathbb{S}^p \times \mathbb{D}^q \subset M,&lt;/math&gt; define the ''n''-manifold

:&lt;math&gt;N := (M-\operatorname{int~im}\varphi)\cup_{\varphi|_{\mathbb{S}^p\times \mathbb{S}^{q-1}}} (\mathbb{D}^{p+1}\times \mathbb{S}^{q-1})&lt;/math&gt;

obtained by [[Surgery theory|surgery]], via cutting out the interior of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^p \times \mathbb{D}^q&lt;/math&gt; and gluing in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^{p+1} \times \mathbb{S}^{q-1}&lt;/math&gt; along their boundary

:&lt;math&gt;\partial \left (\mathbb{S}^p \times \mathbb{D}^q \right) = \mathbb{S}^p \times \mathbb{S}^{q-1} = \partial \left ( \mathbb{D}^{p+1} \times \mathbb{S}^{q-1} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The '''trace''' of the surgery

:&lt;math&gt; W := (M\times I) \cup_{\mathbb{S}^p\times \mathbb{D}^q\times \{1\}} (\mathbb{D}^{p+1}\times \mathbb{D}^q)&lt;/math&gt;

defines an '''elementary''' cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N''). Note that ''M'' is obtained from ''N'' by surgery on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^{p+1}\times \mathbb{S}^{q-1} \subset N.&lt;/math&gt; This is called '''reversing the surgery'''.

Every cobordism is a union of elementary cobordisms, by the work of [[Marston Morse]], [[René Thom]] and [[John Milnor]].

===Examples===
[[File:Circle-surgery.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 1]]
As per the above definition, a surgery on the circle consists of cutting out a copy of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^0 \times \mathbb{D}^1&lt;/math&gt; and glueing in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^0.&lt;/math&gt; The pictures in Fig. 1  show that the result of doing this is either (i) &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1&lt;/math&gt; again, or (ii) two copies of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Sphere-surgery1.png|thumb|left|Fig. 2a]]
[[File:Sphere-surgery2.png|thumb|right|Fig. 2b]]

For surgery on the 2-Sphere, there are more possibilities, since we can start by cutting out either &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^0 \times \mathbb{D}^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{D}^1.&lt;/math&gt;

*(a) &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{D}^1&lt;/math&gt;: If we remove a cylinder from the 2-sphere, we are left with two disks. We have to glue back in&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^0 \times \mathbb{D}^2&lt;/math&gt; – that is, two disks - and it's clear that the result of doing so is to give us two disjoint spheres. (Fig. 2a)

[[File:Sphere-surgery4.png|thumb|right|Fig. 2c. This shape cannot be embedded in 3-space.]]

*(b)&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^0 \times \mathbb{D}^2&lt;/math&gt;: Having cut out two disks &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^0 \times \mathbb{D}^2,&lt;/math&gt; we glue back in the cylinder &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{D}^1.&lt;/math&gt; There are two possible outcomes, depending on whether our glueing maps have the same or opposite orientation on the two boundary circles. If the orientations are the same (Fig. 2b), the resulting manifold is the [[torus]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1&lt;/math&gt; but if they are different, we obtain the [[Klein bottle]] (Fig. 2c).

==Morse functions==
Suppose that ''f'' is a [[Morse function]] on an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold, and suppose that ''c'' is a critical value with exactly one critical point in its preimage. If the index of this critical point is ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, then the level-set ''N'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε) is obtained from ''M'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;ε) by a ''p''-surgery. The inverse image ''W'' := ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;([''c''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;ε, ''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε]) defines a cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') that can be identified with the trace of this surgery.

===Geometry, and the connection with Morse theory and handlebodies===
Given a cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') there exists a smooth function ''f'' : ''W'' → [0, 1] such that ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(0) = ''M'', ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1) = ''N''.  By general position, one can assume ''f'' is Morse and such that all critical points occur in the interior of ''W''. In this setting ''f'' is called a Morse function on a cobordism. The cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') is a union of the traces of a sequence of surgeries on ''M'', one for each critical point of ''f''. The manifold ''W'' is obtained from ''M'' × [0, 1] by attaching one [[handle decomposition|handle]] for each critical point of ''f''.

[[File:Cobordism.svg|thumb|The 3-dimensional cobordism &lt;math&gt;W = \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{D}^2 - \mathbb{D}^3&lt;/math&gt; between the 2-[[sphere]] &lt;math&gt;M = \mathbb{S}^2&lt;/math&gt;  and the 2-[[torus]] &lt;math&gt;N = \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1,&lt;/math&gt; with ''N'' obtained from ''M'' by surgery on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^0 \times \mathbb{D}^2 \subset M,&lt;/math&gt;and ''W'' obtained from ''M'' × ''I'' by attaching a 1-handle &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^1 \times \mathbb{D}^2.&lt;/math&gt;]]
The Morse/Smale theorem states that for a Morse function on a cobordism, the flowlines of ''f''′ give rise to a [[handle decomposition|handle presentation]] of the triple (''W''; ''M'', ''N''). Conversely, given a handle decomposition of a cobordism, it comes from a suitable Morse function. In a suitably normalized setting this process gives a correspondence between handle decompositions and Morse functions on a cobordism.

==History==
Cobordism had its roots in the (failed) attempt by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1895 to define [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] purely in terms of manifolds {{harv|Dieudonné|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=m_X11mZaLocC&amp;pg=PA290 p. 289]}}. Poincaré simultaneously defined both homology and cobordism, which are not the same, in general. See [[#Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory|Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory]] for the relationship between bordism and homology.

Bordism was explicitly introduced by [[Lev Pontryagin]] in geometric work on manifolds. It came to prominence when [[René Thom]] showed that cobordism groups could be computed by means of [[homotopy theory]], via the [[Thom complex]] construction. Cobordism theory became part of the apparatus of [[extraordinary cohomology theory]], alongside [[K-theory]]. It performed an important role, historically speaking, in developments in topology in the 1950s and early 1960s, in particular in the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], and in the first proofs of the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]].

In the 1980s the category with compact manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms played a basic role in the Atiyah–Segal axioms for [[topological quantum field theory]], which is an important part of [[quantum topology]].

==Categorical aspects==
Cobordisms are objects of study in their own right, apart from cobordism classes. Cobordisms form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are closed manifolds and whose morphisms are cobordisms. Roughly speaking, composition is given by gluing together cobordisms end-to-end: the composition of (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') and (''W''′; ''N'', ''P'') is defined by gluing the right end of the first to the left end of the second, yielding (''W''′ ∪&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''; ''M'', ''P''). A cobordism is a kind of [[cospan]]:&lt;ref&gt;While every cobordism is a cospan, the category of cobordisms is ''not'' a "cospan category": it is not the category of all cospans in "the category of manifolds with inclusions on the boundary", but rather a subcategory thereof, as the requirement that ''M'' and ''N'' form a partition of the boundary of ''W'' is a global constraint.&lt;/ref&gt; ''M'' → ''W'' ← ''N''.  The category is a [[dagger compact category]].

A [[topological quantum field theory]] is a [[monoidal functor]] from a category of cobordisms to a category of [[vector space]]s. That is, it is a functor whose value on a disjoint union of manifolds is equivalent to the tensor product of its values on each of the constituent manifolds.

In low dimensions, the bordism question is relatively trivial, but the category of cobordism is not. For instance, the disk bounding the circle corresponds to a null-ary operation, while the cylinder corresponds to a 1-ary operation and the pair of pants to a binary operation.

==Unoriented cobordism==
{{details|List_of_cohomology_theories#Unoriented_cobordism}}

The set of cobordism classes of closed unoriented ''n''-dimensional manifolds is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_n&lt;/math&gt; (rather than the more systematic &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n^{\text{O}}&lt;/math&gt;); it is an [[abelian group]] with the disjoint union as operation. More specifically, if [''M''] and [''N''] denote the cobordism classes of the manifolds ''M'' and ''N'' respectively, we define &lt;math&gt;[M]+[N] = [M \sqcup N]&lt;/math&gt;; this is a well-defined operation which turns &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_n&lt;/math&gt; into an abelian group. The identity element of this group is the class &lt;math&gt;[\emptyset]&lt;/math&gt; consisting of all closed ''n''-manifolds which are boundaries.  Further we have &lt;math&gt;[M] + [M] = [\emptyset]&lt;/math&gt; for every ''M'' since &lt;math&gt;M\sqcup M=\partial (M\times [0,1])&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[GF(2)|field with two elements]]. The cartesian product of manifolds defines a multiplication &lt;math&gt;[M][N]=[M \times N],&lt;/math&gt; so

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_*=\bigoplus_{n \geqslant 0}\mathfrak{N}_n&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[graded algebra]], with the grading given by the dimension.

The cobordism class &lt;math&gt;[M] \in \mathfrak{N}_n&lt;/math&gt; of a closed unoriented ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'' is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney [[characteristic number]]s of ''M'', which depend on the stable isomorphism class of the [[tangent bundle]]. Thus if ''M'' has a stably trivial tangent bundle then &lt;math&gt;[M]=0 \in \mathfrak{N}_n&lt;/math&gt;. In 1954 [[René Thom]] proved

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}_*=\mathbb{F}_2 \left [x_i | i \geqslant 1, i \neq 2^j -1 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

the polynomial algebra with one generator &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in each dimension &lt;math&gt;i\neq 2^j-1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus two unoriented closed ''n''-dimensional manifolds ''M'',''N'' are cobordant, &lt;math&gt;[M]=[N] \in \mathfrak{N}_n,&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for each collection &lt;math&gt;(i_1,\cdots,i_k)&lt;/math&gt; of ''k''-tuples of integers &lt;math&gt;i \geqslant 1, i\neq 2^j-1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;i_1+\cdots+i_k=n&lt;/math&gt; the Stiefel-Whitney numbers are equal

:&lt;math&gt; \left  \langle w_{i_1}(M) \cdots w_{i_k}(M),[M] \right \rangle =  \left \langle w_{i_1}(N) \cdots w_{i_k}(N),[N] \right \rangle \in \mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;w_i(M) \in H^i(M;\mathbb{F}_2)&lt;/math&gt; the ''i''th [[Stiefel-Whitney class]] and &lt;math&gt;[M] \in H_n(M;\mathbb{F}_2)&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;-coefficient [[fundamental class]].

For even ''i'' it is possible to choose &lt;math&gt;x_i =[\mathbb{P}^i(\R)]&lt;/math&gt;, the cobordism class of the ''i''-dimensional [[real projective space]].

The low-dimensional unoriented cobordism groups are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathfrak{N}_0 &amp;=\Z/2, \\
\mathfrak{N}_1 &amp;=0, \\
\mathfrak{N}_2 &amp;=\Z/2, \\
\mathfrak{N}_3 &amp;=0, \\
\mathfrak{N}_4 &amp;=\Z/2 \oplus \Z/2, \\
\mathfrak{N}_5 &amp; =\Z/2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This shows, for example, that every 3-dimensional closed manifold is the boundary of a 4-manifold (with boundary).

The [[Euler characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;\chi(M) \in \Z&lt;/math&gt; of an unoriented manifold ''M'' is an unoriented cobordism invariant. This is implied by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_{\partial W} = \left  (1-(-1)^{\dim W} \right )\chi_W&lt;/math&gt;

for any compact manifold with boundary &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\chi: \mathfrak{N}_i \to \Z/2&lt;/math&gt; is a well-defined group homomorphism. For example, for any &lt;math&gt;i_1, \cdots, i_k \in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi \left (\mathbb{P}^{2i_1} (\R)\times \dots \times \mathbb{P}^{2i_k} (\R) \right ) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular such a product of real projective spaces is not null-cobordant. The mod 2 Euler characteristic map &lt;math&gt;\chi: \mathfrak{N}_{2i} \to \Z/2&lt;/math&gt; is onto for all &lt;math&gt;i \in\mathbb{N},&lt;/math&gt; and a group isomorphism for &lt;math&gt;i=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, because of &lt;math&gt;\chi(M\times N) =\chi(M)\chi(N)&lt;/math&gt;, these group homomorphism assemble into a homomorphism of graded algebras:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \mathfrak{N}\to\mathbb{F}_2[x] \\ {}[M] \mapsto \chi(M) x^{\dim(M)}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Cobordism of manifolds with additional structure==
Cobordism can also be defined for manifolds that have additional structure, notably an orientation. This is made formal in a general way using the notion of ''X''-structure (or [[G-structure]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Switzer | first1=Robert M. | title=Algebraic topology—homotopy and homology | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Classics in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-42750-6 | mr=1886843  | year=2002}}, chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; Very briefly, the [[normal bundle]] ν of an immersion of ''M'' into a sufficiently high-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^{n+k}&lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a map from ''M'' to the [[Grassmannian]], which in turn is a subspace of the [[classifying space]] of the [[orthogonal group]]: ν: ''M'' → '''Gr'''(''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k'') → ''BO''(''k''). Given a collection of spaces and maps ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt; with maps ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''BO''(''k'') (compatible with the inclusions ''BO''(''k'') → ''BO''(''k''+1), an ''X''-structure is a lift of ν to a map &lt;math&gt;\tilde \nu: M \to X_k&lt;/math&gt;. Considering only manifolds and cobordisms with ''X''-structure gives rise to a more general notion of cobordism. In particular, ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be given by ''BG''(''k''), where ''G''(''k'') → ''O''(''k'') is some group homomorphism. This is referred to as a [[G-structure]]. Examples include ''G'' = ''O'', the orthogonal group, giving back the unoriented cobordism, but also the subgroup [[special linear group|SO(''k'')]], giving rise to [[oriented cobordism]], the [[spin group]], the [[unitary group|unitary group ''U''(''k'')]], and the trivial group, giving rise to [[framed cobordism]].

The resulting cobordism groups are then defined analogously to the unoriented case. They are denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega^G_*&lt;/math&gt;.

===Oriented cobordism===
{{details|List_of_cohomology_theories#Oriented_cobordism}}
Oriented cobordism is the one of manifolds with an SO-structure. Equivalently, all manifolds need to be [[orientability|oriented]] and cobordisms (''W'', ''M'', ''N'') (also referred to as ''oriented cobordisms'' for clarity) are such that the boundary (with the induced orientations) is &lt;math&gt;M \sqcup (-N)&lt;/math&gt;, where −''N'' denotes ''N'' with the reversed orientation. For example, boundary of the cylinder ''M'' × ''I'' is &lt;math&gt;M \sqcup (-M)&lt;/math&gt;: both ends have opposite orientations. It is also the correct definition in the sense of [[extraordinary cohomology theory]].

Unlike in the unoriented cobordism group, where every element is two-torsion, 2''M'' is not in general an oriented boundary, that is, 2[''M''] ≠ 0 belongs to &lt;math&gt;\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The oriented cobordism groups are given modulo torsion by

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}\otimes \Q =\Q \left [y_{4i}|i \geqslant 1 \right ],&lt;/math&gt;

the polynomial algebra generated by the oriented cobordism classes

:&lt;math&gt;y_{4i}=\left [\mathbb{P}^{2i}(\Complex) \right ] \in \Omega_{4i}^{\text{SO}}&lt;/math&gt;

of the [[complex projective space]]s (Thom, 1952). The oriented cobordism group &lt;math&gt;\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin [[characteristic number]]s (Wall, 1960). Two oriented manifolds are oriented cobordant if and only if their Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin numbers are the same.

The low-dimensional oriented cobordism groups are :

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\Omega_0^{\text{SO}} &amp;= \Z, \\
\Omega_1^{\text{SO}} &amp;= 0, \\
\Omega_2^{\text{SO}} &amp;= 0, \\
\Omega_3^{\text{SO}} &amp;= 0, \\
\Omega_4^{\text{SO}} &amp;= \Z, \\
\Omega_5^{\text{SO}} &amp;= \Z_2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Signature of a manifold|signature]] of an oriented 4''i''-dimensional manifold ''M'' is defined as the signature of the intersection form on &lt;math&gt;H^{2i}(M) \in \Z&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(M).&lt;/math&gt; It is an oriented cobordism invariant, which is expressed in terms of the Pontrjagin numbers by the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem]].

For example, for any ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ 1

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \left (\mathbb{P}^{2i_1}(\Complex) \times \cdots \times \mathbb{P}^{2i_k}(\Complex) \right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The signature map &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\Omega_{4i}^{\text{SO}} \to \Z&lt;/math&gt; is onto for all ''i'' ≥ 1, and an isomorphism for ''i'' = 1.

==Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory==
Every [[vector bundle]] theory (real, complex etc.) has an [[extraordinary cohomology theory]] called [[K-theory]]. Similarly, every cobordism theory Ω&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; has an [[extraordinary cohomology theory]], with homology ("bordism") groups &lt;math&gt;\Omega^G_n(X)&lt;/math&gt; and cohomology ("cobordism") groups &lt;math&gt;\Omega^n_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; for any space ''X''. The generalized homology groups &lt;math&gt;\Omega_*^G(X)&lt;/math&gt; are [[Covariance|covariant]] in ''X'', and the generalized cohomology groups &lt;math&gt;\Omega^*_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] in ''X''. The cobordism groups defined above are, from this point of view, the homology groups of a point: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_n^G = \Omega_n^G(\text{pt})&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega^G_n(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the group of ''bordism'' classes of pairs (''M'', ''f'') with ''M'' a closed ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'' (with G-structure) and ''f'' : ''M'' → ''X'' a map. Such pairs (''M'', ''f''), (''N'', ''g'') are ''bordant'' if there exists a G-cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') with a map ''h'' : ''W'' → ''X'', which restricts to ''f'' on ''M'', and to ''g'' on ''N''.

An ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'' has a [[Homology (mathematics)|fundamental homology class]] [''M''] ∈ ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''M'') (with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\Z/2&lt;/math&gt; in general, and in &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; in the oriented case), defining a natural transformation

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\Omega^G_n(X) \to H_n(X) \\
(M,f) \mapsto f_*[M]
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which is far from being an isomorphism in general.

The bordism and cobordism theories of a space satisfy the [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]] apart from the dimension axiom.  This does not mean that the groups &lt;math&gt;\Omega^n_G(X)&lt;/math&gt;  can be effectively computed once one knows the cobordism theory of a point and the homology of the space ''X'', though the [[Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] gives a starting point for calculations. The computation is only easy if the particular cobordism theory [[#Cobordism_as_an_extraordinary_cohomology_theory|reduces to a product of ordinary homology theories]], in which case the bordism groups are the ordinary homology groups

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^G_n(X)=\sum_{p+q=n}H_p(X;\Omega^G_q(\text{pt})).&lt;/math&gt;

This is true for unoriented cobordism. Other cobordism theories do not reduce to ordinary homology in this way, notably [[Pontrjagin–Thom construction#Framed cobordism|framed cobordism]], oriented cobordism  and [[complex cobordism]].  The last-named theory in particular is much used by algebraic topologists as a computational tool (e.g., for the [[homotopy groups of spheres]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |first=D.C.  |last=Ravenel |title=Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres |publisher=Academic Press |date=April 1986 |isbn=0-12-583430-6 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobordism theories are represented by [[Thom spectrum|Thom spectra]] ''MG'': given a group ''G'', the Thom spectrum is composed from the [[Thom space]]s ''MG&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the [[tautological bundle|standard vector bundles]] over the [[classifying space]]s ''BG&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Note that even for similar groups, Thom spectra can be very different: ''MSO'' and ''MO'' are very different, reflecting the difference between oriented and unoriented cobordism.

From the point of view of spectra, unoriented cobordism is a product of [[Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg–MacLane spectra]] – ''MO'' = ''H''(π&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;(''MO'')) – while oriented cobordism is a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spectra rationally, and at 2, but not at odd primes: the oriented cobordism spectrum ''MSO'' is rather more complicated than ''MO''.

The '''constant factor rule in integration''' is a dual of the [[constant factor rule in differentiation]], and is a consequence of the [[linearity of integration]].  It states that a constant factor within an [[integrand]] can be separated from the integrand and instead multiplied by the integral.  For example, where k is a constant:

&lt;math&gt;\int k \frac{dy}{dx} dx = k \int \frac{dy}{dx} dx. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==
Start by noticing that, from the definition of [[integral|integration]] as the [[Inverse function|inverse]] process of [[derivative|differentiation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;y = \int \frac{dy}{dx} dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Now [[product (mathematics)|multiply]] both sides by a [[Coefficient|constant]] ''k''. Since ''k'' is a constant it is [[not dependent on]] ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;ky = k \int \frac{dy}{dx} dx. \quad \mbox{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Take the [[constant factor rule in differentiation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left(ky\right)}{dx} = k \frac{dy}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[integral|Integrate]] with respect to ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;ky = \int k \frac{dy}{dx} dx. \quad \mbox{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now from (1) and (2) we have:

:&lt;math&gt;ky = k \int \frac{dy}{dx} dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ky = \int k \frac{dy}{dx} dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\int k \frac{dy}{dx} dx = k \int \frac{dy}{dx} dx. \quad \mbox{(3)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now make a new differentiable [[function (mathematics)|function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{dy}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Substitution property of equality|Substitute]] in (3):

:&lt;math&gt;\int ku dx = k \int u dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can re-substitute ''y'' for something different from what it was originally:

:&lt;math&gt;y = u. \,&lt;/math&gt;

So:

:&lt;math&gt;\int ky dx = k \int y dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the constant factor rule in integration.

A [[special case]] of this, with ''k''=-1, yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\int -y dx = -\int y dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Convergence is a phenomenon in evolutionary computation. It causes evolution to halt because precisely every individual in the population is identical. Full convergence might be seen in [[genetic algorithms]] (a type of evolutionary computation) using only [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] (a way of combining individuals to make new offspring). Premature convergence is when a population has converged to a single solution, but that solution is not as high of quality as expected, i.e. the population has gotten 'stuck'. However, convergence is not necessarily a negative thing, because populations often stabilise after a time, in the sense that the best programs all have a common ancestor and their behaviour is very similar (or identical) both to each other and to that of high fitness programs from the previous generations. Often the term ''convergence'' is loosely used. Convergence can be avoided with a variety of diversity-generating techniques.

'''Dexter''' and '''sinister''' are terms used in [[heraldry]] to refer to specific locations in an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] bearing a [[coat of arms]], and to the other elements of an [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]]. "Dexter" (Latin for "right")&lt;ref name="cawley"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cawley | first = Kevin | authorlink = |author2=Florin Neumann |author3=Matt Neuberg |author4=Lynn Nelson  | title = Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid | publisher = [[University of Notre Dame]] Archives |date=2012 | url = http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=dext&amp;ending=er | accessdate = 2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; means to the right from the viewpoint of the bearer of the shield, ''i.e.'' the bearer's [[proper right]], to the left from that of the viewer.

[[Image:Bend Sinister demo.svg|thumb|200px|''Argent a '''bend sinister''' gules''. The bend sinister extends upward to the sinister corner and generally denotes [[wikt:bastardy|bastardy]]. Usually the bend extends upward to the dexter corner of a shield.]]

==Significance==
The dexter side is considered the side of greater [[honour]], for example when [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] two arms. Thus, by tradition, a husband's arms occupy the dexter half of his shield, his wife's paternal arms the sinister half. The shield of a bishop shows the arms of his [[Episcopal see|see]] in the dexter half, his personal arms in the sinister half. King [[Richard II]] adopted arms showing the attributed arms of [[Edward the Confessor]] in the dexter half, the [[royal arms of England]] in the sinister. More generally, by ancient tradition, the guest of greatest honour at a banquet sits at the right hand of the host. The [[Bible]] is replete with passages referring to being at the "right hand" of God.

Sinister is used to mark that an ordinary or other charge is turned to the heraldic left of the shield. A ''[[bend (heraldry)|bend]] sinister'' is a bend which runs from the bearer's top left to bottom right, as opposed to top right to bottom left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Friar|editor1-first= Stephen|editor1-link= Stephen Friar|page=58|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|date=1987|location=London|publisher= Alphabooks Ltd./[[A &amp; C Black|A &amp; C Black Plc]]|isbn=0 906670 44 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the shield would have been carried with the design facing outwards from the bearer, the bend sinister would slant in the same direction as a sash worn diagonally on the left shoulder.

This division is key to [[dimidiation]], a method of joining two coats of arms by placing the dexter half of one coat of arms alongside the sinister half of the other. In the case of marriage, the dexter half of the husband's arms would be placed alongside the sinister half of the wife's. The practice fell out of use as early as the 14th century and was replaced by [[impalement (heraldry)|impalement]], as in some cases, it could render the arms that are cut in half unrecognizable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=118|last1=Woodcock|first1=Thomas|author-link1=Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|last2=Robinson|first2=John Martin|author-link2=John Martin Robinson|title=The Oxford Guide to Heraldry|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1988|isbn=0-19-211658-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E1mAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=unrecognizable}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases, it would result in a shield that looked like one coat of arms rather than a combination of two.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The [[Great Seal of the United States]] features an eagle clutching an [[olive branch]] in its dexter talon and arrows in its sinister talon, indicating the nation's intended inclination to peace. In 1945, one of the changes ordered for the similarly arranged [[Flag of the President of the United States]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] was having the eagle face towards its right (dexter, the direction of honor) and thus towards the olive branch.&lt;ref&gt;Truman issued {{EO|9646}} on October 25, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheEagleAndTheShield/The%20Eagle%20and%20the%20Shield#page/n495/mode/2up|title=The Eagle and the Shield: A History of the Great Seal of the United States|last=Patterson|first=Richard Sharpe|last2=Dougall|first2=Richardson|publisher= Washington : Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Dept. of State : for sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. Govt.

==Origin==
The sides of a [[shield]] were originally named for the purpose of military training of knights and soldiers long before heraldry came into use early in the 13th century so the only viewpoint that was relevant was the bearer's. The front of the purely-functional shield was originally undecorated.

It is likely that the use of the shield as a defensive and offensive weapon was almost as developed as that of the sword itself and so the various positions or strokes of the shield needed to be described to students of arms. Such usage may indeed have descended directly from Roman training techniques that were spread throughout Roman Europe and then continued during the age of [[chivalry]], when heraldry came into use.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32312">{{about|the classical approach to Green's functions|a modern discussion|fundamental solution}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''Green's function''' is the [[impulse response]] of an [[inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation|inhomogeneous]] linear [[differential equation]] defined on a domain, with specified initial conditions or boundary conditions.

Through the [[superposition principle]] for [[linear operator]] problems, the [[convolution]] of a Green's function with an arbitrary function {{math|''f'' (''x'')}} on that domain is the solution to the inhomogeneous differential equation for  {{math|''f'' (''x'')}}.
In other words, given a [[linear differential equation|linear ordinary differential equation]] (ODE), ''L''(solution) = source, one can first solve {{math|''L''(green) {{=}} ''δ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, for each {{mvar|s}}, and realizing that, since the source is a sum of [[delta function]]s, the solution is a sum of Green's functions as well, by linearity of {{mvar|L}}.

Green's functions are named after the British [[mathematician]] [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]], who first developed the concept in the 1830s. In the modern study of linear [[partial differential equation]]s, Green's functions are studied largely from the point of view of [[fundamental solution]]s instead.

Under [[Green's function (many-body theory)|many-body theory]], the term is also used in [[physics]], specifically in [[quantum field theory]], [[aerodynamics]], [[aeroacoustics]], [[electrodynamics]], [[seismology]] and [[statistical field theory]], to refer to various types of [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]], even those that do not fit the mathematical definition. In quantum field theory, Green's functions take the roles of [[propagator]]s.

==Definition and uses==
A Green's function, {{math|''G''(''x,s'')}}, of a [[linear differential operator]]  {{math|''L'' {{=}} ''L''(''x'')}} acting on [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] over a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, at a point  {{math|''s''}}, is any solution of
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;LG(x,s)=\delta(s-x),&lt;/math&gt;|3=(1)|RawN=.}}
where  {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. This property of a Green's function can be exploited to solve differential equations of the form
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;|3=(2)|RawN=.}}

If the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] of  {{math|''L''}} is non-trivial, then the Green's function is not unique. However, in practice, some combination of [[symmetry]], [[boundary condition]]s and/or other externally imposed criteria will give a unique Green's function. 
Green's functions may be categorized, by the type of boundary conditions satisfied, by a [[Green's function number]].
Also, Green's functions in general are [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], not necessarily [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of a real variable.

Green's functions are also useful tools in solving [[wave equation]]s and [[diffusion equation]]s. In [[quantum mechanics]], the Green's function of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] is a key concept with important links to the concept of [[density of states]].

As a side note, the Green's function as used in physics is usually defined with the opposite sign, instead,  that is,
:&lt;math&gt;LG(x,s)=\delta(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;
This definition does not significantly change any of the properties of the Green's function.

If the operator is [[translation invariant]], that is, when  {{math|''L''}}   has [[constant coefficients]] with respect to  {{math|''x''}}, then the Green's function can be taken to be a [[convolution operator]], that is,
:&lt;math&gt;G(x,s)=G(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the Green's function is the same as the impulse response of [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system theory]].

==Motivation==
{{See also |Spectral theory}}
Loosely speaking, if such a function {{mvar|G}}  can be found for the operator {{mvar|L}}, then, if we multiply the equation (1) for the Green's function by {{math|''f'' (''s'')}}, and then integrate with respect to {{mvar|s}}, we obtain,
:&lt;math&gt;\int L G(x,s)f(s) \, ds = \int \delta(x-s)f(s) \, ds = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side is now given by the equation (2) to be equal to {{math|''L'' ''u''(''x'')}}, thus
:&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=\int LG(x,s) f(s) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the operator &lt;math&gt;L = L(x)&lt;/math&gt; is linear and acts on the variable {{mvar|x}} alone (not on the variable of integration {{mvar|s}}), one may take the operator {{mvar|L}} outside of the integration on the right-hand side, yielding
:&lt;math&gt;Lu(x)=L\left(\int G(x,s) f(s) \,ds\right),&lt;/math&gt;
which suggests
{{NumBlk|1=::|2=&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int G(x,s) f(s) \,ds.&lt;/math&gt;|3=(3)|RawN=.}}

Thus, one may obtain the function  {{math| ''u''(''x'')}}  through knowledge of the Green's function in equation (1) and the source term on the right-hand side in equation (2). This process relies upon the linearity of the operator {{mvar|L}}.

In other words, the solution of equation (2),  {{math| ''u''(''x'')}}, can be determined by the integration given in equation (3). Although {{math|''f'' (''x'')}}  is known, this integration cannot be performed unless {{mvar|G}} is also known. The problem now lies in finding the Green's function  {{mvar|G}}  that satisfies equation (1). For this reason, the Green's function is also sometimes called the [[fundamental solution]] associated to the operator  {{mvar|L}}.

Not every operator  {{mvar|L}} admits a Green's function. A Green's function can also be thought of as a [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverse]] of  {{mvar|L}}.  Aside from the difficulties of finding a Green's function for a particular operator, the integral in equation (3) may be quite difficult to evaluate. However the method gives a theoretically exact result.

This can be thought of as an expansion of  {{mvar|f}}  according to a [[Dirac delta function]] basis (projecting  {{mvar|f}} over {{math| ''δ''(''x−s'')}}); and a superposition of the solution on each [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]. Such an integral equation is known as a [[Fredholm integral equation]], the study of which constitutes [[Fredholm theory]].

==Green's functions for solving inhomogeneous boundary value problems==
The primary use of Green's functions in mathematics is to solve non-homogeneous [[boundary value problem]]s.  In modern [[theoretical physics]], Green's functions are also usually used as [[propagator]]s in [[Feynman diagram]]s;  the term ''Green's function'' is often further used for any [[correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation function]].

===Framework===
Let {{math|''L''}} be the [[Sturm–Liouville theory|Sturm–Liouville]] operator, a linear differential operator of the form
:&lt;math&gt;L=\dfrac{d}{dx}\left[p(x) \dfrac{d}{dx}\right]+q(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and let  {{math|''D''}} be the [[boundary condition]]s operator
:&lt;math&gt;Du= \begin{cases}
 \alpha_1 u'(0)+\beta_1 u(0) \\
 \alpha_2 u'(l)+\beta_2 u(l) ~.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Let  {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be a [[continuous function]] in [0, {{math|''l''}}].  Further suppose that the problem
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 Lu &amp;= f \\
 Du &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
is regular, i.e., only the [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] solution exists for the [[homogenization (mathematics)|homogeneous]] problem.

===Theorem===
There is one and only one solution  {{math|''u''(''x'')}} that satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 Lu &amp; = f\\
 Du &amp; = 0,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is given by
:&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int_0^\ell f(s) G(x,s) \, ds~,&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{math|''G''(''x'',''s'')}} is a Green's function satisfying the following conditions:
# &lt;math&gt;G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;x \ne s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L G(x, s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# For &lt;math&gt;s \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D G(x, s)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# [[Derivative]] "jump": &lt;math&gt;G'(s_{+0}, s)-G'(s_{-0}, s)=1 / p(s)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Symmetry: &lt;math&gt;G(x,s) = G(s, x)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Advanced and special Green's functions===
{{See also|Green's function (many-body theory)|propagator}}Sometimes the Green's function can be split into a sum of two functions. One with the variable positive (+) and the other with the variable negative (-). These are the advanced and special Green's functions, and when the equation under study depends on time, one of the parts is [[causal]] and the other anti-causal. In these problems usually the causal part is the important one.

==Finding Green's functions==

===Units===
While it doesn't uniquely fix the form the Green's function will take, performing a [[dimensional analysis]] to find the units a Green's function must have is an important sanity check on any Green's function found through other means. A quick examination of the defining equation,
:&lt;math&gt; L G(x, s) = \delta(x - s), &lt;/math&gt;
shows that the units &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; depend not only on the units of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; but also on the number and units of the space of which the position vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are elements. This leads to the relationship:
:&lt;math&gt; [[G]] = [[L]]^{-1} [[\mathrm{d} x]]^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[[G]]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as, "the physical units of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;", and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[volume element]] of the space (or [[spacetime]]).

For example, if &lt;math&gt;L = \partial_t^2&lt;/math&gt; and time is the only variable then: 
:&lt;math&gt;[[L]] = [[\mathrm{time}]]^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[\operatorname{d} x]]  = [[\mathrm{time}]],\ \mathrm{and}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[G]] = [[\mathrm{time}]].&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;L = \square = \frac{1}{c^2}\partial_t^2-\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[d'Alembert operator]], and space has 3 dimensions then:
:&lt;math&gt;[[L]] = [[\mathrm{length}]]^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[\operatorname{d} x]] = [[\mathrm{time}]] [[\mathrm{length}]]^3,\ \mathrm{and}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[G]] = [[\mathrm{time}]]^{-1} [[\mathrm{length}]]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Eigenvalue expansions===
If a [[differential operator]]  {{math|''L''}} admits a set of [[eigenvectors]]  {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')}} (i.e., a set of functions   {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and scalars {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that  {{math|''LΨ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  = {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} ) that is complete, then it is possible to construct a Green's function from these eigenvectors and [[eigenvalues]].

"Complete" means that the set of functions { {{math|''Ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} } satisfies the following [[completeness relation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\delta(x-x')=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \Psi_n^\dagger(x) \Psi_n(x').&lt;/math&gt;

Then the following holds,

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation =  &lt;math&gt;G(x, x')=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \dfrac{\Psi_n^\dagger(x) \Psi_n(x')}{\lambda_n},&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
where &lt;math&gt;\dagger&lt;/math&gt; represents complex conjugation.

Applying the operator  {{math|''L''}} to each side of this equation results in the completeness relation, which was assumed.

The general study of the Green's function written in the above form, and its relationship to the [[function space]]s formed by the eigenvectors, is known as [[Fredholm theory]].

There are several other methods for finding Green's functions, including the [[method of images]], [[separation of variables]], and [[Laplace transforms]] (Cole 2011).

===Combining Green's functions===
If the differential operator &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;L=L_1 L_2&lt;/math&gt; then the Green's function of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed from the Green's functions for &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; G(x, s) = \int G_2(x, s_1)\, G_1(s_1, s) \operatorname{d} s_1. &lt;/math&gt;
The above identity follows immediately from taking &lt;math&gt;G(x, s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the representation of the right operator inverse of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, analogous to how for the [[Invertible matrix#Other properties|invertable linear operator]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;C= (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, is represented by its matrix elements &lt;math&gt;C_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;.

A further identity follows for differential operators that are scalar polynomials of the derivative, &lt;math&gt;L = P_N(\partial_x)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], combined with the fact that &lt;math&gt;\partial_x&lt;/math&gt; [[Commutative property|commutes with itself]], guarantees that the polynomial can be factored, putting &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in the form:
:&lt;math&gt; L = \prod_{i=1}^N (\partial_x - z_i),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; are the zeros of &lt;math&gt;P_N(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the [[Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;L G(x, s) = \delta(x - s)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; gives:
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{G}(k_x, k_s) = \frac{\delta(k_x - k_s)}{\prod_{i=1}^N (ik_x - z_i)}. &lt;/math&gt;
The fraction can then be split into a sum using a [[Partial fraction decomposition]] before Fourier transforming back to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; space. This process yields identities that relate integrals of Green's functions and sums of the same. For example, if &lt;math&gt;L = (\partial_x + \gamma) (\partial_x + \alpha)^2&lt;/math&gt; then one form for its Green's function is:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}G(x, s) &amp; = \frac{1}{(\alpha - \gamma)^2}\Theta(x-s) \operatorname{e}^{-\gamma(x-s)} - \frac{1}{(\alpha - \gamma)^2}\Theta(x-s) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s)} + \frac{1}{\gamma-\alpha} \Theta(x - s) \, (x - s) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s)} \\
&amp; = \int \Theta(x - s_1) (x - s_1) \operatorname{e}^{-\alpha(x-s_1)} \Theta(s_1 - s) \operatorname{e}^{-\gamma (s_1 - s)} \operatorname{d} s_1. \end{align}  &lt;/math&gt;
While the example presented is tractable analytically, it illustrates a process that works when the integral is not trivial (for example, when &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt; is the operator in the polynomial).

===Table of Green's functions=== 
The following table gives an overview of Green's functions of frequently appearing differential operators, where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \rho = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the  [[Heaviside step function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle J_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bessel function]], &lt;math&gt;\textstyle I_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[modified Bessel function of the first kind]], and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle K_\nu(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bessel function#Modified Bessel functions: I.CE.B1 .2C K.CE.B1|modified Bessel function of the second kind]].&lt;ref&gt;some examples taken from Schulz, Hermann: Physik mit Bleistift. Frankfurt am Main: Deutsch, 2001. {{ISBN|3-8171-1661-6}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Where time ({{math|''t''}}) appears in the first column, the advanced (causal) Green's function is listed.

==Green's functions for the Laplacian==
Green's functions for linear differential operators involving the [[Laplacian]] may be readily put to use using the second of [[Green's identities]].

To derive Green's theorem, begin with the [[divergence theorem]] (otherwise known as [[Gauss's theorem]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \nabla \cdot \vec A\ dV=\int_S \vec A \cdot d\hat\sigma ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\vec A=\phi\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\phi&lt;/math&gt; and substitute into Gauss' law.

Compute &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\vec A&lt;/math&gt; and apply the product rule for the ∇ operator,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \nabla\cdot\vec A &amp;=\nabla\cdot(\phi\nabla\psi \;-\; \psi\nabla\phi)\\
 &amp;=(\nabla\phi)\cdot(\nabla\psi) \;+\; \phi\nabla^2\psi \;-\; (\nabla\phi)\cdot(\nabla\psi) \;-\; \psi\nabla^2\phi\\
 &amp;=\phi\nabla^2\psi \;-\; \psi\nabla^2\phi ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the divergence theorem produces [[Green's theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V (\phi\nabla^2\psi-\psi\nabla^2\phi) dV=\int_S (\phi\nabla\psi-\psi\nabla\phi)\cdot d\hat\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that the linear differential operator {{mvar|L}} is the [[Laplacian]], ∇², and that there is a Green's function {{mvar|G}} for the Laplacian. The defining property of the Green's function still holds,
:&lt;math&gt;L G(x,x')=\nabla^2 G(x,x')=\delta(x-x').&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\psi=G&lt;/math&gt; in Green's second identity, see [[Green's identities]].  Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \left[ \phi(x') \delta(x-x')-G(x,x') {\nabla'}^2\phi(x')\right]\ d^3x' = \int_S \left[\phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')-G(x,x')\nabla'\phi(x')\right] \cdot d\hat\sigma'.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this expression, it is possible to solve [[Laplace's equation]] ∇²''φ(x)'' = 0 or [[Poisson's equation]]  ∇²''φ(x)'' =−''ρ(x)'', subject to either [[Neumann boundary condition|Neumann]] or [[Dirichlet boundary condition|Dirichlet]] boundary conditions. In other words, we can solve for  ''φ(x)'' everywhere inside a volume where either (1) the value of ''φ(x)'' is specified on the bounding surface of the volume (Dirichlet boundary conditions), or (2) the normal derivative of ''φ(x)''  is specified on the bounding surface (Neumann boundary conditions).

Suppose the problem is to solve for ''φ(x)'' inside the region. Then the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_V {\phi(x')\delta(x-x')\ d^3x'}&lt;/math&gt;
reduces to simply ''φ(x)'' due to the defining property of the [[Dirac delta function]] and we have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=-\int_V G(x,x') \rho(x')\ d^3x'+\int_S \left[\phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')-G(x,x')\nabla'\phi(x')\right] \cdot d\hat\sigma'.&lt;/math&gt;

This form expresses the well-known property of [[harmonic function]]s, that ''if the value or normal derivative is known on a bounding surface, then the value of the function inside the volume is known everywhere''.

In [[electrostatics]],  ''φ(x)'' is interpreted as the [[electric potential]],  ''ρ(x)'' as [[electric charge]] [[density]], and the normal derivative &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi(x')\cdot d\hat\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; as the normal component of the electric field.

If the problem is to solve a Dirichlet boundary value problem, the Green's function should be chosen such that ''G(x,x')''  vanishes when either ''x'' or ''x''′ is on the bounding surface. Thus only one of the two terms in the surface integral remains. If the problem is to solve a Neumann boundary value problem, the Green's function is chosen such that its normal derivative vanishes on the bounding surface, as it would seem to be the most logical choice. (See Jackson J.D. classical electrodynamics, page 39).  However, application of Gauss's theorem to the differential equation defining the Green's function yields
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \nabla' G(x,x') \cdot d\hat\sigma' = \int_V \nabla'^2 G(x,x') d^3x' = \int_V \delta (x-x') d^3x' = 1   ~,&lt;/math&gt;
meaning the normal derivative of ''G(x,x')''  cannot vanish on the surface, because it must integrate to 1 on the surface.  (Again, see Jackson J.D. classical electrodynamics, page 39 for this and the following argument).

The simplest form the normal derivative can take is that of a constant, namely 1/''S'', where ''S'' is the surface area of the surface.  
The surface term in the solution becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\int_S \phi(x')\nabla' G(x,x')\cdot d\hat\sigma' = \langle\phi\rangle_S &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi\rangle_S &lt;/math&gt; is the average value of the potential on the surface.  This number is not known in general, but is often unimportant, as the goal is often to obtain the electric field given by the gradient of the potential, rather than the potential itself.

With no boundary conditions, the Green's function for the Laplacian ([[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation]]) is
:&lt;math&gt;G(x,x')=-\dfrac{1}{4 \pi |x-x'|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Supposing that the bounding surface goes out to infinity and plugging in this expression for the Green's function  finally yields the standard expression for electric potential in terms of electric charge density as

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=\int_V \dfrac{\rho(x')}{4 \pi \varepsilon |x-x'|} \, d^3x' ~.&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example.''' Find the Green function for the following problem, whose [[Green's function number]] is X11:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Lu &amp; = u'' + k^2 u = f(x)\\
  u(0)&amp; = 0, \quad u\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2k}\right) = 0.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''First step:''' The Green's function for the linear operator at hand is defined as the solution to

:&lt;math&gt;g''(x,s) + k^2 g(x,s) = \delta(x-s).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x\ne s&lt;/math&gt;, then the delta function gives zero, and the general solution is

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)=c_1 \cos kx+c_2 \sin kx.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;g(0,s)=c_1 \cdot 1+c_2 \cdot 0=0, \quad c_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

 if &lt;math&gt;x &lt; s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s \ne \tfrac{\pi}{2k}&lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;x&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;x=\tfrac{\pi}{2k}&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;g\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2k},s\right) = c_3 \cdot 0+c_4 \cdot 1=0, \quad c_4 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of &lt;math&gt;g(0,s)=0&lt;/math&gt; is skipped for similar reasons.

To summarize the results thus far:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)= \begin{cases}
  c_2 \sin kx, &amp; \text{for }x&lt;s\\
  c_3 \cos kx, &amp; \text{for }s&lt;x
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Second step:''' The next task is to determine &lt;math&gt;c_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Ensuring continuity in the Green's function at &lt;math&gt;x=s&lt;/math&gt; implies

:&lt;math&gt;c_2 \sin ks=c_3 \cos ks&lt;/math&gt;

One can ensure proper discontinuity in the first derivative by integrating the defining differential equation from &lt;math&gt;x=s-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=s+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;c_3 \cdot \left(-k \sin ks\right)-c_2 \cdot \left( k \cos ks\right )=1&lt;/math&gt;

The two (dis)continuity equations can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_{3}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;c_2 = -\frac{\cos ks}{k}  \quad;\quad c_3 = -\frac{\sin ks}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

So the Green's function for this problem is:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x,s)=\begin{cases}
  -\frac{\cos ks}{k} \sin kx, &amp; x&lt;s\\
  -\frac{\sin ks}{k} \cos kx, &amp; s&lt;x
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Further examples==
* Let {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and let the subset be all of ℝ. Let  {{mvar|L}} be &lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}}/{\operatorname{d} x}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the [[Heaviside step function]] {{mvar|H}}({{mvar|x}}−{{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Green's function of  {{mvar|L}} at {{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Let  {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and let the subset be the quarter-plane {&lt;nowiki/&gt;{{math|(''x'', ''y'') : ''x'', ''y''}} ≥ 0} and  {{mvar|L}} be the [[Laplacian]]. Also, assume a [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] is imposed at  {{mvar|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and a [[Neumann boundary condition]] is imposed at  {{mvar|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Then the X10Y20 Green's function is

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G(x, y, x_0, y_0) =\dfrac{1}{2\pi} &amp;\left[\ln\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}-\ln\sqrt{(x+x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2} \right. \\
&amp;\left. + \ln\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y+y_0)^2}- \ln\sqrt{(x+x_0)^2+(y+y_0)^2}\right]
\end{align}    ~.&lt;/math&gt;

* Let &lt;math&gt; a &lt; x &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;, and all three are elements of the real numbers. Then, for any function from reals to reals, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative that is integrable over the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp; = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \frac{(x - a)^m}{m!} \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^m f}{\operatorname{d} x^m} \right]_{x=a} + \int_a^b \left[\frac{(x - s)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \Theta(x - s)\right] \left[ \frac{\operatorname{d}^n f}{\operatorname{d} x^n} \right]_{x=s} \operatorname{d}s 
\end{align} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

: The Green's function in the above equation, &lt;math&gt;G(x,s) = \frac{(x - s)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \Theta(x - s)&lt;/math&gt;, is not unique. How is the equation modified if &lt;math&gt;g(x-s)&lt;/math&gt; is added to &lt;math&gt;G(x,s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}^n g}{\operatorname{d} x^n} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt; (for example, &lt;math&gt;g(x) = -x/2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;)? Also, compare the above equation to the form of a [[Taylor series]] centered at &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics, the '''growth rate''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with respect to a symmetric [[generating set of a group|generating set]] describes the size of balls in the group.  Every element in the group can be written as a product of generators, and the growth rate counts the number of elements that can be written as a product of length ''n''.

==Definition==
Suppose ''G'' is a finitely generated group; and ''T'' is a finite ''symmetric'' set of [[Generating set of a group|generator]]s
(symmetric means that if &lt;math&gt; x \in T &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; x^{-1} \in T &lt;/math&gt;).
Any element &lt;math&gt; x \in G &lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a [[string (computer science)#Formal theory|word]] in the ''T''-alphabet

:&lt;math&gt; x = a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdots a_k \text{ where } a_i\in T. &lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider the subset of all elements of ''G'' which can be presented by such a word of length &amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(G,T) = \{x\in G \mid x = a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdots a_k \text{ where } a_i\in T \text{ and } k\le n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This set is just the [[Ball (mathematics)|closed ball]] of radius ''n'' in the [[word metric]] ''d'' on ''G'' with respect to the generating set ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(G,T) = \{x\in G \mid d(x, e)\le n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

More geometrically, &lt;math&gt;B_n(G,T)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of vertices in the [[Cayley graph]] with respect to ''T'' which are within distance ''n'' of the identity.

Given two nondecreasing positive functions ''a'' and ''b'' one can say that they are equivalent (&lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt;) if there is a constant ''C'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; a(n/ C) \leq b(n) \leq a(Cn),\, &lt;/math&gt;

for example &lt;math&gt; p^n\sim q^n &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; p,q&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Then the growth rate of the group ''G'' can be defined as the corresponding [[equivalence class]] of the function
:&lt;math&gt;\#(n)=|B_n(G,T)|, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;|B_n(G,T)|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of elements in the set &lt;math&gt;B_n(G,T)&lt;/math&gt;. Although the function &lt;math&gt;\#(n)&lt;/math&gt; depends on the set of generators ''T'' its rate of growth does not (see below) and therefore the rate of growth gives an invariant of a group.

The word metric ''d'' and therefore sets &lt;math&gt;B_n(G,T)&lt;/math&gt; depend on the generating set ''T''.  However, any two such metrics are [[Lipschitz continuity#Lipschitz continuity in metric spaces|''bilipschitz'']] [[equivalence class|''equivalent'']] in the following sense:  for finite symmetric generating sets ''E'', ''F'', there is a positive constant ''C'' such that
:&lt;math&gt; {1\over C} \ d_F(x,y) \leq d_E(x,y) \leq C \ d_F(x,y). &lt;/math&gt;
As an immediate corollary of this inequality we get that the growth rate does not depend on the choice of generating set.

==Polynomial and exponential growth==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hyperbolic geometry]] --&gt;

If

:&lt;math&gt;\#(n)\le C(n^k+1)&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;C,k&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; we say that ''G'' has a '''polynomial growth rate'''.
The infimum &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; of such ''k'''s is called the '''order of polynomial growth'''.
According to [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth|Gromov's theorem]], a group of polynomial growth is a [[virtually]] [[nilpotent group]], i.e. it has a [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] [[subgroup]] of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]].  In particular, the order of polynomial growth &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; has to be a [[natural numbers|natural number]] and in fact &lt;math&gt;\#(n)\sim n^{k_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\#(n)\ge a^n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; we say that ''G'' has an '''[[exponential growth]] rate'''.
Every [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] ''G'' has at most exponential growth, i.e. for some &lt;math&gt;b&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\#(n)\le b^n&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\#(n)&lt;/math&gt; grows [[Infra-exponential|more slowly than any exponential function]], ''G'' has a '''subexponential growth rate'''. Any such group is [[amenable group|amenable]].

==Examples==

* A [[free group]] with a finite rank ''k'' &gt; 1 has an exponential growth rate.
* A [[finite group]] has constant growth – polynomial growth of order 0 – and includes fundamental groups of manifolds whose universal cover is compact.
* If ''M'' is a closed negatively curved [[Riemannian manifold]] then its [[fundamental group]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(M)&lt;/math&gt; has exponential growth rate. [[John Milnor|Milnor]] proved this using the fact that the [[word metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(M)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry#Q|quasi-isometric]] to the [[Covering map|universal cover]] of ''M''.
* '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; has a polynomial growth rate of order ''d''.
* The [[discrete Heisenberg group]] ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a polynomial growth rate of order 4. This fact is a special case of the general theorem of [[Hyman Bass|Bass]] and [[Yves Guivarch|Guivarch]] that is discussed in the article on [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth|Gromov's theorem]].
* The [[lamplighter group]] has an exponential growth.  &lt;!-- This is a rare example of a solvable group with exponential growth.  --&gt;
* The existence of groups with '''intermediate growth''', i.e. subexponential but not polynomial was open for many years. It was asked by [[John Milnor|Milnor]] in 1968 and was finally answered in the positive by [[Rostislav Grigorchuk|Grigorchuk]] in 1984. There are still open questions in this area and a complete picture of which orders of growth are possible and which are not is missing.
* The [[triangle group]]s include infinitely many finite groups (the spherical ones, corresponding to sphere), three groups of quadratic growth (the Euclidean ones, corresponding to Euclidean plane), and infinitely many groups of exponential growth (the hyperbolic ones, corresponding to the hyperbolic plane).

'''Guarded logic''' is a [[choice set]] of [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] involved in choices, where outcomes are limited.

A simple example of guarded logic is as follows: if X is true, then Y, else Z can be expressed in dynamic logic as (X?;Y)∪(~X?;Z). This shows a guarded logical choice: if X holds, then X?;Y is equal to Y, and ~X?;Z is blocked, and a ∪block is also equal to Y. Hence, when X is true, the primary performer of the action can only take the Y branch, and when false the Z branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |title=Formal modeling and analysis of timed system |book-title=International Conference on Formal Modelling and Analysis of Timed Systems No4 |location=Paris, France |date=September 25–27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A real-world example is the idea of [[paradox]]: something cannot be both true and false. A guarded logical choice is one where any change in true affects all decisions made down the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nieuwenhuis | first = Robert | authorlink = |author2=Andrei Voronkov | title = Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Reasoning | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 88–89 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 3-540-42957-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the use of guarded logic there were two major terms used to interpret modal logic. [[Mathematical logic]] and [[database theory]] (Artificial Intelligence) were first-order predicate logic. Both terms found sub-classes of first-class logic and efficiently used in solvable languages which can be used for research. But neither could explain powerful fixed-point extensions to modal style logics.

Later [[Moshe Y. Vardi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vardi | first = Moshe | authorlink = | title = Reasoning about the Past with Two-Way Automata | publisher =  | year = 1998 | location = | pages =  | url = http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~ezolin/dl/bib/Reasoning_about_past_with_two-way_automata_(ICALP_1998).pdf | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; made a conjecture that a tree model would work for many modal style logics. The guarded fragment of first-order logic was first introduced by [[Hajnal Andréka]], [[István Németi]] and [[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] in their article Modal languages and bounded fragments of predicate logic. They successfully transferred key properties of description, modal, and temporal logic to predicate logic. It was found that the robust decidability of guarded logic could be generalized with a tree model property. The tree model can also be a strong indication that guarded logic extends modal framework which retains the basics of modal logics.

Modal logics are generally characterized by invariances under bisimulation. It also so happens that invariance under bisimulation is the root of tree model property which helps towards defining automata theory.

==Types of Guarded Logic==
Within Guarded Logic there exists numerous guarded objects. The first being guarded fragment which are first-order logic of modal logic. Guarded fragments generalize modal quantification through finding relative patterns of quantification. The syntax used to denote guarded fragment is '''GF'''. Another object is [[guarded fixed point logic]] denoted '''μGF''' naturally extends guarded fragment from fixed points of least to greatest. [[Guarded bisimulations]] are objects which when analyzing guarded logic. All relations in a slightly modified standard relational algebra with guarded bisimulation and first-order definable are known as ''guarded relational algebra''. This is denoted using '''GRA'''.

Along with first-order guarded logic objects, there are objects of second-order guarded logic. It is known as [[Guarded Second-Order Logic]] and denoted '''GSO'''. Similar to second-order logic, guarded second-order logic quantifies whose range over guarded relations restrict it semantically. This is different from second-order logic which the range is restricted over arbitrary relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://logic.rwth-aachen.de/pub/hirsch/hirsch.pdf|title= Guarded Logics: Algorithms and Bisimulation|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |pages= 26–48 |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of Guarded Logic==
Let '''B''' be a relational structure with universe ''B'' and vocabulary τ.

''i)'' A set X ⊆ B is ''guarded'' in '''B''' if there exists a ground atom α(b_1, ..., b_k) in '''B''' such that X = {b_1, ..., b_k}.

''ii)'' A τ-structure '''A''', in particular a substructure A ⊆ B, is ''guarded'' if its universe is a guarded set in ''A'' (in ''B'').

''iii)'' A tuple (b_1, ..., b_n) ∈ B^n is ''guarded'' in '''B''' if {b_1, ..., b_n} ⊆ X for some guarded set X ⊆ B.

''iv)'' A tuple (b_1, ..., b_k) ∈ B^k is a guarded list in '''B''' if its components are pairwise distinct and {b_1, ..., b_k} is a guarded set. The empty list is taken to be a guarded list.

''v)'' A relation X ⊆ B^n  is ''guarded'' if it only consists of guarded tuples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://logic.rwth-aachen.de/pub/hirsch/hirsch.pdf|title= Guarded Logics: Algorithms and Bisimulation|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |page= 25 |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guarded Bisimulation===

A ''guarded bisimulation'' between two τ-structures '''A''' and '''B''' is a non-empty set ''I'' of finite partial isomorphic ''f: X → Y'' from '''A''' to '''B''' such that the back and forth conditions are satisfied.

'''Back:'''  For every ''f: X → Y in ''I'' and for every guarded set ''Y` ⊆ B'', there exists a partial isomorphic ''g: X` → Y`'' in ''I'' such that ''f^-1'' and ''g^-1'' agree on ''Y ∩ Y`''.

'''Forth''' For every ''f: X → Y'' in ''I'' and for every guarded set ''X` ⊆ A'', there exists a partial isomorphic ''g: X` → Y`'' in ''I'' such that ''f'' and ''g'' agree on ''X ∩ X`''.

'''Ilan Sadeh''' (born June 1, 1953) is an Israeli IT theoretician, entrepreneur, and human rights activist. He holds the position of    Associate Professor of [[Computer science|Computer Science]]s and Mathematics at the [[University for Information Science and Technology "St. Paul The Apostole"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uist.edu.mk|title=Home - University of Information Science &amp; Technology "St. Paul the Aposle"|website=University of Information Science &amp; Technology "St. Paul the Aposle"|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130403003237/http://uist.edu.mk/?page_id=335]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ohrid]], [[Republic of Macedonia]].

==Biography==
===Background and activities===
Sadeh was the first {{citation needed|date=July 2017}} to claim publicly in the Israeli media that Israel has no right to be called the "heir" to [[Holocaust victims]] and no right to represent [[Holocaust survivors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/2.209/israel-has-no-right-to-be-called-heir-to-holocaust-victims-1.284535|title=Israel Has No Right to Be Called 'Heir' to Holocaust Victims|date=19 April 2010|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017|website=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, Zionist leaders have little cause for pride in their actions during the [[Second World War]] – Zionist financiers withheld funds, while the JDC refused to help save Europe's  Jewry, instead prioritizing the needs of the [[Yishuv]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

The situation in Israel brought Sadeh to the conclusion that the political system must be replaced. He entered politics and led a movement in behalf of Holocaust survivors. He published a few articles in Israeli newspapers and had a public impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/619/659.html|title=חדשות - בארץ - טור אורח nrg - אני מאשים|website=Nrg.co.il|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-56031-00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826002039/http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/003-D-56031-00.html |archivedate=2011-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadeh was elected a representative of that community and ran in the preliminary election of the Labour Party for the [[Knesset]], or Israeli Parliament (1996), but was not elected.   Following his activities, Sadeh was recently threatened and accused of being a traitor. Sadeh has taken libel action over the charges in Israeli Court (2011).

===Mathematical background and Sadeh's contribution===
*  The [[asymptotic equipartition property]] (AEP) or "[[Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem]]" is a general property of the output samples of a stochastic source and is the basis of [[Information Theory]]. It is fundamental to the concept of typical sequences used in theories of coding theory. AEP was first introduced by Shannon (1948), proved in weak convergence by McMillan (1953) and later refined to strong convergence by Breiman (1957, 1960).
*  Shannon Theorems are based on AEP. Shannon provided in 1959 the first source-compression coding theorems. But neither he nor his successors could present any algorithm that attains Shannon bound.
#  Only in 1990, Ornstein and Shields have proposed an algorithm that attains Shannon bound. They proved the convergence to Shannon bound known as "[[rate-distortion function]]". But their algorithm is far from being useful and assumes a-priori knowledge of source distribution.
*  In Sadeh's  Ph.D. research (1990–1992) he proposed a universal [[algorithm]] that attains Shannon bound. That is, it does not require a priori knowledge of source distribution and asymptotically has some computational advantages. The algorithm is a generalization and merging of Ornstein Shields Algorithm and Wiener Ziv Algorithm (1989).
*  When he tried to prove convergence to Shannon bound, known also as "Rate Distortion Function", he realized that he could not rely on AEP or Shannon McMillan Breiman Theory.
*  So in 1992, he presented and proved a new "Limit Theorem" and named it "Lossy AEP" or "Extended Shannon McMillan Breiman Theorem".
*  That means that the basis of "Information theory" has been extended and generalized.
*  From that moment he has had a lot of clashes with   Israeli  academs:   two of them submitted two very negative reviews to Math School in Tel Aviv University, stating that the Limit Theorem is wrong, and prevented the granting of his PhD in 1993 until 1996. Only after a long fight did he receive his PhD, almost three years after the submission of his dissertation!
* Sadeh applied for patents in Israel (1992) and USA (1993) and got Israeli and USA Patents.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=hFgDAAAAEBAJ|title=Methods and means for image and voice compression|website=Google.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  The Israeli American Clique influenced upon the systematic rejection of Sadeh's papers by IEEE.
*  His papers were accepted and published in various Mathematical Journals.
*  He has been invited and presented his results in a few conferences all over the world, including the IEEE Conference at [[Vancouver Canada]] 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors:.QT.Sadeh,I..QT.&amp;newsearch=partialPref|title=IEEE Xplore Search Results|website=Ieeexplore.ieee.org|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development activities==
Ilan Sadeh has had pioneering results in a few research and developments fields: "[[Smart camera]]," a long time before [[September 11]] events, and "[[Homeland Security]]" projects, New [[Video compression]],  military applications for [[surveillance]], seismic data processing and others.

Sadeh has established three start up companies: [[Meitav, Israel]] (1982), Visnet (1996)  and Vipeg (2000). He has been intensively involved in establishing and R&amp;D of new start-up companies, establishing the infrastructure, dealing with intellectual property issues, managing all activities, raising funding, coordinating consortium in EU [[FP5]] [[FP6]] programs.

However, being unable to compete with the "Fat Cat" companies, bureaucracy, civil industry and the military establishment in Israel, as well as with the European Companies that were promoting only [[MPEG4]], Sadeh could not raise government support nor get the support of the Israeli Army, temporarily left Israel in 2006 and moved to Macedonia in 2011.

==Scientific achievements==
* He found and proved important Limit Theorems which are extensions of "[[Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem]]" (1992). These are the fundamental theorems of Information Theory. He applied Compression Algorithms based on Approximate String Matching.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=253135&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications&amp;searchWithin=p_Authors:.QT.Sadeh,+I..QT.&amp;searchField=Search_All|title=On approximate string matching|first=I.|last=Sadeh|date=10 September 1993|pages=148–157|accessdate=10 September 2017|via=IEEE Xplore|doi=10.1109/DCC.1993.253135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He presented performance analysis based on [[large deviations theory]] (LDT) and presented the trade-off between compression rate, distortion level, and probability of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.mk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=WSxrZH0dEVsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=Large+Deviations+Theory+sadeh&amp;ots=pbj9y-0Hnr&amp;sig=Sw-73Yyqh-aG9HvVmlVNFsOSTuQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Large+Deviations+Theory+sadeh&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of the Conference on Control and Information 1995|first=Wong Wing|last=Shing|date=10 September 1995|publisher=Chinese University Press|accessdate=10 September 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* He proposed a new universal coding scheme ("Sadeh Algorithm") based on approximate string matching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.mk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=WSxrZH0dEVsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=approximate+string+matching+sadeh&amp;ots=pbj9y-0Jmr&amp;sig=I4ySY2YtbA3XdcsBupuIXCLFcwE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sadeh+al&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of the Conference on Control and Information 1995|first=Wong Wing|last=Shing|date=10 September 1995|publisher=Chinese University Press|accessdate=10 September 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiener Ziv Algorithm and Ornstein–Shields block-coding algorithm (1992).

An '''inexact differential equation''' is a [[differential equation]] of the form

: &lt;math&gt;M(x,y) \, dx+N(x,y) \, dy=0, \text{ where } \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} \ne \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}. &lt;/math&gt;

The solution to such equations came with the invention of the [[integrating factor]] by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoht.info/page/History+of+differential+equations|title=History of differential equations – Hmolpedia|website=www.eoht.info|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution method ==
In order to solve the equation, we need to transform it into an [[exact differential|exact differential equation]]. In order to do that, we need to find an [[integrating factor]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to multiply the equation by. We'll start with the equation itself.&lt;math&gt;M\,dx+N\,dy=0&lt;/math&gt;, so we get &lt;math&gt;\mu M\,dx+\mu N\,dy=0&lt;/math&gt;. We will require &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mu M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial\mu N}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;. We get &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial y}M+\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\mu=\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial x}N+\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\mu&lt;/math&gt;. After simplifying we get &lt;math&gt;M\mu_y-N\mu_x+(M_y-N_x)\mu=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since this is a [[partial differential equation]], it is mostly extremely hard to solve, however in most cases we will get either &lt;math&gt;\mu (x,y) =\mu (x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu (x,y) =\mu (y)&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we only need to find &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; with a [[first-order linear differential equation]] or a [[separable differential equation]], and as such either &lt;math&gt;\mu(y)=e^{-\int{\frac{M_y-N_x}{M} \, dy}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)=e^{\int{\frac{M_y-N_x} N \, dx}}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23243">In the mathematical field of [[representation theory]], a '''Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial''' &lt;math&gt;P_{y,w}(q)&lt;/math&gt; is a member of a family of [[integral polynomial]]s introduced by {{harvs|txt|author1-link=David Kazhdan|author2-link=George Lusztig| last1=Kazhdan|first1=David |last2=Lusztig|first2=George| year=1979}}. They are indexed by pairs of elements ''y'', ''w'' of a  [[Coxeter group]] ''W'', which can in particular be the [[Weyl group]] of a [[Lie group]].

== Motivation and history==
In the spring of 1978 Kazhdan and Lusztig were studying [[Springer correspondence|Springer representations]] of the Weyl group of an algebraic group on &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-adic cohomology groups related to unipotent conjugacy classes. They found a new construction of these representations over the complex numbers {{Harv|Kazhdan|Lusztig|1980a}}. The representation had two natural bases, and the transition matrix between these two bases is essentially given by the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials. The actual Kazhdan–Lusztig construction of their polynomials is more elementary. Kazhdan and Lusztig used this to construct a [[Polynomial basis|canonical basis]] in the [[Hecke algebra of a Coxeter group|Hecke algebra]] of the Coxeter group and its representations. 

In their first paper Kazhdan and Lusztig mentioned that their polynomials were related to the failure of local [[Poincaré duality]] for [[Schubert variety|Schubert varieties]]. In {{Harvtxt|Kazhdan|Lusztig|1980b}} they reinterpreted this in terms of the [[intersection cohomology]] of [[Mark Goresky]] and [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|Robert MacPherson]], and gave another definition of such a basis in terms of the dimensions of certain intersection cohomology groups.

The two bases for the Springer representation reminded Kazhdan and Lusztig of the two bases for the [[Grothendieck group]] of certain infinite dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras, given by [[Verma module]]s and [[simple module]]s. This analogy, and the work of [[Jens Carsten Jantzen]] and [[Anthony Joseph (mathematician)|Anthony Joseph]] relating [[primitive ideal]]s of [[Universal enveloping algebra|enveloping algebra]]s to representations of Weyl groups, led to the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures. 
&lt;!--
Nominally, you are right: they do mention Jantzen's and Joseph's work on p.168 of the Inventiones paper as "another starting point our  investigation". However, this is more relevant for Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures than for the polynomials. The true motivation appears in the previous two sentences, however, they may be a little too difficult to swallow. See the second KL paper, where they explain the relation to intersection cohomology, which had been introduced in 1977.

--- This can be moved to the section on Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures ---
They were motivated by Springer's work relating unipotent conjugacy classes and representations of Weyl groups, and by the work of J.C. Jantzen and A. Joseph relating primitive ideals of enveloping algebras to representations of Weyl groups. 
--&gt;

== Definition ==
Fix a Coxeter group ''W'' with generating set ''S'', and write &lt;math&gt;\ell(w)&lt;/math&gt; for the length of an element ''w'' (the smallest length of an expression for ''w'' as a product of elements of ''S'').  The [[Hecke algebra of a Coxeter group|Hecke algebra]] of ''W'' has a basis of elements &lt;math&gt;T_w&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;w\in W&lt;/math&gt; over the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[q^{1/2}, q^{-1/2}]&lt;/math&gt;, with multiplication defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_y T_w &amp;= T_{yw},  &amp;&amp; \mbox{if }\ell(yw) = \ell(y) + \ell(w) \\
(T_s + 1)(T_s - q) &amp;= 0, &amp;&amp; \mbox{if }s \in S.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The quadratic second relation implies that each generator {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is invertible in the Hecke algebra, with inverse {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. These inverses satisfy the relation {{math|(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; − ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) {{=}} 0}} (obtained by multiplying the quadratic relation for {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} by {{mvar|−T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), and also the [[braid relation]]s. From this it follows that the Hecke algebra has an automorphism ''D'' that sends ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; to ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt; and each {{mvar|T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} to ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. More generally one has &lt;math&gt;D(T_w)=T_{w^{-1}}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;; also ''D'' can be seen to be an involution.

The Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''yw''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') are indexed by a pair of elements ''y'', ''w'' of ''W'', and uniquely determined by the following properties. 
*They are 0 unless ''y'' ≤ ''w'' (in the [[Bruhat order]] of ''W''), 1 if ''y'' = ''w'', and for ''y'' &lt; ''w'' their degree is at most (''ℓ''(''w'') − ''ℓ''(''y'') − 1)/2.
*The elements
::&lt;math&gt;C'_w=q^{-\frac{\ell(w)}{2}}\sum_{y\le w} P_{y,w}T_y&lt;/math&gt;
:are invariant under the involution ''D'' of the Hecke algebra. The elements &lt;math&gt;C'_w&lt;/math&gt; form a basis of the Hecke algebra as a {{math|'''Z'''[''q''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]}}-module, called the Kazhdan–Lusztig basis.

To establish existence of the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials, Kazhdan and Lusztig gave a simple recursive procedure for computing the polynomials ''P&lt;sub&gt;yw&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') in terms of more elementary polynomials denoted ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''yw''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q''). defined by

:&lt;math&gt;T_{y^{-1}}^{-1} = \sum_xD(R_{x,y})q^{-\ell(x)}T_x.&lt;/math&gt;

They can be computed using the recursion relations

:&lt;math&gt;R_{x,y} =
\begin{cases}
  0,                          &amp; \mbox{if } x \not\le y                \\
  1,                          &amp; \mbox{if } x = y                      \\
  R_{sx,sy},                  &amp; \mbox{if } sx &lt; x \mbox{ and } sy &lt; y \\
  R_{xs,ys},                  &amp; \mbox{if } xs &lt; x \mbox{ and } ys &lt; y \\
  (q-1)R_{sx,y} + qR_{sx,sy}, &amp; \mbox{if } sx &gt; x \mbox{ and } sy &lt; y
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials can then be computed recursively using the relation

:&lt;math&gt;q^{\frac{1}{2}(\ell(w)-\ell(x))}D(P_{x,w}) - q^{\frac{1}{2}(\ell(x)-\ell(w))}P_{x,w} = \sum_{x&lt;y\le w}(-1)^{\ell(x)+\ell(y)}q^{\frac{1}{2}(-\ell(x)+2\ell(y)-\ell(w))}D(R_{x,y})P_{y,w}&lt;/math&gt;

using the fact that the two terms on the left are polynomials in ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt; without [[constant term]]s. These formulas are tiresome to use by hand for rank greater than about 3, but are well adapted for computers, and the only limit on computing Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials with them is that for large rank the number of such polynomials exceeds the storage capacity of computers.

==Examples==
*If ''y'' ≤ ''w'' then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y'',''w''&lt;/sub&gt; has constant term 1. 
*If ''y'' ≤ ''w'' and {{math|''ℓ''(''w'') − ''ℓ''(''y'') ∈ {0, 1, 2} }} then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y'',''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.
*If ''w'' = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[longest element of a Coxeter group|longest element of a finite Coxeter group]] then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y'',''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 for all ''y''.
*If ''W'' is the Coxeter group ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (or more generally any Coxeter group of rank at most 2)  then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y'',''w''&lt;/sub&gt; is 1 if ''y''≤''w'' and 0 otherwise.
*If ''W'' is the Coxeter group ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with generating set ''S'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} with ''a'' and ''c'' commuting then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''b'',''bacb''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 + ''q''  and  ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''ac'',''acbca''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 + ''q'', giving examples of non-constant polynomials.
*The simple values of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials for low rank groups are not typical of higher rank groups. For example, for the split form of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; the [http://www.liegroups.org/kle8.html most complicated Lusztig–Vogan polynomial] (a variation of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials: see below) is
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
152 q^{22} &amp;+ 3,472 q^{21} + 38,791 q^{20} + 293,021 q^{19} + 1,370,892 q^{18} + 4,067,059 q^{17} + 7,964,012 q^{16}\\
&amp;+ 11,159,003 q^{15} + 11,808,808 q^{14} + 9,859,915 q^{13} + 6,778,956 q^{12} + 3,964,369 q^{11} + 2,015,441 q^{10}\\
&amp;+ 906,567 q^9 + 363,611 q^8 + 129,820 q^7 + 41,239 q^6 + 11,426 q^5 + 2,677 q^4 + 492 q^3 + 61 q^2 + 3 q
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
*{{harvtxt|Polo|1999}} showed that any polynomial with constant term 1 and non-negative integer coefficients is the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial for some pair of elements of some symmetric group.

==Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures==
The Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials arise as transition coefficients between their canonical basis and the natural basis of the Hecke algebra. The ''Inventiones'' paper also put forth two equivalent conjectures, known now as Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures, which related the values of their polynomials at 1 with representations of complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s and [[semisimple Lie algebra|Lie algebras]], addressing a long-standing problem in representation theory. 

Let ''W'' be a finite [[Weyl group]]. For each w ∈ ''W'' denote by {{mvar|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the [[Verma module]] of highest weight {{math|−''w''(''ρ'') − ''ρ''}} where ρ is the half-sum of positive roots (or [[Weyl vector]]), and let {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;}} be its irreducible quotient, the [[simple highest weight module]] of highest weight {{math|−''w''(''ρ'') − ''ρ''}}. Both {{mvar|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;}} are locally-finite weight modules over the complex semisimple Lie algebra ''g'' with the Weyl group ''W'', and therefore admit an [[algebraic character]]. Let us  write ch(''X'') for the character of a ''g''-module ''X''. The Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures state:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}(L_w)=\sum_{y\le w}(-1)^{\ell(w)-\ell(y)}P_{y,w}(1)\operatorname{ch}(M_y)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}(M_w)=\sum_{y\le w}P_{w_0w,w_0y}(1)\operatorname{ch}(L_y)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the element of maximal length of the Weyl group.

These conjectures were proved independently by {{harvs|txt|author1-link=Alexander Beilinson|author2-link=Joseph Bernstein|last1=Beilinson|first1=Alexander|last2=Bernstein|first2=Joseph|year=1981}} and by {{harvs|txt|author1-link=Jean-Luc Brylinski|author2-link=Masaki Kashiwara|last1=Brylinski|first1=Jean-Luc|last2=Kashiwara|first2=Masaki|year=1981}}. The methods introduced in the course of the proof have guided development of representation theory throughout the 1980s and 1990s, under the name ''geometric representation theory''.

=== Remarks ===
1. The two conjectures are known to be equivalent. Moreover, [[Borho–Jantzen's translation principle]] implies that {{math|''w''(''ρ'') − ''ρ''}} can be replaced by {{math|''w''(''λ'' + ''ρ'') − ''ρ''}} for any dominant integral weight {{mvar|λ}}. Thus, the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures describe the Jordan–Hölder multiplicities of Verma modules in any regular integral block of Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand [[category O]]. 

2. A similar interpretation of ''all'' coefficients of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials follows from the ''Jantzen conjecture'', which roughly says that individual coefficients of {{mvar|P&lt;sub&gt;y,w&lt;/sub&gt;}} are multiplicities of {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}} in certain subquotient of the Verma module determined by a canonical filtration, the [[Jantzen filtration]]. The Jantzen conjecture in regular integral case was proved in a later paper of {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Alexander Beilinson|author2-link=Joseph Bernstein| last=Beilinson| last2=Bernstein|year=1993}}.

3. [[David Vogan]] showed as a consequence of the conjectures that

:&lt;math&gt;P_{y,w}(q) = \sum_{i} q^i \dim(\operatorname{Ext}^{\ell(w)-\ell(y)-2i}(M_y,L_w))&lt;/math&gt;

and that {{math|Ext&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''L&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} vanishes if {{math|''j'' + ''ℓ''(''w'') + ''ℓ''(''y'')}} is odd, so the dimensions of all such [[Ext groups]] in category ''O'' are determined in terms of coefficients of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials. This result demonstrates that all coefficients of the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials of a finite Weyl group are non-negative integers. However, positivity for the case of a finite Weyl group ''W'' was already known from the interpretation of coefficients of the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials as the dimensions of intersection cohomology groups, irrespective of the conjectures. Conversely, the relation between Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials and the Ext groups theoretically can be used to prove the conjectures, although this approach to proving them turned out to be more difficult to carry out.

4. Some special cases of the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures are easy to verify. For example, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the antidominant Verma module, which is known to be simple. This means that ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, establishing the second conjecture for ''w'' = 1, since the sum reduces to a single term. On the other hand, the first conjecture for ''w'' = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; follows from the [[Weyl character formula]] and the formula for the [[algebraic character|character of a Verma module]], together with the fact that all Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials &lt;math&gt;P_{y,w_0}&lt;/math&gt; are equal to 1.

5. Kashiwara (1990) proved a generalization of the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures to symmetrizable [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s.

==Relation to intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties==
By the [[Bruhat decomposition]] the space ''G''/''B'' of the algebraic group ''G'' with Weyl group ''W'' is a disjoint union of affine spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; parameterized by elements ''w'' of ''W''. The closures of these spaces {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called [[Schubert varieties]], and Kazhdan and Lusztig, following a suggestion of Deligne, showed how to express Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials in terms of intersection cohomology groups of Schubert varieties.

More precisely, the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomial ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y'',''w''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') is equal to 
:&lt;math&gt;P_{y,w}(q) = \sum_iq^i\dim IH^{2i}_{X_y}(\overline{X_w})&lt;/math&gt;
where each term on the right means: take the complex IC of sheaves whose hyperhomology is the [[intersection homology]] of the [[Schubert variety]] of ''w'' (the closure of the cell {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;}}), take its cohomology of degree {{math|2''i''}}, and then take the dimension of the stalk of this sheaf at any point of the cell {{mvar|X&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}} whose closure is the Schubert variety of ''y''. The odd-dimensional cohomology groups do not appear in the sum because they are all zero.

This gave the first proof that all coefficients of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials for finite Weyl groups are non-negative integers.

== Generalization to real groups ==
'''Lusztig–Vogan polynomials''' (also called Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials or '''Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomials''') were introduced in {{Harvtxt|Lusztig|Vogan|1983}}. They are analogous to Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials, but are tailored to representations of ''real'' semisimple Lie groups, and play major role in the conjectural description of their [[unitary dual]]s. Their definition is more complicated, reflecting relative complexity of representations of real groups compared to complex groups.

The distinction, in the cases directly connection to representation theory, is explained on the level of [[double coset]]s; or in other terms of actions on analogues of complex [[flag manifold]]s ''G''/''B'' where ''G'' is a complex Lie group and ''B'' a [[Borel subgroup]]. The original (K-L) case is then about the details of decomposing 

:''B''\''G''/''B'',

a classical theme of the [[Bruhat decomposition]], and before that of [[Schubert cell]]s in a [[Grassmannian]]. The L-V case takes a [[real form]] {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}} of ''G'', a [[maximal compact subgroup]] {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}} in that [[semisimple group]] {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and makes the [[complexification]] ''K'' of {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then the relevant object of study is

:''K''\''G''/''B''.

In March 2007, it was announced that the [[E8 (mathematics)#External links|L-V polynomials had been calculated]] for the split form of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Generalization to other objects in representation theory ==
The second paper of Kazhdan and Lusztig established a geometric setting for definition of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials, namely, the [[algebraic geometry|geometry]] of singularities of Schubert varieties in the [[flag variety]]. Much of the later work of Lusztig explored analogues of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials in the context of other natural singular algebraic varieties arising in representation theory, in particular, closures of [[nilpotent orbit]]s and [[quiver varieties]]. It turned out that the representation theory of [[quantum groups]], [[modular Lie algebra]]s and [[affine Hecke algebra]]s are all tightly controlled by appropriate analogues of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials. They admit an elementary description, but the deeper properties of these polynomials necessary for representation theory follow from sophisticated techniques of modern algebraic geometry and [[homological algebra]], such as the use of [[intersection cohomology]], [[perverse sheaves]] and [[Beilinson–Bernstein–Deligne decomposition]]. 

The coefficients of the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials are conjectured to be the dimensions of some homomorphism spaces in Soergel's bimodule category. This is the only known positive interpretation of these coefficients for arbitrary Coxeter groups.

== Combinatorial theory ==
Combinatorial properties of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials and their generalizations are a topic of active current research. Given their significance in representation theory and algebraic geometry, attempts have been undertaken to develop the theory of Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials in purely combinatorial fashion, relying to some extent on geometry, but without reference to intersection cohomology and other advanced techniques. This has led to exciting developments in [[algebraic combinatorics]], such as ''pattern-avoidance phenomenon''. Some references are given in the textbook of {{Harvtxt|Björner|Brenti|2005}}. A research monograph on the subject is {{Harvtxt|Billey|Lakshmibai|2000}}.

{{As of|2005}}, there is no known combinatorial interpretation of all the coefficients of the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials (as the cardinalities of some natural sets) even for the symmetric groups, though explicit formulas exist in many special cases.

Kollros, the son of a baker, was from 1896 as a student of mathematics and physics at the [[ETH Zurich|Zurich Polytechnikum]], where he was a fellow student of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Marcel Grossmann]].&lt;ref&gt;At that time there were parallel lectures in German and French. Kollros attended only the French lectures, as he mentions in his reminiscences published (in connection with a celebration held in Bern) for the 50th anniversary in 1955 of the theory of special relativity. Louis Kollros: ''Albert Einstein en Suisse: Souvenirs.'' In: ''Helvetica Physica Acta.'' Supplementum 4, 1956, pp. 271-281, and as a German translation: ''Erinnerungen eines Kommilitonen.'' In: [[Carl Seelig]] (ed.): ''Helle Zeit – dunkle Zeit: In memoriam Albert Einstein.'' Europa Verlag, Zürich 1956, pp. 17–31 {{doi|10.1007/978-3-322-84225-1_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1900, Kollros taught mathematics from 1900 to 1909 in secondary school in his hometown  of La Chaux-de-Fonds. In 1903–1904 to 1909 he studied in Göttingen with [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[David Hilbert]]. From 1904 to 1909 Kollross was a ''privat-docent'' (lecturer) at the [[University of Neuchâtel]]. He received his doctorate in 1905 from the [[University of Zurich]] with thesis advisor Hermann Minkowski and thesis ''Un algorithme pour l'approximation simultaneé de deux grandeurs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=57094}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ETH Zurich, where Marcel Grossmann taught until 1927 in the same field, Kollross held from 1909 to 1948 the francophone chair of ''géométrie descriptive et de géométrie euclidienne''.&lt;ref name=Stammbach/&gt;

In 1940–1941 he was president of the [[Swiss Mathematical Society]] and from 1958 an honorary member of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Members of the SMS|url=http://math.ch/members/honorary-members}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[Jakob Steiner|Steiner]]-[[Ludwig Schläfli|Schläfli]] committee (tasked with the publication of their works). In this role, he was co-editor of Schläfli's collected works (3 vols.,1950–1956).&lt;ref name=Stammbach/&gt;

He wrote biographies of [[Evariste Galois]] (1949, 24 p.) and Jakob Steiner (1947, 24 p.), which appeared in the supplements to the ''[[Elemente der Mathematik]]'' ([[Birkhäuser Verlag]]).&lt;ref name=Stammbach/&gt;

His doctoral students include [[Ferdinand Gonseth]].

'''Melvin Hochster''' (born August 2, 1943) is an eminent [[Americans|American]] [[mathematician]], regarded as one of the leading [[commutative algebra]]ists active today.  He is currently the Jack E. McLaughlin Distinguished University Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Michigan]].

Hochster attended [[Stuyvesant High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://173.8.135.113/Math1960.html |title=Stuyvesant Math Team, Spring 1960 |accessdate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529135548/http://173.8.135.113/Math1960.html |archivedate=2011-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was captain of the Math Team, and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Harvard University]].  While at Harvard, he was a [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Fellow]] in 1960.  He earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1967 from [[Princeton University]], where he wrote a dissertation under [[Goro Shimura]] characterizing the [[spectrum of a ring|prime spectra]] of [[commutative ring]]s.  He held positions at the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[Purdue University]] before joining the faculty at Michigan in 1977.  Hochster shared the 1980 [[Cole Prize]] with [[Michael Aschbacher]], received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1981, and has been a member of both the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 1992. In 2008, on the occasion of his 65th birthday, he was honored with a conference in Ann Arbor and with a special volume of the [[Michigan Mathematical Journal]].

Hochster's work is primarily in [[commutative algebra]], especially the study of [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s over [[local ring]]s.  He has established classic theorems concerning [[Cohen-Macaulay ring]]s, [[invariant theory]] and [[homological algebra]].  For example, the ''Hochster-Roberts'' theorem states that the [[invariant polynomial|invariant]] [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of a linearly [[reductive group]] acting on a [[regular ring]] is Cohen-Macaulay.  His best-known work is on the [[homological conjectures]], many of which he established for local rings containing a field, thanks to his proof of the existence of [[big Cohen-Macaulay modules]] and his technique of [[reduction to prime characteristic]].  His most recent work on [[tight closure]], introduced in 1986 with [[Craig Huneke]], has found unexpected applications throughout commutative algebra and [[algebraic geometry]].

Hochster has been recognized for his efforts in mentoring and popularizing mathematics through lectures and articles.  He has had more than 40 doctoral students, and the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] has pointed out his outstanding role in mentoring women students pursuing a career in mathematics. He is currently (since 2009) serving as the chair of the department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan.

Hochster's hobbies are [[cryptic crosswords]] and [[contract bridge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18034">In [[mathematics]], the '''Mohr–Mascheroni theorem''' states that any geometric construction that can be performed by a [[compass and straightedge]] can be performed by a compass alone.

It must be understood that by "any geometric construction", we are referring figures that contain no straight lines, as it is clearly impossible to draw a straight line without a straightedge. It is understood that a line is determined provided that two distinct points on that line are given or constructed, even though no visual representation of the line will be present. The theorem can be stated more precisely as,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Any Euclidean construction, insofar as the given and required elements are points, may be completed with the compass alone if it can be completed with both the compass and the straightedge together.''

Though the use of a straightedge can make a construction significantly easier, the theorem shows that any set of points that fully defines a constructed figure can be determined with compass alone, and the only reason to use a straightedge is for the aesthetics of seeing straight lines, which for the purposes of construction is functionally unnecessary.

== History ==
The result was originally published by [[Georg Mohr]] in 1672,&lt;ref&gt;Georg Mohr, ''[[Euclides Danicus]]'' (Amsterdam: Jacob van Velsen, 1672).&lt;/ref&gt; but his [[Mathematical proof|proof]] languished in obscurity until 1928.&lt;ref name=Eves199&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjelmslev, J. (1928) "Om et af den danske matematiker Georg Mohr udgivet skrift ''Euclides Danicus'', udkommet i Amsterdam i 1672" [Of a memoir ''Euclides Danicus'' published by the Danish mathematician Georg Mohr in 1672 in Amsterdam], ''Matematisk Tidsskrift''  B , pages 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schogt, J. H. (1938) "Om Georg Mohr's ''Euclides Danicus''," ''Matematisk Tidsskrift''  A , pages 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theorem was independently discovered by [[Lorenzo Mascheroni]] in 1797 and it was known as ''Mascheroni's Theorem'' until Mohr's work was rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Mascheroni, ''La Geometria del Compasso'' (Pavia: Pietro Galeazzi, 1797). [https://books.google.com/books?id=HTY4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 1901 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated by Mascheroni's result, in 1822 [[Jean Victor Poncelet]] conjectured a variation on the same theme. He proposed that any construction possible by straightedge and compass could be done with straightedge alone.  The one stipulation though is that a single circle with its center identified must be provided. The [[Poncelet-Steiner theorem]] was proved by [[Jakob Steiner]] eleven years later.

==Constructive proof approach==
To prove the theorem, each of the [[Compass-and-straightedge construction#The basic constructions|basic constructions of compass and straightedge]] need to be proven to be possible by using a compass alone, as these are the foundations of, or elementary steps for, all other constructions. These are:
#Creating the line through two existing points
#Creating the circle through one point with centre another point
#Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing, non-parallel lines
#Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect)
#Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect).

'''#1 - A line through two points'''

It is understood that a straight line cannot be drawn without a straightedge. A line is considered to be given by any two points, as any two points define a line uniquely, and a unique line can be defined by any two points on it.

'''#2 - A circle through one point with defined center'''

This can be done with compass alone quite naturally. There is nothing to prove.

'''#5 - Intersection of two circles'''

This construction can be done directly with a compass provided the centers and radii of the two circles are known. Due to the compass-only construction of the center of a circle (given below), it can always be assumed that any circle is described by its center and radius. Indeed, some authors include this in their descriptions of the basic constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunger784&gt;{{harvnb|Hungerbühler|1994|loc=p. 784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=p.122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''#3, #4 - The other constructions'''

Thus, to prove the theorem, there only compass-only constructions for #3 and #4 need to be given.

=== Alternative proofs ===
Several proofs of the result are known. Mascheroni's proof of 1797 was generally based on the idea of using reflection in a line as the major tool. Mohr's solution was different.&lt;ref name=Eves199 /&gt; In 1890, August Adler published a proof using the [[Inversion in a circle|inversion transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An algebraic approach uses the [[isomorphism]] between the [[Euclidean plane]] and the [[real coordinate space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. This approach can be used to provide a stronger version of the theorem.&lt;ref&gt; Arnon Avron, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01222890 "On strict strong constructibility with a compass alone"], Journal of Geometry (1990) 38: 12. &lt;/ref&gt; It also shows the dependence of the theorem on [[Archimedean property|Archimedes' axiom]] (which cannot be formulated in a [[first-order language]]).

== Constructive proof ==
The following notation will be used throughout this article. A circle whose center is located at point {{mvar|U}} and that passes through point {{mvar|V}} will be denoted by {{math|''U''(''V'')}}. A circle with center {{mvar|U}} and radius specified by a number, {{mvar|r}}, or a line segment {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} will be denoted by {{math|''U''(''r'')}} or {{math|''U''(''AB'')}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general constructions there are often several variations that will produce the same result. The choices made in such a variant can be made without loss of generality. However, when a construction is being used to prove that something can be done, it is not necessary to describe all these various choices and, for the sake of clarity of exposition, only one variant will be given below. However, many constructions come in different forms depending on whether or not they use [[Inversion in a circle|circle inversion]] and these alternatives will be given if possible.
 
=== Some preliminary constructions ===
To prove the above constructions #3 and #4, which are included below, a few necessary intermediary constructions are also explained below since they are used and referenced frequently. These are also compass-only constructions. All constructions below rely on #1,#2,#5, and any other construction that is listed prior to it.

==== Compass equivalence theorem (circle translation) ====
{{main|Compass equivalence theorem}}
The ability to translate, or copy, a circle to a new center is vital in these proofs and fundamental to establish the veracity of the theorem. The creation of a new circle with the same radius as the first, but centered at different point, is the key feature distinguishing the collapsing compass from the modern, rigid compass. The equivalence of a collapsing compass and a rigid compass was proved by Euclid (Book I Proposition 2 of ''The Elements'') using straightedge and collapsing compass when he, essentially, constructs a copy of a circle with a different center. This equivalence can also be established with compass alone. 

==== Reflecting a point across a line ====
[[File:PointReflection.png|thumb|Point symmetry]]
* Given a line segment {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} and a point {{mvar|C}} not on the line determined by that segment,  construct the image of {{mvar|C}} upon reflection across this line.
# Construct two circles: one centered at {{mvar|A}} and one centered at {{mvar|B}}, both passing through {{mvar|C}}.
# {{mvar|D}}, the other point of intersection of the two circles, is the reflection of {{mvar|C}} across the line {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}}. If {{math|1=''C'' = ''D''}} (that is, there is a unique point of intersection of the two circles), then {{mvar|C}} lies on the line {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} and equals its own reflection (contrary to the assumption).
{{clear}}
====Extending the length of a line segment====
[[File:Compass only extension of a segment.svg|thumb|A compass-only construction of doubling the length of segment AB]]
*Given a line segment {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} find a point {{mvar|C}} on the line {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} such that {{mvar|B}} is the midpoint of line segment {{math|{{overline|''AC''}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=p. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Construct point {{mvar|D}} as the intersection of circles {{math|''A''(''B'')}} and {{math|''B''(''A'')}}. (∆''ABD'' is an equilateral triangle.)
# Construct point {{math|''E'' ≠ ''A''}} as the intersection of circles {{math|''D''(''B'')}} and {{math|''B''(''D'')}}. (∆''DBE'' is an equilateral triangle.)
# Finally, construct point {{math|''C'' ≠ ''D''}} as the intersection of circles {{math|''B''(''E'')}} and {{math|''E''(''B'')}}. (∆''EBC'' is an equilateral triangle, and the three angles at {{mvar|B}} show that {{math|''A'', ''B'' and ''C''}} are collinear.)

This construction can be repeated as often as necessary to find a point {{mvar|Q}} so that the length of line segment {{math|{{overline|''AQ''}}}} = {{math|''n''}}⋅ length of line segment {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} for any positive integer {{math|''n''}}.
{{clear}}
==== Inversion in a circle ====
[[File:InversionPointCircle.png|thumb|Point inversion in a circle]]
* Given a circle {{math|''B''(''r'')}}, for some radius {{mvar|r}} (in black) and a point {{math|''D'' (≠ ''B'')}} construct the point {{mvar|I}} that is the inverse of {{mvar|D}} in the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=p. 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Draw a circle {{math|''D''(''B'')}} (in red). 
# Assume that the red circle intersects the black circle at {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|E'}} (if the circles do not intersect in two points see below).
# Construct two new circles {{math|''E''(''B'')}} and {{math|''E' ''(''B'')}} (in light blue).
# The light blue circles intersect at {{mvar|B}} and at another point {{math|''I'' ≠ ''B''}}.
# Point {{mvar|I}} is the desired inverse of {{mvar|D}} in the black circle.

Point {{mvar|I}} is such that the radius {{mvar|r}} of {{math|''B''(''r'')}} is to {{mvar|IB}} as {{mvar|DB}} is to the radius; or {{math|1=''IB'' / ''r'' = ''r'' / ''DB''}}.

In the event that the above construction fails (that is, the red circle and the black circle do not intersect in two points),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=p. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; find a point {{mvar|Q}} on the line {{math|{{overline|''BD''}}}} so that the length of line segment {{math|{{overline|''BQ''}}}} is a positive integral multiple, say {{mvar|n}}, of the length of {{math|{{overline|''BD''}}}} and is greater than {{math|''r'' / 2}} (this is possible by Archimede's axiom). Find {{mvar|Q'}} the inverse of {{mvar|Q}} in circle {{math|''B''(''r'')}} as above (the red and black circles must now intersect in two points). The point {{mvar|I}} is now obtained by extending {{math|{{overline|''BQ' ''}}}} so that {{math|{{overline|''BI''}}}} = {{math|''n'' ⋅ {{overline|''BQ' ''}}}}.

====Determining the center of a circle through three points====
[[File:Circle center construction.svg|thumb|Compass-only construction of the center of a circle through three points (A,B,C)]]
* Given three non-collinear points {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|C}}, find the center {{mvar|O}} of the circle they determine.&lt;ref name=Pedoe123&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=p. 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Construct point {{mvar|D}}, the inverse of {{mvar|C}} in the circle {{math|''A''(''B'')}}.
# Reflect {{mvar|A}} in the line {{math|{{overline|''BD''}}}} to the point {{mvar|X}}.
# {{mvar|O}} is the inverse of {{mvar|X}} in the circle {{math|''A''(''B'')}}.
{{clear}}

=== Intersection of two non-parallel lines (construction #3)===
[[File:Line intersection by compass.svg|thumb|Compass-only construction of the intersection of two lines (not all construction steps shown)]]
* Given non-parallel lines {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} and {{math|{{overline|''CD''}}}}, find their point of intersection, {{mvar|X}}.&lt;ref name=Pedoe123 /&gt;
# Select circle {{math|''O''(''r'')}} of arbitrary radius whose center {{mvar|O}} does not lie on either line.
# Invert points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} in circle {{math|''O''(''r'')}} to points {{mvar|A'}} and {{mvar|B'}} respectively.
# The line {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} is inverted to the circle passing through {{mvar|O}}, {{mvar|A'}} and {{mvar|B'}}. Find the center {{mvar|E}} of this circle.
# Invert points {{mvar|C}} and {{mvar|D}} in circle {{math|''O''(''r'')}} to points {{mvar|C'}} and {{mvar|D'}} respectively.
# The line {{math|{{overline|''CD''}}}} is inverted to the circle passing through {{mvar|O}}, {{mvar|C'}} and {{mvar|D'}}. Find the center {{mvar|F}} of this circle.
# Let {{math|''Y'' ≠ ''O''}} be the intersection of circles {{math|''E''(''O'')}} and {{math|''F''(''O'')}}.
# {{mvar|X}} is the inverse of {{mvar|Y}} in the circle {{math|''O''(''r'')}}.
{{clear}}
=== Intersection of a line and a circle (construction #4)===
The compass-only construction of the intersection points of a line and a circle breaks into two cases depending upon whether the center of the circle is or is not collinear with the line. 

==== Circle center is not collinear with the line====
Assume that center of the circle does not lie on the line.
[[File:LineCircleIntersection.png|thumb|Line-circle intersection (non-collinear case)]]
*Given a circle {{math|''C''(''r'')}} (in black) and a line {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}}. We wish to construct the points of intersection, {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}}, between them (if they exist).&lt;ref name=Hunger784 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Construct the point {{mvar|D}}, which is the reflection of point {{mvar|C}} across line {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}}. (See above.) Under the assumption of this case, {{math|''C'' ≠ ''D''}}.
#Construct a circle {{math|''D''(''r'')}} (in red). (See above, compass equivalence.)
# The intersections of circle {{math|''C''(''r'')}} and the new red circle are points {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}}.

An alternate construction, using circle inversion can also be given.&lt;ref name=Pedoe123 /&gt;

# The line {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} is inverted to the circle passing through {{mvar|C}}, {{mvar|A'}} and {{mvar|B'}}. Find the center {{mvar|E}} of this circle.
# {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} are the intersection points of circles {{math|''C''(''r'')}} and {{math|''E''(''C'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pedoe carries out one more inversion at this point, but the points {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} are on the circle of inversion and so are invariant under this last unneeded inversion.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Construct point {{mvar|F}} as the intersection of circles {{math|''C''(''DD' '')}} and {{math|''D''(''C'')}}. ({{mvar|F}} is the fourth vertex of parallelogram {{mvar|CD'DF}}.)
# Construct point {{mvar|F'}} as the intersection of circles {{math|''C''(''DD' '')}} and {{math|''D' ''(''C'')}}. ({{mvar|F'}} is the fourth vertex of parallelogram {{mvar|CDD'F'}}.)
# Construct point {{mvar|M}} as an intersection of circles {{math|''F''(''D' '')}} and {{math|''F' ''(''D'')}}. ({{mvar|M}} lies on {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}}.)
# Points {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} are the intersections of circles {{math|''F''(''CM'')}} and {{math|''C''(''D'')}}.

Thus it has been shown that all of the basic construction one can perform with a straightedge and compass can be done with a compass alone, provided that it is understood that a line cannot be literally drawn but merely defined by two points.

Narasimhan|last2=Seshadri|author2-link=C. S. Seshadri|year=1965}}, says that a holomorphic [[vector bundle]] over a [[Riemann surface]] is [[stable bundle|stable]] if and only if it comes from an [[simple module|irreducible]] projective [[unitary representation]] of the [[fundamental group]].

The main case to understand is that of topologically trivial bundles, i.e. those of degree zero (and the other cases are a minor 
technical extension of this case). This case of the Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem says that a degree zero holomorphic [[vector bundle]] over a [[Riemann surface]] is stable if and only if it comes from an irreducible [[unitary representation]] of the [[fundamental group]] of the Riemann surface.

{{harvs|txt|last=Donaldson|authorlink=Simon Donaldson|year=1983}} gave another proof using [[differential geometry]], and showed that the [[stable vector bundle]]s have an essentially unique unitary connection of constant (scalar) [[curvature]]. In the degree zero case, Donaldson's version of the theorem says that a degree zero holomorphic vector bundle over a Riemann surface is stable if and only if it admits a flat unitary connection compatible with its holomorphic structure. Then the fundamental group representation appearing in the original statement is just the monodromy representation of this flat unitary connection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5482">In [[mathematics]], '''Nesbitt's [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]''' is a special case of the [[Shapiro inequality]].  It states that for positive real numbers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+c}+\frac{b}{a+c}+\frac{c}{a+b}\geq\frac{3}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
===First proof: AM-HM===
By the [[Arithmetic mean|AM]]-[[Harmonic mean|HM]] inequality on &lt;math&gt;(a+b),(b+c),(c+a)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(a+b)+(a+c)+(b+c)}{3}\geq\frac{3}{\displaystyle\frac{1}{a+b}+\frac{1}{a+c}+ \frac{1}{b+c}}.&lt;/math&gt;
[[Clearing denominators]] yields
:&lt;math&gt;((a+b)+(a+c)+(b+c))\left(\frac{1}{a+b}+\frac{1}{a+c}+\frac{1}{b+c}\right)\geq 9,&lt;/math&gt;
from which we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;2\frac{a+b+c}{b+c}+2\frac{a+b+c}{a+c}+2\frac{a+b+c}{a+b}\geq9&lt;/math&gt;
by expanding the product and collecting like denominators.  This then simplifies directly to the final result.

===Second proof: Rearrangement===
Suppose &lt;math&gt; a \ge b \ge c &lt;/math&gt;, we have that 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {b+c} \ge \frac 1 {a+c} \ge \frac 1 {a+b} &lt;/math&gt;
define
:&lt;math&gt;\vec x = (a, b, c) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec y = \left(\frac 1 {b+c} , \frac 1 {a+c} , \frac 1 {a+b}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
The scalar product of the two sequences is maximum because of the [[rearrangement inequality]] if they are arranged the same way, call &lt;math&gt;\vec y_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec y_2&lt;/math&gt; the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec y&lt;/math&gt; shifted by one and by two, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec x \cdot \vec y \ge \vec x \cdot \vec y_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec x \cdot \vec y \ge \vec x \cdot \vec y_2&lt;/math&gt;

Addition yields Nesbitt's inequality.

===Third proof: Hilbert's Seventeenth Problem===
The following identity is true for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c:&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+c}+\frac{b}{a+c}+\frac{c}{a+b} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{(a-b)^2}{(a+c)(b+c)}+\frac{(a-c)^2}{(a+b)(b+c)}+\frac{(b-c)^2}{(a+b)(a+c)}\right)

&lt;/math&gt;
This clearly proves that the left side is no less than &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt; for positive a,b and c.

Note: every rational inequality can be solved by transforming it to the appropriate identity, see [[Hilbert's seventeenth problem]].

===Fourth proof: Cauchy–Schwarz===
Invoking the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] on the vectors &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\left\langle\sqrt{a+b},\sqrt{b+c},\sqrt{c+a}\right\rangle,\left\langle\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}}\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;((b+c)+(a+c)+(a+b))\left(\frac{1}{b+c}+\frac{1}{a+c}+\frac{1}{a+b}\right)\geq 9,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be transformed into the final result as we did in [[Nesbitt's inequality#First proof: AM-HM|the AM-HM proof]].

===Fifth proof: AM-GM===
We first employ a [[Ravi substitution]]: let &lt;math&gt;x=a+b,y=b+c,z=c+a&lt;/math&gt;.  We then apply the [[Arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality|AM-GM inequality]] to the set of six values &lt;math&gt;\left\{x^2z,z^2x,y^2z,z^2y,x^2y,y^2x\right\}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left(x^2z+z^2x\right)+\left(y^2z+z^2y\right)+\left(x^2y+y^2x\right)}{6}\geq\sqrt[6]{x^2z\cdot z^2x\cdot y^2z\cdot z^2y\cdot x^2y\cdot y^2x}=xyz.&lt;/math&gt;
Dividing by &lt;math&gt;xyz/6&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x+z}{y}+\frac{y+z}{x}+\frac{x+y}{z}\geq6.&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting out the &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; in favor of &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2a+b+c}{b+c}+\frac{a+b+2c}{a+b}+\frac{a+2b+c}{c+a}\geq6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2a}{b+c}+\frac{2c}{a+b}+\frac{2b}{a+c}+3\geq6&lt;/math&gt;
which then simplifies to the final result.

===Sixth proof: Titu's Screw lemma===
Titu's lemma, a direct consequence of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], states that for any sequence of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real numbers &lt;math&gt;(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and any sequence of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; positive numbers &lt;math&gt;(a_k)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{x_k^2}{a_k}\geq\frac{(\sum_{k=1}^n x_k)^2}{\sum_{k=1}^n a_k}&lt;/math&gt;.  We use its three-term instance with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-sequence &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;-sequence &lt;math&gt;a(b+c),b(c+a),c(a+b)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^2}{a(b+c)}+\frac{b^2}{b(c+a)}+\frac{c^2}{c(a+b)}\geq\frac{(a+b+c)^2}{a(b+c)+b(c+a)+c(a+b)}&lt;/math&gt;
By multiplying out all the products on the lesser side and collecting like terms, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^2}{a(b+c)}+\frac{b^2}{b(c+a)}+\frac{c^2}{c(a+b)}\geq\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca)}{2(ab+bc+ca)},&lt;/math&gt;
which simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+c}+\frac{b}{c+a}+\frac{c}{a+b}\geq\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)}+1.&lt;/math&gt;
By the [[rearrangement inequality]], we have &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2+c^2\geq ab+bc+ca&lt;/math&gt;, so the fraction on the lesser side must be at least &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+c}+\frac{b}{c+a}+\frac{c}{a+b}\geq\frac{3}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
===Seventh proof:  Homogeneous===
As the left side of the inequality is homogeneous, we may assume &lt;math&gt;a+b+c=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Now define &lt;math&gt;x=a+b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=b+c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z=c+a&lt;/math&gt;.  The desired inequality turns into &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-x}{x}+\frac{1-y}{y}+\frac{1-z}{z}\ge \frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}\ge 9/2&lt;/math&gt;.  This is clearly true by Titu's Lemma.

'''Outer billiards''' is a [[dynamical system]] based on a [[convex set|convex]] shape in the plane. Classically, this system is defined for the [[Euclidean plane]] but one can also consider the system in the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] or in other spaces that suitably generalize the plane. Outer billiards differs from a usual [[dynamical billiards|dynamical billiard]] in that it deals with a discrete sequence of moves ''outside'' the shape rather than inside of it.

== Definitions ==

===The outer billiards map===
Let P be a [[convex set|convex]] shape in the plane.
Given a point x0 outside P, there is typically a unique
point x1 (also outside P) so that the line segment connecting x0 to x1 is [[tangent]] to P at its [[midpoint]] and
a person walking from x0 to x1 would see P on the right.  (See Figure.)  The map
F: x0 -&gt; x1 is called the ''outer billiards map''.

[[Image:OuterBilliardsDefinition.png|frame|right|Outer billiards defined relative to a pentagon]]
The [[inverse function|inverse]] (or backwards) outer billiards map is also defined, as the map x1 -&gt; x0. 
One gets the inverse map simply by replacing the word ''right'' by the word ''left'' in the definition given above.
The figure shows the situation in the [[Euclidean plane]], but the definition in the
[[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] is essentially the same.

===Orbits===
An outer billiards [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] is the set of all [[iterated function|iterations]] 
of the point, namely ... x0 &lt;--&gt; x1 &lt;--&gt; x2 &lt;--&gt; x3 ...  That is, start at x0 and
iteratively apply both the outer billiards map and the backwards outer billiards map.
When P is a strictly convex shape, such as an [[ellipse]],
every point in the exterior of P has a well defined orbit.  When P
is a [[polygon]], some points might not have well-defined orbits, on account of the
potential ambiguity of choosing the midpoint of the relevant tangent line.  Nevertheless, in
the polygonal case, [[almost every]] point has a well-defined orbit.
*An orbit is called ''periodic'' if it eventually repeats.
*An orbit is called ''aperiodic''  (or ''non-periodic'') if it is not periodic.
* An orbit is called ''bounded'' (or ''stable'') if some bounded region in the plane contains the whole orbit.
*An orbit is called ''unbounded'' (or ''unstable'') if it is not bounded.

===Higher-dimensional spaces===
Defining an outer billiards system in a higher-dimensional space is beyond the scope of this article. Unlike the case of ordinary [[dynamical billiards|billiards]], the definition is not straightforward.  One natural setting for the map is a [[complex vector space]].  In this case, there is a natural choice of line tangent to a [[convex set|convex]] body at each point.  One obtains these tangents by starting with the normals and using the [[Complex manifold|complex structure]] to rotate 90 degrees. These distinguished tangent lines can be used
to define the outer billiards map roughly as above. See S. Tabachnikov's book (cited in the references) for details.

== History ==
Most people attribute the introduction of outer billiards to [[Bernhard Neumann]] in the late 1950s, 
though it seems
that a few people cite an earlier construction in 1945, due to M. Day.  [[Jürgen Moser]] popularized the system in the 1970s as a toy model for
[[celestial mechanics]].   This system has been studied classically in the [[Euclidean plane]], and more recently in
the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]].  One can also consider higher-dimensional spaces, though no serious study has yet been made.
[[Bernhard Neumann]] informally posed the question as to whether or not one can
have unbounded orbits in an outer billiards system, and Moser put it in writing in 1973.
Sometimes this basic question has been called ''the Moser-Neumann question''.
This question, originally posed for shapes in the [[Euclidean plane]] and
solved only recently, has been a
guiding problem in the field.

==Moser-Neumann question==

===Bounded orbits in the Euclidean plane===
In the 70's, [[Jürgen Moser]] sketched a proof, based on [[Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem|K.A.M. theory]], that outer 
billiards relative to a
6-times-[[Differentiable function|differentiable]]  shape of positive [[curvature (mathematics)|curvature]] has all orbits bounded.
In 1982, [[Raphael Douady]] gave the full proof of this result.
A big advance in the polygonal case came over a period of several years when
three teams of authors, Vivaldi-Shaidenko (1987), Kolodziej (1989), and Gutkin-Simanyi (1991), each 
using different methods,
showed that outer
billiards relative to a ''quasirational'' polygon has all orbits bounded.   The notion of quasirational is technical
(see references) but it includes the class of [[regular polygons]] and  ''convex rational polygons'', 
namely those [[convex polygon]]s whose vertices have [[Rational number|rational]] coordinates.  In the case of rational polygons, all the orbits are
periodic.  In 1995, Tabachnikov showed that outer billiards for the [[regular pentagon]] has some aperiodic orbits,
thus clarifying the distinction between the dynamics in the rational and regular cases.
In 1996, Boyland showed that outer billiards relative to some shapes can have orbits which accumulate on
the shape.
In 2005, D. Genin showed that all orbits are bounded when the shape is a [[trapezoid]], thus
showing that quasirationality is not a ''necessary'' condition for the system to have all orbits bounded.
(Not all [[trapezoids]] are quasirational.)

===Unbounded orbits in the Euclidean plane===
In 2007, R. E. Schwartz showed that outer billiards has some unbounded orbits when defined
relative to the [[Roger Penrose|Penrose]] Kite, thus answering the original Moser-Neumann question in the affirmative.
The Penrose kite is the [[Convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] from the kites-and-darts [[Penrose tilings]].
Subsequently, Schwartz showed that outer billiards has unbounded orbits when defined relative
to any irrational kite.  An
''irrational kite'' is a [[quadrilateral]] with the following property: 
One of the [[diagonals]] of the [[quadrilateral]] divides the region into two [[triangles]] of equal area 
and the other [[diagonal]] divides the region into two [[triangles]] whose areas are not [[rational number|rational]] multiples
of each other.
In 2008, Dolgopyat-Fayad showed that outer billiards defined relative to the semidisk has
unbounded orbits.  The ''semidisk'' is the region one gets by cutting a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] in half.
The proof of Dolgopyat-Fayad is robust, and also works for regions obtained by
cutting a disk nearly in half, when the word ''nearly'' is suitably interpreted.

===Unbounded orbits in the hyperbolic plane===
In 2003, Dogru and Tabachnikov showed that all orbits are unbounded
for a certain class of [[convex polygon]]s in the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]].
The authors call such polygons ''large''. 
(See the reference for the definition.) Dogru and Otten then extended this work in 2011 by specifying the conditions under which a regular polygonal table in the hyperbolic plane have all orbits unbounded, that is, are large.

==Existence of periodic orbits==
In ordinary [[dynamical billiards|polygonal billiards]], the existence of periodic
orbits is a major unsolved problem.  For instance, it is unknown if every
triangular shaped table has a periodic billiard path.  More progress has
been made for outer billiards, though the situation is far from well understood.
As mentioned above, all the orbits are periodic when the system is defined
relative to a convex rational polygon in the [[Euclidean plane]].  Moreover, it is a
recent theorem of C. Culter (written up by S. Tabachnikov) that outer
billiards relative to any [[convex polygon]] has periodic orbits—in fact a
periodic orbit outside of any given bounded region.

==Open questions==
Outer billiards is a subject still in its beginning phase.  Most problems are still unsolved.  
Here are some open problems in the area.
*Show that outer billiards relative to [[almost every]] [[convex polygon]] has unbounded orbits.
*Show that outer billiards relative to a [[regular polygon]] has [[almost every]] orbit periodic. The cases of the equilaterial triangle and the square are trivial, and Tabachnikov answered this for the regular pentagon. These are the only cases known.
*more broadly, characterize the structure of the set of periodic orbits relative to the typical [[convex polygon]].
*understand the structure of periodic orbits relative to simple shapes in the hyperbolic plane, such as small equilateral triangles.

[[Image:Focal stability.png|thumb|300px|right|Phase space of a dynamic system with focal instability, showing one phase space trajectory]] 
In [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamical system theory]], a '''phase space''' is a [[Space (mathematics)|space]] in which all possible states of a [[system]] are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space. For [[classical mechanics|mechanical systems]], the phase space usually consists of all possible values of [[position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]] variables.  The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Henri Poincaré]], and [[Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nolte | first1 = D. D. | title = The tangled tale of phase space | doi = 10.1063/1.3397041 | journal = Physics Today | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 33–38| year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2010PhT....63d..33N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
In a phase space, every [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] or [[parameter]] of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space; a one-dimensional system is called a [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]], while a two-dimensional system is called a [[phase plane]]. For every possible state of the system, or allowed combination of values of the system's parameters, a point is included in the multidimensional space. The system's evolving state over time traces a path (a '''phase space trajectory''' for the system) through the high-dimensional space. The phase space trajectory represents the set of states compatible with starting from one particular [[initial condition]], located in the full phase space that represents the set of states compatible with starting from ''any'' initial condition.   As a whole, the phase diagram represents all that the system can be, and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise. A phase space may contain a great number of dimensions. For instance, a gas containing many molecules may require a separate dimension for each particle's ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' positions and momenta (6 dimensions for an idealized monatomic gas), and for more complex molecular systems additional dimensions are required to describe vibrational modes of the molecular bonds, as well as spin around 3 axes. Phase spaces are easier to use when analyzing behavior of mechanical systems restricted to motion around and along various axes of rotation or translation - e.g. in robotics, like analyzing the range of motion of a [[robotic arm]] or determining the optimal path to achieve a particular position/momentum result.

===Conjugate momentarily===
[[File:Hamiltonian flow classical.gif|frame|left|Evolution of an [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of classical systems in phase space (top). The systems are a massive particle in a one-dimensional potential well (red curve, lower figure). The initially compact ensemble becomes swirled up over time.]]

In classical mechanics, any choice of [[generalized coordinates]] ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; for the position (i.e. coordinates on [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]) defines [[conjugate momentum|conjugate generalized momenta]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which together define co-ordinates on phase space. More abstractly, in classical mechanics phase space is the [[cotangent bundle]] of configuration space, and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of natural local [[Darboux coordinates]] for the standard [[symplectic structure]] on a cotangent space.

===Statistical ensembles in phase space===
The motion of an [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of systems in this space is studied by classical [[statistical mechanics]]. The local density of points in such systems obeys [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's Theorem]], and so can be taken as constant. Within the context of a model system in classical mechanics, the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system's dynamic variables.  Because of this, it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any given time in the future or the past, through integration of Hamilton's or Lagrange's equations of motion.

== Examples ==
[[File:Pendulum phase portrait illustration.svg|430px|left|thumbnail|Illustration of how a phase portrait would be constructed for the motion of a simple [[pendulum]].]]
[[File:PenduleEspaceDesPhases.png|thumb|right|Time-series flow in phase space specified by the differential equation of a [[pendulum]]. The X axis corresponds to the pendulum's position, and the Y axis its speed.]]

=== Low dimensions ===
{{main|phase line (mathematics)|phase plane}}

For simple systems, there may be as few as one or two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom occurs when one has an [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]] [[ordinary differential equation]] in a single variable, &lt;math&gt;dy/dt = f(y),&lt;/math&gt; with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]], and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line. The simplest non-trivial examples are the [[exponential growth model]]/decay (one unstable/stable equilibrium) and the [[logistic growth model]] (two equilibria, one stable, one unstable).

The phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a [[phase plane]], which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension, and where the two variables are position and velocity. In this case, a sketch of the [[phase portrait]] may give qualitative information about the dynamics of the system, such as the [[limit cycle]] of the [[Van der Pol oscillator]] shown in the diagram.

Here, the horizontal axis gives the position and vertical axis the velocity.  As the system evolves, its state follows one of the lines (trajectories) on the phase diagram.
[[Image:Limitcycle.svg|thumb|340px|right|[[Phase portrait]] of the [[Van der Pol oscillator]]]]

=== Chaos theory ===
Classic examples of phase diagrams from [[chaos theory]] are :
* the [[Lorenz attractor]]
* population growth (i.e. [[logistic map]])
* parameter plane of [[complex quadratic polynomial]]s with [[Mandelbrot set]].

==Phase plot==
A plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes called a '''phase plot''' or a '''phase diagram'''. [[Phase diagram]], however, is more usually reserved in the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]] for a diagram showing the various regions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system, which consists of [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and composition.

==Quantum mechanics==
In [[quantum mechanics]], the coordinates ''p'' and ''q'' of phase space normally become [[hermitian operators]] in a [[Hilbert space]].

But they may alternatively retain their classical interpretation, provided  functions of them compose in novel algebraic ways (through [[Moyal product|Groenewold's 1946 star product]]), consistent with the [[uncertainty principle]] of quantum mechanics. 
Every quantum mechanical [[observable]] corresponds to a unique function or [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] on phase space, and vice versa, as specified by [[Hermann Weyl]] (1927) and supplemented by [[John von Neumann]] (1931); [[Eugene Wigner]] (1932); and, in a grand synthesis, by [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold|H J Groenewold]] (1946). 
With [[José Enrique Moyal|J E Moyal]] (1949), these completed the foundations of  the '''[[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics''', a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Zachos | first2 = C. K. | doi = 10.1142/S2251158X12000069 | title = Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space | journal = Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter | volume = 01 | pages = 37 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1104.5269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Its modern abstractions include [[deformation quantization]] and [[geometric quantization]].)
 
Expectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to tracing operator observables with the density matrix in Hilbert space: they are obtained by phase-space integrals of observables, with the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution]] effectively serving as a measure.

Thus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for classical mechanics), the [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl map]] facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a [[Deformation theory|'''deformation''']] (generalization) of classical mechanics, with deformation parameter ''[[Reduced Planck constant|ħ]]/S'', where ''S'' is the [[Action (physics)|action]] of the relevant process. (Other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into [[Special relativity|relativistic mechanics]], with deformation parameter ''v''/''c'';{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} or the deformation of Newtonian gravity into [[General Relativity]], with deformation parameter [[Schwarzschild radius]]/characteristic-dimension.){{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Classical expressions, observables, and operations (such as Poisson brackets) are modified by ħ-dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to the noncommutative star-multiplication characterizing quantum mechanics and underlying its uncertainty principle.

==Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics==
&lt;!-- [[Thermodynamic phase space]] redirects here]] --&gt;
In [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] contexts, the term phase space has two meanings: It is used in the same sense as in classical mechanics. If a thermodynamic system consists of ''N'' particles, then a point in the 6''N''-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system, as each particle is associated with three position variables and three momentum variables. In this sense, as long as the particles are [[Gibbs paradox|distinguishable]], a point in phase space is said to be a [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] of the system. (For [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] a microstate will consist of a set of ''N''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; points, corresponding to all possible exchanges of the ''N'' particles.)  ''N'' is typically on the order of [[Avogadro's number]], thus describing the system at a microscopic level is often impractical. This leads  to the use of phase space in a different sense.

The phase space can also refer to the space that is parametrized by the ''macroscopic'' states of the system, such as pressure, temperature, etc. For instance, one may view the pressure-volume diagram or entropy-temperature diagrams as describing part of this phase space. A point in this phase space is correspondingly called a macrostate. There may easily be more than one microstate with the same macrostate. For example, for a fixed temperature, the system could have many dynamic configurations at the microscopic level. When used in this sense, a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in, for example, the [[liquid]] phase, or [[solid]] phase, etc.

Since there are many more microstates than macrostates, the phase space in the first sense is usually a [[manifold]] of much larger dimensions than in the second sense. Clearly, many more parameters are required to register every detail of the system down to the molecular or atomic scale than to simply specify, say, the temperature or the pressure of the system.

==Optics==
Phase space is extensively used in [[nonimaging optics]],&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt; the branch of optics devoted to illumination. It is also an important concept in [[Hamiltonian optics]].

== Phase integral ==
In classical statistical mechanics (continuous energies) the concept of phase space provides a classical analog to the [[Partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] (sum over states) known as the phase integral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurendeau |first=Normand M. |title=Statistical Thermodynamics: Fundamentals and Applications |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-84635-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of summing the Boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states (defined by
appropriate integer [[quantum numbers]] for each degree of freedom) one may integrate over continuous phase space.  Such integration essentially consists of two parts: integration of the momentum component of all degrees of freedom (momentum space) and integration of the position component of all degrees of freedom (configuration space).  Once the phase integral is known, it may be related to the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of [[quantum energy states]] per unit phase space. This normalization constant is simply the inverse of [[Planck's constant]] raised to a power equal to the number of degrees of freedom for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29|title=Configuration integral|last=Vu-Quoc|first=L.|year=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29|archivedate=April 28, 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25406">In [[mathematics]], a '''polygonal number''' is a [[number]] represented  as dots or pebbles arranged in the shape of a [[regular polygon]]. The dots are thought of as alphas (units). These are one type of 2-dimensional [[figurate number]]s.

== Definition and examples ==

The number 10 for example, can be arranged as a [[triangle]] (see [[triangular number]]):

:{|
| align="center" | [[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDotX.svg|16px|*]]
|}

But 10 cannot be arranged as a [[square (geometry)|square]]. The number 9, on the other hand, can be (see [[square number]]):

:{|
| align="center" | [[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]][[File:GrayDot.svg|16px|*]]
|}

Some numbers, like 36, can be arranged both as a square and as a triangle (see [[square triangular number]]):

By convention, 1 is the first polygonal number for any number of sides.  The rule for enlarging the polygon to the next size is to extend two adjacent arms by one point and to then add the required extra sides between those points.  In the following diagrams, each extra layer is shown as in red.

===Triangular numbers===
:[[File:Polygonal Number 3.gif|500px|none]]

===Square numbers===

:[[File:Polygonal Number 4.gif|500px|none]]

Polygons with higher numbers of sides, such as pentagons and hexagons, can also be constructed according to this rule, although the dots will no longer form a perfectly regular lattice like above.

===Pentagonal numbers===

===Hexagonal numbers===

==Formula==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2015}}

If {{mvar|s}} is the number of sides in a polygon, the formula for the {{mvar|n}}th {{mvar|s}}-gonal number {{math|''P''(''s'',''n'')}} is

:&lt;math&gt;P(s,n) = \frac{n^2(s-2)-n(s-4)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;P(s,n) = (s-2)\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+n&lt;/math&gt;

The {{mvar|n}}th {{mvar|s}}-gonal number is also related to the triangular numbers {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;P(s,n) = (s-2)T_{n-1} + n = (s-3)T_{n-1} + T_n\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P(s,n+1)-P(s,n) &amp;= (s-2)n + 1\, ,\\
P(s+1,n) - P(s,n) &amp;= T_{n-1} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\, .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For a given {{mvar|s}}-gonal number {{math|''P''(''s'',''n'') {{=}} ''x''}}, one can find {{mvar|n}} by

:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{\sqrt{8(s-2)x+{(s-4)}^2}+(s-4)}{2(s-2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Every hexagonal number is also a triangular number===
Applying the formula above:
:&lt;math&gt;P(s,n) = (s-2)T_{n-1} + n &lt;/math&gt;

to the case of 6 sides gives:
:&lt;math&gt;P(6,n) = 4T_{n-1} + n &lt;/math&gt;

but since:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{n-1} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt;P(6,n) = \frac{4n(n-1)}{2} + n = \frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = T_{2n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the {{mvar|n}}th hexagonal number {{math|''P''(6,''n'')}} is also the {{math|(2''n'' − 1)}}th triangular number {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  We can find every hexagonal number by simply taking the odd-numbered triangular numbers:

:'''1''', 3, '''6''', 10,'''15''', 21, '''28''', 36, '''45''', 55, '''66''', ...

==Table of values==
The first 6 values in the column "sum of reciprocals", for triangular to octagonal numbers, come from a published solution to the general problem, which also gives a general formula for any number of sides, in terms of the [[digamma function]].&lt;ref name="siam_07-003s"&gt;http://www.siam.org/journals/problems/downloadfiles/07-003s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] eschews terms using Greek prefixes (e.g., "octagonal") in favor of terms using numerals (i.e., "8-gonal").

A property of this table can be expressed by the following identity (see {{OEIS link|id=A086270}}):

:&lt;math&gt;2\,P(s,n) = P(s+k,n) + P(s-k,n),&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., s-3.&lt;/math&gt;

==Combinations==
Some numbers, such as 36 which is both square and triangular, fall into two polygonal sets. The problem of determining, given two such sets, all numbers that belong to both can be solved by reducing the problem to [[Pell's equation]]. The simplest example of this is the sequence of [[square triangular number]]s.

The following table summarizes the set of {{mvar|s}}-gonal {{mvar|t}}-gonal numbers for small values of {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}}.

In some cases, such as {{math|''s'' {{=}} 10}} and {{math|''t'' {{=}} 4}}, there are no numbers in both sets other than 1.

The problem of finding numbers that belong to three polygonal sets is more difficult. A computer search for pentagonal square triangular numbers has yielded only the trivial value of 1, though a proof that there are no other such numbers has yet to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Pentagonal Square Triangular Number | urlname=PentagonalSquareTriangularNumber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 1225 is hecatonicositetragonal ({{math|''s'' {{=}} 124}}), hexacontagonal ({{math|''s'' {{=}} 60}}), icosienneagonal ({{math|''s'' {{=}} 29}}), hexagonal, square, and triangular.

The only polygonal set that is contained entirely in another polygonal set is the set of hexagonal numbers, which is contained in the set of triangular numbers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">In [[computer programming]], a '''postcondition''' is a condition or [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a [[formal specification]]. Postconditions are sometimes tested using [[assertion (computing)|assertions]] within the code itself. Often, postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code.

For example: The result of a [[factorial]] is always an integer and greater than or equal to 1. So a program that calculates the factorial of an input number would have postconditions that the result after the calculation be an integer and that it be greater than or equal to 1.  Another example: a program that calculates the [[square root]] of an input number might have the postconditions that the result be a number and that its [[square (algebra)|square]] be equal to the input.

==Postconditions in object-oriented programming==
In some software design approaches, postconditions, along with [[precondition]]s and class [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]], are components of the software construction method [[design by contract]].

The postcondition for any routine is a declaration of the properties which are guaranteed upon completion of the routine's execution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]], ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]], second edition,'' Prentice Hall, 1997, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; As it relates to the routine's contract, the postcondition offers assurance to potential callers that in cases in which the routine is called in a state in which its [[precondition]] holds, the properties declared by the postcondition are assured.

==Eiffel example==

The following example written in [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] sets the value of a class attribute &lt;code&gt;hour&lt;/code&gt; based on a caller-provided argument &lt;code&gt;a_hour&lt;/code&gt;. The postcondition follows the keyword &lt;code&gt;ensure&lt;/code&gt;. In this example, the postcondition guarantees, in cases in which the precondition holds (i.e., when &lt;code&gt;a_hour&lt;/code&gt; represents a valid hour of the day), that after the execution of &lt;code&gt;set_hour&lt;/code&gt;, the class attribute &lt;code&gt;hour&lt;/code&gt; will have the same value as &lt;code&gt;a_hour&lt;/code&gt;. The tag "&lt;code&gt;hour_set:&lt;/code&gt;" describes this postcondition clause and serves to identify it in case of a runtime postcondition violation.

&lt;source lang="eiffel"&gt;
    set_hour (a_hour: INTEGER)
            -- Set `hour' to `a_hour'
        require
            valid_argument: 0 &lt;= a_hour and a_hour &lt;= 23
        do
            hour := a_hour
        ensure
            hour_set: hour = a_hour
        end
&lt;/source&gt;

==Postconditions and inheritance==
In the presence of [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], the routines inherited by descendant classes (subclasses) do so with their contracts, that is their preconditions and postconditions, in force. This means that any implementations or redefinitions of inherited routines also have to be written to comply with their inherited contracts. Postconditions can be modified in redefined routines, but they may only be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 1997, pp. 570–573.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the redefined routine may increase the benefits it provides to the client, but may not decrease those benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10513">A '''prefix code''' is a type of [[code]] system (typically a [[variable-length code]]) distinguished by its possession of the "prefix property", which requires that there is no whole [[code word]] in the system that is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] (initial segment) of any other code word in the system. For example, a code with code words {9,&amp;nbsp;55} has the prefix property; a code consisting of {9,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;59,&amp;nbsp;55} does not, because "5" is a prefix of "59" and also of "55". A prefix code is a [[uniquely decodable code]]: given a complete and accurate sequence, a receiver can identify each word without requiring a special marker between words. However, there are uniquely decodable codes that are not prefix codes; for instance, the reverse of a prefix code is still uniquely decodable (it is a suffix code), but it is not necessarily a prefix code.

Prefix codes are also known as '''prefix-free codes''', '''prefix condition codes''' and '''instantaneous codes'''. Although [[Huffman coding]] is just one of many algorithms for deriving prefix codes, prefix codes are also widely referred to as "Huffman codes", even when the code was not produced by a Huffman algorithm. The term '''comma-free code''' is sometimes also applied as a synonym for prefix-free codes&lt;ref&gt;US [[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007|url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6416|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in most mathematical books and articles (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Berstel|first1=Jean|last2=Perrin|first2=Dominique|title=Theory of Codes|publisher=Academic Press|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.4153/CJM-1958-023-9|last1=Golomb|first1=S. W.|author1-link=Solomon W. Golomb|last2=Gordon|first2=Basil|author2-link=Basil Gordon|last3=Welch|first3=L. R.|title=Comma-Free Codes|journal=Canadian Journal of Mathematics|volume=10|issue=2|pages=202–209|year=1958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRgtS14oa-sC&amp;pg=PA202}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a comma-free code is used to mean a [[self-synchronizing code]], a subclass of prefix codes.

Using prefix codes, a message can be transmitted as a sequence of concatenated code words, without any [[Out-of-band data|out-of-band]] markers or (alternatively) special markers between words to [[framing (telecommunication)|frame]] the words in the message. The recipient can decode the message unambiguously, by repeatedly finding and removing sequences that form valid code words. This is not generally possible with codes that lack the prefix property, for example {0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;11}: a receiver reading a "1" at the start of a code word would not know whether that was the complete code word "1", or merely the prefix of the code word "10" or "11"; so the string "10" could be interpreted either as a single codeword or as the concatenation of the words "1" then "0".

The variable-length [[Huffman coding|Huffman codes]], [[country calling codes]], the country and publisher parts of [[ISBN]]s, the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA]] 3G Wireless Standard, and the [[instruction set]]s (machine language) of most computer microarchitectures are prefix codes.

Prefix codes are not [[error-correcting codes]]. In practice, a message might first be compressed with a prefix code, and then encoded again with [[channel coding]] (including error correction) before transmission.

For any [[Variable-length_code#Uniquely_decodable_codes|uniquely decodable]] code there is a prefix code that has the same code word lengths.&lt;ref name=LTU2015&gt;Le Boudec, Jean-Yves, Patrick Thiran, and Rüdiger Urbanke. Introduction aux sciences de l'information: entropie, compression, chiffrement et correction d'erreurs. PPUR Presses polytechniques, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kraft's inequality]] characterizes the sets of code word lengths that are possible in a [[Variable-length_code#Uniquely_decodable_codes|uniquely decodable]] code.&lt;ref name=BRS75&gt;Berstel et al (2010) p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
If every word in the code has the same length, the code is called a '''fixed-length code''', or a '''block code''' (though the term [[block code]] is also used for fixed-size [[error-correcting code]]s in [[channel coding]]). For example, [[ISO 8859-15]] letters are always 8 bits long. [[UTF-32/UCS-4]] letters are always 32 bits long. [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM cells]] are always 424 bits (53 bytes) long. A fixed-length code of fixed length ''k'' bits can encode up to &lt;math&gt;2^{k}&lt;/math&gt; source symbols.

A fixed-length code is necessarily a prefix code. It is possible to turn any code into a fixed-length code by padding fixed symbols to the shorter prefixes in order to meet the length of the longest prefixes. Alternately, such padding codes may be employed to introduce redundancy that allows autocorrection and/or synchronisation. However, fixed length encodings are inefficient in situations where some words are much more likely to be transmitted than others.

[[Truncated binary encoding]] is a straightforward generalization of fixed-length codes to deal with cases where the number of symbols ''n'' is not a power of two. Source symbols are assigned codewords of length ''k'' and ''k''+1, where ''k'' is chosen so that ''2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; n ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt;''.

[[Huffman coding]] is a more sophisticated technique for constructing variable-length prefix codes. The Huffman coding algorithm takes as input the frequencies that the code words should have, and constructs a prefix code that minimizes the weighted average of the code word lengths. (This is closely related to minimizing the entropy.) This is a form of [[lossless data compression]] based on [[entropy encoding]].

Some codes mark the end of a code word with a special "comma" symbol, different from normal data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperial.ac.uk/research/hep/group/theses/JJones.pdf "Development of Trigger and Control Systems for CMS"] by J. A. Jones: "Synchronisation" p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This is somewhat analogous to the spaces between words in a sentence; they mark where one word ends and another begins. If every code word ends in a comma, and the comma does not appear elsewhere in a code word, the code is automatically prefix-free. However, modern communication systems send everything as sequences of "1" and "0"&amp;nbsp;– adding a third symbol would be expensive, and using it only at the ends of words would be inefficient. [[Morse code]] is an everyday example of a variable-length code with a comma. The long pauses between letters, and the even longer pauses between words, help people recognize where one letter (or word) ends, and the next begins. Similarly, [[Fibonacci coding]] uses a "11" to mark the end of every code word.

[[Self-synchronizing code]]s are prefix codes that allow [[frame synchronization]].

==Related concepts==
A '''suffix code''' is a set of words none of which is a suffix of any other; equivalently, a set of words which are the reverse of a prefix code.  As with a prefix code, the representation of a string as a concatenation of such words is unique.  A '''bifix code''' is a set of words which is both a prefix and a suffix code.&lt;ref name=BPR58&gt;Berstel et al (2010) p.58&lt;/ref&gt;
An '''optimal prefix code''' is a prefix code with minimal average length. That is, assume an alphabet of {{mvar|n}} symbols with probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(A_i)&lt;/math&gt; for a prefix code {{mvar|C}}. If {{mvar|C'}} is another prefix code and &lt;math&gt;\lambda'_i&lt;/math&gt; are the lengths of the codewords of {{mvar|C'}}, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n { \lambda_i p(A_i) } \leq \sum_{i=1}^n { \lambda'_i p(A_i) } \!&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/423/lecture2.pdf McGill COMP 423 Lecture notes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prefix codes in use today==
Examples of prefix codes include:
* variable-length [[Huffman coding|Huffman codes]]
* [[country calling codes]]
* [[Chen–Ho encoding]]
* the country and publisher parts of [[ISBN]]s
* the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA]] 3G Wireless Standard
* [[VCR Plus|VCR Plus+ codes]]
* [[Unicode Transformation Format]], in particular the [[UTF-8]] system for encoding [[Unicode]] characters, which is both a prefix-free code and a [[self-synchronizing code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4289">{{For|the use of the term '''principal value''' in describing improper integrals|Cauchy principal value}}
{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}

In [[complex analysis]], the '''principal values''' of a [[multivalued function]] are the values along one chosen [[branch (mathematics)|branch]] of that function, so that it is [[Single-valued function|single-valued]]. The simplest case arises in taking the [[square root]] of a positive [[real number|real]] number. For example, 4 has two square roots: 2 and –2; of these the positive root, 2, is considered the principal root and is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Motivation==
Consider the [[complex logarithm]] function log ''z''. It is defined as the [[complex number]] ''w'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;e^w = z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Now, for example, say we wish to find log i. This means we want to solve
:&lt;math&gt;e^w = i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
for ''w''. Clearly iπ/2 is a solution. But is it the only solution?

Of course, there are other solutions, which is evidenced by considering the position of i in the [[complex plane]] and in particular its [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] arg ''i''. We can rotate counterclockwise π/2 radians from 1 to reach i initially, but if we rotate further another 2π we reach i again. So, we can conclude that i(π/2 + 2π) is ''also'' a solution for log i. It becomes clear that we can add any multiple of 2πi to our initial solution to obtain all values for log i.

But this has a consequence that may be surprising in comparison of real valued functions: log i does not have one definite value! For log ''z'', we have
:&lt;math&gt; \log{z} =  \ln{|z|} + i\left(\mathrm{arg}\ z \right)
= \ln{|z|} + i\left(\mathrm{Arg}\ z+2\pi k\right) &lt;/math&gt;
for an integer ''k'', where Arg ''z'' is the (principal) argument of ''z'' defined to lie in the interval &lt;math&gt; (-\pi,\  \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Each value of ''k'' determines what is known as a ''[[branch (mathematics)|branch]]'' (or ''sheet''), a single-valued component of the multiple-valued log function.

The branch corresponding to ''k''=0 is known as the ''principal branch'', and along this branch, the values the function takes are known as the ''principal values''.

==General case==
In general, if ''f''(''z'') is multiple-valued, the principal branch of ''f'' is denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pv}\ f(z)&lt;/math&gt;
such that for ''z'' in the domain of ''f'', pv ''f''(''z'') is single-valued.

===Principal values of standard functions===
Complex valued [[List of mathematical functions|elementary functions]] can be multiple valued over some domains. The principal value of some of these functions can be obtained by decomposing the function into simpler ones whereby the principal value of the simple functions are straightforward to obtain.

====Logarithm function====
We have examined the [[logarithm function]] above, i.e., 
:&lt;math&gt;\log{z} = \ln{|z|} + i\left(\mathrm{arg}\ z\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Now, arg ''z'' is intrinsically multivalued. One often defines the argument of some complex number to be between -π (exclusive) and  π (inclusive), so we take this to be the principal value of the argument, and we write the argument function on this branch Arg ''z'' (with the leading capital A). Using Arg ''z'' instead of arg ''z'', we obtain the principal value of the logarithm, and we write
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pv}\ \log{z} = \mathrm{Log}\ z = \ln{|z|} + i\left(\mathrm{Arg}\ z\right).&lt;/math&gt;

====Square root====
For a [[complex number]] &lt;math&gt;z=r e^{\phi i}\,&lt;/math&gt; the principal value of the [[square root]] is: 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pv} \sqrt{z} = \sqrt{r} \, e^{i \phi / 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Arg (mathematics)|argument]] &lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; \phi \le \pi \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Complex argument====
[[File:Atan2atan.png|right|thumb|comparison of [[Inverse trigonometric functions|atan]] and [[atan2]] functions]]

The principal value of [[Arg (mathematics)|complex number argument]] measured in [[radian]]s can be defined as:
* values in the range [0, 2π) 
* values in the range (-π, π]. 

To compute these values one can use functions :
* [[atan2]] with principal value in  the range (-π, π]
* [[Inverse trigonometric functions|atan]]  with principal value in  the range (-π/2, π/2]

In [[linear algebra]], a [[square matrix|square]] [[nonnegative matrix]] &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''productive''', or to be a '''Leontief matrix''', if there exists a &lt;math&gt;  n \times 1 &lt;/math&gt; nonnegative [[column matrix]] &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt;  such as &lt;math&gt; P-AP &lt;/math&gt; is a [[positive matrix]].

==History==

The concept of productive matrix was developed by the economist [[Wassily Leontief]] ([[Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1973) in order to model and analyze the relations between the different sectors of an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Minju, [http://www.unc.edu/~marzuola/Math547_S13/Math547_S13_Projects/M_Kim_Section001_Leontief_IO_Model.pdf Leontief Input-Output Model (Application of Linear Algebra to Economics)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215221356/http://www.unc.edu/~marzuola/Math547_S13/Math547_S13_Projects/M_Kim_Section001_Leontief_IO_Model.pdf# |date=2014-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependency linkages between the latter can be examined by the [[input-output model]] with empirical data.

==Explicit definition==

The matrix &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathrm{M}_{n,n}(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is productive if and only if &lt;math&gt; A \geqslant 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \exists P \in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R), P&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such as &lt;math&gt;P-AP&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{r,c}(\R)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Matrix_(mathematics)#Notation|set of ''r''×''c'' matrices]] of [[real number]]s, whereas &lt;math&gt; &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt; indicates a positive and a [[nonnegative matrix]], respectively.

==Properties==
The following properties are proven e.g. in the textbook (Michel 1984).&lt;ref&gt;'''(fr)'''Philippe Michel, "9.2 Matrices productives", ''Cours de Mathématiques pour Economistes'', Édition Economica, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===
'''Theorem'''
A nonnegative matrix &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathrm{M}_{n,n}(\R)&lt;/math&gt; is productive if and only if &lt;math&gt;I_n - A&lt;/math&gt; is [[invertible matrix|invertible]] with a nonnegative inverse, where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[identity matrix]].

'''Proof'''

"If" :
:Let &lt;math&gt;I_n-A&lt;/math&gt; be invertible with a nonnegative inverse,
:Let &lt;math&gt;U \in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R)&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary column matrix with &lt;math&gt;U&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
:Then the matrix &lt;math&gt;P = (I_n - A)^{-1}U&lt;/math&gt; is nonnegative since it is the product of two nonnegative matrices.
:Moreover, &lt;math&gt;P - AP = (I_n - A) P = (I_n - A) (I_n - A)^{-1} U = U &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
:Therefore &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is productive.
"Only if" :
:Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be productive, let &lt;math&gt;P &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;V = P - AP &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
:The proof proceeds by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. 
:First, assume for contradiction &lt;math&gt;I_n - A&lt;/math&gt; is [[singular matrix|singular]].
::The [[endomorphism]] canonically associated with &lt;math&gt;I_n - A&lt;/math&gt; can not be [[injective]] by singularity of the matrix.
::Thus some non-zero column matrix &lt;math&gt;Z\in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R)&lt;/math&gt; exists such that &lt;math&gt;(I_n - A) Z = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
::The matrix &lt;math&gt;-Z&lt;/math&gt; has the same properties as &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, therefore we can choose &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; as an element of the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] with at least one positive entry.
::Hence &lt;math&gt;c = \sup_{i \in [|1,n|]}\frac{z_i}{p_i}&lt;/math&gt; is nonnegative and reached with at least one value &lt;math&gt;k \in [|1,n|]&lt;/math&gt;.
::By definition of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, we can infer that:
:::&lt;math&gt;cv_k = c (p_k - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}p_i) = cp_k -  \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}cp_i&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;cp_k = z_k = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}z_i&lt;/math&gt;, using that &lt;math&gt;Z = AZ&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
::Thus &lt;math&gt; cv_k = \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki} (z_i - cp_i) \leq\ 0&lt;/math&gt;, using that &lt;math&gt;z_i \leq cp_i&lt;/math&gt; by definition of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.
::This contradicts &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_k &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, hence &lt;math&gt;I_n - A&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily invertible.
:Second, assume for contradiction &lt;math&gt;I_n - A&lt;/math&gt; is invertible but with at least one negative entry in its inverse.
::Hence &lt;math&gt;\exists X \in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R), X  \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt; such that there is at least one negative entry in &lt;math&gt;Y = (I_n - A)^{-1} X&lt;/math&gt;.
::Then &lt;math&gt;c = \sup_{i \in [|1,n|]}-\frac{y_i}{p_i}&lt;/math&gt; is positive and reached with at least one value &lt;math&gt;k \in [|1,n|]&lt;/math&gt;.
::By definition of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we can infer that:
:::&lt;math&gt;cv_k = c (p_k - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}p_i) = -y_k  -\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}cp_i&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;x_k = y_k - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}y_i&lt;/math&gt;, using that &lt;math&gt;X = (I_n-A)Y&lt;/math&gt; by construction
:::&lt;math&gt;cv_k + x_k = - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki} (cp_i + y_i) \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt; using that &lt;math&gt;-y_i \leqslant cp_i&lt;/math&gt; by definition of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.
::Thus &lt;math&gt;x_k \leq - cv_k &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting &lt;math&gt;X \geqslant 0&lt;/math&gt;.
::Therefore &lt;math&gt;(I_n - A)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is necessarily nonnegative.

===Transposition===
'''Proposition'''
The [[transpose]] of a productive matrix is productive.

'''Proof'''

:Let &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathrm{M}_{n,n}(\R)&lt;/math&gt; a productive matrix.
:Then &lt;math&gt;(I_n - A)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; exists and is nonnegative.
:Yet &lt;math&gt;(I_n - A^T)^{-1} = ((I_n - A)^T)^{-1} = ((I_n - A)^{-1})^T&lt;/math&gt;
:Hence &lt;math&gt;(I_n - A^T)&lt;/math&gt; is invertible with a nonnegative inverse.
:Therefore &lt;math&gt;A^T&lt;/math&gt; is productive.

==Application==

{{Main article|Input-output analysis}}

With a matrix approach of the [[input-output model]], the consumption matrix is productive if it is economically  viable and if the latter and the demand vector are nonnegative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11587">The '''Schoenflies''' (or '''Schönflies''') '''notation''', named after the [[Germans|German]] mathematician [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], is one of two conventions commonly used to describe [[point group]]s. This notation is used in [[spectroscopy]]. The other convention is the [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], also known as the international notation. A point group in the Schoenflies convention is completely adequate to describe the symmetry of a molecule; this is sufficient for spectroscopy. The Hermann–Mauguin notation is able to describe the [[space group]] of a crystal lattice, while the Schoenflies notation isn't. Thus the Hermann–Mauguin notation is used in [[crystallography]].

==Symmetry elements==
Symmetry elements are denoted by '''i''' for centers of inversion, '''C''' for proper rotation axes, '''σ''' for mirror planes, and '''S''' for improper rotation axes ([[rotation-reflection axes]]). '''C''' and '''S''' are usually followed by a subscript number (abstractly denoted '''n''') denoting the order of rotation possible.

By convention, the axis of proper rotation of greatest order is defined as the principal axis. All other symmetry elements are described in relation to it.  A vertical mirror plane (containing the principal axis) is denoted '''σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'''; a horizontal mirror plane (perpendicular to the principal axis) is denoted '''σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Point groups==
In three dimensions, there are an infinite number of point groups, but all of them can be classified by several families. 

*''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[cyclic group|cyclic]]) has an ''n''-fold rotation axis. 
:*''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (''horizontal plane''). 
:*''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of ''n'' mirror planes containing the axis of rotation (''vertical planes''). 
*''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for ''Spiegel'', German for [[mirror]]) contains only a 2''n''-fold [[rotation-reflection axis]]. The index should be even because when ''n'' is odd an ''n''-fold rotation-reflection axis is equivalent to a combination of an ''n''-fold rotation axis and a perpendicular plane, hence ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' for odd ''n''.
*''C&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' has only a [[Improper rotation|rotoinversion axis]]. These symbols are redundant, because any rotoinversion axis can be expressed as rotation-reflection axis, hence for odd ''n'' ''C&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;2ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', and for even ''n'' ''C&lt;sub&gt;2ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Only ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is conventionally used, but in some texts you can see symbols like ''C&lt;sub&gt;3i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;5i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[dihedral group|dihedral]], or two-sided) has an ''n''-fold rotation axis plus ''n'' twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. 
:*''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition, a horizontal mirror plane and, as a consequence, also ''n'' vertical mirror planes each containing the ''n''-fold axis and one of the twofold axes.
:*''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition to the elements of ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''n'' vertical mirror planes which pass between twofold axes (''diagonal planes'').
* ''T'' (the chiral [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] group) has the rotation axes of a tetrahedron (three 2-fold axes and four 3-fold axes). 
:*''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes diagonal mirror planes (each diagonal plane contains only one twofold axis and passes between two other twofold axes, as in ''D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt;''). This addition of diagonal planes results in three improper rotation operations '''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'''.
:*''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes three horizontal mirror planes. Each plane contains two twofold axes and is perpendicular to the third twofold axis, which results in inversion center '''i'''.
* ''O'' (the chiral [[octahedron|octahedral]] group) has the rotation axes of an octahedron or [[cube]] (three 4-fold axes, four 3-fold axes, and six diagonal 2-fold axes).
:*''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes horizontal mirror planes and, as a consequence, vertical mirror planes. It contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
* ''I'' (the chiral [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] group) indicates that the group has the rotation axes of an icosahedron or [[dodecahedron]] (six 5-fold axes, ten 3-fold axes, and 15 2-fold axes).
:*''I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes horizontal mirror planes and contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
&lt;!-- I think, it shouldn't be here: 
It is important to note that the 'plane' in the definition of the rotation-reflection (alternating) axis of symmetry is '''not necessarily''' a mirror plane of the group in which the axis exists.  The ''S'' groups, for example, have no mirror planes. 
May be it should go to Improper rotation page? --&gt;
All groups that do not contain several higher-order axes (order 3 or more) can be arranged in a table, as shown below; symbols marked in red should not be used.

In crystallography, due to the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], ''n'' is restricted to the values of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. The noncrystallographic groups are shown with grayed backgrounds. ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;6''d''&lt;/sub&gt; are also forbidden because they contain [[improper rotation]]s with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus ''T'', ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''O'' and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; constitute 32 [[crystallographic point groups]].  

Groups with ''n = ∞'' are called limit groups or [[Curie group]]s. There are two more limit groups, not listed in the table: ''K'' (for ''Kugel'', German for ball, sphere), the group of all rotations in 3-dimensional space; and ''K&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', the group of all rotations and reflections. In mathematics and theoretical physics they are known respectively as the ''[[special orthogonal group]]'' and the ''[[orthogonal group]]'' in three-dimensional space, with the symbols SO(3) and O(3).

== Space groups ==
The [[List of space groups#List|space groups]] with given point group are numbered  by 1, 2, 3, ...  (in the same order as their international number) and this number is added as a superscript to the Schönflies symbol for the corresponding point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose point group is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have Schönflies symbols ''C''{{sup sub|1|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|2|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|3|2}}. 

While in case of point groups, Schönflies symbol defines the symmetry elements of group unambiguously, the additional superscript for space group doesn't have any information about translational symmetry of space group (lattice centering, translational components of axes and planes), hence one needs to refer to special tables, containing information about correspondence between Schönflies and [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]. Such table is given in [[List of space groups]] page.

In [[geometry]], the '''semidiameter''' or '''semi-diameter''' of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[point (geometry)|point]]s may be one half of its  [[diameter]]; or, sometimes, one half of its extent along a particular direction.

==Special cases==
The semi-diameter of a [[sphere]], [[circle]], or [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] is the same thing as its [[radius (geometry)|radius]] — namely, any [[line segment]] from the [[Center (algebra)|center]] to its [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. 

The semi-diameters of a non-circular [[ellipse]] are the halves of its extents along the two [[axis of symmetry|axes of symmetry]].  They are the parameters ''a'', ''b'' of the [[implicit function|implicit equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^{2}=1.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise, the semi-diameters of an [[ellipsoid]] are the parameters ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' of its implicit equation
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{z}{c}\right)^{2}=1.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The semi-diameters of a [[superellipse]], [[superellipsoid]], or [[superquadric]] can be identified in the same way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14353">The '''set cover problem''' is a classical question in [[combinatorics]], [[computer science]] and [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]. It is one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]] shown to be [[NP-complete]] in 1972.

It is a problem "whose study has led to the development of fundamental techniques for the entire field" of [[approximation algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vazirani|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a set of elements &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt; (called the [[universe (mathematics)|universe]]) and a collection &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; sets whose [[union (set theory)|union]] equals the universe, the set cover problem is to identify the smallest sub-collection of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; whose union equals the universe.  For example, consider the universe &lt;math&gt;U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}&lt;/math&gt; and the collection of sets &lt;math&gt;S = \{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{3, 4\}, \{4, 5\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly the union of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can cover all of the elements with the following, smaller number of sets: &lt;math&gt;\{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{4, 5\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

More formally, given a universe &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; and a family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;,
a ''cover'' is a subfamily &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of sets whose union is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. In the set covering [[decision problem]], the input is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt; and an integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;; the question is whether
there is a set covering of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; or less. In the set covering [[optimization problem]], the input is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt;, and the task is to find a set covering that uses the fewest sets.

The decision version of set covering is [[NP-complete]], and the optimization/search version of set cover is [[NP-hard]].{{sfn |Korte|Vygen|2012|p=414}}

If each set is assigned a cost, it becomes a ''weighted'' set cover problem.

{{Covering-Packing Problem Pairs}}

==Integer linear program formulation==
The minimum set cover problem can be formulated as the following [[integer linear program]] (ILP).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vazirani|2001|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{|
| minimize
| &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S \in \mathcal S} x_S&lt;/math&gt;
|
| (minimize the number of sets)
|-
| subject to
| &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S\colon e \in S} x_S \geqslant 1 &lt;/math&gt;
| for all &lt;math&gt;e\in \mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;
| (cover every element of the universe)
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;x_S \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
| for all &lt;math&gt;S\in \mathcal S&lt;/math&gt;.
| (every set is either in the set cover or not)
|}
This ILP belongs to the more general class of ILPs for [[covering problem]]s.
The [[Linear programming relaxation#Approximation and integrality gap|integrality gap]] of this ILP is at most &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \log n&lt;/math&gt;, so its [[Linear programming relaxation|relaxation]] gives a factor-&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \log n&lt;/math&gt; [[approximation algorithm]] for the minimum set cover problem (where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vazirani|2001|pp=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In weighted set cover, the sets are assigned weights. Denote the weight of set &lt;math&gt;S\in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;w_{S}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the integer linear program describing weighted set cover is identical to the one given above, except that the objective function to minimize is &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S \in \mathcal S} w_S x_S&lt;/math&gt;.

== Hitting set formulation ==
Set covering is equivalent to the '''hitting set problem'''. That is seen by observing that an instance of set covering can
be viewed as an arbitrary [[bipartite graph]], with sets represented by vertices on the left, the universe represented by vertices on the
right, and edges representing the inclusion of elements in sets. The task is then to find a minimum cardinality subset of left-vertices which covers all of the right-vertices. In the Hitting set problem, the objective is to cover the left-vertices using a minimum subset of the right vertices. Converting from one problem to the other is therefore achieved by interchanging the two sets of vertices.

== Greedy algorithm ==

There is a [[greedy algorithm]] for polynomial time approximation of set covering that chooses sets according to one rule: at each stage, choose the set that contains the largest number of uncovered elements. It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;Chvatal, V. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3689577 A Greedy Heuristic for the Set-Covering Problem]. Mathematics of Operations Research
Vol. 4, No. 3 (Aug., 1979), pp. 233-235&lt;/ref&gt; that this algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the set to be covered. In other words, it finds a covering that may be &lt;math&gt;H(n)&lt;/math&gt; times as large as the minimum one, where &lt;math&gt;H(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[harmonic number]]:

:&lt;math&gt; H(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} \le \ln{n} +1&lt;/math&gt;

This greedy algorithm actually achieves an approximation ratio of &lt;math&gt;H(s^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum cardinality set of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\delta-&lt;/math&gt;dense instances, however, there exists a &lt;math&gt;c \ln{m}&lt;/math&gt;-approximation algorithm for every &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Karpinski|Zelikovsky|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SetCoverGreedy.gif|frame|Tight example for the greedy algorithm with k=3]]

There is a standard example on which the greedy algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of &lt;math&gt;\log_2(n)/2&lt;/math&gt;.
The universe consists of &lt;math&gt;n=2^{(k+1)}-2&lt;/math&gt; elements. The set system consists of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; pairwise disjoint sets 
&lt;math&gt;S_1,\ldots,S_k&lt;/math&gt; with sizes &lt;math&gt;2,4,8,\ldots,2^k&lt;/math&gt; respectively, as well as two additional disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;T_0,T_1&lt;/math&gt;,
each of which contains half of the elements from each &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt;. On this input, the greedy algorithm takes the sets
&lt;math&gt;S_k,\ldots,S_1&lt;/math&gt;, in that order, while the optimal solution consists only of &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.
An example of such an input for &lt;math&gt;k=3&lt;/math&gt; is pictured on the right.

Inapproximability results show that the greedy algorithm is essentially the best-possible polynomial time approximation algorithm for set cover up to lower order terms
(see [[Set cover problem#Inapproximability results|Inapproximability results]] below), under plausible complexity assumptions. A tighter analysis for the greedy algorithm shows that the approximation ratio is exactly &lt;math&gt;\ln{n} - \ln{\ln{n}} + \Theta(1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Slavík Petr  [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=237991 A tight analysis of the greedy algorithm for set cover]. STOC'96, Pages 435-441, doi:10.1145/237814.237991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Low-frequency systems ==

If each element occurs in at most {{var|f}} sets, then a solution can be found in polynomial time that approximates the optimum to within a factor of {{var|f}} using [[Linear programming relaxation|LP relaxation]].

If the constraint &lt;math&gt;x_S\in\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;x_S \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all {{var|S}} in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; in the integer linear program shown [[#Integer linear program formulation|above]], then it becomes a (non-integer) linear program {{var|L}}. The algorithm can be described as follows:
# Find an optimal solution {{var|O}} for the program {{var|L}} using some polynomial-time method of solving linear programs.
# Pick all sets {{var|S}} for which the corresponding variable {{var|x}}&lt;sub&gt;{{var|S}}&lt;/sub&gt; has value at least 1/{{var|f}} in the solution {{var|O}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vazirani|2001|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inapproximability results ==

When &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; refers to the size of the universe, {{harvtxt |Lund|Yannakakis|1994}} showed that set covering cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within a factor of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}\log_2{n} \approx 0.72\ln{n}&lt;/math&gt;, unless '''NP''' has [[quasi-polynomial time]] algorithms. [[Uriel Feige|Feige]] (1998) improved this lower bound to &lt;math&gt;\bigl(1-o(1)\bigr)\cdot\ln{n}&lt;/math&gt; under the same assumptions, which essentially matches the approximation ratio achieved by the greedy algorithm. {{harvtxt |Raz|Safra|1997}} established a lower bound
of &lt;math&gt;c\cdot\ln{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a certain constant, under the weaker assumption that '''P'''&lt;math&gt;\not=&lt;/math&gt;'''NP'''.
A similar result with a higher value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; was recently proved by {{harvtxt |Alon|Moshkovitz|Safra|2006}}. {{harvtxt |Dinur|Steurer|2013}} showed optimal inapproximability by proving that it cannot be approximated to &lt;math&gt;\bigl(1 - o(1)\bigr) \cdot \ln{n}&lt;/math&gt; unless '''P'''&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;'''NP'''.

== Weighted set cover ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}

[[Linear programming relaxation|Relaxing]] the integer linear program for weighted set cover stated [[#Integer linear program formulation|above]], one may use [[randomized rounding]] to get an &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;-factor approximation. The corresponding analysis for nonweighted set cover is outlined in [[Randomized rounding#Randomized-rounding algorithm for set cover]] and can be adapted to the weighted case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vazirani|2001|loc=Chapter 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational complexity theory]], '''#SAT''', or '''Sharp-SAT''', a [[function problem]] related to the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], is the problem of counting the number of satisfying assignments of a given Boolean formula. It is well-known example for the class of [[Counting_problem_(complexity)|counting problem]]s, which are of special interest in computational complexity theory.

It is a [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]] problem, as any NP machine can be encoded into a Boolean formula by a process similar to that in [[Cook's theorem]], such that the number of satisfying assignments of the Boolean formula is equal to the number of accepting paths of the NP machine. Any formula in SAT [[3SAT|can be rewritten]] as a formula in 3-[[conjunctive normal form|CNF]] form preserving the number of satisfying assignments, and so #SAT and #3SAT are equivalent and #3SAT is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]] as well.

==Intractable special cases==

Model-counting is intractable in many special cases for which satisfiability is tractable. This includes the following.
* sets of Horn clauses
* sets of 2-literal clauses

==Tractable special cases==

Model-counting is tractable (solvable in polynomial time) for (ordered) [[Binary Decision Diagram|BDDs]] and for d-DNNFs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2779">In [[mathematics]], a '''standard Borel space''' is the [[Borel set#Standard Borel spaces and Kuratowski theorems|Borel space]] associated to a [[Polish space]].  Discounting Borel spaces of discrete Polish spaces, there is, up to isomorphism, only one standard Borel space.

==Formal definition==
A [[measurable space]] {{math|(''X'', Σ)}} is said to be "standard Borel" if there exists a metric on  {{math|''X''}} which makes it a complete separable metric space in such a way that {{math|Σ}} is then the Borel σ-algebra.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, G.W. (1957): Borel structure in groups and their duals. Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 85, 134-165.&lt;/ref&gt;
Standard Borel spaces have several useful properties that do not hold for general measurable spaces.

==Properties==
*If {{math|(''X'', Σ)}} and {{math|(''Y'', Τ)}} are standard Borel then any bijective [[Measurable function|measurable mapping]] &lt;math&gt;f : (X, \Sigma) \rightarrow (Y, \Tau)&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism (i.e., the inverse mapping is also measurable).  This follows from [[analytic set | Souslin's theorem]], as a set that is both [[Analytic set|analytic]] and [[coanalytic]] is necessarily Borel.
*If {{math|(''X'', Σ)}} and {{math|(''Y'', Τ)}}  are standard Borel spaces and &lt;math&gt;f:X  \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; then {{math|''f''}} is measurable if and only if the graph of {{math|''f''}} is Borel.
*The product and direct union of a countable family of standard Borel spaces are standard.
*Every [[Complete measure|complete]] [[probability measure]] on a standard Borel space turns it into a [[standard probability space]].

==Kuratowski's theorem==
'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a [[Polish space]], that is, a topological space such that there is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] ''d'' on ''X'' which defines the topology of ''X'' and which makes ''X'' a complete [[separable space|separable]] metric space.  Then ''X'' as a Borel space is [[Borel isomorphism|Borel isomorphic]] to one of
(1) '''R''', (2) '''Z''' or (3) a finite space. (This result is reminiscent of [[Maharam's theorem]].)

It follows that a standard Borel space is characterized up to isomorphism by its cardinality,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Srivastava| first=S.M. | title=A Course on Borel Sets |  year=1991 | publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] | isbn=0-387-98412-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that any uncountable standard Borel space has the cardinality of the continuum.

Borel isomorphisms on standard Borel spaces are analogous to [[homeomorphism]]s on [[topological space]]s: both are bijective and closed under composition, and a homeomorphism and its inverse are both [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]], instead of both being only Borel measurable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9433">In [[graph theory]], a '''string graph''' is an [[intersection graph]] of [[curve]]s in the plane; each curve is called a "string". Given a graph ''G'', ''G'' is a string graph if and only if there exists a set of curves, or strings, drawn in the plane such that no three strings intersect at a single point and such that the graph having a vertex for each curve and an edge for each intersecting pair of curves is isomorphic to ''G''.

== Background ==
{{harvs|txt|last=Benzer|first=Seymour|authorlink=Seymour Benzer|year=1959}} described a concept similar to string graphs as they applied to genetic structures. In that context, he also posed the specific case of intersecting intervals on a line, namely the now classical family of [[interval graph]]s. Later, {{harvtxt|Sinden|1966}} specified the same idea to electrical networks and printed circuits. The mathematical study of string graphs began with the paper {{harvtxt|Ehrlich|Even|Tarjan|1976}} and 
through a collaboration between Sinden and [[Ronald Graham]], where the characterization of string graphs eventually came to be posed as an open question at the 5th Hungarian Colloquium on Combinatorics in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Graham|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recognition of string graphs was eventually proven to be [[NP-complete]], implying that no simple characterization is likely to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kratochvil|1991b}} showed string graph recognition to be NP-hard, but was not able to show that it could be solved in NP. After intermediate results by {{harvtxt|Schaefer|Štefankovič|2001}} and {{harvtxt|Pach|Tóth|2002}}, {{harvtxt|Schaefer|Sedgwick|Štefankovič|2003}} completed the proof that the problem is NP-complete.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related graph classes==
[[File:Planar string graph.svg|thumb|300px|Representation of a [[planar graph]] as a string graph.]]
Every [[planar graph]] is a string graph:&lt;ref name="ss-s"&gt;{{harvtxt|Schaefer|Štefankovič|2001}} credit this observation to {{harvtxt|Sinden|1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; one may form a string graph representation of an arbitrary plane-embedded graph by drawing a string for each vertex that loops around the vertex and around the midpoint of each adjacent edge, as shown in the figure. For any edge ''uv'' of the graph, the strings for ''u'' and ''v'' cross each other twice near the midpoint of ''uv'', and there are no other crossings, so the pairs of strings that cross represent exactly the adjacent pairs of vertices of the original planar graph. Alternatively, by the [[circle packing theorem]], any planar graph may be represented as a collection of circles, any two of which cross if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent; these circles (with a starting and ending point chosen to turn them into open curves) provide a string graph representation of the given planar graph. {{harvtxt|Chalopin|Gonçalves|Ochem|2007}} proved that every planar graph has a string representation in which each pair of strings has at most one crossing point, unlike the representations described above.
[[Scheinerman's conjecture]], now proven, is the even stronger statement that every planar graph may be represented by the intersection graph of straight line segments, a very special case of strings.

[[File:Subdivided K5.svg|thumb|180px|A subdivision of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; that is not a string graph.]]
If every edge of a given graph ''G'' is [[Subdivision (graph theory)|subdivided]], the resulting graph is a string graph if and only if ''G'' is planar. In particular, the subdivision of the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; shown in the illustration is not a string graph, because ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not planar.&lt;ref name="ss-s"/&gt;

Every [[circle graph]], as an intersection graph of line segments (the chords of a circle), is also a string graph. Every [[chordal graph]] may be represented as a string graph: chordal graphs are intersection graphs of subtrees of trees, and one may form a string representation of a chordal graph by forming a planar embedding of the corresponding tree and replacing each subtree by a string that traces around the subtree's edges.

The [[complement graph]] of every [[comparability graph]] is also a string graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golumbic|Rotem|Urrutia|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Lovász|1983}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fox|Pach|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other results==
{{harvtxt|Ehrlich|Even|Tarjan|1976}} showed computing the chromatic number of string graphs to be NP-hard. {{harvtxt|Kratochvil|1991a}} found that string graphs form an induced minor closed class, but not a minor closed class of graphs.

Every ''m''-edge string graph can be partitioned into two subsets, each a constant fraction the size of the whole graph, by the removal of ''O''(''m''&lt;sup&gt;3/4&lt;/sup&gt;log&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;''m'') edges. It follows that the [[Biclique-free graph|biclique-free string graphs]], string graphs containing no ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''t'',''t''&lt;/sub&gt; subgraph for some constant ''t'', have ''O''(''n'') edges and more strongly have [[bounded expansion|polynomial expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fox|Pach|2010}}; {{harvtxt|Dvořák|Norin|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1408">'''''The American Black Chamber''''' is a 1931 book by [[Herbert O. Yardley]]. The book describes the inner workings of the interwar American governmental cryptography organization called the [[Black Chamber]]. The cryptography historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] called the book "the most famous book on cryptology ever published." By describing the inner workings of the organization, the book created large interest public awareness of the United States's cryptographic abilities. In particular, the Japanese government became aware of the extent of experience the American government had with cryptography and increased the strength of their own knowledge in cryptography in response. Reviewers suggested the book may have cost the United States significantly in the Pacific theater against Japan in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David E.|title=Encyclopedia of Cryptography|year=1997|publisher=Instructional Horizons, Inc|location=Santa Barbara California|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Through and through''' describes a situation where an object, real or imaginary, passes completely through another object, also real or imaginary. The phrase has several common uses:

==Forensics==
'''Through and through''' is used in [[forensics]] to describe a bullet that has passed through a body, leaving both entry and exit wounds [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16258297 Example.].

==Printmaking==
An image may be '''through and through''' in the following cases:
*ink or paint has penetrated to the other side
*inlaying with another material, [[stained glass]], [[patchwork]], [[woodworking|woodwork]], [[linoleum]], [[marble]], etc.
*[[Wikt:carving|carving]] out (e.g. [[wood carving]]), cutting out, [[perforation]]: this may concern the outside [[shape]], shaped [[Punchhole|hole]]s, and patterns of holes (e.g. in a [[punched card]]; also a [[passport]] may have its number perforated in the pages, to make [[forgery]] more difficult).
*[[embroidery]] etc.

Through and through images are more durable; they do not easily wear off.

In the case that the image can be viewed from the other side, we see the [[mirror image]], just like in the case of a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] image, such as a drawing on a transparent sheet.

A sheet with a through and through image is [[Chirality (mathematics)|achiral]]. We can distinguish two cases:
*the sheet surface with the image has no axis of [[symmetry]] parallel to the axis of rotation – the two sides are the same (e.g. U on a page rotated L–R)
*the sheet surface with the image has an axis of symmetry parallel to the axis of rotation – the two sides are different (e.g. C on a page rotated L–R)

* a special case of [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] for a triangle, in which case it is known as a [[ternary plot]] or '''areal coordinates''', among other names,
* [[trilinear coordinates]], in which the coordinates of a point in a triangle are its relative distances from the three sides,

There is also a two-fluid model which helps explain the behavior of [[superfluid]] [[helium]].  This model states that there will be two components in liquid helium below its [[lambda point]] (the temperature where superfluid forms).  These components are a normal fluid and a superfluid component.  Each liquid has a different density and together their sum makes the total density, which remains constant.  The ratio of superfluid density to the total density increases as the temperature approaches absolute zero.
