'''Absolute space and time''' is a concept in physics and philosophy about the properties of the universe. In physics, absolute space and time may be a [[preferred frame]].

==Before Newton==
A version of the concept of absolute space (in the sense of a preferred frame{{clarify|date=August 2018|Reason=What is a preferred frame?}}) can be seen in [[Aristotelian physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/#2 Absolute and Relational Theories of Space and Motion]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. Westman]] writes that a "whiff" of absolute space can be observed in [[Copernicus]]' classic work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', where Copernicus uses the concept of an immobile sphere of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Westman, ''The Copernican Achievement'', University of California Press, 1975, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2018|reason=How is absolute spacetime illustrated by an immobile sphere of stars, and what does that mean anyway? (I know but I doubt the average reader does.) What "whiff" of absolute spacetime in De Revolutionibus? General reader (even one who knows generally about ''De revolutionibus'', and immobile spheres of stars) needs a less allusive explanation, or rather less comparing, and more clear, specific language.}}

==Newton==
Originally introduced by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', the concepts of absolute time and space provided a theoretical foundation that facilitated [[Newtonian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newton, absolute time and space respectively are independent aspects of objective reality:&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;In ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Newton, absolute time exists independently of any perceiver and progresses at a consistent pace throughout the universe. Unlike relative time, Newton believed absolute time was imperceptible and could only be understood mathematically. According to Newton, humans are only capable of perceiving relative time, which is a measurement of perceivable objects in motion (like the Moon or Sun). From these movements, we infer the passage of time.

{{quote|Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies: and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space ...

Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place into another: and relative motion, the translation from one relative place into another ...|Isaac Newton}}

These notions imply that absolute space and time do not depend upon physical events, but are a backdrop or stage setting within which physical phenomena occur. Thus, every object has an absolute state of motion relative to absolute space, so that an object must be either in a state of absolute [[Rest (physics)|rest]], or moving at some absolute [[speed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-iframes/ Space and Time: Inertial Frames (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; To support his views, Newton provided some empirical examples: according to Newton, a solitary rotating sphere can be inferred to rotate about its axis relative to absolute space by observing the bulging of its equator, and a solitary pair of spheres tied by a rope can be inferred to be in [[absolute rotation]] about their center of gravity ([[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]]) by observing the tension in the rope.

Absolute time and space continue to be used in [[classical mechanics]], but modern formulations by authors such as [[Walter Noll]] and [[Clifford Truesdell]] go beyond the [[linear algebra]] of [[elastic moduli]] to use [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]] for non-linear [[Field theory (physics)|field theories]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Truesdell (1977) ''A First Course in Rational Continuum Mechanics'', [[Academic Press]] {{ISBN|0-12-701301-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differing views==
[[Image:Rotating spheres.svg|thumb|200px|Two spheres orbiting around an axis. The spheres are distant enough for their effects on each other to be ignored, and they are held together by a rope. The rope is under tension if the bodies are rotating relative to absolute space according to [[Rotating spheres|Newton]], or because they rotate relative to the universe itself according to [[Mach's principle|Mach]], or because they rotate relative to local [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]] according to [[general relativity]].]]
Historically, there have been differing views on the concept of absolute space and time. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] was of the opinion that space made no sense except as the relative location of bodies, and time made no sense except as the relative movement of bodies.&lt;ref name="Ferraro"&gt;{{citation|title=Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|first1=Rafael|last1=Ferraro|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2007|isbn=9780387699462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]] suggested that, lacking any point of reference, a sphere in an otherwise empty universe could not be conceived to rotate, and a pair of spheres could be conceived to rotate relative to one another, but not to rotate about their center of gravity,&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book |title=The Matter Myth: Dramatic Discoveries that Challenge Our Understanding of Physical Reality |author= Paul Davies |author2= John Gribbin |page= 70 |isbn=0-7432-9091-7 |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlmEIGiZ0g4C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=universe+Milky++rotation#PPA70,M1   }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example later raised by [[Albert Einstein]] in his development of general relativity.

A more recent form of these objections was made by [[Ernst Mach]]. [[Mach's principle]] proposes that mechanics is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular, [[mass]] is an expression of such relative motion. So, for example, a single particle in a universe with no other bodies would have zero mass. According to Mach, Newton's examples simply illustrate relative rotation of spheres and the bulk of the universe.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Ernst Mach; as quoted by {{cite book |title=Gravitation and Inertia |author=Ignazio Ciufolini |author2=John Archibald Wheeler |pages=386‚Äì387 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYIs1ndbi38C&amp;pg=RA1-PA386&amp;dq=centrifugal+Einstein+rotating+globes#PRA1-PA387,M1 |isbn=0-691-03323-4 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When, accordingly, we say that a body preserves unchanged its direction and velocity ''in space'', our assertion is nothing more or less than an abbreviated reference to ''the entire universe''.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Ernst Mach; as quoted by [[Ignazio Ciufolini|Ciufolini]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler]]: ''Gravitation and Inertia'', p. 387&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These views opposing  absolute space and time may be seen from a modern stance as an attempt to introduce [[operational definition]]s for space and time, a perspective made explicit in the special theory of relativity.

Even within the context of Newtonian mechanics, the modern view is that absolute space is unnecessary. Instead, the notion of [[inertial frame of reference]] has taken precedence, that is, [[preferred frame|a preferred ''set'' of frames of reference]] that move uniformly with respect to one another. The laws of physics transform from one inertial frame to another according to [[Galilean invariance|Galilean relativity]], leading to the following objections to absolute space, as outlined by Milutin Blagojeviƒá:&lt;ref name="Blagojeviƒá2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gravitation and Gauge Symmetries |author=Milutin Blagojeviƒá |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8JDSi_eNbwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=inertial+frame+%22absolute+space%22#PPA5,M1 |isbn=0-7503-0767-6 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* The existence of absolute space contradicts the internal logic of classical mechanics since, according to Galilean principle of relativity, none of the inertial frames can be singled out.
* Absolute space does not explain inertial forces since they are related to acceleration with respect to any one of the inertial frames.
* Absolute space acts on physical objects by inducing their resistance to acceleration but it cannot be acted upon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newton himself recognized the role of inertial frames.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;Isaac Newton: ''Principia'', Corollary V, p. 88 in Andrew Motte translation. See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a practical matter, inertial frames often are taken as frames moving uniformly with respect to the [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref name=Moeller&gt;{{cite book |author=C M√∏ller |title=The Theory of Relativity |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford UK |isbn=0-19-560539-X |date=1976 |page=1 |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/220221617&amp;referer=brief_results |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Inertial frame of reference]] for more discussion on this.

==Special relativity==
The concepts of space and time were separate in physical theory prior to the advent of [[special relativity]] theory, which connected the two and showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame's motion. In Einstein's theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were superseded by the notion of [[spacetime]] in [[special relativity]], and curved spacetime in [[general relativity]].

Absolute simultaneity refers to the concurrence of events in time at different locations in space in a manner agreed upon in all frames of reference. The theory of relativity does not have a concept of absolute time because there is a [[relativity of simultaneity]]. An event that is simultaneous with another event in one frame of reference may be in the past or future of that event in a different frame of reference,&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|59}} which negates absolute simultaneity.

==Einstein==
{{Main article|Einstein's views on the aether}}
Quoted below from his later papers, Einstein identified the term [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] with "properties of space", a terminology that is not widely used. Einstein stated that in [[general relativity]] the "aether" is not absolute anymore, as the [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and therefore the structure of spacetime depends on the presence of matter.&lt;ref name=kostb&gt;{{Citation|author=Kostro, L.|title=Albert Einstein's New Ether and his General Relativity|journal=Proceedings of the Conference of Applied Differential Geometry|pages=78‚Äì86|date=2001|url=http://www.mathem.pub.ro/proc/bsgp-10/0KOSTRO.PDF|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802120105/http://www.mathem.pub.ro/proc/bsgp-10/0KOSTRO.PDF|archivedate=2010-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view. For the mechanical behaviour of a corporeal system hovering freely in [[vacuum|empty space]] depends not only on relative positions (distances) and relative velocities, but also on its state of rotation, which physically may be taken as a characteristic not appertaining to the system in itself. In order to be able to look upon the rotation of the system, at least formally, as something real, Newton objectivises space. Since he classes his absolute space together with real things, for him rotation relative to an absolute space is also something real. Newton might no less well have called his absolute space ‚ÄúEther‚Äù; what is essential is merely that besides observable objects, another thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real, to enable [[acceleration]] or [[rotation]] to be looked upon as something real.|Albert Einstein, Ether and the Theory of Relativity (1920)&lt;ref name=einstb&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s:Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation|Because it was no longer possible to speak, in any absolute sense, of simultaneous states at different locations in the aether, the aether became, as it were, four-dimensional, since there was no objective way of ordering its states by time alone. According to special relativity too, the aether was absolute, since its influence on inertia and the propagation of light was thought of as being itself independent of physical influence....The theory of relativity resolved this problem by establishing the behaviour of the electrically neutral point-mass by the law of the geodetic line, according to which inertial and gravitational effects are no longer considered as separate. In doing so, it attached characteristics to the aether which vary from point to point, determining the metric and the dynamic behaviour of material points, and determined, in their turn, by physical factors, namely the distribution of mass/energy. Thus the aether of general relativity differs from those of classical mechanics and special relativity in that it is not ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô but determined, in its locally variable characteristics, by ponderable matter.|Albert Einstein, √úber den √Ñther (1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=A. Einstein | date=1924 | title=[[wikilivres:√úber den √Ñther|√úber den √Ñther]] | journal=Verhandlungen der Schweizerischen naturforschenden Gesellschaft | volume=105|issue=2|pages=85‚Äì93}}.

==General relativity==
Special relativity eliminates absolute time (although G√∂del and others suspect absolute time may be valid for some forms of general relativity)&lt;ref name="Savitt"&gt;{{citation|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven F.|title=There's No Time Like the Present (in Minkowski Spacetime)|doi=10.1086/392846|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=67|issue=S1|date=September 2000|citeseerx=10.1.1.14.6140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general relativity further reduces the physical scope of absolute space and time through the concept of [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]].&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|207‚Äì223}} There appears to be absolute space in relation to the [[celestial sphere|distant stars]] because the local geodesics eventually channel information from these stars, but it is not necessary to invoke absolute space with respect to any system's physics, as its local geodesics are sufficient to describe its spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mach's Principle II|first1=James G.|last1=Gilson|date=September 1, 2004|arxiv=physics/0409010|bibcode = 2004physics...9010G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Close Relationships}}'''Abusive power and control''' (also '''controlling behavior''', '''coercive control''' and '''sharp power''') is the way that an [[Abusive|abusive person]] gains and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]] and control over another person, as a victim, in order to subject that person to [[Psychological abuse|psychological]], [[Physical abuse|physical]], [[Sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[financial abuse]]. The motivations of the abuser are varied, such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluation]], [[envy]] or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers use tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism|economic abuse]] thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulators]] and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics, including [[positive reinforcement]] (such as [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], [[flattery]], [[ingratiation]], [[love bombing]], [[smiling]], [[gift]]s, attention), [[negative reinforcement]], intermittent or partial reinforcement, [[Punishment (psychology)|psychological punishment]] (such as [[nagging]], [[silent treatment]], [[profanity|swearing]], threats, [[intimidation]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[guilt trip]]s, inattention) and traumatic tactics (such as [[verbal abuse]] or [[explosive anger]]).&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ?

[[Isolation to facilitate abuse|Isolation]], [[gaslighting]], [[mind games]], [[lie|lying]], [[disinformation]], [[propaganda]], [[destabilisation]] and [[divide and rule]] are other strategies that are often used. The victim may be plied with alcohol or drugs to help disorientate them.

Certain personality types feel particularly compelled to control other people.

== Personality psychology ==
In the study of [[personality psychology]], certain [[personality disorders]] display characteristics involving the need to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] or control over others:&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Randy J., and [[David M. Buss]]. Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge about Human Nature. New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Those with [[antisocial personality disorder]] tend to display [[superficial charm|glibness]] and a [[grandiose]] sense of [[self-worth]]. Due to their [[shallow affect]] and lack of [[remorse]] or [[empathy]], they are well suited to con and/or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] others into complying with their wishes. 
* Those with [[histrionic personality disorder]] need to be the [[attention seeking|center of attention]]; and in turn, draw people in so they may use (and eventually dispose of) their relationship.  
* Those with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] have an inflated self-importance, hypersensitivity to [[criticism]] and a sense of [[entitlement]] that compels them to [[persuade]] others to comply with their requests. To maintain their [[self-esteem]], and protect their vulnerable [[true selves]], [[narcissists]] need to control others' behavior ‚Äì particularly that of [[Narcissistic parent|their children]] seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Those with [[sadistic personality disorder]] derive pleasure from the distress caused by their aggressive, demeaning and cruel behavior towards others. They have poor ability to control their reactions and become enraged by minor disturbances, with some sadists being more severely abusive. They use a wide range of behaviors to inappropriately control others, ranging from [[hostility|hostile glances]], [[threat]]s, [[humiliation]], [[coercion]], and restricting others' [[autonomy]]. Often the purpose of their behavior is to control and intimidate others.&lt;ref name="Raine pp. 126-128"&gt;Adrian Raine; Jos√© Sanmartin.&lt;/ref&gt; The sadistic individual are likely rigid in their beliefs, [[prejudice|intolerant]] of other [[race (human classification)|races]] or other "[[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]s", [[authoritarian]], and [[wikt:malevolent|malevolent]]. They may seek positions in which they are able to exert power over others, such as a [[judge]], [[army]] [[sergeant]] or [[psychiatrist]] who misuse their positions of power to control or brutalize others. For instance, a psychiatrist may institutionalize a patient by misusing [[mental health law|mental health legislation]].&lt;ref name="Raine pp. 126-128" /&gt;

== Control freaks==
{{Main|Control freak}}
Control freaks are often [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionists]]&lt;ref&gt;Michelle N. Lafrance, ''Women and Depression'' (2009) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; defending themselves against their own inner [[vulnerabilities]] in the belief that if they are not in total control they risk exposing themselves once more to childhood [[angst]].&lt;ref&gt;Art Horn, ''Face It'' (2004) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Such persons [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and [[Coercion|pressure]] others to change so as to avoid having to change themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and use power over others to escape an inner emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly and Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (Dorset 1999) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; When a control freak's pattern is broken, the controller is left with a terrible feeling of powerlessness but feeling their pain and fear brings them back to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Evans, ''Controlling People'' (Avon 2002) p. 129 and p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of personality-type theory, control freaks are very much the [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A]] personality, driven by the need to dominate and control.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Holmes/Dan Wilson, ''Pains in the Office'' (2004) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; An obsessive need to control others is also associated with [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Stout]], ''The Sociopath Next Door'' (2005) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological manipulation==
{{Main|Psychological manipulation}}
Braiker identified the following ways that manipulators control their victims:&lt;ref name="braiker"/&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or smile, and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: involves removing one from a negative situation as a reward, e.g. "You won't have to do your homework if you allow me to do this to you."
*[[Reinforcement#Schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], yelling, the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using [[verbal abuse]], [[explosive anger]], or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

Manipulators may have:&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt;
* a strong need to attain feelings of power and superiority in relationships with others
* a want and need to feel in control
* a desire to gain a feeling of power over others in order to raise their perception of [[self-esteem]].

===Emotional blackmail===
{{Main|Emotional blackmail}}
Emotional blackmail is a term coined by psychotherapist Susan Forward, about controlling people in relationships and the theory that [[fear]], [[obligation]] and guilt (FOG) are the [[Transactional analysis|transactional dynamics]] at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics are useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=R.

Forward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;Susan Forward/Donna Frazier, ''Emotional Blackmail'' (London 1997) p. 28, 82, 145, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different levels of demands - demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal [[integrity]], demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

===Silent treatment===
{{Main|Silent treatment}}
The silent treatment is sometimes used as a control mechanism.  When so used, it constitutes a [[passive-aggressive]] action characterized by the coupling of nonverbal but nonetheless unambiguous indications of the presence of negative emotion with the refusal to discuss the scenario triggering those emotions and, when those emotions' source is unclear to the other party, occasionally the refusal to clarify it or even to identify that source at all.  As a result, the perpetrator of the silent treatment denies the victim both the opportunity to negotiate an after-the-fact settlement of the grievance in question and the ability to modify his/her future behavior to avoid giving further offense.  In especially severe cases, even if the victim gives in and accedes to the perpetrator's initial demands, the perpetrator may continue the silent treatment so as to deny the victim feedback indicating that those demands have been satisfied.  The silent treatment thereby enables its perpetrator to cause hurt, [[Attention seeking|obtain ongoing attention]] in the form of repeated attempts by the victim to restore dialogue, maintain a position of power through creating uncertainty over how long the verbal silence and associated impossibility of resolution will last, and derive the satisfaction that the perpetrator associates with each of these consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Petra Boynton The Telegraph (26 Apr 2013) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10020662/Silent-treatment-how-to-snap-him-out-of-it.html Silent treatment: how to snap him out of it]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love bombing===

===Mind games===
{{Main|Mind games}}
One sense of mind games is a largely [[consciousness|conscious]] struggle for psychological [[one-upmanship]], often employing [[passive‚Äìaggressive behavior]] to specifically demoralize or dis-empower the thinking subject, making the aggressor look superior; also referred to as "power games".&lt;ref&gt;Gita Mammen, ''After Abuse'' (2006) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[intimate relationships]], mind games can be used to [[gaslighting|undermine one partner's belief in the validity of their own perceptions]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen J, Ferraro, ''Neither Angels nor Demons'' (2006) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Personal experience may be denied and driven from memory;&lt;ref&gt;[[R. D. Laing]], ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'' (Penguin 1984) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and such abusive mind games may extend to [[denial]] of the victim's reality, [[social undermining]], and the [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivializing]] of what is felt to be important.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Maguire, ''Where there's a Will there's a Way'' (London 2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Both sexes have equal opportunities for such verbal coercion,&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service'' (London 1997) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; which may be carried out unconsciously as a result of the need to maintain one's own self-deception.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divide and conquer===
{{Main article|Divide and rule|Narcissistic parent|Narcissism in the workplace}}
A primary strategy the [[narcissist]] uses to assert control, particularly within their family, is to create divisions among individuals. This weakens and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolates]] them, making it easier for the narcissist to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and dominate. Some are favoured, others are [[scapegoated]]. Such dynamics can play out in a workplace setting.&lt;ref&gt;Hall J [http://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/03/27/its-you-and-me-baby-narcissist-head-games/ It‚Äôs You and Me Baby: Narcissist Head Games] The Narcissist Family Files 27 Mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In an intimate relationship==
{{main|Intimate relationship|Battered person syndrome|Domestic violence|Intimate partner violence|}}

===Background===
The power and control "wheel" was developed in 1982 by the Domestic Abuse Program in Minneapolis to explain the nature of abuse, to delineate the forms of abuse used to control another person, and to educate people with the goal of stopping violence and abuse. The model is used in many batterer intervention programs, and is known as the [[Duluth model]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Joan McClennen PhD. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nHHWSsUvXwwC&amp;pg=PA147 Social Work and Family Violence: Theories, Assessment, and Intervention]''. Springer Publishing Company; 8 February 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-1133-3}}. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Power and control is generally present with violent physical and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7"&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85239/1/9789241564625_eng.pdf ''Global and regional estimates of violence against women: prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence.''] World Health Organization. 2013. {{ISBN|978-92-4-156462-5}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control development===
Often the abusers are initially attentive, [[Superficial charm|charming]] and loving, gaining the [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] of the individual that will ultimately become the victim, also known as the survivor. When there is a connection and a degree of trust, the abusers become unusually involved in their partner's feelings, thoughts and actions.&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt; Next, they set petty rules and exhibit "[[pathological jealousy]]". A [[Operant conditioning|conditioning process]] begins with alternation of loving followed by [[abusive]] behavior. According to ''Counselling Survivors of Domestic Abuse'', "These serve to confuse the survivor leading to potent conditioning processes that impact on the survivor's [[Self-concept|self-structure]] and [[Schema (psychology)|cognitive schemas]]." The abuser [[Psychological projection|projects]] responsibility for the abuse on to the victim, or survivor, and the denigration and negative projections become incorporated into the survivor's [[self-image]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson" /&gt;

[[Traumatic bonding]] occurs as the result of ongoing [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which the intermittent [[reinforcement]] of reward and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"/&gt;

Controlling abusers use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their partners. According to Jill Cory and Karen McAndless-Davis, authors of ''When Love Hurts: A Woman's Guide to Understanding Abuse in Relationships'': Each of the tactics within the power and control wheel are used to "maintain power and control in the relationship. No matter what tactics your partner uses, the effect is to control and [[intimidate]] you or to influence you to feel that you do not have an equal voice in the relationship."&lt;ref name="Cory p. 30" /&gt;

====Coercion and threats====
{{main|Coercion|threats}}

A tool for exerting control and power is the use of threats and coercion. The victim may be subject to threats that they will be left, hurt, or reported to welfare. The abuser may threaten that they will commit [[suicide]]. They may also coerce them to perform illegal actions or to drop charges that they may have against their abuser.&lt;ref name="Duluth model"&gt;[http://www.theduluthmodel.org/pdf/PowerandControl.pdf ''Power and Control.''] Duluth Model. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strangulation (domestic violence)|Strangulation]], a particularly pernicious abusive behavior in which the abuser literally has the victim‚Äôs life in his hands, is an extreme form of abusive control. Sorenson and colleagues have called strangulation the domestic violence equivalent of waterboarding, which is widely considered to be a form of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Joshi M, Sorenson SB. ‚ÄúDo you know what it feels like to drown?‚Äù: Strangulation as coercive control in intimate relationships. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 2014; 38, 124-137&lt;/ref&gt;

At its most effective, the abuser creates intimidation and [[fear]] through [[Operant conditioning|unpredictable and inconsistent behavior]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson"/&gt; Absolute control may be sought by any of four types of [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadists]]: explosive, enforcing, tyrannical, or spineless sadists. The victims are at risk of [[anxiety]], [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[shame]], [[low self-esteem]] and [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="Sanderson p. 25"&gt;Chrissie Sanderson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5vA42Opyx9cC&amp;pg=PA25 Counselling Survivors of Domestic Abuse]''. Jessica Kingsley Publishers; 15 June 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-84642-811-1}}. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intimidation====
{{main|Intimidation}}
Abused individuals may be intimidated by the brandishing of weapons, destruction of their property or other things, or use of gestures or looks to create fear.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt; For example, threatening to use a gun or simply displaying the weapon is a form of intimidation and coercive control.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson SB, Schut RA. Nonfatal gun use in intimate partner violence: a systematic review of the literature. Trauma Violence &amp; Abuse. 2016 Sep 14. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic abuse====
{{main|Economic abuse}}
An effective means of ensuring control and power over another is to control their access to money. One method is to prevent the abusee from getting or retaining a job. Controlling their access to money can also be done by withholding information and access to family income, taking their money, requiring the person to ask for money, giving them an allowance, or filing a [[power of attorney]] or [[conservatorship]], particularly in the case of [[Elder financial abuse|economic abuse of the elderly]].&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Emotional abuse====
{{main|Psychological abuse}}
Emotional abuse include [[name-calling]], playing [[mind games]], [[Victim blaming|putting the victim down]], or [[humiliating]] the individual. The goals are to make the person feel bad about themselves, feel [[Guilt trip|guilty]] or [[Gaslighting|think that they are crazy]].&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Isolation====
{{main|Isolation to facilitate abuse}}
Another element of psychological control is the isolation of the victim from the outside world.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7" /&gt; Isolation includes controlling a person's social activity: who they see, who they talk to, where they go, and any other method to limit their access to others. It may also include limiting what material is read.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt; It can include insisting on knowing where they are and requiring permission for medical care. The abuser exhibits hypersensitive and reactive jealousy.&lt;ref name="WHO 2013 p. 7" /&gt;

====Minimizing, denying and blaming====
{{main|Minimisation (psychology)|Denial|Victim blaming}}
The abuser may deny the abuse occurred to attempt to place the responsibility for their behavior on the victim. Minimizing concerns or the degree of the abuse is another aspect of this control.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Using children and pets====
Children may be used to exert control by the abuser threatening to take the children or making them feel guilty about the children. It could include [[harassing]] them during visitation or using the children to relay messages. Another controlling tactic is abusing pets.&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

====Using privilege====
{{main|Privilege (social inequality)}}
Using "privilege" means that the abuser defines the roles in the relationship, makes the important decisions, treats the individual like a servant and acts like the "master of the castle".&lt;ref name="Duluth model" /&gt;

==In the workplace==
{{See also|Workplace bullying}}
A power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Duthie_workplace-power-control-wheel_2013.pdf Power &amp; Control in the Workplace] American Institute on Domestic Violence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullying==

An essential prerequisite of bullying is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Children who are bullying or being bullied | work =Cambridgeshire County Council: Children and families | publisher =Cambridgeshire County Council | date =2013-07-24 | url =http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | accessdate =2013-10-28 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029215401/http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | archive-date =2013-10-29 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ericson | first =Nels | title =Addressing the Problem of Juvenile Bullying | journal =OJJDP Fact Sheet #FS-200127| volume =27 | publisher =U.S. Department of Justice: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention | date =June 2001 | url =https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/fs200127.pdf | accessdate = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace psychopaths==
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains power:&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
#  '''Entry''' ‚Äì psychopath will use highly developed [[social skills]] and [[Superficial charm|charm]] to obtain employment into an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee you might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. 
#  '''Assessment''' ‚Äì psychopath will weigh you up according to your usefulness, and you could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal [[Social influence|influence]] and will be easily manipulated) or a [[Patronage|patron]] (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks)
#  '''[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]]''' ‚Äì psychopath will create a scenario of "[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]" where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda.
#  '''Confrontation''' ‚Äì the psychopath will use techniques of [[character assassination]] to maintain his/her agenda, and you will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron
#  '''Ascension''' ‚Äì your role as a patron in the psychopath's quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them.

==Caring professions==
According to anti-bullying author and activist [[Tim Field]], bullies are attracted to the caring professions, such as medicine, by the opportunities to exercise power over [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] clients, and over vulnerable employees and students.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7340.786/a |title=Bullying in medicine |year=2002 |last1=Field |first1=T. |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7340 |pages=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional abuse==
{{main|Institutional abuse}}
Institutional abuse is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) from a system of power.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=J. L. |author2=A. Mooney |author3=M. Nunno|title=Institutional abuse: A review of the literature|journal=Journal of Child and Youth Care|year=1990|volume=4|issue=6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from acts similar to home-based child abuse, such as neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and hunger, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

==Human trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking}}
The use of coercion by perpetrators and traffickers involves the use of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of [[psychological stress]] induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics of coercion are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and [[indoctrination]].&lt;ref name=Hopper&gt;Hopper, E. and Hidalgo, J. (2006). Invisible chains: Psychological coercion of human trafficking victims. "Intercultural Human Rights Law, 1", 185-209.&lt;/ref&gt; During the initiation phase, traffickers use [[foot-in-the-door]] techniques of [[persuasion]] to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt; Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of [[childhood abuse]] to psychologically manipulate women and children into the trafficking industry.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, B. and Butler, L. D. (2013). Running a gauntlet: A review of victimization and violence in the pre-entry, post-entry, and peri-/post-exit periods of commercial sexual exploitation. ''Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, Advance online publication.'' {{DOI|10.1037/a0032977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a trafficker is to turn a human being into a slave. To do this, perpetrators employ tactics that can lead to the psychological consequence of [[learned helplessness]] for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], or withhold food or sleep.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and [[self-blame]], anger and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]], and sleep disturbances, [[PTSD]], numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Segerstron&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segerstron | first1 = S.

Children are especially vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking because they are so young. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy physical and mental health of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse.&lt;ref name=Rafferty2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Y | year = 2008 | title = The impact of trafficking on children: Psychological and social policy perspectives | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 13‚Äì18 | doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2008.00035.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stockholm syndrome]] is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.&lt;ref name=Rafferty1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Y | year = 2013 | title = Child trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation: A review of promising prevention policies and programs | url = | journal = American Journal of Orthopsychiatry | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 559‚Äì575 | doi = 10.1111/ajop.12056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oppression==
{{Main|Oppression}}
Oppression is the exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729230603/http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/oppression definition from Merriam Webster Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zersetzung==
{{Main|Zersetzung}}
The practice of repression in Zersetzung comprised extensive and secret methods of control and psychological manipulation, including personal relationships of the target, for which the [[Stasi]] relied on its network of [[Informal collaborators (East Germany)|informal collaborators]],&lt;ref&gt;Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic: [http://www.bstu.bund.de/EN/MinistryOfStateSecurity/UnofficialCollaboratorsOfMfS/_node.html The Unofficial Collaborators (IM) of the MfS]&lt;/ref&gt; (in German ''inoffizielle Mitarbeiter'' or ''IM''), the State's power over institutions, and on [[operational psychology]]. Using targeted psychological attacks the Stasi tried to deprive a dissident of any chance of a "hostile action".

==Serial killers==
{{Main|Serial killer}}
The main objective for one type of serial killer is to gain and exert power over their victim. Such killers are sometimes [[child abuse|abused as children]], leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or control-motivated killers [[sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that [[rape]] is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Egger|first=Steven A.|year=2000|title=Why Serial Murderers Kill: An Overview|journal=Contemporary Issues Companion: Serial Killers}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See article [[causes of sexual violence]] for the differences regarding anger rape, power rape, and sadistic rape.) [[Ted Bundy]] is an example of a power/control-oriented serial killer. He traveled around the United States seeking women to control.{{sfn|Peck|2000|p=255}}

==Law==
In December 2015, controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship was made illegal in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-guidance-framework-controlling-or-coercive-behaviour-in-an-intimate-or-family-relationship Statutory guidance framework: controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship] 05 Dec 2015 ''[[gov.uk]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Androdioecy is rare in comparison to the other major reproductive systems: [[dioecy]], [[gynodioecy]] and  [[hermaphroditism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Pannell, JR. |title=The evolution and maintenance of androdioecy|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=33| pages=397‚Äì425|year=2002 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150419}}&lt;/ref&gt; In animals, androdioecy has been considered an important stepping stone in the transition from dioecy to hermaphroditism, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="weeks2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weeks | first1 = SC | year = 2012 | title = The role of androdioecy and gynodioecy in mediating evolutionary transitions between dioecy and hermaphroditism in the Animalia | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 66 | issue = 12| pages = 3670‚Äì3686 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01714.x | pmid=23206127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of androdioecy==
The fitness requirements for androdioecy to arise and sustain itself are theoretically so improbable that it was long considered that such systems do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = D | year = 1984 | title = Androdioecy and the evolution of dioecy | url = | journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 333‚Äì348 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb01683.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C. 1877. The different forms of flowers and plants of the same species. New York: Appleton.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, males and hermaphrodites have to have the same [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], in other words the same number of offspring, in order to be maintained. However, males only have offspring by fertilizing eggs or ovules of hermaphrodites, while hermaphrodites have offspring both through fertilizing eggs or ovules of other hermaphrodites and their own ovules. This means that all else being equal, males have to fertilize twice as many eggs or ovules as hermaphrodites to make up for the lack of female reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lloyd | first1 = DG | year = 1975 | title = The maintenance of gynodioecy and androdioecy in angiosperms | url = | journal = Genetica | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 325‚Äì339 | doi=10.1007/bf01508307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = B | last2 = Charlesworth | first2 = D | year = 1978 | title = A Model for the Evolution of Dioecy and Gynodioecy | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 112 | issue = 988| pages = 975‚Äì997 | doi=10.1086/283342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Androdioecy can evolve either from dioecious ancestors through the invasion of hermaphrodites or from hermaphroditic ancestors through the invasion of males. The ancestral state is important because conditions under which androdioecy can evolve differ significantly.

===Androdioecy with dioecious ancestry===
In roundworms, clam shrimp, tadpole shrimp and cancrid shrimps, androdioecy has evolved from dioecy. In these systems, hermaphrodites can only fertilize their own eggs (self-fertilize) and do not mate with other hermaphrodites. Males are the only means of [[outcrossing]]. Hermaphrodites may be beneficial in colonizing new habitats, because a single hermaphrodite can generate many other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pannell | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = A hypothesis for the evolution of androdioecy: the joint influence of reproductive assurance and local mate competition in a metapopulation | doi = 10.1023/A:1011082827809 | journal = Evolutionary Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 195‚Äì211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the well-studied [[roundworm]] [[Caenorhabditis elegans]], males are very rare and only occur in populations that are in bad condition or stressed.&lt;ref name="stewart2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = AD | last2 = Phillips | first2 = PC | year = 2002 | title = Selection and maintenance of androdioecy in Caenorhabditis elegans | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 160 | issue = 3| pages = 975‚Äì982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Androdioecy with hermaphroditic ancestry===
In animals, corals (phyla Cnidaria) and barnacles (Subphyla Crustacea), androdioecy has evolved from hermaphroditism. Many plants self-fertilize, and males may be sustained in a population when [[inbreeding depression]] is severe because males guarantee outcrossing.

==Androdioecious species==
Despite their unlikely evolution, 115 androdioecious animal and about 50 androdioecious plant species are known.&lt;ref name="weeks2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weeks | first1 = SC | last2 = Benvenuto | first2 = C | last3 = Reed | first3 = SK | year = 2006 | title = When males and hermaphrodites coexist: a review of androdioecy in animals | url = | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 449‚Äì464 | doi=10.1093/icb/icj048}}&lt;/ref&gt; These species include

{{redirect|Anthropic bias|the book|Anthropic Bias (book)}}
The '''anthropic principle''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical consideration]] that observations of the [[universe]] must be compatible with the [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[sapience|sapient]] [[life]] that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the [[age of the universe|age]] and the [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the [[Fine-tuned Universe|narrow range thought to be compatible with life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html  Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ James Schombert, Department of Physics at University of Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''strong anthropic principle''' ('''SAP''') as explained by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life [[emergence|emerge]] within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a '''weak anthropic principle''' ('''WAP''') similar to the one defined by [[Brandon Carter]], which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of [[selection bias]] (specifically [[survivor bias]]): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the [[multiverse]] for there to be a [[statistical population]] of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of ''only'' this universe, compatible with ''our'' life) could occur.

==Definition and basis==
The principle was formulated as a response to a [[Fine-tuned Universe|series of observations]] that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on [[Earth]].  The anthropic principle states that this is a [[a priori and a posteriori|necessity]], because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe ''some'' universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.

The term ''[[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]]'' in "anthropic principle" has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Moster√≠n J., (2005), ''Antropic Explanations in Cosmology'', in  Hajek, Vald√©s &amp; Westerstahl (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 12th International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''; http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1658/"&lt;/ref&gt; to be a [[misnomer]].&lt;ref&gt;"anthropic" means "of or pertaining to mankind or humans".&lt;/ref&gt;  While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require [[human]] life or some kind of [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf The Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617015335/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf |date=June 17, 2012 }}, Victor J. Stenger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TZ5FLwnCTMAC&amp;client=firefox-a Anthropic Bias], Nick Bostrom, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.

The anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking [[falsifiability]] and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, "conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropic%20principle anthropic principle]. ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; is "easy" to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[truism]].&lt;!--, albeit a "vacuously true" statement [removed for the time being] --&gt;  However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/~lwilliam/sota/anth/SAP_FAP.htm The Strong Anthropic Principle and the Final Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstpraxis.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-knowing-sagan-from-pale-blue-dot/ On Knowing, Sagan from Pale Blue Dot]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropic 'coincidences'==
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
In 1961, [[Robert Dicke]] noted that the [[age of the universe]], as seen by living observers, cannot be random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Robert Dicke |author = Dicke, R. H.  | journal = Nature | title = Dirac's Cosmology and Mach's Principle | volume = 192 | pages = 440‚Äì441| date = 1961 | doi = 10.1038/192440a0|bibcode = 1961Natur.192..440D | issue=4801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a "golden age", neither too young nor too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Paul Davies | author = Davies, P. | title = The Goldilocks Enigma | publisher = Allen Lane| date = 2006 | isbn = 0-7139-9883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of
[[metallicity]] (levels of elements besides [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]) especially [[carbon]], by [[nucleosynthesis]].  Small rocky planets did not yet exist.  If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the [[main sequence]] and would have turned into [[white dwarf]]s, aside from the dimmest [[red dwarf]]s, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|Dirac's varying-G theory]].

Dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] needed to prevent the [[Big Crunch]] (the "Dicke coincidences" [[argument]]). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of [[baryon]]ic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of [[dark matter]] account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a [[Cosmological constant problem|cosmological constant]]. [[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | author = Weinberg, S. | title = Anthropic bound on the cosmological constant | journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 59| pages = 2607‚Äì2610| date = 1987 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2607 | pmid = 10035596 | issue = 22 | bibcode=1987PhRvL..59.2607W}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than the value [[particle physics]] predicts (this has been described as the "worst prediction in physics").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/2007/02/physicists-debate-nature-of-space-time.html New Scientist Space Blog: Physicists debate the nature of space-time - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the cosmological constant were only several orders of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.

The observed values of the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s (such as the [[fine-structure constant]]) governing the four [[fundamental interaction]]s are balanced as if [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? ] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html John Baez, mathematical physicist. U. C. Riverside], April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in the [[strong interaction]] would bind the [[dineutron]] and the [[diproton]], and [[nuclear fusion]] would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.

==Origin==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was among the first atheist proponents of arguments along similar lines to the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''Arthur Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Presentation, Volume 1'', Routledge, 2016, p. 211: "the world [is a] mere ''presentation'', object for a subject..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Svensson, ''Borderline: A Traditionalist Outlook for Modern Man'', Numen Books, 2015, p. 71: "[Schopenhauer] said that "the world is our conception." A world without a perceiver would in that case be an impossibility. But we can‚Äîhe said‚Äîgain knowledge about Essential Reality for looking into ourselves, by introspection. ... This is one of many examples of the anthropic principle. The world is there for the sake of man."&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "anthropic principle" first appeared in [[Brandon Carter]]'s contribution to a 1973 [[Krak√≥w]] [[symposium]] honouring [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the [[Copernican Principle]], which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the [[Universe]]. As Carter said: "Although our situation is not necessarily ''central'', it is inevitably privileged to some extent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=B.| last = Carter | authorlink = Brandon Carter | booktitle =IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data | publisher =Reidel | date = 1974 | location = Dordrecht |title = Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology | pages = 291‚Äì298}}; republished in General Relativity and Gravitation (Nov. 2011), Vol. 43, Iss. 11, p. 3225-3233, with an introduction by [[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]] (available on [[Arxiv]]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the [[Perfect Cosmological Principle]], which states that all large regions ''and times'' in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the [[steady-state theory]], which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the [[Big Bang]]).

Carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a "weak" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged [[spacetime]] locations in the universe, and a more controversial "strong" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.

[[Roger Penrose]] explained the weak form as follows:

{{quote|The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the Earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and [[Robert Dicke]] to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the [[gravitational constant]], the mass of the [[proton]], the [[age of the universe]], etc.). A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the Earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called [[main-sequence]] stars, such as the Sun. At any other epoch, the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around to measure the physical constants in question‚Äîso the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be [[Sapience|intelligent life]] around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!|''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'', Chapter 10}}

One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make "predictions" about the parameters. But second, "as a last resort", we can convert these predictions into ''explanations'' by assuming that there ''is'' more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the [[multiverse]] ("world ensemble" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a [[selection effect]], exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: "why do the [[list of laws of science|fundamental laws of physics]] take the particular form we observe and not another?"

Since Carter's 1973 paper, the term "anthropic principle" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; published that year which distinguished between "weak" and "strong" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.

Carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: "Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink = Alfred R.

==Variants==
'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' ([[Brandon Carter|Carter]]): "[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is ''necessarily'' privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers." Note that for Carter, "location" refers to our location in time as well as space.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Carter): "[T]he universe (and hence the [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental parameters]] on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase [[Descartes]], ''cogito ergo mundus talis est''."&lt;br&gt;The Latin tag ("I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]") makes it clear that "must" indicates a [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a [[truism]].

In their 1986 book, ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barrow, John D. | title = Anthropic Definitions | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 24| pages = 146‚Äì53 | date = 1997 | bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..146B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow &amp; Tipler's definitions are quoted verbatim at ''[http://www.dhushara.com/book/quantcos/anth/anth.htm Genesis of Eden Diversity Encyclopedia.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The observed values of all physical and [[cosmological]] quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where [[carbon-based life]] can [[evolution|evolve]] and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just "observers". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the [[fine structure constant]], the number of [[Spacetime#Privileged character of 3+1 spacetime|spacetime dimensions]], and the [[cosmological constant]]‚Äîtopics that fall under Carter's SAP.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the "must" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "There exists one possible Universe 'designed' with the goal of generating and sustaining 'observers'."
::This can be seen as simply the classic [[design argument]] restated in the garb of contemporary [[cosmology]]. It implies that the purpose of the universe is to give rise to [[Sapience|intelligent life]], with the [[physical law|laws of nature]] and their fundamental physical constants set to ensure that life as we know it will emerge and evolve.
* "Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being."
::Barrow and Tipler believe that this is a valid conclusion from [[quantum mechanics]], as [[John Archibald Wheeler]] has suggested, especially via his idea that information is the fundamental reality (see [[It from bit]]) and his '''Participatory anthropic principle (PAP)''' which is an [[Von Neumann‚ÄìWigner interpretation|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] associated with the ideas of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Eugene Wigner]].
* "An ensemble of other different universes is necessary for the existence of our Universe."
::By contrast, Carter merely says that an [[multiverse|ensemble of universes]] is necessary for the SAP to count as an explanation.

For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for ''anthropic bias''‚Äîthat is, the bias created by anthropic [[selection effect]]s (which Bostrom calls "observation" selection effects)‚Äîthe necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:

{{quote|Many 'anthropic principles' are simply confused. Some, especially those drawing inspiration from Brandon Carter's seminal papers, are sound, but... they are too weak to do any real scientific work. In particular, I argue that existing methodology does not permit any observational consequences to be derived from contemporary cosmological theories, though these theories quite plainly can be and are being tested empirically by astronomers. What is needed to bridge this methodological gap is a more adequate formulation of how observation [[selection effect]]s are to be taken into account.|''Anthropic Bias'', Introduction&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N. (2002), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''[[Self-sampling assumption|Strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA)]]''' ([[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom]]): "Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its [[reference class]]."&lt;br&gt; Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of "observer-moments" helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate "reference class": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.

According to [[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]], the anthropic principle essentially just says that the [[conditional probability]] of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as "gravity won't change tomorrow". To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the [[prior distribution]] of [[multiverse|alternative universes]] are necessary.&lt;ref name="RgenSchmidhuber"&gt;[[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]], 2000, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 Algorithmic theories of everything.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]], 2002, "[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/speedprior.html The Speed Prior: A New Simplicity Measure Yielding Near-Optimal Computable Predictions.]" ''Proc. 15th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory'' (COLT 2002), Sydney, Australia, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer: 216-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright and novelist [[Michael Frayn]] describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book ''The Human Touch'', which explores what he characterises as "the central oddity of the Universe":

{{quote|It's this simple paradox. The Universe is very old and very large. Humankind, by comparison, is only a tiny disturbance in one small corner of it - and a very recent one. Yet the Universe is only very large and very old because we are here to say it is... And yet, of course, we all know perfectly well that it is what it is whether we are here or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frayn]], ''The Human Touch''. Faber &amp; Faber {{ISBN|0-571-23217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Character of anthropic reasoning ==
Carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the "fundamental parameters"‚Äîthat is, the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s and initial conditions for the [[Big Bang]]. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is [[fine-tuned universe|fine tuned]] to permit life. Collins &amp; Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that "there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins C. B. | author-link = C. B. Collins | author2 = Hawking, S. W. | author2-link = Stephen Hawking | title = Why is the universe isotropic? | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 180 | pages = 317‚Äì334 | date = 1973 | doi = 10.1086/151965 | bibcode=1973ApJ...180..317C}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the "typical" universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.

Although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tegmark, M. | authorlink = Max Tegmark | title = Is 'the theory of everything' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?| journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 270 | pages = 1‚Äì51| date = 1998 | doi = 10.1006/aphy.1998.5855|arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important development in the 1980s was the combination of [[inflation theory]] with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by [[symmetry breaking]] in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as "fundamental constants" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[string landscape]] emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the number of non-compact dimensions, see [[String theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a [[theory of everything]] having no free parameters. As [[Einstein]] said: "What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world." In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a "theory of everything", [[string theory]], proclaimed "the end of the anthropic principle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kane, Gordon L. | author2 = Perry, Malcolm J. | author3 = Zytkow, Anna N. | last-author-amp = yes | title=The Beginning of the End of the Anthropic Principle | journal = New Astronomy | volume = 7 | date = 2002 | pages = 45‚Äì53  | doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(01)00088-4 | arxiv=astro-ph/0001197|bibcode = 2002NewA....7...45K }}&lt;/ref&gt; since there would be no free parameters to select. String theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see [[#String theory|below]]).

The modern form of a [[design argument]] is put forth by [[intelligent design]]. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning]] observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, [[Elliott Sober|Sober]] (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliott, 2005, "[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf The Design Argument]" in Mann, W. E., ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Religion''. Blackwell Publishers. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903095009/http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ikeda and [[William H. Jefferys|Jefferys]],&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W., "The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism," in ''The Improbability of God,'' Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier, Editors, pp. 150-166. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-59102-381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W. (2006). Unpublished FAQ "[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism.]"&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see [[fine-tuned universe]].

[[Paul Davies]]'s book ''[[The Goldilocks Enigma]]'' (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:
#The absurd universe: Our universe just happens to be the way it is.
#The unique universe: There is a deep underlying unity in physics which necessitates the Universe being the way it is. Some [[Theory of Everything]] will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that we see.
#The multiverse: Multiple universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and we inevitably find ourselves within a universe that allows us to exist.
#Intelligent design: A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of intelligence.
#The life principle: There is an underlying principle that constrains the Universe to evolve towards life and mind.
#The self-explaining universe: A closed explanatory or causal loop: "perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist". This is [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler's]] Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP).
#The fake universe: We live inside a [[virtual reality simulation]].

Omitted here is [[Lee Smolin]]'s model of [[Fecund universes theory|cosmological natural selection]], also known as "fecund universes", which proposes that universes have "offspring" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, James N., 2005, "[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-physical-constants-as-biosignature-an-anthropic-retrodiction-of-the-selfish-biocosm-hypothesis The Physical Constants as Biosignature: An anthropic retrodiction of the Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis,]" ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).

The anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carter, B. | title = The anthropic principle and its implications for biological evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = A310 | pages = 347‚Äì363 | date = 1983 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1983.0096 | last2 = McCrea | first2 = W. H. | issue = 1512 |bibcode = 1983RSPTA.310..347C }}&lt;/ref&gt; inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account [[cosmological]] and [[astrophysical]] considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the [[age of the universe]], the evolutionary chain culminating in ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' probably admits only one or two low probability links.

==Observational evidence==
No possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is "required" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in ''our'' portion of ''this'' universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.

Philosopher [[John Andrew Leslie|John Leslie]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. (1986) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Carter SAP (with [[multiverse]]) predicts the following:
* Physical theory will evolve so as to strengthen the hypothesis that early [[phase transition]]s occur probabilistically rather than deterministically, in which case there will be no deep physical reason for the values of fundamental constants;
* Various theories for generating [[multiverse|multiple universes]] will prove robust;
* Evidence that the universe is [[fine tuned universe|fine tuned]] will continue to accumulate;
* No life with a [[alternative biochemistry|non-carbon chemistry]] will be discovered;
* Mathematical studies of [[galaxy formation]] will confirm that it is sensitive to the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].

Hogan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hogan, Craig | title = Why is the universe just so? | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume =  72 | date = 2000 | pages = 1149‚Äì1161 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1149 | bibcode=2000RvMP...72.1149H|arxiv = astro-ph/9909295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe ''not'' to support life.

Probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:
#a particular multiverse with a "[[measure theory|measure]]", i.e. a well defined "density of universes" (so, for parameter ''X'', one can calculate the [[prior probability]] ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ''dX'' that ''X'' is in the range ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''X'' &lt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''dX''), and
#an estimate of the number of observers in each universe, ''N''(''X'') (e.g., this might be taken as proportional to the number of stars in the universe).
The probability of observing value ''X'' is then proportional to ''N''(''X'') ''P''(''X''). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be "over-tuned", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the [[cosmological constant]] can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.

One thing that would ''not'' count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence  that the Earth or the [[solar system]] occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the [[Copernican principle]] (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see [[Copernican principle]]), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a [[necessary condition]] for our existence as observers.

==Applications of the principle==
{{Synthesis|date=December 2010}}

===The nucleosynthesis of carbon-12===
[[Fred Hoyle]] may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on [[carbon-12]] [[atom]]s, that there must be an undiscovered [[resonance]] in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the [[triple-alpha process]]. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;University of Birmingham [http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm Life, Bent Chains and the Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927094126/http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm |date=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 29 (1957) 547&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alfred Fowler|Willie Fowler]]'s research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.

However, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, Helge (2010) When is a prediction anthropic? Fred Hoyle and the 7.65 MeV carbon resonance. http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/5332/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic inflation ===
{{Main|Cosmic inflation}}
[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] criticized the entire theory of [[cosmic inflation]] as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = D.N. | last = Page | date= 1983 | title = Inflation does not explain time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | page = 39 | doi = 10.1038/304039a0|bibcode = 1983Natur.304...39P | issue=5921}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic [[arrow of time]] in a universe with a [[Big Bang]] origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the [[entropy]] of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. [[Paul Davies]] rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = P.C.W. | last = Davies |authorlink = Paul Davies | date = 1984 | title = Inflation to the universe and time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | page =  524 | doi = 10.1038/312524a0|bibcode = 1984Natur.312..524D | issue=5994}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value‚Äîdue to random quantum fluctuations‚Äîto account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any "ad hoc" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.

=== String theory ===
{{Main|String theory landscape}}
[[String theory]] predicts a large number of possible universes, called the "backgrounds" or "vacua". The set of these vacua is often called the "[[multiverse]]" or "[[String theory landscape|anthropic landscape]]" or "string landscape". [[Leonard Susskind]] has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.

[[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Weinberg, S. | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | date = 2007 | title = Living in the multiverse | booktitle = Universe or multiverse? | editor = B.

Others‚Äîmost notably [[David Gross]] but also [[Lubos Motl]], [[Peter Woit]], and [[Lee Smolin]]‚Äîargue that this is not predictive. [[Max Tegmark]],&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Livio]], and [[Martin Rees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Livio, M. | author2 = Rees, M.

[[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]] (2000‚Äì2002) points out that [[Ray Solomonoff]]'s [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]] and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some [[prior distribution]] on the set of possible explanations of the universe.

{{anchor|Spacetime}}

===Dimensions of spacetime===
[[File:Spacetime dimensionality.svg|thumb|300px|Properties of ''n''+''m''-dimensional spacetimes]]
There are two kinds of dimensions, [[spatial dimension|spatial]] (bidirectional) and [[temporal dimension|temporal]] (unidirectional).&lt;ref name="Skow2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skow|first1=Bradford|title=What makes time different from space?|journal=No√ªs |date=2007 |volume=41 |pages=227‚Äì252 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824025031/http://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/research/temporality.pdf |accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let the number of spatial dimensions be ''N'' and the number of temporal dimensions be ''T''. That ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by [[string theory]] and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting ''N'' differ from 3 and ''T'' differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue.  

The implicit notion that the dimensionality of the universe is special is first attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who in the [[Discourse on Metaphysics]] suggested that the world is [[wikiquote:Gottfried Leibniz|"the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypothesis and the richest in phenomena."]]&lt;ref name="Leibniz1686"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried|title=Die philosophischen schriften von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Volume 4|date=1880|publisher=Weidmann|page=427&amp;ndash;463|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Metaphysics|accessdate=13 April 2018|chapter=Discourse on Metaphysics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square [[law of universal gravitation]]. While Kant's argument is historically important, [[John D. Barrow]] says that it "[...] gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa" (Barrow 2002: 204).&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is because the law of gravitation (or any other [[inverse-square law]]) follows from the concept of [[flux]] and the proportional relationship of flux density and the strength of field. If ''N'' = 3, then 3-dimensional solid objects have surface areas proportional to the square of their size in any selected spatial dimension. In particular, a sphere of [[radius]] ''r'' has area of 4œÄ''r''&amp;nbsp;¬≤. More generally, in a space of ''N'' dimensions, the strength of the gravitational attraction between two bodies separated by a distance of ''r'' would be inversely proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''N''‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Paul Ehrenfest]] showed that if there is only one time dimension and greater than three spatial dimensions, the [[orbit]] of a [[planet]] about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star's orbit around the center of its [[galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ehrenfest| first = Paul| authorlink = Paul Ehrenfest| title = How do the fundamental laws of physics make manifest that Space has 3 dimensions?|journal = Annalen der Physik| volume = 61| pages = 440| date = 1920| doi = 10.1002/andp.19203660503|issue = 5 |bibcode = 1920AnP...366..440E}}. Also see Ehrenfest, P. (1917) "In what way does it become manifest in the fundamental laws of physics that space has three dimensions?" ''Proceedings of the Amsterdam Academy''20: 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a [[wave]] impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are &lt;math&gt;5 + 2k&lt;/math&gt; spatial dimensions, where ''k'' is a whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, [[Hermann Weyl]] showed that [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]] works only with three dimensions of space and one of time.&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, H. (1922) ''Space, time, and matter''. Dover reprint: 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] or disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tangherlini| first = F. R.| title = Atoms in Higher Dimensions| journal = Nuovo Cimento| volume = 14 | issue = 27| pages = 636| date= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tegmark| first = Max| authorlink = Max Tegmark| title = On the dimensionality of spacetime| journal = Classical and Quantum Gravity| volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = L69‚ÄìL75| date= April 1997| url = http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf| doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002| accessdate = 2006-12-16 |arxiv = gr-qc/9702052 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''T'' differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant [[partial differential equation]]s. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if ''T'' &gt; 1, Tegmark maintains that [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.) If ''N'' &lt; 3, gravitation of any kind becomes problematic, and the universe is probably too simple to contain observers. For example, when ''N'' &lt; 3, nerves cannot cross without intersecting.

In general, it is not clear how physical law could function if ''T'' differed from 1. If ''T'' &gt; 1, subatomic particles which decay after a fixed period would not behave predictably, because time-like [[geodesic]]s would not be necessarily maximal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1976386 | last1 = Dorling | first1 = J. | year = 1970 | title = The Dimensionality of Time | url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/38/539/1 | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 539‚Äì40 |bibcode = 1970AmJPh..38..539D }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''N'' = 1 and ''T'' = 3 has the peculiar property that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a ''lower bound'' on the velocity of matter; all matter consists of [[tachyon]]s.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim" /&gt; 

Hence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, which happens to describe the world around us.

== Metaphysical interpretations ==
Some of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s earlier interpretation of the universe as being Christ centered (compare [[Omega Point]]), expressing a ''creatio evolutiva'' instead the elder notion of ''creatio continua''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Johann.&amp;nbsp;Dorschner. und.&amp;nbsp;Ralph.&amp;nbsp;Neuh√§user.&amp;nbsp;Evolution. des.

===''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle''===
A thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]], a [[cosmologist]], and [[Frank J. Tipler]], a [[cosmologist]] and [[mathematical physicist]]. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical [[astrophysics]], it also touches on [[quantum physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[earth science]]. An entire chapter argues that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is, with high probability, the only [[extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent species]] in the [[Milky Way]].

The book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the [[history of ideas]] the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of [[teleology]] and [[intelligent design]]. They discuss the writings of [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Bergson]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and the [[Omega Point]] cosmology of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish [[teleology|teleological]] reasoning from [[eutaxiology|''eutaxiological'']] reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hicks| first= L. E.| date=1883| title=A Critique of Design Arguments| location=New York| publisher=Scribner's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the [[final anthropic principle]] (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and "closely connected with moral values". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the [[universe]], constraints developed further in Tipler's ''The Physics of Immortality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = F. J. | last = Tipler |authorlink = Frank Tipler | title = The Physics of Immortality | publisher = DoubleDay | date = 1994 |isbn =  0-385-46798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such constraint is that the universe must end in a [[big crunch]], which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about [[dark energy]], based on observations of very distant [[supernova]]s.

In his review&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, M.]], "WAP, SAP, PAP, and FAP," ''The New York Review of Books 23'', No. 8 (May 8, 1986): 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; of Barrow and Tipler, [[Martin Gardner]] ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):

{{quote|At the instant the [[Omega Point]] is reached, life will have gained control of ''all'' matter and forces not only in a single universe, but in all universes whose existence is logically possible; life will have spread into ''all'' spatial regions in all universes which could logically exist, and will have stored an infinite amount of information, including ''all'' bits of knowledge which it is logically possible to know. And this is the end.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 677&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception and controversies  ==
Carter  has frequently regretted his own choice of the word "anthropic", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Carter (2004) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. message from [[Martin Rees]] presented at the Kavli-CERCA conference (see video in External links)&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised the word "principle" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of [[selection effects]].

A common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy [[deus ex machina]] which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: "[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Penrose, R. |authorlink = Roger Penrose | title = The Emperor's New Mind | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-851973-7 | date =1989}} Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as [[truism]]s or trivial [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]‚Äîthat is, statements true solely by virtue of their [[logical form]] (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying "if things were different, they would be different", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.

Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a [[scientific method|scientific statement]] but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a [[multiverse]], although some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Starkman, G. D. | author2 = Trotta, R. | title = Why Anthropic Reasoning Cannot Predict Œõ | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 |page = 201301 | date = 2006 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.201301 | pmid = 17155671 | issue = 20 | bibcode=2006PhRvL..97t1301S|arxiv = astro-ph/0607227 }} See also this [http://www.physorg.com/news83924839.html news story.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's ''anthropic cosmological principle'', which are [[Teleology|teleological]] notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a ''necessary prerequisite'' for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| date =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | date= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time| isbn=0-7167-3090-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shermer| first=Michael | date= 2007 | title=Why Darwin Matters| isbn=0-8050-8121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] through [[natural selection]] to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.

Some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an [[argument by lack of imagination]], for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called "[[carbon chauvinism]]", see also [[alternative biochemistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal | author = [[Bernard Carr|Carr, B. J.]] |author2=[[Martin Rees|Rees, M. J.]] | title = The anthropic principle and the structure of the physical world | journal = Nature | volume = 278 | pages = 605‚Äì612| date = 1979 | doi = 10.1038/278605a0 | bibcode=1979Natur.278..605C | issue=5705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a [[fine tuned universe]] have argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stenger| first=Victor J| authorlink = Victor Stenger | date= 2000| title=Timeless Reality: Symmetry, Simplicity, and Multiple Universes| publisher=Prometheus Books| isbn = 1-57392-859-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Harnik et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harnik, R. | author2 = Kribs, G. | author3 = Perez, G. | date = 2006 | title =A Universe without Weak interactions | journal = Physical Review | volume = D74 | page = 035006 | doi =10.1103/PhysRevD.74.035006 |arxiv= hep-ph/0604027 | bibcode=2006PhRvD..74c5006H | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a [[weakless universe]] in which the [[weak nuclear force]] is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other [[fundamental interaction]]s, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind‚Äî[[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[galaxies]], etc.

[[Lee Smolin]] has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his [[Lee Smolin#Cosmological natural selection|fecund universes]] theory, which assumes universes have "offspring" through the creation of [[black hole]]s whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Lee Smolin| author-link=Lee Smolin | editor=Tyson, Neil deGrasse | editor-link=Neil deGrasse Tyson | editor2=Soter, Steve | editor2-link=Steven Soter| date=2001| title=Cosmic Horizons: Astronomy at the Cutting Edge | publisher= The New Press| isbn = 978-1-56584-602-9 | pages =148‚Äì152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophers of cosmology [[John Earman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Earman John | date = 1987 | title = The SAP also rises: A critical examination of the anthropic principle | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 24 | pages = 307‚Äì317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernan McMullin]],&lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Ernan. (1994). "Fine-tuning the Universe?" In M. Shale &amp; G. Shields (ed.), ''Science, Technology, and Religious Ideas'', Lanham: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jes√∫s Moster√≠n]] contend that "in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation".&lt;ref&gt;Moster√≠n, Jes√∫s. (2005). Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism by Moster√≠n concerns the flawed "anthropic" inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:

{{quote|The suggestion that an infinity of objects characterized by certain numbers or properties implies the existence among them of objects with any combination of those numbers or characteristics [...] is mistaken. An infinity does not imply at all that any arrangement is present or repeated. [...] The assumption that all possible worlds are realized in an infinite universe is equivalent to the assertion that any infinite set of numbers contains all numbers (or at least all G√∂del numbers of the [defining] sequences), which is obviously false.}}

==History==
Bakeys was founded by Narayana Peesapathy in 2010 in Hyderabad. In April 2016, it earned a crowd-funding of around {{INRconvert|25|l}} from 1500+ backers through Ketto with its initial goal being only {{INRconvert|1|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.ketto.org/bakeys|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=| website=Ketto| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Eat Your Spoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this support, the company started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to increase its reach.&lt;ref name="ZME 2016"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.zmescience.com/ecology/environmental-issues/bakeys-spoon-53749/|last1=Micu|first1=Alexandra|last2=|first2=|date=30 March 2016| website=ZME Science| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=India‚Äôs Bakey edible spoon does two of my favorite things: limits dishes and plastic waste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/description|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=April 2016| website=[[Kickstarter]]| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Edible Cutlery: The Future of Eco Friendly Utensils}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the company had 30 employees.&lt;ref name="TET 2016"/&gt; As of May 2017 the company had not yet started shipping to backers of the Kickstarter, though shipments of the spoons to customers in India, has been proceeding without issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/posts/1787901 | date=19 January 2017 | website=Kickstarter | title=Kickstarter Campaign Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Kickstarter backers are currently attempting legal action against Bakeys due to no response after pledging over $250,000 in US dollars.

[[Image:Bijection.svg|thumb|200px|A bijective function, ''f'': ''X'' ‚Üí ''Y'', where set X is {1, 2, 3, 4} and set Y is {A, B, C, D}. For example, ''f''(1) = D.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''bijection''', '''bijective function''', or '''one-to-one correspondence''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] between the elements of two [[set (mathematics)|sets]], where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function ''f'': ''X'' ‚Üí ''Y'' is a [[Injective function|one-to-one (injective)]] and [[Surjective function|onto (surjective)]] mapping of a set ''X'' to a set ''Y''.

A bijection from the set ''X'' to the set ''Y'' has an [[inverse function]] from ''Y'' to ''X''.  If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements. For [[infinite set]]s the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a ''[[permutation]]''.

Bijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of [[isomorphism]], [[homeomorphism]], [[diffeomorphism]], [[permutation group]], and [[projective map]].

==Definition==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
For a pairing between ''X'' and ''Y'' (where ''Y'' need not be different from ''X'') to be a bijection, four properties must hold:
# each element of ''X'' must be paired with at least one element of ''Y'',
# no element of ''X'' may be paired with more than one element of ''Y'',
# each element of ''Y'' must be paired with at least one element of ''X'', and
# no element of ''Y'' may be paired with more than one element of ''X''.

Satisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a bijection is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] with [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X''. It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of ''X'' is paired with exactly one element of ''Y''. Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be "[[onto]] ''Y'' " and are called [[Surjective function|surjections]] (or '''surjective functions'''). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be "[[one-to-one function]]s" and are called [[Injective function|injections]] (or '''injective functions''').&lt;ref&gt;There are names associated to properties (1) and (2) as well. A relation which satisfies property (1) is called a ''total relation'' and a relation satisfying (2) is a ''single valued relation''.&lt;/ref&gt; With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both "one-to-one" and "onto".

Bijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail ({{unichar|2916|RIGHTWARDS TWO-HEADED ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}), as in ''f'' : ''X'' ‚§ñ ''Y''. This symbol is a combination of the two-headed rightwards arrow ({{unichar|21A0|RIGHTWARDS TWO HEADED ARROW|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote surjections and the rightwards arrow with a barbed tail ({{unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote injections.

==Examples==

=== Batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team===
Consider the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting line-up]] of a [[baseball]] or [[cricket]] team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set ''X'' will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set ''Y'' will be the  positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The "pairing" is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.

=== Seats and students of a classroom===
In a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:
# Every student was in a seat (there was no one standing),
# No student was in more than one seat,
# Every seat had someone sitting there (there were no empty seats), and
# No seat had more than one student in it. 
The instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.

==More mathematical examples and some non-examples==
* For any set ''X'', the [[identity function]] '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''X'' ‚Üí ''X'', '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''x'', is bijective.
* The function ''f'': '''R''' ‚Üí '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1 is bijective, since for each ''y'' there is a unique ''x'' = (''y'' ‚àí 1)/2 such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. In more generality, any [[linear function]] over the reals,  ''f'': '''R''' ‚Üí '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = ''ax'' + ''b'' (where ''a'' is non-zero) is a bijection. Each real number ''y'' is obtained from (paired with) the real number ''x'' = (''y'' - ''b'')/''a''.
* The function ''f'': ''R'' ‚Üí (-œÄ/2, œÄ/2), given by ''f''(''x'') = arctan(''x'') is bijective since each real number ''x'' is paired with exactly one angle ''y'' in the interval (-œÄ/2,&amp;nbsp;œÄ/2) so that tan(''y'') = ''x'' (that is, ''y'' = arctan(''x'')). If the [[codomain]]  (-œÄ/2,&amp;nbsp;œÄ/2) was made larger to include an integer multiple of œÄ/2 then this function would no longer be onto (surjective) since there is no real number which could be paired with the multiple of œÄ/2 by this arctan function. 
* The [[exponential function]], ''g'': '''R''' ‚Üí '''R''', ''g''(''x'') = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, is not bijective: for instance, there is no ''x'' in '''R''' such that ''g''(''x'') = ‚àí1, showing that ''g'' is not onto (surjective).  However, if the codomain is restricted to the positive real numbers &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \R^+ \;\equiv\; \left(0,\, +\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''g'' becomes bijective; its inverse (see below) is the [[natural logarithm]] function ln.
* The function ''h'': '''R''' ‚Üí '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''h''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not bijective: for instance, ''h''(‚àí1) = ''h''(1) = 1, showing that ''h''  is not one-to-one (injective).  However, if the [[domain of a function|domain]] is restricted to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\R^+_0 \;\equiv\; \left[0,\, +\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''h'' becomes bijective; its inverse is the positive square root function.

==Inverses==
A bijection ''f'' with domain ''X'' (indicated by ''f'': ''X ‚Üí Y'' in [[Function (mathematics)#Notation|functional notation]]) also defines a [[converse relation]] starting in ''Y'' and going to ''X'' (by turning the arrows around). The process of "turning the arrows around" for an arbitrary function does not, ''in general'', yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain ''Y''. Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse ''function'' is a surjection and an injection, that is, the [[inverse function]] exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be [[Invertible function|invertible]]. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.

Stated in concise mathematical notation, a function ''f'': ''X ‚Üí Y'' is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition
:for every ''y'' in ''Y'' there is a unique ''x'' in ''X'' with ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').

Continuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.

==Composition==
The [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; of two bijections ''f'': ''X ‚Üí Y'' and ''g'': ''Y ‚Üí Z'' is a bijection. The inverse of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (g \,\circ\, f)^{-1} \;=\; (f^{-1}) \,\circ\, (g^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Bijective composition.svg|thumb|300px|A bijection composed of an injection (left) and a surjection (right).]]
Conversely, if the composition &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; of two functions is bijective, we can only say that ''f'' is [[Injective function|injective]] and ''g'' is [[surjective function|surjective]].

==Bijections and cardinality==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then there exists a bijection between the two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' [[iff|if and only if]] ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same number of elements. Indeed, in [[axiomatic set theory]], this is taken as the definition of "same number of elements" ([[equinumerosity]]), and generalising this definition to [[infinite set]]s leads to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

== Properties ==
* A function ''f'': '''R''' ‚Üí '''R''' is bijective if and only if its [[graph of a function|graph]] meets every horizontal and vertical line exactly once.
* If ''X'' is a set, then the bijective functions from ''X'' to itself, together with the operation of functional composition (‚àò), form a [[group (algebra)|group]], the [[symmetric group]] of ''X'', which is denoted variously by S(''X''), ''S&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''X''! (''X'' [[factorial]]).
* Bijections preserve [[cardinalities]] of sets: for a subset ''A'' of the domain with cardinality |''A''| and subset ''B'' of the codomain with cardinality |''B''|, one has the following equalities:
*:|''f''(''A'')| = |''A''| and |''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')| = |''B''|.
*If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s with the same cardinality, and ''f'': ''X ‚Üí Y'', then the following are equivalent:
*# ''f'' is a bijection.
*# ''f'' is a [[surjection]].
*# ''f'' is an [[injection (mathematics)|injection]].
*For a finite set ''S'', there is a bijection between the set of possible [[total ordering]]s of the elements and the set of bijections from ''S'' to ''S''.  That is to say, the number of [[permutation]]s of elements of ''S'' is the same as the number of total orderings of that set‚Äînamely, ''n''!.

==Bijections and category theory==
Bijections are precisely the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and set functions.  However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories.  For example, in the category '''[[Category of groups|Grp]]''' of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], the morphisms must be [[homomorphism]]s since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are ''group isomorphisms'' which are bijective homomorphisms.

==Generalization to partial functions==
The notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to [[partial functions]], where they are called '''partial bijections''', although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a [[total function]], i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]].&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|date=16 July 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from ''A'' to ''B'' is any relation 
''R'' (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that ''R'' is the [[Graph of a function|graph of]] a bijection ''f'':''A‚Ä≤''‚Üí''B‚Ä≤'', where ''A‚Ä≤'' is a [[subset]] of ''A'' and ''B‚Ä≤'' is a subset of ''B''.&lt;ref name="Borceux1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Borceux|title=Handbook of Categorical Algebra: Volume 2, Categories and Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5i2v9q0m5XAC&amp;pg=PA289|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44179-7|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a '''one-to-one partial [[transformation (function)|transformation]]'''.&lt;ref name="Grillet1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre A. Grillet|title=Semigroups: An Introduction to the Structure Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yM544W1N2UUC&amp;pg=PA228|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-9662-4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[M√∂bius transformation]] simply defined on the complex plane, rather than its completion to the extended complex plane.&lt;ref name="Campbell2007"&gt;{{cite book|editors=C.M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3305">'''Class collaboration''' is a principle of social organization based upon the belief that the division of society into a hierarchy of [[social class]]es is a positive and essential aspect of [[civilization]].

==Fascist views==
Class collaboration is one of the main pillars of social architecture in [[fascism]]. In the words of [[Benito Mussolini]], fascism "affirms the irremediable, fruitful and beneficent inequality of men."&lt;ref name = "Mussolini"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1932|title=The Doctrine of Fascism| encyclopedia = [[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|publisher=''Istituto Giovanni Treccani''|location=[[Rome]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this premise, fascists conclude that the preservation of social hierarchy is in the interests of all classes, and therefore all classes should [[Collaboration|collaborate]] in its defense. Both the lower and the higher classes should accept their roles and perform their respective duties.

In fascist thought, the principle of class collaboration is combined with strong [[ultranationalism]]. The stability and the prosperity of the nation was seen as the ultimate purpose of collaboration between classes.

==Communist views==
[[Communism|Communists]] are ideologically and fundamentally opposed to class collaboration, advocating for [[class struggle]] and generally favoring a [[classless society]] instead.

Whereas the doctrine of class struggle urges the lower classes to overthrow the ruling class and the existing social order for the purpose of establishing equality, the doctrine of class collaboration urges them to accept inequality as part of the natural state of things and preserve the social order. Furthermore, it holds that the State alone 'reconciles' class antagonisms in society, and that the strife which gives rise to Communism can be harmonized.

Some Marxists use the term "class collaboration" as a pejorative term describing working class organisations that do not pursue [[class struggle]]. In this [[word sense|sense]] the term echoes the [[connotation]]s of [[collaborationism]].

At the same time, however, communists do not necessarily reject all alliances between classes. Some communists argue that, in a country with a large peasant population, the transition to communism can be accomplished by an alliance between two classes, the [[peasant]]ry and the [[proletariat]], united against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1923/jan/23.htm|title=How We Should Reorganise the Wokers' and Peasants' Inspection|date=January 23, 1923|author=V. I. Lenin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[New Democracy]] concept calls for "the peasantry, the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie and national and patriotic elements from the bourgeoisie to collectively operate for the building of a socialist society".

In [[computer science]], a '''composite data type''' or '''compound data type''' is any [[data type]] which can be constructed in a program using the [[programming language]]'s [[primitive data types]] and other composite types.  It is sometimes called a '''structure''' or '''aggregate data type''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howe|first1=Denis|title=The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aggregate%20type|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the latter term may also refer to [[Array data type|arrays]], [[List (abstract data type)|lists]], etc.  The act of constructing a composite type is known as [[Object composition|composition]].

==C/C++ structures and classes==
{{Split section portions|struct (C programming language)|date=July 2014}}
{{details|C++ classes}}
A &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; is [[C (programming language)|C]]'s and [[C++]]'s notion of a composite type, a datatype that composes a fixed set of labeled '''fields''' or '''members'''. It is so called because of the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword used in declaring them, which is short for ''structure'' or, more precisely, ''user-defined data structure''.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}}

In C++, the only difference between a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and a [[class (computer science)|class]] is the default [[access level]], which is ''private'' for classes and ''public'' for &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s.

Note that while classes and the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] were completely new in C++, the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] already had a crude type of &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s. For all intents and purposes, C++ &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s form a [[superset]] of C &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s: virtually all valid C &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s are valid C++ &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s with the same semantics.

===Declaration===
A &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; declaration consists of a list of fields, each of which can have any type.  The total storage required for a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; object is the sum of the storage requirements of all the fields, plus any internal [[Data structure alignment#Data structure padding|padding]].

For example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Account {
   int account_number;
   char *first_name;
   char *last_name;
   float balance;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

defines a type, '''''referred''''' to as &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt;. To create a new variable of this type, we can write &lt;code&gt;struct Account myAccount;&lt;/code&gt;
which has an integer component, accessed by &lt;code&gt;myAccount.account_number&lt;/code&gt;, and a floating-point component, accessed by &lt;code&gt;myAccount.balance&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;last_name&lt;/code&gt; components. The structure &lt;code&gt;myAccount&lt;/code&gt; contains all four values, and all four fields may be changed independently.

Since writing &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly in code becomes cumbersome, it is not unusual to see a &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; statement in C code to provide a more convenient synonym for the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;.

For example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
typedef struct Account_ {
   int    account_number;
   char   *first_name;
   char   *last_name;
   float  balance;
} Account;
&lt;/source&gt;

In C++ code, the [[Typedef|&lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;]] is not needed because types defined using &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; are already part of the regular namespace, so the type can be referred to as either &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt; or simply &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt;.

As another example, a three-dimensional Vector composite type that uses the floating point data type could be created with:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Vector {
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

A variable named &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; composite type would be declared as &lt;code&gt;Vector velocity;&lt;/code&gt; Members of the &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; would be accessed using a dot notation.  For example, &lt;code&gt;velocity.x = 5;&lt;/code&gt; would set the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; component of &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; equal to 5.

Likewise, a color structure could be created using:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Color {
  unsigned int red;
  unsigned int green;
  unsigned int blue;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In 3D graphics, you usually must keep track of both the position and color of each vertex.  One way to do this would be to create a &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt; composite type, using the previously created &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; composite types:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Vertex {
  Vector position;
  Color color;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

===Instantiation===
Create a variable of type &lt;code&gt;struct Vertex&lt;/code&gt; using the same format as before: &lt;code&gt;Vertex v;&lt;/code&gt;

===Member access===
Assign values to the components of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; like so:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
v.position.x = 0.0;
v.position.y = 1.5;
v.position.z = 0.0;
v.color.red = 128;
v.color.green = 0;
v.color.blue = 255;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Primitive subtype===
The primary use of &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; is for the construction of complex datatypes, but sometimes it is used to create primitive [[Structural type system|structural]] [[subtype|subtyping]]. For example, since [[Standard C]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} requires that if two structs have the same initial fields, those fields will be represented in the same way, the code

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct ifoo_old_stub {
   long x, y;
};
struct ifoo_version_42 {
   long x, y, z;
   char *name;
   long a, b, c;

==Type signature==
[[Type signature]]s (or [[Function type]]s) are constructed from primitive and composite types, and can serve as types themselves when constructing composite types:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

typedef double (*Metric) (Point p1, Point p2);

typedef struct {
    Point centre;
    double radius;
    Metric metric;
} Circle;
&lt;/source&gt;

In [[metaphysics]], '''conceptualism''' is a theory that explains universality of [[particular]]s as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref name="Conceptualism" /&gt; Intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref name="universals" /&gt; Conceptualism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[immanent realism]] is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

[[Peter Ab√©lard]] was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Ab√©lard‚Äôs view denied the existence of determinate universals within things.&lt;ref name="Abailard" /&gt; [[William of Ockham]] was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no ''[[wikt:fundamentum|fundamentum]]'' outside the mind.&lt;ref name="Ockham" /&gt;

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the [[Jesuit]]s: [[Hurtado de Mendoza (philosopher)|Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and [[Francisco Oviedo (philosopher)|Francisco Oviedo]] are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of [[Francisco Su√°rez]], the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the [[early modern philosophy]].

=== Modern philosophy ===
Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[Ren√© Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] ‚Äì often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' mental structures and functions.&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335‚Äì352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], conceptualist views were held by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary philosophy&lt;!--'Conceptualist realism', 'Perceptual conceptualism', 'Perceptual non-conceptualism', 'Perceptual nonconceptualism', and 'Nonconceptual mental content' redirect here; linked from 'John McDowell--&gt; ===
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[philosophy of mathematics]] has been construed as a form of conceptualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Zahar, Elie| year=2001| title=Poincar√©'s Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology| publisher=Open Court Pub Co| location=Chicago| page=211| isbn=0-8126-9435-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptualist realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a view put forward by [[David Wiggins]] in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of ''Mind and World'' by [[John McDowell]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind and World |last1=McDowell |first1=John |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-57610-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that [[Wilfrid Sellars]] provided for what he called the "[[Myth of the Given]]"‚Äîthe notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/ | title = Wilfrid Sellars | accessdate = 2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for '''perceptual conceptualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which perceptual content is conceptual "from the ground up", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's [[philosophy of justification]] is considered a form of [[foundationalism]]: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, 1994, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275‚Äì281.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world‚Äôs impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject‚Äôs rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.&lt;ref name=McDowellPaper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDowell | first1 = J. | title = What Myth? | doi = 10.1080/00201740701489211 | journal = Inquiry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 338‚Äì351 | year = 2007 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not "given" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The application of the term "perceptual conceptualism" to Kant's [[philosophy of perception]] is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement1.html "The Togetherness Principle, Kant‚Äôs Conceptualism, and Kant‚Äôs Non-Conceptualism" ‚Äì Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed '''perceptual non-conceptualism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hanna, "Kantian non-conceptualism", ''Philosophical Studies'' '''137'''(1):41‚Äì64 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''Convergence''' in [[sustainability science]]s refers to mechanisms and pathways that lead towards [[sustainability]] with a specific focus on 'Equity within biological planetary limits'. These pathways and mechanisms explicitly advocate equity and recognise the need for redistribution of the Earth's resources in order for human society to operate enduringly within the Earth's biophysical limits.

This use of the term 'convergence' harkens from the concept of [[contraction and convergence]] (C&amp;C), taking its core principles of Equity and Survival and applying them beyond the frame of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] to the wider sustainability agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortnam|first=Matt|title=Convergence:   How can it be a part of the   pathway to sustainability?|url=http://www.convergeproject.org/node/51|publisher=The CONVERGE project website|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daniel Pe≈°ta (2017).jpg|thumb|Daniel Pe≈°ta, 2017]]
'''Daniel Pe≈°ta''' (born 1 May 1959) is a Czech [[multimedia artist]].

== Biography ==
Pe≈°ta was born into the family of architect Anton√≠n Pe≈°ta and psychologist Helena Montanelli-Pe≈°tov√°. After completing secondary school of civil engineering, he studied at the V√°clav Hollar College of Art in [[Prague]]. During the communist era, Pe≈°ta became a part of the country's alternative culture scene and later earned a living as a graphic designer. After 2000, he finally left behind applied art and book illustrations and started to work exclusively with painting, from which he expanded into other forms of artistic expression. He spent two study trips in [[New York City|New York]] ‚Äì one in 1998 and one in 2000.

Pe≈°ta has exhibited independently since 1992, and has participated in group exhibitions since 2000. Some of his most important projects include ''I was born in your bed'', held at the [[Venice Biennale|55th Venice Biennale]] in 2013 and ''Personal Structures (Nocturnal Head Records)'', held at the Palazzo Bembo on the occasion of 56th Venice Biennale in 2015 and in Palazzo Mora in 2017. In 2017 he was awarded the 2nd price in painting at London Art Biennale.

He is married to [[Dadja Altenburg-Kohl]]. His daughter Karol√≠na Pe≈°tov√°-Matou≈°ov√° studied art theory at Charles University in Prague.

== Work ==
Already in his youth, Pe≈°ta acquired an artistic dexterity and sense for material that he first applied in [[hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealistic painting]]. Nevertheless, he soon abandoned this approach in favor of a raw, expressive style more closely reflecting his nature. In 1998, Pe≈°ta went on his first study trip to [[New York City|New York]]. This contact with the international art scene radically influenced his work. He started to make use of diverse materials, experimenting with wax, leather, textiles, or recycled photographs as part of naturalistic [[assemblage (art)|assemblages]]. Since 2004, his favorite technique has been clear epoxy resin, which he uses to cover older paintings and objects, thus conserving and devaluating them all at once.
Over time, he expanded his range of artistic approaches to include [[installation art|object installations]], [[video art]], and purely [[conceptual art|conceptual]] endeavors.

In his alarming conceptual project ''I was born in your bed'' (2013) ‚Äì an exploration of [[Romani people|Roma]] issues (i.e., how an individual's fate is predetermined by race) ‚Äì Pe≈°ta sounds a warning bell. The accompanying video art projects in particular contributed to broad public discourse on the issue. 

In his series ''Genetic Codes'', which explores the predestination of fate or analyses human subconsciousness. A mask is another of Pe≈°ta's central motifs. He sees it as a symbol of pretense and anonymity, and also of being obsessed with one's own uniqueness and power. 

In terms of subject matter, Pe≈°ta's works touch on the mysteries of human existence, the fragile nature of intimacy, and the role of man within society. His art often has a social or political subtext.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25318">'''Dichotic listening''' or the '''Dichotic listening test''' is a psychological test commonly used to investigate [[selective attention]] within the [[auditory system]] and is a subtopic of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]]. Specifically, it is "used as a behavioral test for hemispheric lateralization of speech sound perception."&lt;ref name=Ingram2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=John C.L.|title=Neurolinguistics: an introduction to spoken language processing and its disorders|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-79640-8|edition=1. publ., 3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}}  During a standard dichotic listening test, a participant is presented with two different auditory stimuli simultaneously (usually [[Speech communication|speech]]). The different stimuli are directed into different ears over headphones.&lt;ref name=Ingram2007/&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} Participants are asked to pay attention to one or both of the stimuli. Later, they are asked about the content of either the message they were asked to attend to or the message that they were not told to listen to. As a result of focusing to repeat the words, participants noticed little of the message to the other ear, often not even realizing that at some point it changed from English to German. At the same time, participants did notice when the voice in the unattended ear changed from a male's to a female's, suggesting that the selectivity of consciousness can work to tune in some information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Schacter, GILBERT, WEGNER|first=Daniel|title=Psychology|year=2011|publisher=WorthPublishers|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-429-24107-6|pages=180|edition=1. publ., 3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dichotic listening also relates to the third basic property of consciousness: [[Selective auditory attention|Selectivity]] which is the capacity to include some objects but not others.&lt;ref name="Schacter 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schacter, Daniel L |title=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=1-4292-3719-8 |oclc= 696604625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s Donald Shankweiler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/shankweiler.html |title=Donald P. Shankweiler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Studdert-Kennedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/msk.html |title=Michael Studdert-Kennedy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Haskins Laboratories]] used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables) to demonstrate the dissociation of [[phonetic]] (speech) and [[sound|auditory]] (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning is an integral part of language and is typically processed in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(a)&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Studdert-Kennedy |first1=Michael |last2=Shankweiler |first2=Donald |date=19 August 1970 |title=Hemispheric specialization for speech perception |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=579‚Äì594 |doi=10.1121/1.1912174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(b)&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert-Kennedy M. |author2=Shankweiler D. |author3=Schulman S. | year = 1970 | title = Opposed effects of a delayed channel on perception of dichotically and monotically presented CV syllables | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 599‚Äì602 | doi=10.1121/1.1912179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(c)&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Studdert-Kennedy M. |author2=Shankweiler D. |author3=Pisoni D. | year = 1972 | title = Auditory and phonetic processes in speech perception: Evidence from a dichotic study | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 455‚Äì466 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90017-5 |pmc=3523680 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dichotic listening performance advantage for one ear is interpreted as indicating a processing advantage in the contralateral [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]. In another example, Sidtis (1981)&lt;ref name=Sidtis&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sidtis J. J. | year = 1981 | title = The complex tone test: Implications for the assessment of auditory laterality effects | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 103‚Äì112 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(81)90050-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that healthy adults have a left-ear advantage on a dichotic pitch recognition experiment. He interpreted this result as indicating right-hemisphere dominance for pitch discrimination.

During the early 1970s, Tim Rand demonstrated dichotic perception at [[Haskins Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/publications/pub-r.html |title=Rand, T. C. (1974) |work=Haskins Laboratories Publications-R |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Timothy C. | year = 1974 | title = Dichotic release from masking for speech | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 678‚Äì680 | doi=10.1121/1.1914584 | pmid=4819869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study, the first stimuli: [[formant]] (F1), was presented to one ear while the second and third stimuli:(F2) and (F3) formants, were presented to the opposite ear. F2 and F3 varied in low and high intensity. Ultimately, in comparison to the binaural condition, "peripheral masking is avoided when speech is heard dichotically."&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; This demonstration was originally known as "the Rand effect" but was later renamed "dichotic release from masking". The name for this demonstration continued to evolve and was finally named "dichotic perception" or "dichotic listening." Around the same time,  Jim Cutting (1976),&lt;ref name=Cutting&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cutting J. E. | year = 1976 | title = Auditory and linguistic processes in speech perception: inferences from six fusions in dichotic listening | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 114‚Äì140 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.83.2.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; an investigator at [[Haskins Laboratories]], researched how listeners could correctly identify syllables when different components of the syllable were presented to different ears. The [[formant]]s of vowel sounds and their relation are crucial in differentiating vowel sounds. Even though the listeners heard two separate signals with neither ear receiving a 'complete' vowel sound, they could still identify the syllable sounds.

==Dichotic listening test designs==

===Dichotic fused words test (DFWT)===
The "dichotic fused words test" (DFWT) is a modified version of the basic dichotic listening test. It was originally explored by Johnson ''et al.'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|title=Dichotic ear preference in aphasia|journal=J. Speech Hear Res|year=1977|volume=20|pages=116‚Äì129|doi=10.1044/jshr.2001.116|pmid=846195|issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the early 80's Wexler and Hawles (1983)&lt;ref name="Wexler 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wexler|first=Bruce|author2=Terry Hawles|title=Increasing the power of dichotic methods: the fused rhymed words test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1983|volume=21|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(83)90100-8|pmid=6843817|issue=1|pages=59‚Äì66}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified this original test to ascertain more accurate data pertaining to hemispheric specialization of language function. In the DFWT, each participant listens to pairs of monosyllabic rhyming consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. Each word varies in the initial consonant. The significant difference in this test is "the stimuli are constructed and aligned in such a way that partial interaural fusion occurs: subjects generally experience and report only one stimulus per trial."&lt;ref name="Zatorre 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zatorre|first=Robert|title=Perceptual asymmetry on the dichotic fused words test and cerebral speech lateralization determined by the caroid sodium amytal test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1989|volume=27|issue=10|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(89)90033-x|pages=1207‚Äì1219|pmid=2480551}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zatorre (1989), some major advantages of this method include "minimizing attentional factors, since the percept is unitary and localized to the midline" and "stimulus dominance effects may be explicitly calculated, and their influence on ear asymmetries assessed and eliminated."&lt;ref name="Zatorre 1989"/&gt; Wexler and Hawles study obtained a high test-retest reliability (r=0.85).&lt;ref name="Wexler 1983"/&gt; High test-retest reliability is good, because it proves that the data collected from the study is consistent.

===Testing with emotional factors===
An emotional version of the dichotic listening task was developed. In this version individuals listen to the same word in each ear but they hear it in either a surprised, happy, sad, angry, or neutral tone. Participants are then asked to press a button indicating what tone they heard. Usually dichotic listening tests show a right-ear advantage for speech sounds. Right-ear/left-hemisphere advantage is expected, because of evidence from [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], which are both located in the left hemisphere.  In contrast, the left ear (and therefore the right hemisphere) is often better at processing nonlinguistic material.&lt;ref  name="Grimshaw 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimshaw|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2003|volume=41|doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00315-9 |display-authors=etal|title=The dynamic nature of language lateralization: effects of lexical and prosodic factors|pages=1008‚Äì1019|pmid=12667536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data from the emotional dichotic listening task is consistent with the other studies, because participants tend to have more correct responses to their left ear than to the right.&lt;ref  name="Hahn 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahn|first=Constanze|title=Smoking reduces language lateralization: A dichotic listening study with control participants and schizophrenia patients|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262611000625|work=Journal|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.03.015|volume=76|pages=300‚Äì309|pmid=21524559|date=Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the emotional dichotic listening task is seemingly harder for the participants than the phonemic dichotic listening task. Meaning more incorrect responses were submitted by individuals.

===Manipulation of voice onset time (VOT)===
The manipulation of voice onset time (VOT) during dichotic listening tests have given many insights regarding brain function.&lt;ref name="Arciuli 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arciuli J |title=Manipulation of voice onset time during dichotic listening |journal=Brain Cogn |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=233‚Äì8 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21320740 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.01.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the most common design is the utilisation of four VOT conditions: short-long pairs (SL), where a Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable with a short VOT is presented to the left ear and a CV syllable with a long VOT is presented to the right ear, as well as long-short (LS), short-short (SS) and long-long (LL) pairs. In 2006, Rimol, Eichele, and Hugdahl&lt;ref name="Rimol 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rimol, L.M. |author2=Eichele, T. |author3=Hugdahl, K. |title=The effect of voice-onset-time on dichotic listening with consonant-vowel syllables|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2006|volume=44 | issue = 2|pages=191‚Äì196|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.05.006|pmid=16023155}}&lt;/ref&gt; first reported that in healthy adults SL pairs elicit the largest REA while, in fact, LS pairs elicit a significant left ear advantage (LEA). A study of children 5‚Äì8 years old has shown a developmental trajectory whereby long VOTs gradually start to dominate over short VOTs when LS pairs are being presented under dichotic conditions.&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Westerhausen, R. |author2=Helland, T. |author3=Ofte, S. |author4=Hugdahl, K. |title=A longitudinal study of the effect of voicing on the dichotic listening ear advantage in boys and girls at age 5 to 8.|journal=Dev Neuropsychol.|year=2010|volume=35 | issue = 6|pages=):752‚Äì761|doi=10.1080/87565641.2010.508551|pmid=21038164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Converging evidence from studies of attentional modulation of the VOT effect shows that around age 9 children lack the adult-like cognitive flexibility required to exert top-down control over stimulus-driven bottom-up processes.&lt;ref name="Andersson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andersson, M. |author2=Llera, J.E. |author3=Rimol, L.M. |author4=Hugdahl, K. |title=Using dichotic listening to study bottom-up and top-down processing in children and adults.|journal=Child Neuropsychol.|year=2008|volume=14 | issue = 5|pages=470‚Äì479|doi=10.1080/09297040701756925|pmid=18608228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arciuli, J. |author2=Rankine, T. |author3=Monaghan, P. |title=Auditory discrimination of voice-onset time and its relationship with reading ability.|journal=Laterality.|year=2010|volume=15 | issue = 3|pages=343‚Äì360|doi=10.1080/13576500902799671|pmid=19343572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arciuli et al.(2010) further demonstrated that this kind of cognitive flexibility is a predictor of proficiency with complex tasks such as reading.&lt;ref name="Arciuli 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arciuli J |title=Manipulation of voice onset time during dichotic listening |journal=Brain Cogn |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=233‚Äì8 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21320740 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.01.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arciuli 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arciuli J, Rankine T, Monaghan P |title=Auditory discrimination of voice-onset time and its relationship with reading ability |journal=Laterality |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=343‚Äì60 |date=May 2010 |pmid=19343572 |doi=10.1080/13576500902799671 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==
Dichotic listening tests can also be used as lateralized speech assessment task. Neuropsychologists have used this test to explore the role of singular neuroanatomical structures in speech perception and language asymmetry. For example, Hugdahl ''et al.'' (2003), investigated dichotic listening performance and [[frontal lobe]] function&lt;ref name="Hugdahl 2003 58‚Äì65"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hugdahl|first=Kenneth|title=Dichotic Listening Performance and Frontal Lobe Function|journal=Thomas Bodner, Elisabeth Weiss, Thomas Benke|year=2003|volume=16|pages=58‚Äì65|doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(02)00210-0|pmid=12589889|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in left and right lesioned frontal lobe nonaphasiac patients compared to healthy controls. In the study, all groups were exposed to 36 dichotic trials with pairs of CV syllables and each patient was asked to state which syllable he or she heard best. As expected, the right lesioned patients showed a right ear advantage like the healthy control group but the left hemisphere lesioned patients displayed impairment when compared to both the right lesioned patients and control group. From this study, researchers concluded "dichotic listening as into a neuronal circuitry which also involves the frontal lobes, and that this may be a critical aspect of speech perception."&lt;ref name="Hugdahl 2003 58‚Äì65"/&gt; Similarly, Westerhausen and Hugdahl (2008)&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2008 1044‚Äì1054"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westerhausen|first=Rene|author2=Kenneth Hugdahl|title=The corpus callosum in dichotic listening studies of hemispheric asymmetry: A review of clinical and experimental evidence|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2008|volume=32|pages=1044‚Äì1054|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.04.005|pmid=18499255|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the role of the [[corpus callosum]] in dichotic listening and speech perception. After reviewing many studies, it was concluded that "...dichotic listening should be considered a test of functional inter-hemispheric interaction and connectivity, besides being a test of lateralized temporal lobe language function" and "the corpus callosum is critically involved in the top-down attentional control of dichotic listening performance, thus having a critical role in auditory laterality."&lt;ref name="Westerhausen 2008 1044‚Äì1054"/&gt;

==Language processing==

Dichotic listening can also be used to test the [[lateralization of brain function|hemispheric asymmetry]] of [[language processing]]. In the early 60s, Doreen Kimura reported that dichotic verbal stimuli (specifically spoken numerals) presented to a participant produced a right ear advantage (REA).&lt;ref name="Kimura 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kimura D | year = 1961 | title = Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 166‚Äì171 | doi=10.1037/h0083219}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attributed the right-ear advantage "to the localization of speech and language processing in the so-called dominant left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex."&lt;ref name=Ingram2007/&gt;{{rp|115}}  According to her study, this phenomenon was related to the structure of the auditory nerves and the left-sided dominance for language processing.&lt;ref name="Kimura 1967"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kimura D | year = 1967 | title = Functional asymmetry of the brain in dichotic listening | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 163‚Äì178 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(67)80010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that REA doesn't apply to non-speech sounds. In "Hemispheric Specialization for Speech Perception," by Studdert-Kennedy and Shankweiler (1970)&lt;ref name=Studdert-Kennedy(a)/&gt; examine dichotic listening of CVC syllable pairs. The six stop consonants (b, d, g, p, t, k) are paired with the six vowels and a variation in the initial and final consonants are analyzed. REA is the strongest when the sound of the initial and final consonants differ and it is the weakest when solely the vowel is changed. Asbjornsen and Bryden (1996) state that "many researchers have chosen to use CV syllable pairs, usually consisting of the six stop consonants paired with the vowel \a\. Over the years, a large amount of data has been generated using such material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asbjornsen|first=Arve|author2=M.P. Bryden|title=Biased attention and the fused dichotic words test|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1996|volume=34|issue=5|pages=407‚Äì11|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(95)00127-1|pmid=9148197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selective attention==
In selective attention experiments, the participants may be asked to repeat aloud the content of the message they are listening to. This task is known as [[Speech shadowing|shadowing]]. As [[Colin Cherry]] (1953)&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cherry E. C. | year = 1953 | title = Some experiments on the recognition of speech, with one and two ears | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 975‚Äì979 | doi=10.1121/1.1907229}}&lt;/ref&gt; found, people do not recall the shadowed message well, suggesting that most of the processing necessary to shadow the attended to message occurs in [[working memory]] and is not preserved in the [[long-term memory|long-term store]]. Performance on the unattended message is worse. Participants are generally able to report almost nothing about the content of the unattended message. In fact, a change from [[English language|English]] to [[German language|German]] in the unattended channel frequently goes unnoticed. However, participants are able to report that the unattended message is speech rather than non-verbal content. In addition to this, if the content of the unattended message contains certain information, such as the listener's name, then the unattended message is more likely to be noticed and remembered.&lt;ref name="Moray 1959"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moray N | year = 1959 | title = Attention in dichotic listening: Affective cues and the influence of instructions | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 56‚Äì60 | doi=10.1080/17470215908416289}}&lt;/ref&gt; A demonstration of this was done by Conway, Cowen, and Bunting (2001) in which they had subjects shadow words in one ear while ignoring words in the other ear.  At some point, the subject's name was spoken in the ignored ear, and the question was whether the subject would report hearing their name.  Subjects with a high working memory (WM) span were more capable of blocking out the distracting information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engle Randall W | year = 2002 | title = Working Memory Capacity as Executive Attention | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.00160 | volume=11 | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | pages=19‚Äì23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also if the message contains sexual words then people usually notice them immediately.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Sarason 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nielson L. L. |author2=Sarason I. G. | year = 1981 | title = Emotion, personality, and selective attention | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 945‚Äì960 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.41.5.945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the unattended information is also undergoing analysis and keywords can divert attention to it.

==Sex differences==
Some data gathered from dichotic listening test experiments suggests that there is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language laterality. According to Voyer (2011),&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245‚Äì255"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voyer|first=Daniel|title=Sex differences in dichotic listening|journal=Brain and Cognition|year=2011|volume=76|pages=245‚Äì255|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.02.001|pmid=21354684|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of task type (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of laterality effects, with men obtaining larger laterality effects than women."&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245‚Äì255"/&gt;{{rp|245‚Äì246}} However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in "Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic words test,"&lt;ref name="Voyer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voyer|first=Daniel|author2=Jennifer Ingram|title=Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic word test|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain, and Cognition|year=2005|volume=6|pages=545‚Äì561|doi=10.1080/13576500442000292}}&lt;/ref&gt; women reported more "intrusions" or words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused Dichotic Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues.&lt;ref name="Voyer 2011 245‚Äì255"/&gt;

==Effect of schizophrenia==
A study conducted involving the dichotic listening test, with emphasis on subtypes of schizophrenia (particularly paranoid and undifferentiated), demonstrated that [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenics]] have the largest left hemisphere advantage ‚Äì with undifferentiated schizophrenics (where psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met) having the smallest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Michelle S. |last1=Friedman |first2=Gerard E. |last2=Bruder |first3=Paul G. |last3=Nestor |first4=Barbara K. |last4=Stuart |first5=Xavier F. |last5=Amador |first6=Jack M. |last6=Gorman |date=September 2001 |title=Perceptual Asymmetries in Schizophrenia: Subtype Differences in Left Hemisphere Dominance for Dichotic Fused Words |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=9 |pages=1437‚Äì1440 |url=http://psychophysiology.cpmc.columbia.edu/pdf/friedman2001a.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=11532728 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.9.1437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the dichotic listening test helped to further the beliefs that preserved left hemisphere processing is a product of paranoid schizophrenia, and in contrast, that the left hemisphere's lack of activity is a symptom of undifferentiated schizophrenia. In 1994, M.F. Green and colleagues tried to relate "the functional integration of the left hemisphere in hallucinating and nonhallucinating psychotic patients" using a dichotic listening study. The study showed that auditory hallucinations are connected to a malfunction in the left hemisphere of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=MF |last2=Hugdahl |first2=K |last3=Mitchell |first3=S |date=March 1994 |title=Dichotic listening during auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=357‚Äì362 |pmid=8109643 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.3.357 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.151.3.357 |subscription=yes |via=PsychiatryOnline }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3333">In mathematics, a '''divisibility sequence''' is an [[integer sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; indexed by [[positive integer]]s ''n'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\text{if }m\mid n\text{ then }a_m\mid a_n&lt;/math&gt;

for all&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''.  That is, whenever one index is a multiple of another one, then the corresponding term also is a multiple of the other term.  The concept can be generalized to sequences with values in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] where the concept of [[divisibility]] is defined.

A '''strong divisibility sequence''' is an integer sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that for all positive integers&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_{\gcd(m,n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Every strong divisibility sequence is a divisibility sequence: if &lt;math&gt;m\mid n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n) = m&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the strong divisibility property, &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_m&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;a_m\mid a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* Any constant sequence is a strong divisibility sequence.
* Every sequence of the form &lt;math&gt;a_n = kn&lt;/math&gt;, for some nonzero integer ''k'', is a divisibility sequence.
* Every sequence of the form &lt;math&gt;a_n = A^n - B^n&lt;/math&gt; for integers &lt;math&gt;A&gt;B&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is  a divisibility sequence.
* The [[Fibonacci numbers]] {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} form a strong divisibility sequence.
* More generally, any [[Lucas sequence]] of the first kind {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'',''Q'')}} is a divisibility sequence. Moreover, it is a strong divisibility sequence when {{math|1=gcd(''P'',''Q'')=1}}.
* [[Elliptic divisibility sequence]]s are another class of such sequences.

'''Donaldson Wells King''' (1942‚Äì2014) was a writer and gay rights activist in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].

King was born in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. He married in 1967 but later divorced his wife and gradually began "coming out." King would eventually become one of Charlotte's most outspoken activists for the civil rights of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goqnotes.com/32393/don-king-early-charlotte-lgbt-community-pioneer-dies-at-72/|title=Don King, early Charlotte LGBT community pioneer, dies at 72|date=2014-11-07|newspaper=QNotes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was a writer who enjoyed a career in journalism. He first worked in Durham in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he was hired by the ''[[The Charlotte Observer|Charlotte Observer]]''. His writing was marked by the positive way he portrayed the LGBT community. King's goal was to create an LGBT community that could stand by itself and push for equality within the  Charlotte area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9226121.html|title=Early Charlotte gay rights ‚Äòwarrior‚Äô Don King dies of cancer|newspaper=charlotteobserver|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 he co-founded the Queen City Quordinators (QCQ), a joint fundraising umbrella group for LGBT groups in Charlotte. QCQ published a newsletter named "Q Notes" beginning in 1983. King was hired as the first editor of the newsletter, publishing it monthly through 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His ability to stand up for civil rights in a respectful and gentle manner helped him become well known and respected in Charlotte.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Police harassment and entrapment of gay men was an issue that King was passionate about. In the late 1980s he led efforts to change the way police officers treated gay men and to stop undercover officers from entrapping gay men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

King helped start the [[Pride parade|Gay Pride Parade]] in Charlotte and later in the 1980s ran a gay and lesbian bookstore out of his apartment. He was also a devoted member of the Charlotte Bridge Club.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

King died October 30, 2014, from [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 72.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">[[File:Elliptic cylindrical coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Coordinate surfaces]] of elliptic cylindrical coordinates.  The yellow sheet is the prism of a half-hyperbola corresponding to ŒΩ=-45¬∞, whereas the red tube is an elliptical prism corresponding to Œº=1.  The blue sheet corresponds to ''z''=1.  The three surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere) with [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (2.182, -1.661, 1.0).  The foci of the ellipse and hyperbola lie at ''x'' = ¬±2.0.]]

'''Elliptic cylindrical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from projecting the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] in the
perpendicular &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  Hence, the [[coordinate surfaces]] are [[prism (geometry)|prisms]] of confocal [[ellipse]]s and [[hyperbola]]e.  The two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] 
&lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are generally taken to be fixed at &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, on the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Basic definition==

The most common definition of elliptic cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, z)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \sinh \mu \ \sin \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = z
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in [0, 2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;. 

These definitions correspond to ellipses and hyperbolae.  The trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \cosh^{2} \mu} + \frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \sinh^{2} \mu} = \cos^{2} \nu + \sin^{2} \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; form [[ellipse]]s, whereas the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2} \cos^{2} \nu} - \frac{y^{2}}{a^{2} \sin^{2} \nu} = \cosh^{2} \mu - \sinh^{2} \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; form [[hyperbola]]e.

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the elliptic cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = h_{\nu} = a\sqrt{\sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the remaining scale factor &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  
Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right) d\mu d\nu dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = \frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right)} \left( \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \mu^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \nu^{2}} \right) + \frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, z)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Alternative definition==

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \cosh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau = \cos \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are hyperbolae.  The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; 
coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
 
The coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the foci &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  For any point in the (x,y) plane, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the foci equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.  (Recall that &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;x=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) 

A drawback of these coordinates is that they do not have a 1-to-1 transformation to the [[Cartesian coordinates]]
:&lt;math&gt;
x = a\sigma\tau
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} = a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left(1 - \tau^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative scale factors==

The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; are 

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sigma^{2} - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\tau} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and, of course, &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{2} \frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sqrt{\left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)}} d\sigma d\tau dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - \tau^{2} \right) }
\left[
\sqrt{\sigma^{2} - 1} \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} 
\left( \sqrt{\sigma^{2} - 1} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma} \right) + 
\sqrt{1 - \tau^{2}} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} 
\left( \sqrt{1 - \tau^{2}} \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau} \right)
\right] + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of elliptic cylindrical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which elliptic cylindrical coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]].  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding a 
flat conducting plate of width &lt;math&gt;2a&lt;/math&gt;.

The three-dimensional [[wave equation]], when expressed in elliptic cylindrical coordinates, may be solved by separation of variables, leading to the [[Mathieu differential equation]]s.

The geometric properties of elliptic coordinates can also be useful.  A typical example might involve 
an integration over all pairs of vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; 
that sum to a fixed vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;, where the integrand 
was a function of the vector lengths &lt;math&gt;\left| \mathbf{p} \right|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \mathbf{q} \right|&lt;/math&gt;.  (In such a case, one would position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; between the two foci and aligned with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = 2a \mathbf{\hat{x}}&lt;/math&gt;.)  For concreteness,  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; could represent the [[momentum|momenta]] of a particle and its decomposition products, respectively, and the integrand might involve the kinetic energies of the products (which are proportional to the squared lengths of the momenta).

'''Extraordinary rendition''', also called '''irregular rendition''' or '''forced rendition''', is the government-sponsored [[kidnapping|abduction]] and [[extrajudicial]] transfer of a person from one country to another that has predominantly been carried out by the [[United States]] government with the consent of other countries.&lt;ref name="54 countries"&gt;{{cite news |author=Max Fisher |title=A staggering map of the 54 countries that reportedly participated in the CIA's rendition program|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/05/a-staggering-map-of-the-54-countries-that-reportedly-participated-in-the-cias-rendition-program/ |quote= |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/22/us-extraordinary-rendition-programme|title=New light shed on US government's extraordinary rendition programme|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=James|last2=Ball|date=22 May 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/cia-photographed-naked-detainees|title=CIA photographed detainees naked before sending them to be tortured|first=Spencer|last=Ackerman|date=28 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
By 2004, critics alleged that torture was used against subjects with the knowledge or acquiescence of the United States (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law).&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=statesman2004may17&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/147955 America's gulag]. By Stephen Grey. 17 May 2004. ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some former detainees claimed to have been transferred to other countries for interrogation under torture, such as the Australian citizen [[Mamdouh Habib]]. In December 2005 [[Condoleezza Rice]] (then the [[United States Secretary of State]]) stated that:&lt;ref name=rice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Upon Her Departure for Europe, 5 Dec 2005|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/57602.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;-- The United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 2001 to 2005 CIA officers captured an estimated 150 people and transported them around the world.&lt;ref name="NYT-17-Feb-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA-Background-Memo"&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc97.pdf Background Paper on CIA's Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques]". 30 December 2004.

Under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], rendered persons were reported to have undergone torture by the receiving countries. Journalists, civil and constitutional rights groups, and former detainees have alleged that this occurred with the knowledge or cooperation of the administrations of the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="britain-condemned"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/4963949/Britain-condemned-over-extraordinary-rendition.html|title=Britain condemned over extraordinary rendition|first=Rosa|last=Prince|date=21 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelations about the US program prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving [[Council of Europe]] member states. A [[#27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution|June 2006 report]] from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centers ("[[black site]]s") used by the CIA, some located in Europe. According to the separate [[#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|European Parliament report of February 2007]], the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm Resolution 1507 (2006).]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |date=12 June 2010 }} Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of the [[European Union Parliament]] endorsed the report's conclusion that many member states tolerated illegal actions by the CIA, and criticized several European governments and intelligence agencies for their unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation.

Within days of his inauguration in 2009, US President [[Barack Obama]] signed an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] opposing rendition torture and established a task force to provide recommendations about processes to prevent rendition torture.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |title=Ensuring Lawful Interrogations &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061153/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |archivedate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Obama administration has distanced itself from some of the harshest counter-terrorism techniques, it has also said that at least some forms of renditions will continue.&lt;ref name="LA-Times-2009-Feb-01"&gt;"[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/01/nation/na-rendition1 Obama preserves renditions as counter-terrorism tool]".

== Definitions ==
[[Rendition (law)|Rendition]], in law, is a transfer of persons from one jurisdiction to another, and the act of handing over, both after legal proceedings and according to law. "Extraordinary rendition," however, is a rendition which is extralegal, i.e. outside the law (see: [[kidnapping]]). Rendition refers to the transfer; the apprehension, detention, interrogation, and any other practices occurring before and after the movement and exchange of extrajudicial prisoners do not fall into the strict definition of ''extraordinary rendition''. In practice, the term is widely used to describe such practices, particularly the initial apprehension. This latter usage extends to the transfer of suspected terrorists by the US to countries known to torture prisoners or to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture.&lt;ref name="MJC-2009-09-08"&gt;Michael John Garcia, Legislative Attorney American Law Division. [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32890.pdf "Renditions: Constraints Imposed by Laws on Torture"], 8 September 2009; link from the United States [http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html Counter-Terrorism Training and Resources for Law Enforcement web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014042245/http://www.counterterrorismtraining.gov/leg/index.html |date=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush administration freely admitted to this practice; stating, among other provisions, that they have specifically asked that torture not be used. Torture can still occur, however, despite these provisions, and much documentation exists alleging that it has happened in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4502986.stm "Rendition: Tales of Torture"], BBC News Online, 7 December 2005. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="italydidntknow" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/15/arar-agent.html "Mystery surrounds former customs agent in Arar case"], CBC.CA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo050906 /&gt; In these instances, the initial captor allows the possibility of torture by releasing the prisoner into the custody of nations that practice torture.

The next distinction of degree is that of intent, where much of the search for evidence continues. It has been alleged that some of those detainees have been tortured with the knowledge, acquiescence, or even participation of US agencies. A transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture would be a violation of US law.&lt;ref name="MJC-2009-09-08" /&gt; New York attorney Marc D. Falkoff stated that such evidence, i.e. transfer for the purposes of torture, was an operational practice. In a court filing, Falkoff described a classified prisoner transfer memo from [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] as noting that information could not be retrieved, as torture could not be used, and recommending that the prisoner be sent to a nation that practiced torture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/938331331.html?dids=938331331:938331331&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+8%2C+2005&amp;author=Ken+Silverstein&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.10&amp;desc=Pentagon+Memo+on+Torture-Motivated+Transfer+Cited%3B+A+court+filing+describes+a+classified+proposal+to+send+a+detainee+away+for+information+extraction.

== Historical instances ==

=== Historical cases ===
An early case involves [[Adolf Eichmann#Capture in Argentina|Israel's rendition of Adolf Eichmann]] from Argentina in 1960.

The first well-known American rendition case involved the ''[[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]]'' hijackers in 1985: after they were given a plane and were en route in international air space, they were forced by [[United States Navy]] fighter planes to land at the [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]], an Italian military base in [[Sicily]] used by the US Navy and [[NATO]]. The US was trying to get them within judicial reach of [[United States government]] representatives for transport to and trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Clancy, [[Carl Stiner]], Tony Koltz (2002), ''Shadow Warriors: Inside the Special Forces''. {{ISBN|0-399-14783-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1987, during the Reagan administration, the United States executed an extraordinary rendition, code named "Goldenrod," in a joint FBI-CIA operation. Agents lured [[Fawaz Yunis]], who was wanted in the U.S. courts for his role in the hijacking of a Jordanian airliner that had American citizens on board, onto a boat off the coast of Cyprus and taken to international waters, where he was arrested.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Reagan administration did not undertake this kidnapping lightly. Then-FBI Director [[William H. Webster]] had opposed an earlier bid to snatch Yunis, arguing that the United States should not adopt the tactics of Israel, which had abducted [[Adolf Eichmann]] on a residential street in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1960 ... In 1984 and 1986, during a wave of terrorist attacks, Congress passed laws making air piracy and attacks on Americans abroad federal crimes. Ronald Reagan added teeth to these laws by signing a secret covert-action directive in 1986 that authorized the CIA to kidnap, anywhere abroad, foreigners wanted for terrorism. A new word entered the dictionary of U.S. foreign relations: rendition.&lt;ref name="Naftali" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] alleges that extraordinary rendition was developed during the [[Clinton administration]]. CIA officials in the mid-1990s were trying to track down and dismantle [[Islamic fundamentalism|militant Islamic]] organizations in the Middle East, particularly [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="ACLU-Fact-Sheet" /&gt;

According to Clinton administration official [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]]:

{{quote|'extraordinary renditions', were operations to apprehend terrorists abroad, usually without the knowledge of and almost always without public acknowledgment of the host government ... The first time I proposed a snatch, in 1993, the White House Counsel, Lloyd Cutler, demanded a meeting with the President to explain how it violated international law. Clinton had seemed to be siding with Cutler until Al Gore belatedly joined the meeting, having just flown overnight from South Africa. Clinton recapped the arguments on both sides for Gore: 'Lloyd says this. Dick says that.' Gore laughed and said, 'That's a no-brainer. Of course it's a violation of international law, that's why it's a covert action. The guy is a terrorist. Go grab his ass.'&lt;ref&gt;Richard Clarke, [[#References|Enemies]] pp143‚Äì4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both the Reagan and Clinton cases involved apprehending known terrorists abroad, by covert means if necessary. The Bush administration expanded the policy after the [[9/11 attacks]].

In a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' interview with CIA veteran [[Michael Scheuer]], an author of the rendition program under the Clinton administration, writer [[Jane Mayer]] noted,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1995, American agents proposed the rendition program to Egypt, making clear that it had the resources to track, capture, and transport terrorist suspects globally‚Äîincluding access to a small fleet of aircraft. Egypt embraced the idea ... 'What was clever was that some of the senior people in Al Qaeda were Egyptian,' Scheuer said. 'It served American purposes to get these people arrested, and Egyptian purposes to get these people back, where they could be interrogated.' Technically, U.S. law requires the CIA to seek 'assurances' from foreign governments that rendered suspects won't be tortured. Scheuer told me that this was done, but he was 'not sure' if any documents confirming the arrangement were signed.&lt;ref name="mayer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scheuer testified in 2007 before Congress that no such assurances were received.&lt;ref&gt;"I have read and been told that Mr. Clinton, Mr. Berger and Mr. Clarke have said, since 9/11, that they insisted that each receiving country treat the rendered person it received according to U.S. legal standards. To the best of my memory, that is a lie." [http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf ''Extraordinary Rendition in U.S. Counter terrorism Policy: The Impact on Transatlantic Relations''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101093745/http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf |date=1 November 2007 }}, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, Subcommittee on Europe, 17 April 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that treatment of prisoners may not have been "up to U.S. standards." He stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a matter of no concern as the Rendition Program's goal was to protect America, and the rendered fighters delivered to Middle Eastern governments are now either dead or in places from which they cannot harm America. Mission accomplished, as the saying goes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf Extraordinary Rendition in U.S. Counter terrorism Policy: The Impact on Transatlantic Relations.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101093745/http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/34712.pdf |date=1 November 2007 }}, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, Subcommittee on Europe, 17 April 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thereafter, with the approval of President Clinton and a presidential directive (PDD 39), the CIA elected to send suspects to Egypt, where they were turned over to the Egyptian [[Egyptian General Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]].

=== 20th century ===
The US has used rendition increasingly as a tool in the US-led "[[war on terror]]" to deal with foreign [[defendant]]s, ignoring the normal [[extradition]] processes in international law.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Bonner: [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19777 "The CIA's Secret Torture"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Modern methods of rendition include a form where suspects are taken into US custody but delivered to a third-party state, often without ever being on US soil, and without involving the rendering countries, termed "extraordinary rendition." Hundreds of documents retrieved from [[Foreign relations of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan foreign ministry]] offices in [[Tripoli]] following the [[2011 Libyan civil war]] show that the CIA and the United Kingdom's [[MI6]] rendered suspects to Libyan authorities knowing they would be tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/06/libyan-dissident-tortured-sues-britain |title=Libyan dissident tortured by Gaddafi to sue Britain over rendition |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/9/7/discovered_files_show_us_britain_had |title=Discovered Files Show U.S., Britain Had Extensive Ties with Gaddafi Regime on Rendition, Torture |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2011 |publisher=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source speaks of MI6 cooperation, it never suggests active rendition|date=June 2015}} The CIA was granted permission to use rendition (to the USA of indicted terrorists) in a [[presidential directive]] signed by US President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995, following a procedure&lt;ref&gt;[[Presidential directive]] [https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd39.htm PDD 39], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; established by US President [[George H.

Critics have accused the CIA of [[rendition (law)|rendering]] suspects to other countries in order to avoid US laws mandating [[due process]] and prohibiting [[torture]]. Critics have also called this practice "torture flights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Torture flights: what No 10 knew and tried to cover up | url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,1689853,00.html| accessdate=23 January 2006 |work=The Guardian  |location=London  | date=19 January 2006 | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the practice argue that culturally informed and native-language interrogations are more successful in gaining information from suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18709-2005Mar8.html 'Rendition' Realities], David Ignatius, ''The Washington Post'', 9 March 2005; p.

Sociological comparisons have also been drawn between incidents of extraordinary rendition and the [[death flights]] procedure implemented, most notably, by Argentina during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015.

Following the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] the United States, in particular the [[CIA]], has been accused of rendering hundreds of people suspected by the government of being terrorists‚Äîor of aiding and abetting terrorist organizations‚Äîto third-party states such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. Such "[[ghost detainees]]" are kept outside [[judicial]] oversight, often without ever entering US territory, and may or may not ultimately be transferred to the custody of the United States.&lt;ref name="mayer"&gt;Mayer, Jane. ''The New Yorker'', 14 February 2005. {{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?050214fa_fact6|title=Outsourcing Torture: The secret history of America's 'extraordinary rendition' program.|accessdate=20 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the former CIA case officer [[Bob Baer]], "If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria.

According to a 4 December 2005 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' by [[Dana Priest]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members of the Rendition Group follow a simple but standard procedure: Dressed head to toe in black, including masks, they blindfold and cut the clothes off their new captives, then administer an [[enema]] and sleeping drugs. They outfit detainees in a diaper and jumpsuit for what can be a day-long trip. Their destinations: either a detention facility operated by cooperative countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, or one of the CIA's own covert prisons‚Äîreferred to in classified documents as "black sites", which at various times have been operated in eight countries, including several in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="WaPo051204"&gt;{{cite news | author=Dana Priest | title=Wrongful Imprisonment: Anatomy of a CIA Mistake | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301476.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 | work=The Washington Post | date=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following mounting scrutiny in Europe, including investigations held by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] senator [[Dick Marty]] who released a public report in June 2006, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]], in December 2005, was about to approve a measure that would include amendments requiring the Director of National Intelligence to provide regular, detailed updates about secret detention facilities maintained by the United States overseas, and to account for the treatment and condition of each prisoner.&lt;ref name="NyTimes051215"&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate is Set to Require White House to Account for Secret Prisons |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1071FFA34550C768DDDAB0994DD404482 |date=15 December 2005 |accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The New York Times |first=Douglas |last=Jehl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408042758/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1071FFA34550C768DDDAB0994DD404482 |archivedate=8 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports describe suspects as being arrested, blindfolded, shackled, and sedated, or otherwise [[kidnapping|kidnapped]], and transported by private jet or other means to the destination country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/guantanamo/story/0,13743,1540752,00.html Suspect's tale of travel and torture], Stephen Grey and Ian Cobain, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 August 2005. "He says he was flown on what he believes was a US aircraft to Morocco, while shackled, blindfolded and wearing earphones"&lt;/ref&gt; The reports also say that the rendering countries have provided interrogators with lists of questions.

==== Boeing Jeppesen international trip planning ====
On 23 October 2006, the ''New Yorker'' reported that [[Jeppesen]], a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], handled the logistical planning for the CIA's extraordinary rendition flights. The allegation is based on information from an ex-employee who quoted Bob Overby, managing director of the company as saying "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights‚Äîyou know, the torture flights. Let's face it, some of these flights end up that way. It certainly pays well." The article went on to suggest that this may make Jeppesen a potential defendant in a lawsuit by [[Khaled El-Masri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/061030ta_talk_mayer The C.I.A.'s Travel Agent], Jane Mayer, ''The New Yorker'', 23 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeppesen was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the [[ACLU]] on 30 May 2007, on behalf of several other individuals who were allegedly subject to extraordinary rendition.

The suit was dismissed on 8 September 2010 by a federal appeals court on the grounds that "going forward would reveal state secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/08/AR2010090807334.html |title=Suit dismissed against firm in CIA rendition case |date=9 September 2010 |author=Peter Finn |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Black sites" ===
In 2005, ''The Washington Post'' and [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA flights and "[[black site]]s", covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The [[European Parliament]] published a report in February 2007 concerning the use of such secret detention centers and extraordinary rendition (''[[Extraordinary rendition#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below]]''). These detention centers violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|UN Convention Against Torture]], treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Europeans Probe Secret CIA Flights | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111602198.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= EU to look into 'secret US jails' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4403166.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | date=3 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=U.S. Faces Scrutiny Over Secret Prisons | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110300422.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ABC News]] two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity. CIA officers say the captives were relocated to the North African desert. All but one of these 11 high-value [[al Qaeda]] prisoners were subjected to the harshest interrogation techniques in the CIA's secret arsenal, sometimes referred to as "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" authorized for use by about 14 CIA officers.&lt;ref name="AbcNews051205"&gt;{{cite news | title=Exclusive: Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123 | accessdate=18 December 2005 | publisher=ABC News | date=5 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, Swiss senator [[Dick Marty]], representative at the [[Council of Europe]] in charge of the European investigations, concluded that 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA in Europe‚Äîthus qualifying as ghost detainees‚Äîand then rendered to a country where they may have been tortured. Marty qualified the sequestration of [[Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr]] (aka "Abu Omar") in [[Milan]] in February 2003 as a "perfect example of extraordinary rendition."&lt;ref name="Bbc060124"&gt;{{cite news | title=Europe 'knew about' CIA flights |publisher=BBC News | date=24 January 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4641810.stm | accessdate=7 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe in Uproar over CIA Operations |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-flights26nov26,0,1837707.story?coll=la-home-headlines |accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Tracy |last=Wilkinson |date=26 November 2005 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CIA Flights in Europe: The Hunt for Hercules N8183J | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,387185,00.html|accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=Der Spiegel }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Extraordinary rendition#The European investigation and its June 2006 report|See below: The European investigation and its June 2006 report]])

==== Criticisms of ''The Washington Post'''s decision to withhold locations of the black sites ====
A comment by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]]&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005" /&gt; on ''The Washington Post'''s decision to withhold the locations of these secret prisons was that since the revelations "could open the [[U.S. government]] to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad," the ''Post'' did its part to minimize these risks. Yet, according to FAIR, "the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however‚Äîit's the whole point of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. First Amendment]]. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close." FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.&lt;ref name="FAIR 2005"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Consequences of Covering Up | url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2715 | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Raw Story]]'', the Polish site identified by reporter [[Larisa Alexandrovna]] and Polish intelligence officer [[David Dastych]] is [[Stare Kiejkuty (base)|Stare Kiejkuty]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified‚Äîbut never named‚Äîwhen the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Soviet-era compound in northern Poland was site of secret CIA interrogation, detentions | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Sovietera_compound_in_Poland_was_site_0307.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Alexandrovna and Dastych have stated that their sources told them that the same information and documents were provided to ''The Washington Post'' in 2005. In addition, they also identified the methodology of concealing the black sites:

{{quote|Former European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify and locate.

What some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim "black sites"‚Äîsecret facilities used for covert activities‚Äîcan be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.}}

They go on to explain that "Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport." The airport in question is the [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]], according to Alexandrovna and Dastych.

In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, [[Zbigniew Siemiatkowski]], embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations made by Alexandrovna and Dastych were "... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush," according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Former Polish intelligence chief who says report on CIA detention site part of US domestic battle admitted CIA had access to facility | url=http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Former_Polish_intelligence_chief_who_says_0308.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating "[[Prison ship|floating prisons]]" to house and transport those arrested in its [[war on terror#US objectives|''War on Terror'']], according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Duncan Campbell |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/02/usa.humanrights |title=US accused of holding terror suspects on prison ships |work=The Guardian  |location=London |date= 2 June 2008|accessdate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, the Italian judge Guido Salvini issued a warrant for the arrest of 13 persons said to be agents or operatives of the CIA in association with Nasr's kidnapping. In December 2005, an Italian court issued a [[European arrest warrant]] against 22 CIA agents suspected of this kidnapping (including [[Robert Seldon Lady]], [[Eliana Castaldo]], Lt. Col. [[Joseph L.

On 6 December 2005, ''The Washington Post'' reported Italian court documents which showed that the CIA tried to mislead Italian anti-terrorism police who were looking for the cleric at the time. Robert S. Lady, the CIA's substation chief in Milan, has been implicated in the abduction.

[[Marco Mancini]], the [[SISMI]] director of anti-terrorism and counterespionage, and Gustavo Pignero, the department's director in 2003, have been arrested on charges of complicity in a kidnapping, with the aggravating circumstances of [[abuse of power]].

A story in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on 8 December 2005 seems to corroborate the claims of "torture by proxy." It mentions the attorneys for [[Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad]], a detainee held by the Pentagon at Guantanamo Bay, filed a petition to prevent his being transferred to foreign countries. According to the petition's description of a redacted classified [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] memo from 17 March 2004, its contents say  "officials suggested sending Ahmad to an unspecified foreign country that employed torture in order to increase chances of extracting information from him."

Mr Falkoff, representing Ahmad, continued: "There is only one meaning that can be gleaned from this short passage," the petition says. "The government believes that Mr. Ahmad has information that it wants but that it cannot extract without torturing him." The petition goes on to say that because torture is not allowed at Guantanamo, "the recommendation is that Mr. Ahmad should be sent to another country where he can be interrogated under torture."&lt;ref name="LaTimes051208"&gt;{{Cite news

In a report, regarding the allegations of CIA flights, on 13 December 2005, the rapporteur and Chair of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]'s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, Swiss councillor [[Dick Marty]], concluded: "The elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees‚Äîoutside all judicial procedure‚Äîin European countries."&lt;ref name="Bbc051213"&gt;{{cite news | title=CIA abduction claims 'credible' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4524864.stm | accessdate=18 December 2005 |publisher=BBC News | date=13 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muhammad Bashmila case ===
Muhammad Bashmila, a former secret prisoner, now free in Yemen, gave an interview to the [[BBC]] [[Newsnight]] programme, where he spoke of being transferred from Afghanistan to a [[Internment camp|detention center]] where it was cold, where the food appeared European and where evening prayers were held.

=== Maher Arar case ===
{{Main|Maher Arar}}
Maher Arar, a Syrian-born dual Syrian and Canadian citizen, was detained at [[Kennedy International Airport]] on 26 September 2002, by US [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] officials. He was heading home to Canada after a family holiday in Tunisia. After almost two weeks, enduring hours of interrogation chained, he was sent, shackled and bound, in a private jet to Jordan and then Syria, instead of being deported to Canada. There, he was interrogated and tortured by Syrian intelligence. Maher Arar was eventually released a year later. He told the BBC that he was repeatedly tortured during 10 months' detention in Syria‚Äîoften whipped on the palms of his hands with metal cables. Syrian intelligence officers forced him to sign a [[Confession (law)|confession]] linking him to [[Al Qaeda]].

He was finally released following intervention by the Canadian government. The Canadian government lodged an official complaint with the US government protesting Arar's deportation. On 18 September 2006, a Canadian public enquiry presented its findings, entirely clearing Arar of any terrorist activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sirc-csars.gc.ca/pdfs/cm_arar_rec-eng.pdf |title=Report of the Events Relating to Maher Arar: Analysis and Recommendations }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.17&amp;nbsp;MB)}}, Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Maher Arar&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Arar filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New York against senior U.S. officials, on charges that whoever sent him to Syria knew he would be tortured by intelligence agents.&lt;ref name="Talesoftorture"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4502986.stm "Renditions: Tales of Torture"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 7 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Tom Ridge]] and [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] were all named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=bbc2004jan23&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3421743.stm Canadian sues US over deportation], BBC News, 23 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that U.S. law did not allow victims of extraordinary rendition to sue U.S. officials for torture suffered overseas.&lt;ref name=maher_arar_appeal_rejected /&gt;

On 18 October 2006, Arar received the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award from the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] for his ordeal. On 18 October 2007, Maher Arar received a public apology from the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative [[Dana Rohrabacher]], who apologized, stated that he would fight any efforts to end the practice.

In 2007, Arar was awarded $10.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensation from the Canadian government for pain and suffering in his ordeal and a formal apology from Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]].&lt;ref name="USlegislatorsapologize"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/10/18/arar.html U.S. legislators apologize to Maher Arar], ''CBCNews'', 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''This is a non-exhaustive list of some alleged examples of extraordinary rendition.  Most cannot be confirmed.''
* A Pakistani newspaper reported that in the early hours of 23 October 2001 a Yemeni citizen, Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed, a 27-year-old [[microbiology]] student at [[Karachi University]], was spirited aboard a private plane at Karachi's airport by Pakistani security officers.&lt;ref name="Washpost041227"&gt;{{cite news | title=Jet is an Open Secret in Terror War | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A27826-2004Dec26?language=printer| accessdate=12 February 2007 |work=The Washington Post | date=27 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2001, [[Mamdouh Habib]], who lives in Australia and has both Australian and Egyptian nationality (having been born in Egypt), was detained in Pakistan, where he was interrogated for three weeks, and then flown to Egypt in a private plane. From Egypt, he was later flown to a US airbase in Afghanistan. He told the BBC that he did not know who had held him, but had seen Americans, Australians, Pakistanis, and Egyptians among his captors. He also said that he had been beaten, given electric shocks, [[deprived of sleep]], blindfolded for eight months and brainwashed.&lt;ref name="Talesoftorture" /&gt; After signing confessions of involvement with al-Qaeda, which he has now retracted, Mr Habib was transferred to Guantanamo Bay.

At a news conference he told reporters and U.S. officials he had been wrongly imprisoned for allegedly plotting to kill [[Osama bin Laden]]. He was then taken to a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, where he was stripped, bound and thrown behind bars. According to U.S. lawyers who represent him, in January 2002 he was sent to the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Nearly four years later, Turkistani remained there, despite being cleared for release early 2005 after a government review concluded he is "no longer an [[enemy combatant]]." It is unclear exactly when that determination was made, but [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] lawyers gave notice of it in an 11 October court filing.&lt;ref name="WaPo051215"&gt;{{cite news |title=Detainee Cleared for Release Is in Limbo at Guantanamo |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121402125.html |date=15 December 2005 &lt;!-- |mirror=http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/121505M.shtml --&gt; |accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Washington Post |first1=Josh |last1=White |first2=Robin |last2=Wright |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2005%2F12%2F14%2FAR2005121402125.html&amp;date=2013-02-08 |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 26 June 2006 press release from the Saudi Arabian embassy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiembassy.net/2006News/News/TerDetail.asp?cIndex=6331 Fourteen Guantanamo detainees returned to the Kingdom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928001128/http://saudiembassy.net/2006News/News/TerDetail.asp?cIndex=6331 |date=28 September 2006 }}, Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington DC, 25 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Turkistani was released from Guantanamo to Saudi custody.

The information he provided to his interrogators formed a fundamental part of the Bush administration case for attacking Iraq, alleging links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. Al-Libi later recanted his story and it is generally believed that his stories of contact between the Saddam Hussein regime and Al-Qaeda were fabricated to please his interrogators.&lt;ref name="Guardian051209"&gt;{{cite news | title=Prewar claims 'sourced from rendition detainee' | url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1663743,00.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 |work=The Guardian  |location=London | date=9 December 2005  | first=Simon | last=Jeffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery]], two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden, were arrested by Swedish police in December 2001. They were taken to Bromma airport in Stockholm, had their clothes cut from their bodies, suppositories were inserted in their anuses and they were put in diapers, overalls, hoods, hand and ankle cuffs, they were then put onto a jet with [[Rendition aircraft|American registration N379P]] with a crew of masked men. They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to Swedish investigative programme ''Kalla fakta''.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript from a Swedish television show, "''Kalla Fakta''" (Cold Facts) in May 2004 in which the abduction is the topic.

Agiza was previously charged and sentenced in absentia with being an Islamic militant and was sentenced to 25 years, a sentence that was reduced to 15 years due to the political pressure after the Rendition became known. Al-Zery wasn't charged, and after two years in jail without ever seeing a judge or prosecutor he was sent to his village in Egypt. In 2008 AL Zery was awarded $500,000 in damages by the Swedish government for the wrongful treatment he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.
* In March 2002, [[Abou Elkassim Britel]], an Italian citizen with Moroccan origins, was arrested in Pakistan and subsequently interrogated by Pakistani and US officials. He was then rendered to Moroccan authorities, detained and tortured in a secret [[Temara interrogation centre]]. He was finally released without any charges brought against him, before being rearrested in May 2003 at the border crossing of the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] in North Africa. He is currently imprisoned in [[√Ñin Bourja prison]] in [[Casablanca]] after having been sentenced to nine years in January 2004 for membership of a subversive organisation and for activities including holding unauthorised meetings. This in spite of conclusions in September 2006 by Italian Justice, after a five years investigation, that there was "an absolute lack of grounds of evidence of charge which may be used in trial" and that the suspicion motivating the inquiries had proved unfounded. Nonetheless, allegations in the Italian press and the judicial proceedings that were underway in Italy influenced court proceedings against Britel in Morocco that led to him being sentenced. MPs from Italy and from the European Parliament are set to ask the [[Moroccan Royal Cabinet]] to grant a pardon to the Italian citizen.{{when|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/jan/10britel.htm Renditions: Italian and European MPs set to request pardon for Abou Elkassim Britel], [[Statewatch]], January 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the European Parliament ''Temporary Committee on the Alleged Use of European Countries by the CIA for the Transport and the Illegal Detention of Prisoners'' headed by rapporteur [[Giovanni Claudio Fava]], documents demonstrated that "the Italian judicial authorities and the Italian Ministry for Home Affairs (the latter, acting on behalf of the ''Direzione Centrale della Polizia di Prevenzione'' cited in connection with the investigation by the ''Divisione Investigazioni Generali ed Operazioni Speciali'') cooperated constantly with foreign secret services and were well aware of all Britel's movements and whatever unlawful treatments he received, from the time of his initial arrest in Pakistan."&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/feb/ep-rendition-and-detention-wd-no-9.pdf |title=Temporary Committee on the Alleged Use of European Countries by the CIA for the Transport and the Illegal Detention of Prisoners }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(353&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Rapporteur Giovanni Claudio Fava, [[European Parliament]] DT/65174EN.doc 7 February 2007, made accessible by Statewatch.

==== Council of Europe investigation and its two reports ====
On 25 November 2005, the lead investigator for the [[Council of Europe]], Swiss lawmaker [[Dick Marty]] announced that he had obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for suspected black sites, and he was planning to use satellite imagery over the last several years as part of his investigation. On 28 November 2005, EU Justice Commissioner [[Franco Frattini]] asserted that any EU country which had operated a secret prison would have its voting rights suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Ames |title=EU May Suspend Nations With Secret Prisons | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=[[ABC News]] | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=1352347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preliminary report, Dick Marty declared that it was "highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware" of the CIA kidnapping of a "hundred" persons on European territory and their subsequent rendition to countries where they may be tortured.&lt;ref name="DickMarty_PDF_2006-01-22"&gt;Directed by Swiss senator Dick Marty, Entitled "Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states," see: {{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_01_06_detention.pdf |title=Information memorandum II on the alleged secret detentions in Council of Europe states }}, Dick Marty, 22 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Council of Europe directed by Dick Marty, and made public on 7 June 2006, was titled: "Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states."&lt;ref&gt;June 2006 Council of Europe report available here: [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm HTML] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610064258/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=%2FCommitteeDocs%2F2006%2F20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm |date=10 June 2006 }} and [http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.pdf PDF] formats.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of this report, the Council of Europe published its draft Recommendation and Resolution document which
found grounds for concern with the conduct of both the US and member states of the EU and expresses concern for the disregard of international law and the Geneva Convention. Following a 23-point resolution the document makes five recommendations.
* 1 refers to its Resolution on alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states.
* 2 recalling its previous recommendation on the legality of the detention of persons by the United States in Guantanamo Bay
* 3 urges the Committee of Ministers to draft a recommendation to Council of Europe member States containing:
:common measures to guarantee more effectively the human rights of persons suspected of terrorist offences who are captured from, detained in or transported through Council of Europe member States; and a set of minimum requirements for "human rights protection clauses", for inclusion in bilateral and multilateral agreements with third parties, especially those concerning the use of military installations on the territory of Council of Europe member States.
* 4 urgently requests that: an initiative be launched on an international level, expressly involving the United States, an Observer to the Council of Europe, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat. The strategy should conform in all its elements with the fundamental principles of our common heritage in terms of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law. Also, a proposal be considered, in instances where States are unable or unwilling to prosecute persons accused of terrorist acts, to bring these persons within the jurisdiction of an international court that is competent to try them. One possibility worth considering would be to vest such a competence in the International Criminal Court, whilst renewing invitations to join the Court to the United States and other countries that have not yet done so.
* 5 recommends improving the Council of Europe's ability to react rapidly and effectively to allegations of systematic human rights abuse involving several member States.

Several months before the publication of the Council of Europe report directed by Dick Marty, [[Gijs de Vries]], the EU's antiterrorism coordinator, asserted in April 2006 that no evidence existed that extraordinary rendition had been taking place in Europe. It was also said that the European Union's probe, and a similar one by the continent's leading human rights group had not found any human rights violations nor other crimes that could be proven to the satisfaction of the courts.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe060421"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/04/21/eu_official_no_evidence_of_illegal_cia_action/ EU official: No evidence of illegal CIA action: Antiterror chief advises committee], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 21 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This denial from a member of the [[executive power]] of the EU institutions has been questioned by the [[European Parliament]] report, which was accepted by a vast majority of the Parliament in February 2007 (''[[Extraordinary renditions#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|See below:The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report]]'').

On the other hand, Dick Marty explained the difference of approach concerning terrorism between the EU and the US as following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While the states of the Old World have dealt with these threats primarily by means of existing institutions and legal systems, the United States appears to have made a fundamentally different choice: considering that neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism, it decided to develop new legal concepts. This legal approach is utterly alien to the European tradition and sensibility, and is clearly contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5055872.stm Rendition and the rights of the individual], ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, despite Marty's claims, the European Parliament investigations uncovered cooperation between European [[secret services]] and governments and the extraordinary renditions programs, making such a clear-cut distinction over-simplistic (''[[Extraordinary renditions#The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report|see below]]''). Dick Marty himself has not accepted such a dualistic approach, as he showed that for the British government also, the phenomenon of Islamic terrorism was alleged to be so grave that the balance of liberties had to be reconsidered.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07" /&gt; Marty's report stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The compilation of so-called "black lists" of individuals and companies suspected of maintaining connections with organisations considered terrorist and the application of the associated sanctions clearly breach every principle of the fundamental right to a fair trial: no specific charges, no right to be heard, no right of appeal, no established procedure for removing one's name from the list.&lt;ref name="BBC_NOL_2006-06-07" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second report was released on 8 June 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/marty_08_06_07.pdf |title=Secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states: second report }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(528&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Council of Europe Parliamentary]] Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, 7 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution ====
The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) accused the United States of operating a "clandestine spiderweb of disappearances, secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers" and called for EU regulations governing foreign intelligence services operating in Europe, and demanded "human rights clauses" in military base agreements with the USA.

In a resolution and recommendation approved by a large majority, the Assembly also called for:
* The dismantling by the US of its system of detentions and transfers.
* A review of bilateral agreements between Council of Europe member states and the US, particularly on the status of US forces stationed in Europe and on the use of military and other instrastructures, to ensure they conform to international human rights norms.
* Official apologies and compensation for victims of illegal detentions against whom no formal accusations, nor any court proceedings, have ever been brought
* An international initiative, expressly involving the United States, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat which conforms to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/ERES1507.htm |title=Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=17 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612123848/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta06%2FERES1507.htm |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Parliament's investigation and report ====
The [[European Parliament]] launched its own investigation into the reports. In April 2006, [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] leading the investigations expressed concerns that the CIA had conducted more than 1,000 secret flights over European territory since 2001, some to transfer terror suspects to countries that used torture. Investigators said that the same US agents and planes were involved over and over again.&lt;ref name="NyTimes060427"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/world/europe/27cia.html?ex=1303790400&amp;en=f28193a7c7a919c0&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss European Inquiry Says C.I.A. Flew 1,000 Flights in Secret], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament adopted a resolution in July 2006 endorsing the Council of Europe's conclusions, midway through its own investigation into the alleged program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2006-0316+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN Texts adopted by Parliament. Thursday, 6 July 2006 ‚Äì Strasbourg. Final edition: Extraordinary renditio]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In a resolution passed on 14 February 2007 MEPs approved by a large majority (382 voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining) their committee's final report, which criticized the rendition program and concluded that many European countries tolerated illegal [[CIA]] activities including secret flights over their territories. The countries named were: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Bbc070214"&gt;{{cite news | title=EU endorses damning report on CIA | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6360817.stm | accessdate=14 February 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date=14 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report ...

{{quote|''Denounces'' the lack of co-operation of many member states and of the [[Council of the European Union]] with the investigation;

''Regrets'' that European countries have been relinquishing control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the CIA which, on some occasions, were being used for illegal transportation of detainees;

''Calls'' for the closure of [the US military detention mission in] Guantanamo and for European countries immediately to seek the return of their citizens and residents who are being held illegally by the US authorities;

''Considers'' that all European countries should initiate independent investigations into all stopovers by civilian aircraft [hired by] the CIA;

''Urges'' that a ban or system of inspections be introduced for all CIA-operated aircraft known to have been involved in extraordinary rendition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6361829.stm EU rendition report: Key excerpts], on the BBC News website&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the report, the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture. The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of the Guantanamo camp. According to Italian Socialist [[Giovanni Fava]], who drafted the document, there was a "strong possibility" that the intelligence obtained under the illegal extraordinary rendition program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where "an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture".

=== Investigations by national governments ===

==== France ====
The French [[attorney general]] of [[Bobigny]] opened up an instruction in order "to verify the presence in [[Le Bourget Airport]], on 20 July 2005, of the plane numbered N50BH." This instruction was opened following a complaint deposed in December 2005 by the ''[[Ligue des droits de l'homme]]'' (LDH) NGO ("Human Rights League") and the ''[[International Federation of Human Rights Leagues]]'' (FIDH) NGO on charges of "arbitrary detention", "crime of torture" and "non-respect of the rights of [[war prisoners]]". It has as objective to determine if the plane was used to transport CIA prisoners to [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] and if the French authorities had knowledge of this stop. However, the lawyer defending the LDH declared that he was surprised that the instruction was only opened on 20 January 2006, and that no verifications had been done before.
On 2 December 2005, conservative newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' had revealed the existence of two CIA planes that had landed in France, suspected of transporting CIA prisoners. But the instruction concerned only N50BH, which was a [[Gulfstream III]], which would have landed at Le Bourget on 20 July 2005, coming from [[Oslo]], Norway. The other suspected aircraft would have landed in [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 31 March 2002. It is investigated by the Canadian authorities, as it would have been flying from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] in Canada, via [[Keflav√≠k]] in Iceland before going to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}{{cite news | title=La France enqu√™te sur les avions de la CIA |work=Le Figaro  |language=French |date=2 February 2006 | url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060302.FIG000000200_la_france_enquete_sur_les_avions_de_la_cia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
Business daily ''[[Handelsblatt]]'' reported 24 November 2005, that the CIA used an American military base in Germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the German government. The ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'' reported the following day there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a "high probability" of being operated by the CIA, at [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]], the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] and others. The newspaper cited experts and "[[Aircraft spotting|plane-spotters]]" who observed the planes as responsible for the tally.&lt;ref name="refbot.947"&gt;{{cite web | title=CIA Uses German Bases to Transport Terrorists, Paper Says | publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] | date=25 November 2005 | url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1792376,00.html | accessdate=18 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police at [[Shannon Airport]] said that they had received political instruction not to approach, search or otherwise interfere with US aircraft suspected of being involved in extraordinary rendition flights.

==== Portugal ====
Portugal opened up an investigation concerning CIA flights in February 2007, on the basis of declarations by [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Ana Gomes]] and by Rui Costa Pinto, journalist of ''[[Vis√£o]]'' review. The Portuguese general prosecutor, [[C√¢ndida Almeida]], head of the [[Central Investigation and Penal Action Department]] (DCIAP), announced the opening of investigations on 5 February 2007. They were to be centered on the issue of "torture or inhuman and cruel treatment," and instigated by allegations of "illegal activities and serious human rights violations" made by MEP Ana Gomes to the attorney general, Pinto Monteiro, on 26 January 2007.&lt;ref name="StateFeb07"&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/feb/03cia-portugal.htm Portugal: Renditions: Judicial investigation into CIA flights begins], ''[[Statewatch]] News Online'', 5 February 2007 ‚Äì 6 February 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, the UK NGO [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] published a report based on flight logs obtained by Ana Gomes, confirming that over 728 prisoners were flown to Guant√°namo through Portuguese airspace, and hence through Portuguese jurisdiction, in at least 28 flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=www.statewatch.org|title= Portugal: Over 700 prisoners flown to Guant√°namo through Portuguese airspace|url= http://www.statewatch.org/news/2008/feb/02reprieve-rendition-portugal.htm|accessdate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most critic voice against the scarce collaboration provided by the Portuguese government to the European Parliament Commission which investigated CIA flights, Ana Gomes declared that, although she had no doubt that permission of these illegal flights were frequent during [[Dur√£o Barroso]] (2002‚Äì2004) and [[Santana Lopes]] (2004‚Äì2005)' governments, "during the [Socialist] government of [[Jos√© S√≥crates]] [2005‚Äì ], 24 flights which passed through Portuguese territory" are registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/noticia.aspx?cod=20070205202548&amp;ch=69 Portugal/CIA ‚Äì La Fiscal√≠a General abre una investigaci√≥n sobre los supuestos vuelos ilegales de la CIA en Portugal], ''[[Europa Press]]'', 5 February 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active in the TDIP commission, Ana Gomes complained about the Portuguese state's reluctance to provide information, leading her to tensions with the Foreign minister, [[Lu√≠s Amado]], member of the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|same party]]. Ana Gomes declared herself satisfied with the opening of the investigations, but underlined that she had always claimed that a parliamentary inquiry would be necessary.&lt;ref name="StateFeb07" /&gt;

On the other hand, journalist Rui Costa Pinto was heard by the DCIAP, as he had written an article, refused by ''Vis√£o'', about flights passing by [[Lajes Field]], a Portuguese airbase used by the US Air Forces, in the [[Azores]].&lt;ref name="StateFeb07" /&gt;

==== Romania ====
[[Franco Frattini]] the European Union Justice Commissioner requested an explanation from the governments of Poland and Romania about the accusations made by Dick Marty. Doris Mircea (Romanian spokeswoman in [[Brussels]]) replied to this in November 2007 in a letter stating "no person was kept illegally as a prisoner within Romanian jails and no illegal transfer of detainees passed through Romanian territory" and that that was the official finding of a committee of inquiry set up by the government to investigate the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7097253.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Romania says it had no CIA bases | date=15 November 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa√≠s]]'' reported that CIA planes had landed in the [[Canary Islands]] and in [[Palma de Mallorca]]. Spanish magistrate [[Baltasar Garz√≥n]], notable for his earlier attempt to prosecute Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]], opened up an investigation concerning these landings which, according to Madrid, were made without official knowledge, thus being a breach of [[national sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='El Gobierno canario pide explicaciones sobre vuelos de la CIA en Tenerife' |date=16 November 2005 |work=El Pais |url=http://www.elpais.es/articulo/elpepinac/20051116elpepinac_3/Tes/Canarias%20pide%20explicaciones%20sobre%20las%20escalas%20de%20vuelos%20de%20la%20CIA%20en%20Tenerife |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301012114/http://www.elpais.es/articulo/elpepinac/20051116elpepinac_3/Tes/Canarias%20pide%20explicaciones%20sobre%20las%20escalas%20de%20vuelos%20de%20la%20CIA%20en%20Tenerife |archivedate=1 March 2006 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='La Fiscal√≠a de Canarias investigar√° las escalas de vuelos de la CIA en Tenerife y Gran Canaria' |date=18 November 2005 |work=El Mundo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/11/18/espana/1132315880.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Un supuesto avi√≥n de la CIA aterriza en la base portuguesa de Azores' |date=28 November 2005 |publisher=Canarias 7 |url=http://www.canarias7.es/articulo.cfm?Id=14607&amp;dia=29%20November%202005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomatic cables exposed in 2010 by [[WikiLeaks]] suggest that the United States government including the American ambassador, worked with parts of the Spanish government to subvert the Spanish judicial process to control and ultimately stymie and thwart the investigation.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks Cables" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wikileaks judicial interference"&gt;Tremlett, Giles,[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/30/wikileaks-us-spain-guantanamo- Wikileaks: US pressured Spain over CIA rendition and Guant√°namo torture rendition] The Guardian, 1 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horton Interview DemocraqcyNow"&gt;Horton, Scott [http://www.democracynow.org/2010/12/1/wikileaks_cables_reveal_us_tried_to WikiLeaks Cables Reveal U.S. Tried to Thwart Spanish Probes of Gitmo Torture and CIA Rendition] Interview with Amy Goodman, 1 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Repatriation of Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery}}
Extraordinary rendition provoked a diplomatic crisis between the United States and Sweden in 2006 when Swedish authorities put a stop to CIA rendition flights.&lt;ref name="Sweden Stops Flights"&gt;Nylander, Johan, [http://www.swedishwire.com/politics/7497-cia-rendition-flights-stopped-by-swedish-military CIA rendition flights stopped by Swedish military] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208232249/http://www.swedishwire.com/politics/7497-cia-rendition-flights-stopped-by-swedish-military |date=8 December 2010 }} The Swedish Wire, 5 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001 Swedish police detained Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery, two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden. The police took them to Bromma airport in Stockholm, and then stood aside as masked alleged CIA operatives cut their clothes from their bodies, inserted drugged suppositories in their anuses, and dressed them in diapers and overalls, handcuffed and chained them and put them on an executive jet with American registration N379P.  They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to extensive investigate reports by Swedish programme "Kalla fakta".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/de/news/2004/11/21/swedish-tv4-kalla-fakta-program-broken-promise-part-iv |title=Kalla Facta program Part IV-"The Broken Promise" |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=21 November 2004 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Swedish Parliamentary investigator concluded that the degrading and inhuman treatment of the two prisoners violated Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/20/AR2005052001605.html New Swedish Documents Illuminate CIA Action] The Washington Post, 21 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the United Nations found Sweden had violated an international torture ban in its complicity in the CIA's transfer of al-Zari to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/11/09/sweden-violated-torture-ban-cia-rendition Sweden Violated Torture Ban in CIA Rendition] Human Rights Watch 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden imposed strict rules on rendition flights, but Swedish Military Intelligence posing as airport personnel who boarded one of two subsequent extraordinary rendition flights in 2006 during a stopover at Stockholm's Arlanda International Airport found the Swedish restrictions were being ignored.&lt;ref name="Sweden Stops Flights" /&gt; In 2008 the Swedish government awarded al-Zery $500,000 in damages for the abuse he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Sweden Stops Flights" /&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
After claims by [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] that British airports had been used by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|"CIA]] for extraordinary rendition flights, the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] launched an investigation in November 2005. The report was published in June 2007 and found no evidence to support the claim. This was on the same day the Council of Europe released its report with evidence that the UK had colluded in extraordinary rendition, thus directly contradicting ACPO's findings. Liberty has challenged the findings and has stated that its original claims were based on "credible evidence".&lt;ref name="BBC News 9 June"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6736227.stm Police reject UK rendition claims], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 9 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, the government's Intelligence and Security Committee released their Rendition report, detailing U.S. and U.K. activities and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/upload/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/publications/intelligence/20070725_isc_final.pdf Rendition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227144826/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/upload/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/publications/intelligence/20070725_isc_final.pdf |date=27 February 2008 }}; Intelligence and Security Committee; The [[Rt Hon]] [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy MP]], Chairman; July 2007.

Retrieved July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2008, British Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] admitted (despite previous government denials) that two U.S. extraordinary rendition flights had stopped on [[Diego Garcia]] in 2002, a U.K. territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7256587.stm|title=UK apology on US terror flights|publisher=BBC|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned as to whether the government had deliberately misled the public over rendition, the Foreign Secretary apologised and stated that the government had simply "made a mistake". His statement also laid out the current UK Government view on Extraordinary rendition;

{{quote|Our counter-terrorism relationship with the United States is vital to UK security. I am absolutely clear that there must and will continue to be the strongest possible intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship with the US, consistent with UK law and our international obligations.

As part of our close co-operation, there has long been a regular exchange with the US authorities, in which we have set out: that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including Overseas Territories; that we will grant that permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations; and how we understand our obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7257500.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=In full: Miliband rendition statement | date=21 February 2008 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Miliband}}

A judicial inquiry, chaired by [[Sir Peter Gibson]] was announced by the government in July 2010, but was never formally launched and was scrapped in January 2012. According to the government, this was due to ongoing criminal investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-16614514 |publisher=BBC News | title=UK inquiry into rendition and torture collusion scrapped | date=19 January 2012 | accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 the CIA and FBI won a court ruling in the USA, exempting them from releasing documentation requested by British members of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cia-wins-fight-to-keep-mps-in-dark-on-rendition-7631357.html |publisher=The Independent| title=CIA wins fight to keep MPs in dark on rendition|date=11 April 2012|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that relevant 2002 flight records from Diego Garcia had been destroyed by [[water damage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=15|last=Leith|first=Sam|title=To back up, or not to back up|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Erroneous rendition" ==
An article published in 5 December 2005, ''The Washington Post'' reported that the [[CIA]]'s [[Inspector General]] was investigating what it calls '''erroneous renditions'''.&lt;ref name="WaPo051205"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301476_pf.html Wrongful Imprisonment: Anatomy of a CIA Mistake: German Citizen Released After Months in 'Rendition'], [[Dana Priest]], ''The Washington Post'', 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears to refer to cases in which innocent people were subjected to extraordinary rendition.

[[Khalid El-Masri]] is the most well-known person who is believed to have been subjected to the process of "extraordinary rendition", as a result of mistaken identity. [[Laid Saidi]], an Algerian detained and tortured along with El-Masri, was apprehended apparently because of a taped telephone conversation in which the word ''tirat'', meaning "tires" in Arabic, was mistaken for the word ''tairat'', meaning "airplanes".&lt;ref name="NyTimes060707" /&gt;

The Post's anonymous sources say that the Inspector General is looking into a number of similar cases‚Äîpossibly as many as thirty innocent men who were captured and transported through what has been called "erroneous renditions".

A 27 December 2005 story quotes anonymous CIA insiders claiming there have been 10 or fewer such erroneous renditions.&lt;ref name="ApNews"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-12-27-cia-renditions_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA CIA watchdog probes 'renditions' of suspects], [[Associated Press]], 27 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
It names the CIA's [[inspector general]], [[John Helgerson]], as the official responsible for the inquiry.

The AP story quotes Tom Malinowski, Washington office director of Human Rights Watch who said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am glad the CIA is investigating the cases that they are aware of, but by definition you are not going to be aware of all such cases, when you have a process designed to avoid judicial safeguards.&lt;ref name="ApNews" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Obama Executive Order on rendition ==

Two days after President Barack Obama was sworn into office, on 22 January 2009, he signed an executive order entitled "Ensuring Lawful Interrogations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations |title=Ensuring Lawful Interrogations |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218212240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations |archivedate=18 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order specifically addresses the practice of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov" /&gt; It establishes a committee that will provide recommendations within 180 days of the executive order. It specifically has as its goal a process to ensure that the United States practices do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov" /&gt;

Overall, the executive order calls for more oversight of interrogation by third parties, but does not end extraordinary rendition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/politics/25rendition.html | title=U.S. Says Rendition to Continue, but With More Oversight | author=Johnston, David | work=The New York Times | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section of the Executive Order relating to extraordinary rendition provides as follows:

{{quote|
* '''(e) Mission.'''  The mission of the Special Task Force shall be:
** '''(i)'''   to study and evaluate whether the interrogation practices and techniques in [[FM 2-22.3 Human Intelligence Collector Operations|Army Field Manual 2 22.3]], when employed by departments or agencies outside the military, provide an appropriate means of acquiring the intelligence necessary to protect the Nation, and, if warranted, to recommend any additional or different guidance for other departments or agencies; and
** '''(ii)'''  to study and evaluate the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.
* '''(f) Administration.'''  The Special Task Force shall be established for administrative purposes within the Department of Justice and the Department of Justice shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide administrative support and funding for the Special Task Force.
* '''(g) Recommendations.''' The Special Task Force shall provide a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Counsel to the President, on the matters set forth in subsection (d) within 180 days of the date of this order, unless the Chair determines that an extension is necessary.
* '''(h) Termination.'''  The Chair shall terminate the Special Task Force upon the completion of its duties.}}

On 2 November 2009 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that victims of extraordinary rendition cannot sue Washington for torture suffered overseas, because Congress has not authorized such lawsuits, in ruling on Canadian citizen Maher Arar's case.&lt;ref name=maher_arar_appeal_rejected&gt;{{cite web | title= Appeals Court Rules in Maher Arar Case: Innocent Victims of Extraordinary Rendition Cannot Sue in US Courts | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/11/3/appeals_court_rules_in_maher_arar| accessdate=4 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September 2010 [[PolitiFact.com]] wrote about the Obama administration's record on renditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The administration has announced new procedural safeguards concerning individuals who are sent to foreign countries. President Obama also promised to shut down the CIA-run "black sites," and there seems to be anecdotal evidence that extreme renditions are not happening, at least not as much as they did during the Bush administration. Still, human rights groups say that these safeguards are inadequate and that the DOJ Task Force recommendations still allow the U.S. to send individuals to foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Obama's extreme rendition policy is issued, but results still uncertain | url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/176/end-the-use-of-extreme-rendition/ |accessdate=7 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other Countries ==

=== CIA participating countries ===
According to a report by the [[Open Society Foundations]], 54 countries participated at one point or another with the CIA's extraordinary rendition program:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/globalizing-torture-cia-secret-detention-and-extraordinary-rendition|title=Globalizing Torture: CIA Secret Detention and Extraordinary Rendition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">In modern U.S. usage, '''forfeiture''' is deprivation or destruction of a [[rights|right]] in consequence of the non-performance of some [[Obligation (law)|obligation]] or condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Connellan v. Federal Life &amp; Casualty Co.|vol=134|reporter=ME|opinion=104|date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be accidental, and therefore is distinguished from [[waiver]]; ''see [[waiver and forfeiture]].''  

Historically, forfeiture of a convict‚Äôs land and other assets followed on from conviction for certain serious offences (and thus resulted from criminal activity rather than from a failure to act).  A striking illustration of the practical effects of this rule is [[Giles Corey]]‚Äôs refusal to plead, in the [[Salem Witch Trials]], instead dying under ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.  By refusing to plead he avoided the jurisdiction of the court and thus avoided conviction and the consequent forfeiture of his estate.  Instead it passed to his sons.{{citation needed |date=November 2018}}

In the early 21st century, the [[United States Government]] began to seize [[domain name]]s, on the legal theory that they were property used in [[criminal activity|criminal activities]] and thus subject to forfeiture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Also, while there is a greater consensus regarding the formal rights, due partly on diplomacy motives, the actual implementation process is much more complex.

[[File:Igualtat de sexes.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for gender equality]]
'''Gender equality''', also known as '''sexual equality''', is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender.

{{Quote|text=Gender equality, equality between men and women, entails the concept that all human beings, both men and women, are free to develop their personal abilities and make choices without the limitations set by stereotypes, rigid gender roles and prejudices. Gender equality means that the different behaviour, aspirations and needs of women and men are considered, valued and favoured equally. It does not mean that women and men have to become the same, but that their rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female. Gender equity means fairness of treatment for women and men, according to their respective needs. This may include equal treatment or treatment that is different but which is considered equivalent in terms of rights, benefits, obligations and opportunities.|sign=ABC Of Women Worker's Rights And Gender Equality|source=ILO, 2000. p. 48.}}

Gender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help in achieving the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is more than equal representation, it is strongly tied to [[women's rights]], and often requires policy changes. As of 2017, the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of [[Third gender|genders besides women and men]], or [[Gender identity|gender identities]] outside of the [[gender binary]].

[[UNICEF]] says gender equality "means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Overarching_2Pager_Web.pdf|title=Promoting Gender Equality: An Equity-based Approach to Programming|first=Roger|date=2011|website=Operational Guidance Overview in Brief|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2011-01-28|author=LeMoyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including [[sex trafficking]], [[femicide]], [[wartime sexual violence]], and other [[Violence against women|oppression tactics]]. [[UNFPA]] stated that, "despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Population Fund|publisher=UNFPA|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, gender equality is the fifth of seventeen [[Sustainable Development Goals|sustainable development goals]] of the [[United Nations]]. [[Gender inequality]] is measured annually by the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s [[Human Development Report]]s.

== History ==
[[Christine de Pizan]], an early advocate for gender equality, states in her 1405 book ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice, pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics|author=Riane Eisler|authorlink=Riane Eisler|year=2007|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakers]], an evangelical group, which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict [[celibacy]], were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a [[Quaker]] community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers' central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal. He then brought [[Lucy Wright]] into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured the society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men's spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man. After Meacham's death in 1796, Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821.

Shakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women's rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were "the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederick William |last=Evans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg2bS2pDUVMC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Shakers: Compendium of the Origin, History, Principles, Rules and Regulations, Government, and Doctrines of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing |place=New York |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co. |year=1859 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on speakers' platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:
{{Quote|Each sex works in its own appropriate sphere of action, there being a proper subordination, deference and respect of the female to the male in his order, {{em|and of the male to the female in her order}} [emphasis added], so that in any of these communities the zealous advocates of "women‚Äôs rights" may here find a practical realization of their ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes'' (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. It has been argued that they demonstrated that gender equality was achievable and how to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy R. Benningfield, Appeal of the Sisterhood: The Shakers and the Woman's Rights Movement (University of Kentucky Lexington doctoral dissertation, 2004), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the [[suffragette|suffrage movement]] in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to [[women's property rights]], particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]].)

Since [[World War II]], the [[women's liberation]] movement and [[feminism]] have created a general movement towards recognition of [[women's rights]]. The [[United Nations]] and other international agencies have adopted several conventions which promote gender equality. These conventions have not been uniformly adopted by all countries, and include:
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] was adopted in 1960, and came into force in 1962 and 1968.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It has been described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, which came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a [[human rights]] declaration adopted by consensus at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] on 25 June 1993 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Women's rights are addressed at para 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | author-link = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | title = Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action | url = http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O | publisher = [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1993.
* In 1994, the twenty-year ''Cairo Programme of Action'' was adopted at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. This [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] programme-of-action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. As such, it called for [[family planning]], [[reproductive rights]] services, and strategies to promote gender equality and stop violence against women.
* Also in 1994, in the Americas, the [http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women], known as the ''Convention of Bel√©m do Par√°'', called for the end of violence and discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Organization of American States | author-link = Organization of American States | title = Follow-up Mechanism to the Bel√©m do Par√° Convention (MESECVI): About the Bel√©m do Par√° Convention | publisher = [[Organization of American States]] | url = http://www.oas.org/en/mesecvi/convention.asp | accessdate = 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the end of the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]], the UN adopted the [[Beijing Declaration]] on 15 September 1995 - a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] adopted to promulgate a set of principles concerning gender equality.
* The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325]] (UNSRC 1325), which was adopted on 31 October 2000, deals with the rights and protection of women and girls during and after [[armed conflict]]s.
* The [[Maputo Protocol]] guarantees comprehensive rights to women, including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political equality with men, to control their [[reproductive health]], and an end to [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]. It was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] and came into force in 2005.
* The EU [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] ''Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states that: "Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of European Communities|last=|first=|date=9 February 1976|publisher=EUR-Lex Access to European Union law|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Convention of Bel√©m do Par√° and the Istanbul Convention: a response to violence against women worldwide | url = https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[Organization of American States]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations]] and Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations | date = March 2014 }} CSW58 side event flyer 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; came into force in 2014.

:*Preventing and combating [[violence against women]]
:*Guaranteeing Equal Access of Women to Justice
:*Achieving balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision-making
:*Achieving [[Gender mainstreaming|Gender Mainstreaming]] in all policies and measures

Such [[legislation]] and [[affirmative action]] policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least "somewhat important," and a global median of 65% believe it is "very important" that women have the same rights as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/strong-global-support-for-gender-equality-especially-among-women/|title=Strong global support for gender equality, especially among women|last=Zainulbhai|first=Hani|date=2016-03-08|website=Pew Research|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries.{{Refn|For example, many countries now permit women to serve in the [[armed forces]], the [[police|police forces]] and to be [[fire fighter]]s ‚Äì occupations traditionally reserved for men. Although these continue to have a male majority, an increasing number of women are now active, especially in directive fields such as politics, and occupy high positions in business.|group=lower-roman}}

Similarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered [[women's work]], such as [[nursing]], [[Maid|cleaning]] and [[child care]]. In domestic situations, the role of [[Parenting]] or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a [[career]] after [[childbirth]]. For further information, see [[Shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the [[Married and maiden names#Feminism and preserving one's personal name|non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband's surname on marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450|title=Why should women change their names on getting married?|last=Coulombeau|first=Sophie|date=1 November 2014|publisher=BBC|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in [[religious law|religiously orientated societies]].{{Refn|For example, [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam#Contents|the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] declared that women have equal dignity but not equal rights, and this was accepted by many predominantly Muslim countries.|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In some [[Christianity|Christian churches]], the practice of [[churching of women]] may still have elements of [[ritual purification]] and the [[Ordination of women]] to the priesthood may be restricted or forbidden.|group=lower-roman}} Some Christians or Muslims believe in [[Complementarianism]], a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.

In addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, a [[Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide#Cultural preference|cultural preference for a male child]] has resulted in a [[Missing women of Asia|shortfall of women]] in the population. [[Feminism in Japan|The feminist movement in Japan]] has made many strides which resulted in Rethe [[Gender Equality Bureau]], but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.

The notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas.{{Refn|An example is [[Finland]], which has offered very high opportunities to women in public/professional life but has had a weak legal approach to the issue of [[violence against women]], with the situation in this country having been called a [[paradox]].&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clarke | first = Kris | title = The paradoxical approach to intimate partner violence in Finland | journal = [[Tokiwa University#Publications|International Perspectives in Victimology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 9‚Äì19 | doi = 10.5364/ipiv.6.1.19 | date = August 2011 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/83438809/paradoxical-approach-intimate-partner-violence-finland | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-08-27 }} [https://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland Available through academia.edu.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McKie |first1=Linda |last2=Hearn |first2=Jeff |title=Gender-neutrality and gender equality: comparing and contrasting policy responses to 'domestic violence' in Finland and Scotland |journal=[[Scottish Affairs]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85‚Äì107 |doi=10.3366/scot.2004.0043 |date=August 2004 |ref=harv |postscript=. }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021023708/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;"Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation. International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937 but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 ‚Äî making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995.

==Gender biases==
There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of "progress" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966913723|title=Man's dominion : religion and the eclipse of women's rights in world politics|last=Sheila|first=Jeffreys,|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415596732|location=|pages=94|oclc=966913723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EU Gender Policy: Trapped in the 'Wollstonecraft Dilemma'?|first=Emanuela|last=Lombardo|date=1 May 2003|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159‚Äì180|doi=10.1177/1350506803010002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the [[European Union]], is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647686058|title=Multiple meanings of gender equality : a critical frame analysis of gender policies in Europe|last=Lombardo|first=Emanuela|last2=Jalu≈°i√®|first2=Vlasta|last3=Maloutas|first3=Maro Pantelidou|last4=Sauer|first4=Birgit|date=|publisher=Central European University Press Budapest|year=2007|isbn=9786155211393|editor-last=Verloo|editor-first=Mike|location=New York|pages=79‚Äì108|chapter=III.

A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of [[imperialism]] and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of "othering" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders - the "violent others" - and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/sp/article-abstract/20/4/534/1714604/The-Othering-of-Domestic-Violence-The-EU-and|title=The Othering of Domestic Violence: The EU and Cultural Framings of Violence against Women|first1=Celeste|last1=Montoya|first2=Lise|last2=Rolandsen Agust√≠n|date=1 December 2013|journal=Soc Polit|volume=20|issue=4|pages=534‚Äì557|via=sp.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/sp/jxt020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316143234|title=An introduction to feminist philosophy|last=Alison|first=Stone|date=|publisher=Polity Press|year=2008|isbn=9780745638836|location=|pages=209‚Äì211|oclc=316143234}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in [[family law]] in the 1980s.{{Refn|In Switzerland in 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland profile - Timeline|date=28 December 2016|website=Bbc.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|first=Markus G.

==Efforts to fight inequality==
{{see also|Gender inequality}}
In 2010, the [[European Union]] opened the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]] to promote gender equality and to fight [[sex discrimination]]. In 2015 the EU published the Gender Action Plan 2016‚Äì2020.&lt;ref name="GAP2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=The European Union's new Gender Action Plan 2016‚Äì2020: gender equality and women's empowerment in external relations|url=https://www.odi.org/publications/10021-gender-equality-empowerment-eu-external-relations-gap-2016_2020|website=odi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries. By presidential decree, the Republic of Kazakhstan created a Strategy for Gender Equality 2006‚Äì2016 to chart the subsequent decade of gender equality efforts.&lt;ref name="sgeinkz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy for Gender Equality in Kazakhstan 2006‚Äì2016|url=https://www.ndi.org/files/Kazakhstan-Gender-Strategy-2006-2016.pdf|website=NDI.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal, Social and Health Education]], [[Religious education|religious studies]] and [[Language acquisition]] curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society.

A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development. To overcome gender inequality the [[United Nations Population Fund]] states that, "Women's empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policy-making. These levels include reproductive health, economic empowerment, educational empowerment and political empowerment."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/engaging-men-and-boys-brief-summary-unfpa-experience-and-lessons-learned|title=Engaging Men and Boys: A Brief Summary of UNFPA Experience and Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=2013|website=UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNFPA]] says that "research has also demonstrated how working with men and boys as well as women and girls to promote gender equality contributes to achieving health and development outcomes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Further|Gender disparities in health}}
Social constructs of [[gender]] (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]) often have a negative effect on health. The World Health Organization cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm [[women's health]]. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through [[risk|risk taking]], and men dying at much higher rate from [[lung cancer]] due to [[smoking]], in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting [[men's health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/genderandhealth/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Violence against women====
[[File:FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Anti-[[FGM]] road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005]]
{{Main article|Violence against women}}
[[Violence against women]] is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.{{Refn|Forms of violence against women include [[Sexual violence]] (including [[War Rape]], [[Marital rape]], [[Date rape]] by drugs or alcohol, and [[Child sexual abuse]], the latter often in the context of [[Child marriage]]), [[Domestic violence]], [[Forced marriage]], [[Female genital mutilation]], [[Forced prostitution]], [[Sex trafficking]], [[Honor killing]], [[Dowry killing]], [[Acid attacks]], [[Stoning]], [[Flogging]], [[Forced sterilisation]], [[Forced abortion]], violence related to accusations of witchcraft, mistreatment of widows (e.g. widow inheritance). Fighting against violence against women is considered a key issue for achieving gender equality. The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).|group=lower-roman}} This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly ''because'' they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs.{{Refn|The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life" and states that:"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women|author=|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Violence and mistreatment of women in marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage ([[domestic violence]]) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as [[dowry]], [[bride price]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]]).

According to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on [[Intimate partner violence]] victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, Ronet (January 1994).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/digitization/145325ncjrs.pdf Violence Against Women: A National Crime Victimization Survey Report]&amp;nbsp;(PDF)(Report).

In some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life.{{Refn|According to UNFPA:&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm|title=Gender equality|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, it is only in more recent decades that domestic violence against women has received significant legal attention. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring this form of violence.{{Refn|In its [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm explanatory report] at para 219, it states:

In some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male 'owners' of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women's family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf|title=Supplement to the Handbook for Legislation on Violence Against Women: Harmful Practices Against Women|last=|first=|date=2012|website=UN Women|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices include [[Types of rape#Payback rape|payback rape]], a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the [[Pacific Islands]], which consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers, with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waaiabulletin.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/png_activist_toolkit_16_days_2009_-_iwd_2010.pdf|title=Many Voices One Message: Stop Violence Against Women in PNG|last=|first=|date=2009‚Äì2010|website=Activist Toolkit, Amnesty International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard A.

Posner, page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the [[Family honor|honor of the family]], rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml|title=Ethics: Honour crimes |website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895|title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings'|website=BBC News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences.{{Refn|She writes "To know what is wrong with rape, know what is right about sex. If this, in turn, is difficult, the difficulty is as instructive as the difficulty men have in telling the difference when women see one. Perhaps the wrong of rape has proved so difficult to define because the unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse, while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'', by Catharine A. MacKinnon, pp 174&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Socialization within rigid gender constructs often creates an environment where sexual violence is common.{{Refn|According to the World Health Organization: "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf|title=World report on violence and health: summary|website=World Health Organization|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} One of the challenges of dealing with sexual violence is that in many societies women are perceived as being readily available for sex, and men are seen as entitled to their bodies, until and unless women object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/32000/ior530012011en.pdf|title=Rape and Sexual Violence: Human rights law and standards in the international criminal court|last=|first=|date=1 March 2011|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/64000/eur270022007en.pdf|title=Hungary: Cries Unheard: The Failure To Protect Women From Rape And Sexual Violence In The Home|publisher=Amnesty International|date=2007|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Rebecca Cook wrote in ''Submission of Interights to the European Court of Human Rights in the case of [[M.C. v.

The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions, and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing and the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/hiv_aids/en/|title=WHO: World Health Organization|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maternal mortality]] is a major problem in many parts of the world. [[UNFPA]] states that countries have an obligation to protect women's right to health, but many countries do not do that.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/reducing_mm.pdf|title=Reducing Maternal Mortality: The contribution of the right to the highest attainable standard of health|last=Hunt|first=Paul|last2=Mezquita de Bueno|first2=Julia|publisher=University of Essex|year=2010|isbn=|location=United Nations Population Fund|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of [[human rights]].{{Refn|[[UNFPA]] says that, "since 1990, the world has seen a 45 per cent decline in maternal mortality ‚Äì an enormous achievement. But in spite of these gains, almost 800 women still die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. This is about one woman every two minutes."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health: UNFPA ‚Äì United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNFPA:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

:"Preventable maternal mortality occurs where there is a failure to give effect to the rights of women to health, equality, and non-discrimination. Preventable maternal mortality also often represents a violation of a woman‚Äôs right to life."|group=lower-roman}}

The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as [[forced sterilization]], forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. [[forced marriage]], [[child marriage]]), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as [[sex outside marriage]]), lack of criminalization of [[marital rape]], violence in regard to the choice of partner ([[honor killings]] as punishment for 'inappropriate' relations).{{Refn|Amnesty International‚Äôs Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity ‚Äì even punishable by death."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|publisher=Amnesty International|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman's right to control her sexuality is not recognized.{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] has called for full respect and recognition of women's autonomy and sexual and reproductive health rights, stating:

:"Violations of women's human rights are often linked to their sexuality and reproductive role. Women are frequently treated as property, they are sold into marriage, into trafficking, into sexual slavery. Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence. Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate, while infertile women are rejected by husbands, families, and communities. In many countries, married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands, and often have no say in whether they use contraception."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/images/files/news/news_2012/Navi%20Pillay%20Lecture%2015%20May%202012.pdf|title=Valuing Women as Autonomous Beings: Women's sexual and reproductive rights|last=Pillay|first=Navi|date=May 15, 2012|website=University of Pretoria, Centre for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices infringe on the right of achieving reproductive and sexual health.|group=lower-roman}}

[[Adolescent]] girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors.{{Refn|Females' risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of males'.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents|title=Giving Special Attention to Girls and Adolescents|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

=====Family planning and abortion=====

[[Family planning]] is the practice of freely deciding the number of children one has and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of contraception or voluntary sterilization. Abortion is the induced termination of pregnancy. [[Abortion law]]s vary significantly by country. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia |website=Balkan Insight |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family planning is particularly important from a women's rights perspective, as having very many pregnancies, especially in areas where malnutrition is present, can seriously endanger women's health. UNFA writes that "Family planning is central to gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/family-planning|title=Family planning: UNFPA ‚Äì United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family planning is often opposed by governments who have strong [[natalist]] policies. During the 20th century, such examples have included the aggressive natalist policies from [[communist Romania]] and [[communist Albania]]. State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by some authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Documentation Center of Cambodia, ''Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity,''|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the [[one child policy]] of China (1979‚Äì2015) included punishments for families with more than one child and [[forced abortion]]s. Some governments have sought to prevent certain ethnic or social groups from reproduction. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|date=24 July 2002|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls====
Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal [[impunity]] of perpetrators of crimes against women, with such crimes being often ignored by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ImpunityForVAWGlobalConcern.aspx|title=Impunity for violence against women is a global concern|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case with murders of women in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/CDDandCMDPDH_forthesession_Mexico_CEDAW52.pdf|format=PDF|title=Femicide and Impunity in Mexico: A context of structural and genearlized violence|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/4/femicide-in-latin-america|title=Femicide in Latin America|website=Unwomen.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgrs.uchastings.edu/our-work/central-america-femicides-and-gender-based-violence|title=Central America: Femicides and Gender-Based Violence|website=Cgrs.uchastings.edu|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is impunity in regard to [[domestic violence]].{{Refn|High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], has stated on domestic violence against women: "The reality for most victims, including victims of honor killings, is that state institutions fail them and that most perpetrators of domestic violence can rely on a culture of impunity for the acts they commit ‚Äì acts which would often be considered as crimes, and be punished as such, if they were committed against strangers."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E|title=High Commissioner speaks out against domestic violence and "honour killing" on occasion of International Women's Day"|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

Women are often, in law or in practice, unable to access legal institutions. UN Women has said that: "Too often, justice institutions, including the police and the courts, deny women justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progress.unwomen.org/|title=Progress of the World's Women 2015‚Äì2016|website=My Favorite News|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence.{{Refn|According to Amnesty International, "Women who are victims of gender-related violence often have little recourse because many state agencies are themselves guilty of gender bias and discriminatory practices."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|website=Amnesty International USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}

====Harmful traditional practices====

"Harmful traditional practices" refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can be affected.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbv.scot.nhs.uk/gbv/harmful-traditional-practices|title=National Gender Based Violence &amp; Health Programme|website=Gbv.scot.nhs.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet23en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children|website=Ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These practices include, according to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]:&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

{{Quote|[[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price}}

Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Abuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

The [[caste system in India]] which leads to [[untouchability]] (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by [[Dalit]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/chrgj-hrw.pdf|format=PDF|title=CASTE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DALITS OR SO-CALLED UNTOUCHABLES IN INDIA|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/one-in-four-indians-admit-to-practising-untouchability-biggest-caste-survey/|title=Biggest caste survey: One in four Indians admit to practising untouchability|date=29 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional customs regarding birth sometimes endanger the mothers. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to "confess" to the infidelity.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;

Tribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the [[Satere-Mawe]] tribe use [[bullet ant]]s as an [[initiation rite]]. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants' stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered "warriors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/travel/Holidays/Wildlife/article77936.ece|title=Bitten by the Amazon|last=Backshall|first=Steve|date=6 January 2008|publisher=The Sunday Times|location=London|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other harmful traditional practices include [[marriage by abduction]], ritualized [[sexual slavery]] ([[Devadasi]], [[Trokosi]]), [[breast ironing]] and [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-13-0-000-11-Web/Anth-13-2-000-11-Abst-Pdf/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N/Anth-13-2-121-11-720-Wadesango-N-Tt.pdf|format=PDF|title=Violation of Women's Rights by Harmful Traditional Practices|author1=Newman Wadesango|author2= Symphorosa Rembe|author3=Owence Chabaya|website=Krepublishers.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/elim-disc-viol-girlchild/ExpertPapers/EP.4%20%20%20Raswork.pdf|format=PDF|title=The impact of harmful traditional practices on the girl child|website=Un.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/HarmfulPractices/GenderEmpowermentandDevelopment.pdf|format=PDF|title=Breast Ironing...

=====Female genital mutilation=====
[[File:Campaign_road_sign_against_female_genital_mutilation_(cropped)_2.jpg|thumb|left|Road sign near [[Kapchorwa]], [[Uganda]], 2004]]
[[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] regard the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] as "a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities ‚Äì whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim ‚Äì the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation: UNFPA ‚Äì United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in Egypt and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/unfpa-unicef-joint-programme-female-genital-mutilationcutting-accelerating-change|title=UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change|website=Unfpa.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt;

=====Forced marriage=====
[[File:Girl Summit - 22nd July in London (14498368279).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Poster against child and forced marriage]]
{{Main|Forced marriage}}
Early marriage, child marriage or [[forced marriage]] is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23.&lt;ref name="NHS Traditional" /&gt; Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl's education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58008.html|title=Child marriage|date=22 October 2014|website=UNICEF|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/topic/womens-rights/child-marriage|title=Child Marriage|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that "Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2014/child_marriage.pdf?ua=1|format=PDF|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly : 69/XX. Child, Early and Forced Marriage|website=Who.int|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, "one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/end-child-marriage|title=End Child Marriage|website = UNFPA ‚Äì United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] states that, "over 67 million women 20‚Äì24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org2" /&gt;

=====Bride price=====
{{Main|Bride price}}
[[Bride price]] (also called bridewealth or bride token) is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the bride. This custom often leads to women having reduced ability to control their fertility. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women's Fears and Men's Anxieties : The Impact of Family Planning on Gender Relations in Northern Ghana|website=Popcouncil.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. [[UN Women]] recommended its abolition, and stated that: "Legislation should [...] State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women‚Äôs right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of [[domestic violence]], including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands' homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Now (2007) Protecting the girl child: Using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations|url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf|format=PDF|website=Equalitynow.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lelieveld, M.|date=2011|title=Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia.

Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe (i.e. parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as the Netherlands and Ireland.{{Refn|In 2011, [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], then president of the [[European Commission]], stated "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, should look at the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce".&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-persistently-low-birthrate-gets-marginal-boost/a-15325123-0|title=Germany's persistently low birthrate gets marginal boost |date=18 August 2011 |website=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|The Netherlands and Ireland are among the last Western countries to accept women as professionals; despite the Netherlands having an image as progressive on gender issues, women in the Netherlands work less in paid employment than women in other comparable Western countries.

====Freedom of movement====
[[File:Group of Women Wearing Burkas.jpg|thumb|Women in [[Afghanistan]] wearing [[burqa]]s. Some clothes that women are required to wear, by law or custom, can restrict their movements]]
{{Further|Freedom of movement}}
The degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies by culture and socioeconomic characteristics. [[Seclusion]] of women within the home was a common practice among the [[upper classes]] of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies. Before the 20th century it was also common in parts of Southern Europe, such as much of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberating Women's History:Theoretical and Critical Essays'', edited by Berenice A. Carroll, pp. 161‚Äì2&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's [[freedom of movement]] continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to [[marriage laws]].{{Refn|For instance, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations stipulate that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref name="www2.ohchr.org" group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf|title=Yemen's Dark Side: Discrimination and violence against women and girls.|website=2.ohchr.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24691034|title=Why can't women drive in Saudi Arabia?|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2015|date = 27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) states at Article 15 (4) that:
{{Quote|4. States Parties shall accord to men and women the same rights with regard to the law relating to the movement of persons and the freedom to choose their residence and domicile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003 |publisher= |accessdate=14 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to laws, women's freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms.{{Refn|For example, [[purdah]], a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim communities in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as well as upper-caste Hindus in [[North India|Northern India]], such as the [[Rajputs]], which often leads to the minimizing of the movement of women in public spaces and restrictions on their social and professional interactions;&lt;ref name=Papanek group=upper-roman&gt;Papanek, Hanna.

====Girls' access to education====

{{Main article|Female education|Gender and education}}
In many parts of the world, girls' access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles. These include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|title=Global issues affecting women and girls |website=National Union of Teachers|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429020903/http://www.teachers.org.uk/node/12978|archivedate=29 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforeducationusa.org/obstacles-to-education-for-girls-and-women|title=Global Campaign For Education United States Chapter|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plan-international.org/files/Africa/progress-and-obstacles-to-girls-education-in-africa|title=Progress and Obstacles to Girls' Education in Africa|website=Plan International|date = 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OHCHR]], there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009‚Äì2014 with "a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15555&amp;LangID=E|title=Attacks against girls' education occurring with "increasing regularity" ‚Äì UN human rights report|last=|first=|date=9 February 2015|website=Ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender-equality|title=Gender equality|website=[[United Nations Population Fund]]|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|About two thirds of the world's [[Literacy#Gender disparities|illiterate]] adults are women. Lack of an education severely restricts a woman's access to information and opportunities. Conversely, increasing women's and girls' educational attainment benefits both individuals and future generations.

The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards.{{Refn|[[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869) compared marriage to [[slavery]] and wrote that: "The law of servitude in marriage is a monstrous contradiction to all the principles of the modern world, and to all the experience through which those principles have been slowly and painfully worked out."&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1869/subjection-women/ch04.htm|title=The Subjection of Women by John Stuart Mill|website=Marxists.org|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In 1957, James Everett, then Minister for Justice in Ireland, stated: "The progress of organised society is judged by the status occupied by married women".&lt;ref name=Oireachtas group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad1957011600008?opendocument |title= Married Women's Status Bill, 1956‚ÄîSecond Stage: Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) |website= [[Houses of the Oireachtas|Oireachtas]] |date= 16 January 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through [[marriage laws]] giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through [[marriage bar]]s.{{Refn|In France, married women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965;&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf|title=National Report: France|website=Ceflonline.net|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}}{{Refn|In [[Austria]], the marriage law was overhauled between 1975 and 1983, abolishing the restrictions on married women's right to work outside the home, providing for equality between spouses, and for joint ownership of property and assets.&lt;ref group=upper-roman&gt;''Women and Politics in Contemporary Ireland: From the Margins to the Mainstream'', by Yvonne Galligan, pp.90&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-roman}} In 1978, the [[Council of Europe]] passed the ''Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RESOLUTION   (78)  37 ON   EQUALITY   OF   SPOUSES  IN   CIVIL   LAW|url=https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|publisher=Council of Europe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121025014/https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=596422&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=662346&amp;Usage=2|archivedate=21 January 2016|date=27  September  1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]] was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a [[Voting in Switzerland|referendum]], who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/swiss-grant-women-equal-marriage-rights.html|title=SWISS GRANT WOMEN EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS|date=23 September 1985|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450|title=Switzerland Profile: Timeline|website=BBC News|date = 21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html|title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology|author=Markus G.

==== Political Gender Equality ====
Two recent movements in countries with large Kurdish populations have implemented political gender equality. One has been the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey led by the [[Democratic Regions Party]] (DBP) and the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP),&lt;!-- The apostrophe is correctly placed. The party is pro-minority, and the name is also translated as Democratic Party of the People{{uu|s}} --&gt; from 2006 or before.
The mayorships of 2 metropolitan areas and 97 towns{{citation needed|date=January 2018|reason= The citation was to [[Turkish local elections, 2014]]. See [[WP:CIRC]] and [[Talk:Gender equality#new section Political Gender Equality|Political Gender Equality]].}} are led jointly by a man and a woman, both called co-mayors. Party offices are also led by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed, which also had to be co-presided over by a man and a woman together. However, in November 2016 the Turkish government cracked down on the HDP, jailing ten of its members of Parliament, including the party's male and female co-leaders.&lt;ref name=Nordland&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/world/middleeast/turkey-kurds-womens-rights.html |title=Crackdown in Turkey Threatens a Haven of Gender Equality Built by Kurds |last=Nordland |first=Rod| date=2016-12-07|work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|Gender role}}
Gender [[stereotype]]s arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace. In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being "supportive" or "nurturing". Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Voices and Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|year=|isbn=|location=|page=450|quote="Women are expected to want to be mothers"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their male counterparts are seen as being "assertive" or "ambitious" as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geteverwise.com/human-resources/how-does-gender-bias-really-affect-women-in-the-workplace/|title=How Does Gender Bias Really Affect Women in the Workplace?|date=2016-03-24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A [[gender role]] is a set of societal [[norm (social)|norms]] dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], although there are [[Third gender|exceptions]] and [[genderqueer|variations]].

====Portrayal of women in the media====
{{Main article|Exploitation of women in mass media}}
The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The [[exploitation of women in mass media]] refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the [[mass media]], when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population's perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/474442/IPOL-FEMM_ET%282013%29474442_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=Women and Girls as Subjects of Media's Attention and Advertisement Campaigns : The Situation in Europe, Best Practices and Legislations|website=Europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women. The vast array of studies that have been conducted on the issue of the portrayal of women in the media have shown that women are often portrayed as irrational, fragile, not intelligent, submissive and
subservient to men.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"&gt;Acevedo et all. 2010. 'A Content Analysis of the Roles Portrayed by Women in Commercials: 1973 ‚Äì 2008', Revista Brasileira de Marketing Vol. 9. Universidade Nove de Julho, Sao Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that stereotyped images such as these have been shown to negatively impact on the mental health of many female viewers who feel bound by these roles, causing amongst other problems, self-esteem issues, depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Acevedo 2010"/&gt;

According to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to:  "Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women"; "Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence"; "Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave"; "Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on"; "The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls' development." Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6‚Äì8 have stated they want to be slimmer. (Striegel-Moore &amp; Franko, 2002)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|title=The Myriad: Westminster's Interactive Academic Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gretchen-kelly/the-thing-all-women-do-you-dont-know-about_b_8630416.html|title=The Thing All Women Do That You Don't Know About|author=Gretchen Kelly|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Informing women of their rights====
While in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact is that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women's rights are of recent date. This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims (explicitly or implicitly) to believe that their abuse is within their rights. This may apply to a wide range of abuses, ranging from domestic violence to employment discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/criminal-justice/bc-criminal-justice-system/if-victim/publications/hsh-english-domestic-violence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Help is available if you or someone you know is a victim of Domestic Violence|website=2.gov.bc.ca|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maternityaction.org.uk/2015/01/know-your-rights-get-your-rights/|title=Know your rights ‚Äì get your rights!|website=Maternityaction.org.uk|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/crisispreventionandrecovery/focus_areas/gender_equality_andwomensempowerment/eight_point_agendaforwomensempowermentandgenderequality.html|title=Eight Point Agenda for Women's Empowerment and Gender Equality|website=Undp.org|accessdate=14 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509195554/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/crisispreventionandrecovery/focus_areas/gender_equality_andwomensempowerment/eight_point_agendaforwomensempowermentandgenderequality.html|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender mainstreaming====
{{Main article|Gender mainstreaming}}
Gender mainstreaming is described as the [[public policy]] of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, C. and Bennett, (2002) "Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 9 (4): 430‚Äì46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/defin.htm|title=Definition of Gender Mainstreaming|website=International Labor Organization|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been developed in the [[United Nations]] development community.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010708124202/http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/00/000201-03.html II. The Origins of Gender Mainstreaming in the EU]", ''[http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/ Academy of European Law online]''&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming "involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm|title=Gender Mainstreaming|website=UN Women|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Council of Europe definition: "Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making."&lt;ref name="coe.int"/&gt;

An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is "the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/gender-heart-icpd|title=Gender at the Heart of ICPD: The UNFPA Strategic Framework on Gender Mainstreaming and Women's Empowerment |website=United Nations Population Fund|date = 2011|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "in Azerbaijan, [[UNFPA]] conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org3"/&gt;

It is an essential component of the Dzogchen tradition for both the [[Bonpo]] and the [[Nyingmapa]].{{sfn|Rossi|1999|p=52}}{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=354}} Knowledge of this ''Ground'' is called ''[[rigpa]]''.{{refn|group=note|Wylie: rig pa; [[IAST]]: vidyƒÅ){{Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=336}}}}

==Etymology==
The {{bo|t=‡ΩÇ‡Ωû‡Ω≤|w=gzhi}} has been rendered as 'Base', 'Basis', 'Ground' and 'Ground of Being' amongst other English glosses. According to [[Dudjom Rinpoche|Dudjom]] the original Sanskrit-term is ''ƒÅ≈õraya'' ([[IAST]]; Sanskrit Devanagari: ‡§Ü‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø; [[w:Etymology|Etymology]]: ‡§Ü- ‚àö‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø),{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=354 Index of Technical Terms}}{{refn|group=note|name="ƒÅ≈õraya"|According to ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2003, 2004&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://glossary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/15491/asraya Charles Muller, Tokyo Gakuen University (1997), "ƒÅ≈õraya"] accessed 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "ƒÅ≈õraya" is a synonym for ''[[ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna]]'', the "store-house-consciousness. }} but it could also be ''sthƒÅna''.

[[Sam van Schaik]] states that ''gzhi'' is to be distinguished from ''kun gzhi''. In the [[Menngagde|Seminal Heart]] series a distinction is made between ''kun gzhi'', c.q. ''ƒÅlaya'', "the base of it all", the samsaric basis of consciousness, of all the samsaric appearances; and ''gzhi'', "the nirvanic basis known as the ground."{{sfn|Schaik|2004}}{{refn|group=note|Sam van Schaik: "....the Seminal Heart distinction between two types of basis, the nirvanic basis known as the ground (gzhi) and the samsaric basis of consciousness, the ƒÅlaya (kun gzhi).{{sfn|Schaik|2004}}}}

==Three qualities==
[[File:Sam Taeguk.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Gankyil]]]]
According to the Dzogchen-teachings, the ''Ground'' or [[Buddha-nature]] has three qualities:{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Petit|1999|p=78-79}}
* ''ngo bo'', "essence", openness or emptiness ({{bo|w=ngo bo stong pa}}), 
* ''rang bzhin'', "nature", luminosity, lucidity or clarity (as in the [[luminous mind]] of the [[Five Pure Lights]]) ({{bo|w=rang bzhin gsal ba}}),
* ''thugs rje'', "power", universal [[Karu·πáƒÅ|compassionate energy]] ({{bo|w=thugs rje kun khyab}}), unobstructed ({{bo|w=ma 'gags pa}}).

(In Goodman &amp; Davidson 1992,) Herbert V. Guenther points out that this ''Ground'' is both a static potential and a dynamic unfolding. They give a [[Process philosophy|process-orientated]] translation, to avoid any essentialist associations, since
{{quote|''ngo-bo'' (facticity) has nothing to do with nor can even be reduced to the (essentialist) categories of substance and quality; [...] ''rang-bzhin'' (actuality) remains open-dimensional, rather than being or turning into a rigid essence despite its being what it is; and that ''thugs-rje'' (resonance) is an atemporal sensitivity and response, rather than a distinct and narrowly circumscribed operation.{{sfn|Goodman|Davidson|1992|p=14}}}}

The 19th/20th-century Tibetan Buddhist scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha-nature as ultimate truth,&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:
{{quote|Buddha-nature is immaculate. It is profound, serene, unfabricated suchness, an uncompounded expanse of luminosity; nonarising, unceasing, primordial peace, spontaneously present nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Prayer of Kuntuzangpo==
Beings are trapped in samsara by not recognizing the ground. The ''Prayer of Kuntuzangpo'' from the Gonpa Zangthal states:
{{quote|From the beginning you beings are deluded&lt;br /&gt;
Because you do not recognize&lt;br /&gt;
The awareness of the ground{{sfn|Ranjung Yeshe|2006|p=Chapter 9}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9368">'''The Gumshoe System''' (stylised as ''The GUMSHOE System'') is a [[role-playing game system]] created in 2007 by [[Robin Laws]], designed for running investigative scenarios. The premise is that investigative games are not about finding clues, they are about interpreting the clues that are found. The ''Gumshoe System'' is used in various games published by [[Pelgrane Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-907702-58-7|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Hillfolk kickstarter, the SRD for the ''GUMSHOE System'' has been made available for use under two open licenses: the [[Open Game License|Open Game License (OGL)]] and [[Creative Commons|Creative Commons (CC)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/the-gumshoe-system-reference-document/ The GUMSHOE System SRD]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Of the games in the line, ''[[Trail of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Trail of Cthulhu]]'' won the 2010 Lucca Games award for best role-playing game&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/452/trail-of-cthulhu RPG Geek profile of Trail of Cthulhu]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ashen Stars]]'' was a 2011 nominee for the [[Origins Award]] for best RPG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/10264/ashen-stars RPG Geek profile of Ashen Stars]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The ''Gumshoe System'' is designed around the idea that investigative scenarios are difficult to run with most role-playing systems. The problem is identified as important clues being missed due to failed dice-rolls, resulting in play grinding to a halt.

The ''Gumshoe System'' is designed to solve this by making the game not about finding clues, but about interpreting them. Attention is given to designing investigative scenarios, while at the same time the focus is put on encouraging the players to take control of the investigation (and, thereby, the story being told).

The ''Gumshoe System'' is player-centric, putting die rolling in the hands of the players whenever possible. [[Non-player character]] abilities either modify the roll made by the player, or succeeds or fails depending on what the [[game master]] finds dramatically appropriate. Direct conflict between characters, such as combat, is an exception.

==Character creation==
[[Player characters]] in the ''Gumshoe System'' are created by using '''build points''' to buy '''rating points''' in character '''abilities'''. Points are spent on a one-for-one basis.

Each player character receives a number of investigative build points depending on the number of players and the setting. In ''The Esoterrorists'' setting, two players receive 32 investigative build points each, while five or more players receive 20 build points each. Any number of investigative build points can be spent on an investigative ability, though more than 3 or 4 points is rarely useful.

Each player character receives a number of general build points depending on the setting, but regardless of number of players. In ''The Esoterrorists'' setting players receive 60 general build points each. Any number of general build points can be spent on a general ability, as long as the second highest rated ability is at least half that of the highest rated. After a scenario is completed, player characters receive new build points which can be used as either investigative or general build points. The amount acquired depends on the length of the scenario. There are no levels through which player characters progress.

==Game mechanics==
All mechanics in the ''Gumshoe System'' revolve around character [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|abilities]]. [[Attribute_(role-playing_games)|Attributes]], common to most [[role-playing games]], are not used in ''Gumshoe''. Rating points goes into a '''pool''' of points that can be used in '''spends''' related to that ability. Spent or lost points from ability pools are '''refreshed''' at various points of play.

===Investigative abilities===
The purpose of investigative abilities is to find clues that advance the story. These clues are called '''core clues'''. Investigative abilities always work; there are no dice rolls involved. If a scene contains a core clue and a player character uses an investigative ability that relates to the clue, the character will find the clue.

A spend for an investigative ability costs 1 or 2 points. A spend gives additional clues. These clues are not necessary to solve the scenario, though they should give additional information or other benefits. Spent pool points from investigative abilities are refreshed between scenarios.

Example of investigative abilities: Architecture, Cop Talk, Forensic Accounting.

===General abilities===
General abilities are used when an unknown outcome is dramatically appropriate. For these situations, the Gumshoe System utilizes a single six-sided die, which is rolled against a '''difficulty''' (or target number). This is called a '''test'''. The standard difficulty is 4, though it can be modified to anything from 2 to 8 to represent special circumstances.

As long as the die roll is equal to or higher than the difficulty, the player character has succeeded in its action.

A spend for a general ability can be as high as that ability's pool. Each point spent adds 1 to the die roll. Spent pool points from general abilities are refreshed between scenarios, though special circumstances can refresh some points during play.

Example of general abilities: Athletics, Health, Shooting.

====Health and stability====
Though Health and Stability are general abilities, they function differently. While other abilities are exhausted once they reach 0, Health and Stability can reach negative numbers. This represents serious injury or mental illness. If either ability reaches ‚àí12, the player character has died or gone permanently insane.

Use of appropriate abilities can refresh some spent or lost points in Health and Stability during play. Apart from that, Stability refreshes between scenarios, while the player character is required to rest to refresh Health.

{{Functions}}
{{Distinguish|Multiplicative inverse}}
In [[mathematics]], an '''inverse function''' (or '''anti-function'''&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that "reverses" another function: if the function {{mvar|f}} applied to an input {{mvar|x}} gives a result of {{mvar|y}}, then applying its inverse function {{mvar|g}} to {{mvar|y}} gives the result {{mvar|x}}, and vice versa, i.e., {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.&lt;ref name="Keisler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheinerman_2013"/&gt;

As an example, consider the real-valued function of a real variable given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 5''x'' ‚àí 7}}. Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number {{mvar|x}}, multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get {{mvar|x}} back from some output value, say {{mvar|y}}, we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to {{mvar|y}} and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,
:&lt;math&gt;g(y) = \frac{y + 7}{5}.&lt;/math&gt;
With {{math|1=''y'' = 5''x'' ‚àí 7}} we have that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} and {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.

Not all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function {{math|''f'': ''X'' ‚Üí ''Y''}} to have an inverse,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB1"/&gt; it must have the property that [[for every]] {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} there must be [[uniqueness quantification|one, and only one]] {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} so that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}}. This property ensures that a function {{math|''g'': ''Y'' ‚Üí ''X''}} will exist having the necessary relationship with {{mvar|f}}.

==Definitions==
[[Image:Inverse Functions Domain and Range.png|thumb|right|240px|If {{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}, then {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} maps {{mvar|Y}} back to {{mvar|X}}.]]

Let {{mvar|f}} be a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}}, and whose [[Range (mathematics)|image (range)]] is the set {{mvar|Y}}. Then {{mvar|f}} is ''invertible'' if there exists a function {{mvar|g}} with domain {{mvar|Y}} and image {{mvar|X}}, with the property:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = y\,\,\Leftrightarrow\,\,g(y) = x.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|f}} is invertible, the function {{mvar|g}} is [[unique (mathematics)|unique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101, Theorem 4.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that there is exactly one function {{mvar|g}} satisfying this property (no more, no less). That function {{mvar|g}} is then called ''the'' inverse of {{mvar|f}}, and is usually denoted as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB2"/&gt;

Stated otherwise, a function, considered as a [[binary relation]], has an inverse if and only if the [[converse relation]] is a function on the range {{mvar|Y}}, in which case the converse relation is the inverse function.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 202, Theorem 4.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all functions have an inverse. For a function to have an inverse, each element {{math|''y'' ‚àà ''Y''}} must correspond to no more than one {{math|''x'' ‚àà ''X''}}; a function {{mvar|f}} with this property is called one-to-one or an [[injective function|injection]]. If {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, then each element {{math|''y'' ‚àà ''Y''}} must correspond to some {{math|''x'' ‚àà ''X''}}. Functions with this property are called [[surjective function|surjections]]. This property is satisfied by definition if {{mvar|Y}} is the image (range) of {{mvar|f}}, but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called [[bijections]]. The inverse of an injection {{math| ''f'': ''X'' ‚Üí ''Y''}} that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a [[partial function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, which means that for some {{math|''y'' ‚àà ''Y''}}, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}} is undefined. If a function {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then both it and its inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} are bijections.

There is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the "set-theoretic" or "graph" definition using [[ordered pair]]s in which a [[codomain]] is never referred to.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p.198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this convention all functions are surjections,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB3"/&gt; and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection. Authors using this convention may use the phrasing that a function is invertible if and only if it is an injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1988|loc=p. 116 Theorem 5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two conventions need not cause confusion as long as it is remembered that in this alternate convention the codomain of a function is always taken to be the range of the function.

===Example: Squaring and square root functions===
The function {{math|''f'': ‚Ñù ‚Üí [0,‚àû)}} given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not injective since each possible result ''y'' (except 0) corresponds to two different starting points in {{mvar|X}} ‚Äì one positive and one negative, and so this function is not invertible. With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-[[Injective function|injective]] or, in some applications, information-losing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

If the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be {{math|''f'': [0, ‚àû) ‚Üí [0, ‚àû)}} with the same ''rule'' as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p.69 Example 7.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse function here is called the ''(positive) square root function''.
&lt;!-- Repetitive. To be held for a short time until refactor is finished. 
===Inverses in higher mathematics===
The definition given above is commonly adopted in [[set theory]] and [[calculus]]. In higher mathematics, the notation
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y &lt;/math&gt;
means "{{mvar|f}} is a function mapping elements of a set {{mvar|X}} to elements of a set {{mvar|Y‚Äâ}}".  The source, {{mvar|X}}, is called the domain of {{mvar|f}}, and the target, {{mvar|Y}}, is called the [[codomain]].  The codomain contains the range of {{mvar|f}} as a [[subset]], and is part of the definition of {{mvar|f}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using codomains, the inverse of a function {{math| ''f'': ''X'' ‚Üí ''Y''}} is required to have domain {{mvar|Y}} and codomain {{mvar|X}}.  For the inverse to be defined on all of {{mvar|Y}}, every element of {{mvar|Y}} must lie in the range of the function {{mvar|f}}.  A function with this property is called ''onto'' or ''[[Surjective function|surjective]]''.  Thus, a function with a codomain is invertible if and only if it is both ''[[Injective function|injective]]'' (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).  Such a function is called a one-to-one correspondence or a [[bijection]], and has the property that every element {{math| ''y'' ‚àà ''Y''}} corresponds to exactly one element {{math| ''x'' ‚àà ''X''}}.
--&gt;

==={{anchor|Compositional inverse}}Inverses and composition===
{{See also|Inverse element}}

If {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1}\left( \, f(x) \, \right) = x&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[composition of functions]] we can rewrite this statement as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1} \circ f = \operatorname{id}_X, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[identity function]] on the set {{mvar|X}}; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In [[category theory]], this statement is used as the definition of an inverse [[morphism]].

Considering function composition helps to understand the notation {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Repeatedly composing a function with itself is called [[iterated function|iteration]]. If {{mvar|f}} is applied {{mvar|n}} times, starting with the value {{mvar|x}}, then this is written as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}; so {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''f'' (''x''))}}, etc. Since {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' (''x'')) {{=}} ''x''}}, composing {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} yields {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ''n''‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, "undoing" the effect of one application of {{mvar|f}}.

===Note on notation===

While the notation {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} might be misunderstood, {{math|(''f''(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} certainly denotes the [[multiplicative inverse]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and has nothing to do with the inverse function of {{mvar|f}}.

In keeping with the general notation, some English&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; authors use expressions like {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} to denote the inverse of the sine function applied to {{mvar|x}} (actually a [[#Partial inverses|partial inverse]]; see below)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1972|loc=pp. 304-309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors feel that this may be confused with the notation for the multiplicative inverse of {{math|sin‚Ää(''x'')}}, which can be denoted as {{math|(sin‚Ää(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. To avoid any confusion, an [[inverse trigonometric function]] is often indicated by the prefix "[[arc (function prefix)|arc]]" (for Latin ''arcus'').&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the [[arcsine]] function, written as {{math|[[arcsin]](''x'')}}.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; Similarly, the inverse of a [[hyperbolic function]] is indicated by the prefix "[[ar (function prefix)|ar]]" (for Latin ''area'').&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; For instance, the inverse of the [[hyperbolic sine]] function is typically written as {{math|[[arsinh]](''x'')}}.&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; Other inverse special functions are sometimes prefixed with the prefix "inv" if the ambiguity of the {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} notation should be avoided.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt;

==Properties==
Since a function is a special type of [[binary relation]], many of the properties of an inverse function correspond to properties of [[converse relation]]s.

===Uniqueness===
If an inverse function exists for a given function {{mvar|f}}, then it is unique.&lt;ref name="Wolf72"&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p. 208 Theorem 7.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows since the inverse function must be the converse relation which is completely determined by {{mvar|f}}.

===Symmetry===
There is a symmetry between a function and its inverse. Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then its inverse {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} has domain {{mvar|Y}} and range {{mvar|X}}, and the inverse of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the original function {{mvar|f}}. In symbols, for functions {{math|''f'':''X'' ‚Üí ''Y''}}  and {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;:''Y'' ‚Üí ''X''}},&lt;ref name=Wolf72 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\circ f = \operatorname{id}_X &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f \circ f^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_Y.&lt;/math&gt;

This statement is a consequence of the implication that for {{mvar|f}} to be invertible it must be bijective. The [[involution (mathematics)|involutory]] nature of the inverse can be concisely expressed by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=pg. 141 Theorem 3.3(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(f^{-1}\right)^{-1} = f.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Composition of Inverses.png|thumb|right|240px|The inverse of {{math| ''g''‚Äâ‚àò‚Äâ''f'' }} is {{math| ''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àò‚Äâ''g''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.]]
The inverse of a composition of functions is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p. 71 Theorem 7.26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the order of {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|f}} have been reversed; to undo {{mvar|f}} followed by {{mvar|g}}, we must first undo {{mvar|g}} and then undo {{mvar|f}}.

For example, let {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = 3''x''}} and let {{math|1= ''g''(''x'') = ''x'' + 5}}.  Then the composition {{math| ''g''‚Äâ‚àò‚Äâ''f''}} is the function that first multiplies by three and then adds five,
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = 3x + 5.&lt;/math&gt;
To reverse this process, we must first subtract five, and then divide by three,
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)^{-1}(x) = \tfrac13(x - 5).&lt;/math&gt;
This is the composition
{{math| (''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àò‚Äâ''g''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;)(''x'')}}.

===Self-inverses===
If {{mvar|X}} is a set, then the [[identity function]] on {{mvar|X}} is its own inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{id}_X}^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_X.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a function {{math| ''f'' : ''X'' ‚Üí ''X''}} is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition {{math| ''f''‚Äâ‚àò‚Äâ''f''}} is equal to {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Such a function is called an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].

==Inverses in calculus==
Single-variable [[calculus]] is primarily concerned with functions that map [[real number]]s to real numbers. Such functions are often defined through [[formula]]s, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 .&lt;/math&gt;
A surjective function {{mvar|f}} from the real numbers to the real numbers possesses an inverse as long as it is one-to-one, i.e. as long as the graph of {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} has, for each possible {{mvar|y}} value only one corresponding {{mvar|x}} value, and thus passes the [[horizontal line test]].

The following table shows several standard functions and their inverses:

===Formula for the inverse===
One approach to finding a formula for {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, if it exists, is to solve the [[equation]] {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') }} for {{mvar|x}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 &lt;/math&gt;

then we must solve the equation {{math|1= ''y'' = (2''x'' + 8)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{mvar|x}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      y         &amp; = (2x+8)^3 \\
  \sqrt[3]{y}   &amp; = 2x + 8   \\
\sqrt[3]{y} - 8 &amp; = 2x       \\
\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{y} - 8}{2} &amp; = x .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \frac{\sqrt[3]{y} - 8} 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes the inverse of a function cannot be expressed by a formula with a finite number of terms.  For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x - \sin x ,&lt;/math&gt;

then {{mvar|f}} is a bijection, and therefore possesses an inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The [[Kepler's equation#Inverse Kepler equation|formula for this inverse]] has an infinite number of terms:

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(y) =
\sum_{n=1}^\infty
 \frac{y^{n/3}}{n!} \lim_{ \theta \to 0} \left(
 \frac{\mathrm{d}^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm{d} \theta^{\,n-1}} \left(
 \frac \theta { \sqrt[3]{ \theta - \sin( \theta )} } \right)^n
\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Graph of the inverse===
[[Image:Inverse Function Graph.png|thumb|right|The graphs of {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') }} and {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}. The dotted line is {{math|1= ''y'' = ''x''}}.]]
If  {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then the graph of the function

:&lt;math&gt;y = f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

is the same as the graph of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x = f(y) .&lt;/math&gt;

This is identical to the equation {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} that defines the graph of {{mvar|f}}, except that the roles of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} have been reversed.  Thus the graph of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be obtained from the graph of {{mvar|f}} by switching the positions of the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} axes.  This is equivalent to [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflecting]] the graph across the line
{{math|1= ''y'' = ''x''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2011|loc=pp. 28-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inverses and derivatives===
A [[continuous function]] {{mvar|f}} is invertible on its range (image) if and only if it is either strictly [[monotonic function|increasing or decreasing]] (with no local [[maxima and minima|maxima or minima]]).  For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3 + x&lt;/math&gt;

is invertible, since the [[derivative]]
{{math|1= ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') = 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 }} is always positive.

If the function {{mvar|f}} is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on an interval {{mvar|I}} and {{math| ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') ‚â† 0}} for each {{math|''x'' ‚àà ''I''}}, then the inverse {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} will be differentiable on {{math|''f''(''I'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p. 246 Theorem 26.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}, the derivative of the inverse is given by the [[inverse function theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\left(f^{-1}\right)^\prime (y)  = \frac{1}{f'\left(x \right)}. &lt;/math&gt;
Using [[Leibniz's notation]] the formula above can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{dy / dx}. &lt;/math&gt;
This result follows from the [[chain rule]] (see the article on [[inverse functions and differentiation]]).

The inverse function theorem can be generalized to functions of several variables.  Specifically, a differentiable [[real multivariable function|multivariable function]] {{math| ''f '': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Üí '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is invertible in a neighborhood of a point {{mvar|p}} as long as the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}} is [[invertible matrix|invertible]].  In this case, the Jacobian of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} at {{math|''f''(''p'')}} is the [[matrix inverse]] of the Jacobian of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}}.

== Real-world examples ==
* Let {{mvar|f}} be the function that converts a temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] to a temperature in degrees [[Fahrenheit]],
::&lt;math&gt; F = f(C) = \tfrac95 C + 32 ;&lt;/math&gt;
:then its inverse function converts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius,
::&lt;math&gt; C = f^{-1}(F) = \tfrac59 (F - 32) ,&lt;/math&gt;
:since
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f^{-1} (f(C)) = {} &amp; f^{-1}\left(  \tfrac95 C + 32 \right) = \tfrac59 \left( (\tfrac95 C + 32 ) - 32 \right) =  C, \\
&amp; \text{for every value of } C, \text{ and } \\[6pt]
f\left(f^{-1}(F)\right) = {} &amp; f\left(\tfrac59 (F - 32)\right) = \tfrac95 \left(\tfrac59 (F - 32)\right) + 32 = F, \\
&amp; \text{for every value of } F.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Suppose {{mvar|f}} assigns each child in a family its birth year. An inverse function would output which child was born in a given year. However, if the family children born in the same year (for instance, twins or triplets, etc.) then the output cannot be known when the input is the common birth year. As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function. For example,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(\text{Allan})&amp;=2005 , \quad &amp; f(\text{Brad})&amp;=2007 , \quad &amp; f(\text{Cary})&amp;=2001 \\
 f^{-1}(2005)&amp;=\text{Allan} , \quad &amp; f^{-1}(2007)&amp;=\text{Brad} , \quad &amp; f^{-1}(2001)&amp;=\text{Cary}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Let {{mvar|R}} be the function that leads to an {{mvar|x}} percentage rise of some quantity, and {{mvar|F}} be the function producing an {{mvar|x}} percentage fall. Applied to $100 with {{mvar|x}} = 10%, we find that applying the first function followed by the second does not restore the original value of $100, demonstrating the fact that, despite appearances, these two functions are not inverses of each other.

==Generalizations==

===Partial inverses===
[[Image:Inverse square graph.svg|thumb|right|The square root of {{mvar|x}} is a partial inverse to {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.]]
Even if a function {{mvar|f}} is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a '''partial inverse''' of {{mvar|f}} by [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restricting]] the domain.  For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is not one-to-one, since {{math|1= ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (‚àí''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' ‚â• 0}}, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{y} . &lt;/math&gt;

(If we instead restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' ‚â§ 0}}, then the inverse is the negative of the square root of {{mvar|y}}.)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a [[multivalued function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \pm\sqrt{y} . &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Inversa d'una c√∫bica gr√†fica.png|right|thumb|The inverse of this [[cubic function]] has three branches.]]
Sometimes this multivalued inverse is called the '''full inverse''' of {{mvar|f}}, and the portions (such as {{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}} and ‚àí{{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}}) are called ''branches''.  The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the ''[[principal branch]]'', and its value at {{mvar|y}} is called the ''principal value'' of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}}.

For a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of [[minima and maxima|local extrema]].  For example, the inverse of a [[cubic function]] with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).

[[Image:Gr√†fica del arcsinus.png|right|thumb|The [[arcsine]] is a partial inverse of the [[sine]] function.]]
These considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of [[trigonometric functions]].  For example, the [[sine function]] is not one-to-one, since

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for every real {{mvar|x}} (and more generally {{math|1= sin(''x'' + 2{{pi}}''n'') = sin(''x'')}} for every [[integer]] {{mvar|n}}).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval
{{closed-closed|‚àí{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}},‚Äâ{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the [[arcsine]].  This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between ‚àí{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.  The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2011|loc=pp. 39-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left and right inverses===
If {{math|''f'': ''X'' ‚Üí ''Y''}}, a '''left inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[retract (category theory)|retraction]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''g'': ''Y'' ‚Üí ''X''}} such that

: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = \operatorname{id}_X . &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the function {{mvar|g}} satisfies the rule

: &lt;math&gt;\text{If } f(x) = y, \text{ then } g(y) = x .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, {{mvar|g}} must equal the inverse of {{mvar|f}} on the image of {{mvar|f}}, but may take any values for elements of {{mvar|Y}} not in the image. A function {{mvar|f}} with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function {{mvar|f}} with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in [[constructive mathematics]]. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion {{math|{0,1} ‚Üí '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals violates [[indecomposability]] by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {{math|{0,1}‚Ää}}.

A '''right inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[section (category theory)|section]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''h'': ''Y'' ‚Üí ''X''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;f \circ h = \operatorname{id}_Y . &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the function {{mvar|h}} satisfies the rule

:If &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(y) = x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x) = y .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, {{math|''h''(''y'')}} may be any of the elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}} under {{mvar|f}}.  A function {{mvar|f}} has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the [[axiom of choice]]).

An inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if {{mvar|g}} is a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} may or may not be a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}; and if {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} is not necessarily a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}. For example, let {{math|''f'': '''R''' &amp;rarr; {{closed-open|0,‚Äâ‚àû}}}} denote the squaring map, such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let  {{math|{{mvar|g}}: {{closed-open|0,‚Äâ‚àû}} &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} denote the square root map, such that {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} }}{{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} for all {{math|''x'' ‚â• 0}}. Then {{math|1=''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''x''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{closed-open|0,‚Äâ‚àû}}; that is, {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse to {{mvar|f}}. However, {{mvar|g}} is not a left inverse to {{mvar|f}}, since, e.g., {{math|1=''g''(''f''(‚àí1)) = 1 ‚â† ‚àí1}}.

===Preimages===
If {{math|''f'': ''X'' ‚Üí ''Y''}} is any function (not necessarily invertible), the '''preimage''' (or '''inverse image''') of an element {{math| ''y'' &amp;isin; ''Y''}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}}:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{y\}) = \left\{ x\in X : f(x) = y \right\} . &lt;/math&gt;

The preimage of {{mvar|y}} can be thought of as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{mvar|y}} under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function {{mvar|f}}.

Similarly, if {{mvar|S}} is any [[subset]] of {{mvar|Y}}, the preimage of {{mvar|S}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|S}}:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(S) = \left\{ x\in X : f(x) \in S \right\} . &lt;/math&gt;

For example, take a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' ‚Üí '''R'''}}, where {{math|''f'': ''x'' ‚Ü¶ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This function is not invertible for reasons discussed [[#Example: squaring and square root functions|above]]. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\left\{1,4,9,16\right\}) = \left\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The preimage of a single element {{math| ''y'' &amp;isin; ''Y''}} ‚Äì a [[singleton set]] {{math|{''y''}‚Ää}} ‚Äì is sometimes called the ''[[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]'' of {{mvar|y}}.  When {{mvar|Y}} is the set of real numbers, it is common to refer to {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;‚Äâ‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;({''y''})}} as a ''[[level set]]''.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB1"&gt;It is a common practice, when no ambiguity can arise, to leave off the term function and just refer to an inverse.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB2"&gt;Not to be confused with numerical exponentiation such as taking the multiplicative inverse of a nonzero real number.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB3"&gt;So this term is never used in this convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4018">The Jones model is a growth model developed in 1995 by economist [[Charles I. Jones]].

The model is essentially identical to the [[Romer model]] (1990), in particular it generalizes or modifies the description of how new technologies, ideas or design instructions arise. This should take into account the criticism made of the Romer model that the long-term growth rate depends positively on the size of the population ([[economies of scale]]). This is problematic in several respects: on the one hand larger countries do not necessarily grow faster. On the other hand, an increasing population or intensified research work did not increase the growth rate on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Charles I. Jones]]|title= R&amp;D-based models of economic growth|journal= [[Journal of Political Economy]]|year= 1995|volume=103|issue=4|pages= 759-784|doi= 10.1086/262002|jstor= 2138581|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the extent of influence from the current state of knowledge on new inventions (standing on shoulders effect).

==Model Structure==
For a single company {\ displaystyle i} i According to the following modeling applies to the emergence of new ideas or design instructions:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot A_i = \delta \cdot A(t)^\phi \cdot L_A(t)^{\lambda-1} \cdot L_{A_i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

With

:&lt;math&gt;L_{A}&lt;/math&gt;:: Number of employees in the research sector

:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;: Technology level

:&lt;math&gt;\dot A&lt;/math&gt; refers to the derivation of the variables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; A after the time, so &lt;math&gt;\dot A= \frac{\partial A(t)}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; 

where the parameters take the following values: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \lambda &lt; 1; \phi &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, For parameter values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \phi = 1&lt;/math&gt; results in the Romer model (&lt;math&gt;\dot A = \delta \cdot A \cdot L_A&lt;/math&gt;). After aggregation across all companies results:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot A = \delta \cdot A(t)^\phi \cdot L_A(t)^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here the parameters have the following meaning:

* &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; lambda restricts the effect of additional labor input in the research sector. Although more researchers are producing more ideas , each researcher is contributing less and less. This relationship is also called standing-on-shoes effect (step on your feet, see also yield law ). This parameter reflects a possible negative externality of the duplication. For a single company, however, this problem does not exist because within a research department, all researchers know about the work of their colleagues.
* &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;: A negative value aims at giving only finitely many potential new ideas for a given time. This case is also referred to as a fishing-out effect: over time, the relatively "simple" inventions are made first; Today, it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop a new drug.
* &lt;math&gt;\phi = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: Here, productivity in the research sector would be independent of existing knowledge. For example, a physicist should be able to develop the same new ideas, whether he lives today or 100 years ago (an unrealistic case).
* &lt;math&gt;\phi &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;: Describes in principle a positive externality and the case encountered in reality. The current state of the art is to a certain extent involved in research. The standing-on-shoulders effect is only weakened compared to the Romer model.

==Growth rate==
In the Jones model, growth in steady state is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\dot{\hat{A(t)}}}{\hat{A(t)}} = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \hat{A(t)} = \frac{\lambda \cdot n}{1 - \phi}&lt;/math&gt; n for the growth rate of persons working in the research sector.

In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], '''negentropy''' is used as a measure of distance to normality.  The concept and phrase "negative entropy" was introduced by [[Erwin Schr√∂dinger]] in his 1944 popular-science book ''[[What is Life? (Schr√∂dinger)|What is Life?]]''&lt;ref&gt;Schr√∂dinger, Erwin, ''What is Life ‚Äì the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell'', Cambridge University Press, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[L√©on Brillouin]] shortened the phrase to ''negentropy'',&lt;ref&gt;Brillouin, Leon: (1953) "Negentropy Principle of Information", ''J. of Applied Physics'', v. '''24(9)''', pp. 1152‚Äì1163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L√©on Brillouin, ''La science et la th√©orie de l'information'', Masson, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; to express it in a more "positive" way: a living system imports negentropy and stores it.&lt;ref&gt;Mae-Wan Ho, [http://www.i-sis.org.uk/negentr.php What is (Schr√∂dinger's) Negentropy?], Bioelectrodynamics Laboratory, Open university Walton Hall, Milton Keynes&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi]] proposed replacing the term ''negentropy'' with ''syntropy''. That term may have originated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Fantappi√®]], who tried to construct a unified theory of [[biology]] and [[physics]]. [[Buckminster Fuller]] tried to popularize this usage, but ''negentropy'' remains common.

In a note to ''[[What is Life?]]'' Schr√∂dinger explained his use of this phrase.
{{cquote|[...] if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}

In 2009, Mahulikar &amp; Herwig redefined negentropy of a dynamically ordered sub-system as the specific entropy deficit of the ordered sub-system relative to its surrounding chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Mahulikar, S.P. &amp; Herwig, H.: (2009) "Exact thermodynamic principles for dynamic order existence and evolution in chaos", ''Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals'', v. '''41(4)''', pp. 1939‚Äì1948&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negentropy has SI units of (J kg&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit mass, and (K&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit energy. This definition enabled: ''i'') scale-invariant thermodynamic representation of dynamic order existence, ''ii'') formulation of physical principles exclusively for dynamic order existence and evolution, and ''iii'') mathematical interpretation of Schr√∂dinger's negentropy debt.

==Information theory==
In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], negentropy is used as a measure of distance to normality.&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyv√§rinen, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/NCS99web/node32.html Survey on Independent Component Analysis, node32: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyv√§rinen and Erkki Oja, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/IJCNN99_tutorialweb/node14.html Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial, node14: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruye Wang, [http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/ica/node4.html Independent Component Analysis, node4: Measures of Non-Gaussianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] with a given mean and variance, the normal or [[Gaussian distribution]] is the one with the highest entropy. Negentropy measures the difference in entropy between a given distribution and the Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance. Thus, negentropy is always nonnegative, is invariant by any linear invertible change of coordinates, and vanishes [[if and only if]] the signal is Gaussian.

Negentropy is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;J(p_x) = S(\varphi_x) - S(p_x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(\varphi_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[differential entropy]] of the Gaussian density with the same [[mean]] and [[variance]] as &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S(p_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the differential entropy of &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;S(p_x) = - \int p_x(u) \log p_x(u) \, du&lt;/math&gt;

Negentropy is used in [[statistics]] and [[signal processing]]. It is related to network [[Information entropy|entropy]], which is used in [[independent component analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Comon, Independent Component Analysis ‚Äì a new concept?, ''Signal Processing'', '''36''' 287‚Äì314, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Didier G.

==Correlation between statistical negentropy and Gibbs' free energy==
[[File:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|275px|thumb|right|[[Willard Gibbs]]‚Äô 1873 '''available energy''' ([[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]) graph, which shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of ''v'' ([[volume]]) and passing through point A, which represents the initial state of the body. MN is the section of the surface of [[dissipated energy]]. QŒµ and QŒ∑ are sections of the planes ''Œ∑'' = 0 and ''Œµ'' = 0, and therefore parallel to the axes of Œµ ([[internal energy]]) and Œ∑ ([[entropy]]) respectively. AD and AE are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state, AB and AC its ''available energy'' ([[Gibbs energy]]) and its ''capacity for entropy'' (the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume) respectively.]]
There is a physical quantity closely linked to [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] ([[free enthalpy]]), with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]] created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to [[free enthalpy]]. On the diagram one can see the quantity called [[capacity for entropy]]. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume.&lt;ref&gt;Willard Gibbs, [http://www.ufn.ru/ufn39/ufn39_4/Russian/r394b.pdf A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces], ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy'', 382‚Äì404 (1873)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by [[Fran√ßois Jacques Dominique Massieu|Massieu]] for the [[isothermal process]]&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869a). Sur les fonctions caract√©ristiques des divers fluides. ''C. R. Acad. Sci.'' LXIX:858‚Äì862.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869b). Addition au precedent memoire sur les fonctions caract√©ristiques. ''C. R. Acad. Sci.'' LXIX:1057‚Äì1061.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869), ''Compt. Rend.'' '''69''' (858): 1057.&lt;/ref&gt; (both quantities differs just with a figure sign) and then [[Max Planck|Planck]] for the [[Isothermal process|isothermal]]-[[Isobaric process|isobaric]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1945). ''Treatise on Thermodynamics''. Dover, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the Massieu‚ÄìPlanck [[thermodynamic potential]], known also as ''[[free entropy]]'', has been shown to play a great role in the so-called entropic formulation of [[statistical mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;Antoni Planes, Eduard Vives, [http://www.ecm.ub.es/condensed/eduard/papers/massieu/node2.html Entropic Formulation of Statistical Mechanics], Entropic variables and Massieu‚ÄìPlanck functions 2000-10-24 Universitat de Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; applied among the others in molecular biology&lt;ref&gt;John A.

==Brillouin's negentropy principle of information==
In 1953, [[L√©on Brillouin]] derived a general equation&lt;ref&gt;Leon Brillouin, The negentropy principle of information, ''J. Applied Physics'' '''24''', 1152‚Äì1163 1953&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the changing of an information bit value requires at least kT ln(2) energy. This is the same energy as the work [[Le√≥ Szil√°rd]]'s engine produces in the idealistic case. In his book,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Brillouin, ''Science and Information theory'', Dover, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; he further explored this problem concluding that any cause of this bit value change (measurement, decision about a yes/no question, erasure, display, etc.) will require the same amount of energy.

'''New Yorkers For Children''' (NYFC) was founded in 1996 by [[Nicholas Scoppetta]] in [[Manhattan, New York]] as a not for profit organization helping people who have aged out of the foster care system. The organization focuses on the academic success of  foster children. NYFC's goal is to help all youth in the foster care system succeed academically and with equal opportunity in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=February 12, 2018 | url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org | title=Our Mission | website=newyorkersforchildren.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their partner [[Administration for Children's Services]] (ACS), NYFC is able to provide school supplies, access to academic counselling, job opportunities, access to schools, as well as financial support to keep them in school.

Since its founding New Yorkers For Children has raised and donated over $55 million to its programs, scholarships, and its partnership with ACS.

== Background ==
Nicholas Scoppetta founded NYFC after he was recruited by New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to run the newly formed children service agency. Scopetta was credited for facilitating the re-formulation of the system which resulted in improved training, management, pay, and accountability. He was also successful in getting more children adopted out of the system, reducing case loads, as well as hiring more employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/nyregion/nicholas-scoppetta-foster-child-who-became-a-versatile-public-servant-dies-at-83.html|title=Nicholas Scoppetta, Former Foster Child Who Led Child Welfare Agency, Dies at 83|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=March 24, 2016|work=New York Times|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these achievements Scoppetta formed NYFC and was the President of Board of Directors until his retirement in 2013 where he was replaced by Eric Brettschneider. Brettschneider started working in the child welfare and social services in 1967 and has worked in various specializations of that sector ever since. With his experience he has pledged to  "continue the tradition Nick (Scoppetta) established - empowering the child welfare community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T004&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA333316881&amp;docType=Article&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA333316881&amp;searchId=R4&amp;userGroupName=crepuq_bishop&amp;inPS=true|title=New Yorkers For Children Appoints Eric Brettschneider Next President Of The Board Of Directors|last=|first=|date=June 10, 2013|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects==
* '''Back to School Package Program'''
The program aims at supplying people from the foster system with supplies necessary for their successful completion of a bachelor's degree. The package, valued at $1000, comes with a metro pass, laptop, and Amazon gift card intended to help the student purchase more supplies and eliminate some of their disadvantages. NYFC has provided 8,000 packages to 2,500 students in foster care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to School Packages|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/campaigns/give-education-to-children/|website=www.newyorkersforchildren.org|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Nicholas Scopetta Scholarship Program'''
This program provides financial, emotional, and academic support to students to ensure their successful completion of an academic career. Working together with the "private sector, foster care agencies, CUNY (City University of New York, the system of universities in New York) and Private Colleges in New York City" the NYFC has been able to provide a support system for the students in or leaving foster care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicholas Scopetta Scholarship|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/campaigns/nicholas-scoppetta-scholarship-program-formerly-nyfc-guardian-scholars-program/|website=New Yorkers For Children|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund'''
This Emergency Fund goes to people leaving the foster care system and financially supports them to be able to complete their educations without having to worry about their financial situations too much. Since these students leave the care of the foster system without the traditional support from families they often live pay cheque to pay cheque. Once a financial emergency hits, the students are forced to decide between their education and finding a job to raise funds for their basic needs. The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund provides students with financial support to ensure they continue their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/campaigns/10086/|website=New Yorkers For Children|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Spirit Award'''
The Spirit Award is given to a student from the foster care system that is succeeding in college as well as demonstrating leadership, commitment to the community, determination, and has shown the ability to overcome barriers. In 2016 the award was given to two students in full ($10,000) and second place prizes were awarded to two students of the value of $2,500.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/New-Yorkers-For-Children-Inc_2016-FS_FINAL.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children, Inc. - Financial Report|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2016|website=Newyorkerforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wrap to Rap'''

The Wrap to Rap is a holiday event where board members, friends of the NYFC, and teens of the community join together to wrap Christmas presents. The gifts go to children in foster care. The event serves as a community event to support the organizations efforts while allowing teens the opportunity to learn of the struggles of others and simultaneously getting them involved in volunteering for the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''The Youth Advisory Board (YAB)'''
The Youth Advisory Board is in charge of promoting social change in regards to changing how the social system supports foster children once they are too old for foster care. Their social policy efforts fight mainly for affordable housing, post secondary opportunities, and funding for college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Funding ==
New Yorkers For Children makes most of its revenues from foundation and business organizations contributions. In 2016 alone the organization made $3.2 million in foundation and business organizations contributions. NYFC's special events bring in the second largest amount of revenue. From 2012 to 2016 NYFC's events brought in on average $2.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/New-Yorkers-For-Children-Inc_2016-FS_FINAL.pdf|title=Annual Report 2016|website=New Yorker For Children|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2015-Audited-Financial-Statements.pdf|title=New Yorker For Children Annual Report 2015|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2015|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/financial-statements.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children Annual Report 2014|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2014|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Financial-Statements.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children Annual Report 2012 &amp; 2013|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2013|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each event honours a few of the children receiving aid from the foundation and supplies them with proper clothing attire for the night. The events are also each sponsored by a big brand or corporation, for example [[Chlo√©]] and by [[Circa]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/new-yorkers-for-children-fall-gala|title=Everyone Wins|last=Vanessa|first=Lawrence|date=September 17, 2015|website=WMagazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gotham-magazine.com/2010-new-yorkers-for-children-fall-gala-presented-by-circa|title=2010 New Yorkers For Children Fall Gala Presented by Circa|last=|first=|date=October 29, 2010|website=Gotham Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the Spring Dinner Dance was presented by [[Saks Fifth Avenue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/events-page/2015-spring-dinner-dance-fools-fete/|title=2015 Spring Dinner Dance Presented by Saks Fifth Avenue|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newyorkerforchildren.org|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fool's Fete of 2012 was sponsored by CD Greene. Each of these big named sponsors bring in different crowds of people to the events and increases and diversifies the organizations base of donors.
* '''The New Yorkers For Children Annual Fall Gala'''
Held every year in the fall, NYFC's New Yorker For Children Annual Fall Gala at Cipriani 42nd Street consistently raises over $1.2 million. With tickets starting at $1,200 and tables being sold for up to $50,000, the evening is always a success for the organization. The event is attended by actors, designers, athletes, journalists, artists, wealthy business entrepreneurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA463958528&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Kelly happy with 'Children'|last=|first=|date=September 17, 2016|work=New York Post|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and singers all willing to spend big money for charity. The Gala is meant to raise money as well as acknowledge people for their own charitable efforts. It also receives media coverage from well known news outlets like Vogue, InStyle, and New Getty.
* '''New Yorkers For Children Spring Dinner Dance'''
In 2015 the event held at the Mandarin Oriental raised $750,000 with tickets selling out before they are made open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/events-page/2016-spring-dinner-dance/|title=2016 Spring Dinner Dance|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newyorkersforchildren.org|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the event was publicized not only for its philanthropic work but also because it honoured the fashion legend [[Oscar de la Renta]] giving the event an edge in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;id=GALE%7CA410561283&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1|title=Oscar dresses glam gala|last=|first=|date=April 19, 2015|work=New York Post|access-date=February 21, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More attention is brought to the event due to the attendance of well known people like actress [[Emma Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA365668823&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Springtime for stars &amp; kids|last=|first=|date=April 23, 2014|work=New York Post|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as royalty of a Saudi Prince&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA325862252&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Don't take my number|last=|first=|date=April 11, 2013|work=New York Post|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013. Although the event does not raise as much money as the Annual Fall Gala, the publicity that the organization gets largely affects its donations.

== Public Support ==
New Yorkers For Children receives a lot of supports from public figures, actors, artists, singers, athletes, etc. In 2009 [[Anderson Cooper]], anchor for CNN, hosted the annual fall gala. This night included awarding [[Mary J. Blige]] the Nicholas Scoppetta Child Welfare Award for her own organization FFAWN which empowers and supports women to go to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=February 20, 2018 | url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;id=GALE%7CA208580480&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1 | title=School Ties | date=September 24, 2009 | website=wwd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past honourees include Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]], [[Geoffrey Canada]], [[Russell Simmons]], and All-Pro Linebacker for the New York Giants, [[Keith Bulluck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;id=GALE%7CA235267638&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1|title=New York Giants' Keith Bulluck to be Honored at the New Yorkers For Children 2010 Fall Gala Benefiting Youth in Foster Care in New York City|last=|first=|date=August 24, 2010|work=PR Newswire|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list of honourees shows the diverse background of people that participate in charitable functions.

Furthermore, the annual fall gala also included [[Ne-Yo]] performing his hit songs and Oscar-nominated director [[Tony Gilroy]] premiered his short film about eight youth in foster care. 19 youth who receive aid from NYFC were guests of honour. [[Macy's]] provided them with clothing while [[MAC Cosmetics]] and French hairstylist [[Fr√©d√©ric Fekkai|Frederic Fekkai]] provided hair and makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/events-page/tenth-annual-fall-gala/|title=Tenth Annual Fall Gala|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newyorkersforchildren.org|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Hugh Jackman]] co-chaired the event with his wife [[Deborra-lee Furness|Deborra-Lee Furness]]. Jackman expressed his appreciation and support for New Yorkers For Children: "I love what New Yorkers for Children does. It's at a grass-roots level, it doesn't throw money here and there, it really looks after kids with what they need emotionally as well as financially."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com.ubishops.ca:2048/ic/bic1/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;catId=&amp;u=crepuq_bishop&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA343331226&amp;activityType=BasicSearch&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Power crowd for kids|last=|first=|date=September 19, 2013|work=New York Post|access-date=February 21, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work With Administration for Children Services ==
New Yorkers For Children is partnered with the government organization Administration for Children Services (ACS). NYFC supports the organization's projects financially. In 2016 the NYFC donated $100,000 in grants to fund the Community Connections Project, The Door Project, and ACS Special Programs and Events. The Community Connections Project is a detention release initiative that works to support low risk individuals that are being removed from detention and rehabilitated in their homes with their families. The Door project works to offer homeless people and "system-involved" young people better access to post-secondary opportunities. This initiative is community based and supported by education services, and external partnerships. ACS Special Programs and Events promotes child wellbeing projects specifically Safe Sleep Symposium and Child Abuse Awareness month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkersforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/New-Yorkers-For-Children-Inc_2016-FS_FINAL.pdf|title=New Yorkers For Children Inc. 2016 Financial Report - Pilot and innovative programs|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2016|website=newyorkersforchildren.com|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1398">'''Personality pathology''' refers to enduring patterns of cognition, emotion, and behavior that negatively affect a person's adaptation. In [[psychiatry]] and [[clinical psychology]], it is characterized by adaptive inflexibility, vicious cycles of maladaptive behavior, and emotional instability under stress. In the United States and elsewhere, [[personality disorders]] are diagnosed categorically on [[Axis II (psychology)|Axis II]] of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

'''''Plasmodium ovale curtisi''''' is a subspecies of [[parasite|parasitic]] [[protozoa]] that causes tertian [[malaria]] in humans. It was described in 2010 when it was realised that ''[[Plasmodium ovale]]'' was in fact two distinct species - ''Plasmodium ovale curtisi'' and ''[[Plasmodium ovale wallikeri]]'' - which are morphologically identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/652240|title=Two nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human malaria parasite ''Plasmodium ovale'' occur globally|vauthors=Sutherland CJ, Tanomsing N, Nolder D, Oguike M, Jennison C, Pukrittayakamee S, Dolecek C, Hien TT, do Ros√°rio VE, Arez AP, Pinto J, Michon P, Escalante AA, Nosten F, Burke M, Lee R, Blaze M, Otto TD, Barnwell JW, Pain A, Williams J, White NJ, Day NP, Snounou G, Lockhart PJ, Chiodini PL, Imwong M, Polley SD |journal=J Infect Dis|year=2010|volume=201|issue=10|pages=1544&amp;ndash;50|pmid=20380562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Both P. ovale subspecies have been identified in [[Ghana]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nigeria]], [[S√£o Tom√©]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Uganda]].

==Clinical features==

Since this species has only recently been identified clinical features are described in the page on ''[[Plasmodium ovale]]''.

==Phylogenetics==

This species separated from its closest known relative - ''Plasmodium ovale wallikeri'' - between 1.0 and 3.5 million years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">A '''religious reform''' (from Latin ''re'': back, again, and ''formare'': to form; i.e. put together: ''to restore, reconstruct, or rebuild'') aims at the reform of religious teachings. It is not to be confused with an organizational reform of a religious community, though mostly this is a consequence of a reform of religious teachings.

== Definition ==

Religious reforms are performed when a religious community reaches the conclusion that it deviated from its - assumed - true faith. Mostly religious reforms are started by parts of a religious community and meet resistance in other parts of the same religious community. Religious reforms usually lead to a reformulation of the religious teachings held for true, and to the condemnation resp. rejection of teachings held for wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Johnstone: [https://books.google.de/books/about/Religion_in_Society.html?id=11LuAAAAMAAJ Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion], Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2006. pp. 134 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly the deviation from the assumed true faith which gives reason for a religious reform crept in over a longer period of time, sometimes over centuries. A religious reform is always a reorientation at the historical beginnings of a religion (therefore: ''re-formare'', reconstruct) under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A typical example for deviations from an assumed true faith are social changes within society which lead a loss purpose for [[ethics|ethical]] prescriptions, so they have to be replaced by other ethical prescriptions in order to protect the underlying, unchanged value for the future. Another typical example is the factual falsification of traditional views, e.g. by better insights into historical events or into natural science, by which the traditional views are falsified.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Hassan Butt: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/comment.religion1 My plea to fellow Muslims: you must renounce terror], in: The Guardian 01 July 2007; citation: "If our country is going to take on radicals and violent extremists, Muslim scholars must go back to the books and come forward with a refashioned set of rules and a revised understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Muslims whose homes and souls are firmly planted in what I'd like to term the Land of Co-existence. And when this new theological territory is opened up, Western Muslims will be able to liberate themselves from defunct models of the world, rewrite the rules of interaction and perhaps we will discover that the concept of killing in the name of Islam is no more than an anachronism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The eternally continuing change of society and the progress of human knowledge are the reasons why a "final" reform of religious teachings is not possible. Religious teachings have to be reformed again and again. This realization was formulated in a concise sentence by [[Karl Barth]] in 1947: ''[[Ecclesia semper reformanda est]]'', i.e. ''The church is always to be reformed.''&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mahlmann: ''Ecclesia semper reformanda''. Eine historische Aufarbeitung. Neue Bearbeitung, in: Torbj√∂rn Johansson, Robert Kolb, Johann Anselm Steiger (Hrsg.): Hermeneutica Sacra. Studien zur Auslegung der Heiligen Schrift im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert, Berlin - New York 2010, pp. 382-441, here pp. 384-388&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious reforms do not aim at an adjustment to the spirit of the time in the first place, yet they naturally bring about certain adjustments to the present time, since the religious tradition is reconsidered and reformed under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A full adjustment of a religious teaching to the spirit of the present time cannot be expected from a credible religious reform. Religious reforms which do not aim at the reestablishment of an assumed true faith in the first place, yet at a mere adjustment of religious teaching to the spirit of the time without respect to an assumed true faith are no religious reforms, strictly speaking. Their purpose is questionable since those reforms are not based on the faith of the believers. Reforms of this nature are often based on compulsion and are usually not long-lasting but are reversed in the next generations. An example is the attempt of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate to [[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion|restore paganism as state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. the struggle for the meaning of ''[[Aggiornamento]]'' in the Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of justified religious reforms are called traditionalists, their ideology is traditionalism. The adherents of reforms to adjust to the spirit of the time in the first place without respect for an assumed true faith are called modernists, their ideology is [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]]. Both concepts were coined by Christian-Catholic historical developments, yet today they are applied to all religions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. title of: J. Schacht: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4282132 Modernism and Traditionalism in a History of Islamic Law], in:  Middle Eastern Studies Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul., 1965), pp. 388-400&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous examples of religious reforms ==
* The [[Buddhist councils]] for the clarification of the teachings of the Buddha.
* The [[First Council of Nicaea]] for the clarification of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], 325 AD.
* The movement of the Muslim [[Mu øtazila]] rejected wrong traditions, 9th to 11th century.
* The [[Protestant Reformation]] of 1517 by [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and others.
* The introduction of the [[Historical Criticism#History|Historical-Critical Method]] in Christianity in the 19th and 20th century.
* The [[Second Vatican Council]] of the [[Catholic Church]], 1962-1965.

'''Regular script''' ({{zh|s=Ê•∑‰π¶|t=Ê•∑Êõ∏|p=k«éish≈´|first=t}}; [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]: ''kaisho''), also called Ê≠£Ê•∑ ({{zh|p=zh√®ngk«éi}}), ÁúüÊõ∏ (''zhƒìnsh≈´''), Ê•∑È´î (''k«éit«ê'') and Ê≠£Êõ∏ (''zh√®ngsh≈´''), is the newest of the [[Chinese script styles]] (appearing by the [[Cao Wei]] dynasty ca. 200 CE and maturing stylistically around the 7th century), hence most common in modern writings and publications (after the [[Ming (typefaces)|Ming]] and [[East Asian gothic typeface|gothic]] styles, used exclusively in print).

Regular script came into being between the [[Eastern Han|Eastern H√†n]] and [[Cao Wei|C√°o W√®i]] dynasties,&lt;ref name=qiu143&gt;Qi√∫ 2000 p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and its first known master was [[Zhong Yao| Zh≈çng Y√°o]] (sometimes also read Zh≈çng Y√≥u; ÈçæÁπá),&lt;ref&gt;Qi√∫ 2000 p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in the E. H√†n to C√°o W√®i period, ca. 151‚Äì230 CE. He is known as the "father of regular script", and his famous works include the XuƒÅnsh√¨ Bi«éo (ÂÆ£Á§∫Ë°®), Ji√†nj√¨zh√≠ Bi«éo (Ëñ¶Â≠£Áõ¥Ë°®), and L√¨m√¨ng Bi«éo (ÂäõÂëΩË°®).  [[Qiu Xigui]]&lt;ref name=qiu143/&gt; describes the script in Zhong‚Äôs XuƒÅnsh√¨ Bi«éo as:

{{quote|‚Ä¶clearly emerging from the womb of early period semi-cursive script. If one were to write the tidily written variety of early period semi-cursive script in a more dignified fashion and were to use consistently the pause technique (d√πn È†ì, used to reinforce the beginning or ending of a stroke) when ending horizontal strokes, a practice which already appears in early period semi-cursive script, and further were to make use of right-falling strokes with thick feet, the result would be a style of calligraphy like that in the "XuƒÅn sh√¨ bi«éo".}}

However, other than a few literati, very few wrote in this script at the time; most continued writing in neo-clerical script, or a hybrid form of semi-cursive and neo-clerical.&lt;ref name=qiu143/&gt;  Regular script did not become dominant until the early [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], in the 5th century; this was a variety of regular script which emerged from neo-clerical as well as from Zhong Yao's regular script,&lt;ref&gt;Qi√∫ 2000 p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and is called "[[Northern Wei|Wei]] regular" (È≠èÊ•∑ Weikai). Thus, regular script has parentage in early semi-cursive as well as neo-clerical scripts.

The script is considered to have matured stylistically during the [[Tang Dynasty]], with the most famous and oft-imitated regular script calligraphers of that period being:
* The early Tang four great calligraphers (ÂàùÂîêÂõõÂ§ßÂÆ∂):
** [[Ouyang Xun]] (Ê¨ßÈò≥ËØ¢)
** [[Yu Shinan]] (Ëôû‰∏ñÂçó)
** [[Chu Suiliang]] (Ë§öÈÅÇËâØ)
** [[Xue Ji]] (ËñõÁ®∑)
* "Yan-Liu" ("È°èÊü≥")
** [[Yan Zhenqing]] (È¢úÁúüÂçø)
** [[Liu Gongquan]] (Êü≥ÂÖ¨ÊùÉ)

==Characteristics==
Regular script characters with width (or length) larger than 5 cm (2 in) is usually considered larger regular script, or dakai (Â§ßÊ•∑), and those smaller than 2 cm (0.8 in) usually small regular script, or xiaokai (Â∞èÊ•∑). Those in between are usually called medium regular script, or zhongkai (‰∏≠Ê•∑). What these are relative to other characters. The [[Eight Principles of Yong]] are said to contain a variety of most of the strokes found in regular script.

Notable writings in regular script include:
* ''The Records of Yao Boduo Sculpturing'' (Âßö‰ºØÂ§öÈÄ†ÂÉèË®ò) during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]
* The Tablet of Guangwu General (Âª£Ê≠¶Â∞áËªçÁ¢ë) during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]
* The Tablet of Longzang Temple (ÈæçËóèÂØ∫Á¢ë) of the [[Sui Dynasty]]
* ''Tombstone-Record of Sui Xiaoci'' (ËòáÂ≠ùÊÖàÂ¢ìË™å) of the Sui Dynasty
* ''Tombstone-Record of Beauty Tong'' (Ëë£Áæé‰∫∫Â¢ìË™å) of the Sui Dynasty
* Sweet Spring at Jiucheng Palace (‰πùÊàêÂÆÆÈÜ¥Ê≥âÈäò) of the [[Tang Dynasty]]

===Derivatives===
*[[Imitation Song typeface]]s ({{zh|c=‰ªøÂÆãÈ´î|p=f«éng S√≤ngt«ê}}) are typefaces based on a printed style which developed in the [[Song dynasty]], from which [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] typefaces developed.
*The most common printed typeface styles [[Ming (typeface)|Ming]] and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]] are based on the structure of regular script.
*The Japanese textbook typefaces ({{lang|ja|ÊïôÁßëÊõ∏‰Ωì}}; [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]: ''ky≈çkashotai'') are based on regular script, but modified so that they appear to be written with a [[pencil]] or [[pen]]. They also follow the standardized character forms prescribed in the [[J≈çy≈ç kanji]].
*[[Bopomofo|Zhuyin Fuhao]] characters, although not true Chinese characters, are virtually always written with regular script strokes.

'''Relapse prevention''' ('''RP''') is a [[cognitive-behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] approach to [[relapse]] with the goal of identifying and preventing high-risk situations such as substance abuse, obsessive-compulsive behavior, sexual offending, obesity, and depression.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"&gt;Witkiewitz, K. &amp; Marlatt, G.A. (2004). Relapse Prevention for Alcohol and Drug Problems. American Psychologist, 59, 4, 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an important component in the treatment process for [[alcoholism]], or [[alcohol dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=Mary E.|author2=Palmer, Rebekka S. |author3=Marlatt, G. Alan |date=1999|title=Relapse Prevention|publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|volume=23|issue=2|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/151-160.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalbug.com/what-is-alcohol-addiction-what-causes-alcohol-addiction/#more-164|title=What is Alcohol Addiction: What Causes Alcohol Addiction?|date=6 January 2012|publisher=Medical Bug|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying assumptions==
Relapse is seen as both an outcome and a transgression in the process of behavior change. An initial setback or lapse may translate into either a return to the previous problematic behavior, known as relapse, or the individual turning again towards positive change, called prolapse.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt; A relapse often occurs in the following stages: emotional relapse, mental relapse, and finally, physical relapse. Each stage is characterized by feelings, thoughts, and actions that ultimately lead to the individual returning to their old behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ambrosiatc.com/addiction/relapse-prevention-comeback/?ambTRK=PR |title=Relapse Prevention &amp; Comeback |date= September 15, 2016|website=Ambrosia Treatment Center |publisher= Ambrosia Treatment Center |access-date= June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relapse is thought to be multi-determined, especially by self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, coping, emotional states, and interpersonal factors. In particular, high [[self-efficacy]], negative outcome [[Expectancy theory|expectancies]], potent availability of [[coping skills]] following treatment, positive [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], and functional [[social support]] are expected to predict positive outcome. Craving has not historically been shown to serve as a strong predictor of relapse.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt;

==Efficacy and effectiveness==
Carroll ''et al''. conducted a review of 24 other trials and concluded that RP was more effective than no treatment and was equally effective as other active treatments such as [[supportive psychotherapy]] and [[interpersonal therapy]] in improving substance use outcomes. Irvin and colleagues also conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of RP techniques in the treatment of alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and polysubstance use, and upon reviewing 26 studies, concluded that RP was successful in reducing substance use and improving psychosocial adjustment. RP seemed to be most effective for individuals with alcohol problems, suggesting that certain characteristics of alcohol use are amenable to the RP.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt; Miller et al. (1996) found the GORSKI/CENAPS relapse warning signs to be a good predictor of the occurrence of relapse on the AWARE scale (r = .42, p &lt; .001).

==Systems theory==
Some theorists, including [[Katie Witkiewitz]] and [[G. Alan Marlatt]], borrowing ideas from [[systems theory]], conceptualize relapse as a multidimensional, [[complex system]]. Such a [[nonlinear]] [[dynamical system]] is believed to be able to best predict the data witnessed, which commonly includes cases where small changes introduced into the equation seem to have large effects. The model also introduces concepts of self-organization, feedback loops, timing/context effects, and interplay between tonic and phasic processes.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt;

Rami Jumnoodoo and Dr. Patrick Coyne, in London UK, have been working with [[National Health Service]] users and carers over the past ten years to transfer RP theory into the field of adult mental health. The uniqueness of the model is the sustainment of change by developing service users and carers as 'experts' - following RP as an educational process and graduating as Relapse Prevention Practitioners. The work has won many national awards, been presented at many conferences, and has resulted in a number of publications.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Terence Gorski MA has developed the CENAPS (Center for Applied Science)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cenaps.com/The_Cenaps_Corporation/Home.html CENAPS (Center for Applied Science)]&lt;/ref&gt; model for relapse prevention including Relapse Prevention Counseling (Gorski, Counseling For Relapse Prevention, 1983) and a system for certification of Relapse Prevention Specialists (CRPS).

In the [[United States]], which has an English [[common law]] tradition, the concept of a [[right to keep and bear arms]] was recognized prior to the creation of a written national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McAffee |first1=Thomas B. |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael J. |year=1997 |title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, or Precedent Stand In The Way? |url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/512/ |journal=Scholarly Works |volume=Paper 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Patriot (American Revolution)|colonists]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] rebelled against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] control during the [[American Revolution]] they cited the 1689 English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] as an example.

== English precedent ==
{{see also|Assize of Arms of 1181}}
The American understanding of the right to keep and bear arms was influenced by the 1689 [[English Bill of Rights]], an [[Act of Parliament]], which also dealt with personal defence by [[Protestant]] English subjects.

The Bill of Rights did not create a new right to have arms but rather rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed King [[James II of England|James II]], a [[Roman Catholic]], who had forced the disarming of [[Protestant]]s, while arming and deploying armed Catholics contrary to Law (among other alleged violations of individual rights). The Bill of Rights provided that Protestants could bear arms for their defence as permitted by law. It also established that the power to regulate the right to bear arms belonged to Parliament, not the monarch.&lt;ref name="c21WillMarSess2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1518621|title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar. Sess. 2|publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the eighteenth century about the right to have arms being auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation", but conceded that the right was subject to their suitability and allowance by law.

{{Quote|The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Civilian usage meaning ==
In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the right to arms preexisted the Constitution and in that case and in ''[[Presser v. Illinois]]'' (1886) recognized that the Second Amendment protected the right from being infringed by Congress. In ''[[United States v. Miller]]'' (1939), the Court again recognized that the right to arms is individually held and, citing the Tennessee case of ''Aymette v State'', indicated that it protected the right to keep and bear arms that are "part of the ordinary military equipment" or the use of which could "contribute to the common defense." In its first opportunity to rule specifically on whose right the Second Amendment protects, ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), the Court ruled that the amendment protects an individual right "to keep and carry arms in case of confrontation," not contingent on service in a militia, while indicating, in dicta, that restrictions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, on the carrying of arms in sensitive locations, and with respect to the conditions on the sale of firearms could pass constitutional muster. In the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago, the Court applied incorporation doctrine to extend the Second Amendment's protections nationwide.

The people's right to have their own arms for their defense is described in the philosophical and political writings of [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[John Locke]], [[Machiavelli]], the [[Whig (British political faction)|English Whigs]] and others.&lt;ref name="Halbrook, Stephen P. 1994 8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Halbrook, Stephen P.|title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (Independent Studies in Political Economy)|publisher=The Independent Institute|location=Oakland, CA|year=1994|page=8|isbn=0-945999-38-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=June 2016}} Though possessing arms appears to be distinct from "bearing" them, the possession of arms is recognized as necessary for and a logical precursor to the bearing of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=William &amp; Mary Bill of Rights Journal|author=Schmidt, Christopher|title=An International Human Right to Keep and Bear Arms|date=February 2007|publisher=The College of William &amp; Mary School of Law|location=Williamsburg, Virginia|volume=15|issue=3|page=983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Kates]], a civil liberties lawyer, cites historic English usage describing the "right to keep and bear ''their private arms''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kates, Jr.|first=Don B.|date=November 1983|title=Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=82|issue=2|pages=204‚Äì273|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|quote=In unmistakable individual right terms: As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear ''their private arms''. (Emphasis in original)|doi=10.2307/1288537|jstor=1288537}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, Sayoko Blodgett-Ford notes a non-military usage of the phrase in a pamphlet widely circulated by the dissenting minority dating from the time of the Pennsylvania ratifying convention for the U.S. Constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed...&lt;ref name="Sayoko001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blodgett-Ford, Sayoko|title=The Changing Meaning of the Right to Bear Arms|journal=Seton Hall Constitutional Law Journal|date=Fall 1995|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In commentary written by Judge Garwood in ''[[United States v. Emerson]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] concluded in 2001 that:&lt;ref name="isbn0-8223-3017-2"&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|...there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service. See ''Bliss v. Commonwealth'', 13 Am. Dec. 251, 12 Ky. 90 (Ky. 1822).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1332436.html |title=United States v. Emerson, No. 99-10331., October 16, 2001 ‚Äì US 5th Circuit &amp;#124; FindLaw |publisher=FindLaw |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, in a released Senate report on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Senator [[Orrin Hatch]], chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution, states:

{{quote|They argue that the Second Amendment's words "right of the people" mean "a right of the state"&amp;nbsp;‚Äì apparently overlooking the impact of those same words when used in the First and Fourth Amendments. The "right of the people" to assemble or to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is not contested as an individual guarantee. Still they ignore consistency and claim that the right to "bear arms" relates only to military uses. This not only violates a consistent constitutional reading of "right of the people" but also ignores that the second amendment protects a right to "keep" arms. "When our ancestors forged a land "conceived in liberty", they did so with musket and rifle. When they reacted to attempts to dissolve their free institutions, and established their identity as a free nation, they did so as a nation of armed freemen. When they sought to record forever a guarantee of their rights, they devoted one full amendment out of ten to nothing but the protection of their right to keep and bear arms against governmental interference. Under my chairmanship the Subcommittee on the Constitution will concern itself with a proper recognition of, and respect for, this right most valued by free men.&lt;ref name="rkba1982"/&gt;}}

Likewise, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), No. 07-290, that "[t]he Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."&lt;ref&gt;''Heller'', Syllabus, item #1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military service and civilian usage meanings ==
Some historians have argued that prior to and through the 18th century, the expression "bear arms" appeared exclusively in military contexts, as opposed to the use of firearms by civilians.&lt;ref name="UM194"&gt;Uviller, H. Richard. &amp; Merkel, William G.: ''The Militia and the Right to Arms, Or, How the second Amendment Fell Silent '', pp 23, 194. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0-8223-3017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, John; Petrie, Carol; Wellford, Charles F.: ''Firearms and violence'', p. 290. National Academies Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-309-09124-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]]. ''To Keep and Bear Arms''. New York Review Of Books, September 21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-300-09562-7"&gt;{{cite book| author=Williams, David H.|title=The mythic meanings of the Second Amendment: taming political violence in a constitutional republic| publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn|year=2003|page=5|quote=The amendment thus guarantees a right to arms only within the context of a militia, not an individual right to arms for self-defense or hunting.|isbn=0-300-09562-7|oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In late-eighteenth-century parlance, ''bearing arms'' was a term of art with an obvious military and legal connotation. ... As a review of the Library of Congress's data base of congressional proceedings in the revolutionary and early national periods reveals, the thirty uses of 'bear arms' and 'bearing arms' in bills, statutes, and debates of the Continental, Confederation, and United States' Congresses between 1774 and 1821 invariably occur in a context exclusively focused on the army or the militia.&lt;ref name="UM194b"&gt;Uviller, H. Richard. &amp; Merkel, William G.: ''The Militia and the Right to Arms, Or, How the Second Amendment Fell Silent '', p. 194. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0-8223-3017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this conclusion is disputed and may be due to [[selection bias]], which arises from the use of a limited selection of government documents that overwhelmingly refer to matters of military service.&lt;ref name="Cramer-Olson001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cramer, Clayton E. |author2=Olson, Joseph |title=What Did "Bear Arms" Mean in the Second Amendment?|journal=Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|issue=2|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this previous research, other historians note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Searching more comprehensive collections of English language works published before 1820 shows that there are a number of uses that...have nothing to do with military service...[and] The common law was in agreement. Edward Christian's edition of Blackstone's Commentaries that appeared in 1790s described the rights of Englishmen (which every American colonist had been promised) in these terms 'everyone is at liberty to keep or carry a gun, if he does not use it for the [unlawful] destruction of game.' This right was separate from militia duties.&lt;ref name="Cramer-Olson001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the term ''to bear arms'' as: ''"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight,"'' dating to about 1330.

[[Garry Wills]], author and history professor at [[Northwestern University]], has written of the origin of the term ''bear arms'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;By legal and other channels, the Latin "''[[wikt:arma#Latin|arma]] [[wikt:ferre#Latin|ferre]]''" entered deeply into the European language of war. Bearing arms is such a synonym for waging war that Shakespeare can call a just war "'' 'justborne arms''" and a civil war "''self-borne arms''." Even outside the special phrase "''bear arms''," much of the noun's use echoes Latin phrases: to be under arms (''[[wikt:sub#Latin|sub]] armis''), the call to arms (''[[wikt:ad#Latin|ad]] arma''), to follow arms (''arma [[wikt:sequi|sequi]]''), to take arms (''arma [[wikt:capere|capere]]''), to lay down arms (''arma p≈ìnere''). "Arms" is a profession that one brother chooses the way another choose law or the church. An issue undergoes the arbitrament of arms." ... "One does not bear arms against a rabbit...".&lt;ref name="isbn0-684-87026-6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wills, Garry|title=A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|year=2002|page=257|isbn=0-684-87026-6|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Garry Wills also cites Greek and Latin [[etymology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... "Bear Arms" refers to military service, which is why the plural is used (based on Greek 'hopla pherein' and Latin 'arma ferre')&amp;nbsp;‚Äì one does not bear arm, or bear an arm. The word means, etymologically, 'equipment' (from the root ar-* in verbs like 'ararisko', to fit out). It refers to the 'equipage' of war. Thus 'bear arms' can be used of naval as well as artillery warfare, since the "profession of arms" refers to all military callings.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Garry (1999). ''A Necessary Evil'' pp. 256‚Äì257. New York, NY. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historically, the right to keep and bear arms, whether considered an individual or a collective or a militia right, did not originate fully formed in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791; rather, the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] was the codification of the six-centuries-old responsibility to keep and bear arms for king and country that was inherited from the English Colonists that settled North America, tracing its origin back to the [[Assize of Arms of 1181|Assize of Arms]] of 1181 that occurred during the reign of Henry II. Through being codified in the United States Constitution, the common law right was continued and guaranteed for the People, and statutory law enacted subsequently by Congress cannot extinguish the pre-existing common law right to keep and bear arms.&lt;ref name='Espohl_97'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Espohl,  Frank |title=The Right to Carry  Concealed Weapons  for Self Defense |journal=Southern Illinois University Law Journal |volume=22 |page=151 |year=1997 |quote=The right of self-preservation, including the right of self-defense, has been suggested to be within the protection of the Ninth Amendment.  Thus, although some courts have refused to hold that the Ninth Amendment protects  a right to possess firearms, laws which restrict the ability of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms for the purpose of self-defense could be said to violate the Ninth Amendment.  Another common interpretation of the Ninth Amendment is that it protects rights which were recognized at common law as being among the "fundamental rights of Englishmen."  The common law, as described in Blackstone's Commentaries, has been carried into American jurisprudence.  One such right protected at common law was the right to self-defense and the right to possess and carry weapons for defensive purposes.  Hobbes described the right to self-defense as a fundamental natural right of which persons can not justly be deprived by any law or covenant.  Blackstone listed self-defense and the right to carry weapons for self-defense as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.  Blackstone further described the right to self-defense as "the primary law of nature, so it is not, nor can it be in fact, taken away by the law of society |url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Espohl1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523070409/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Espohl1.htm |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] refers to a pre-existing right to keep and bear arms:

{{quote|A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&lt;ref name='BoR'&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html |title=Bill of Rights Transcript Text |work=archives.gov |year=2011 |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right is often presented in the United States as being an unenumerated, pre-existing right, such as provided for by the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution]],&lt;ref name='Espohl_97'/&gt; interpreted by some as providing for unenumerated rights, and therefore implicitly a right to keep and bear arms:

{{quote|The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.}}

Some have seen the Second Amendment as derivative of a common law right to keep and bear arms; Thomas B. McAffee &amp; Michael J. Quinlan, writing in the North Carolina Law Review said ''"...&amp;nbsp;Madison did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he drafted the Second Amendment&amp;nbsp;‚Äì the right was pre-existing at both common law and in the early state constitutions."''&lt;ref name='nclr'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, Or Precedent Stand In The Way?|journal=North Carolina Law Review|date=March 1997|first=Thomas B.|last=McAffee|author2=Michael J.

Akhil Reed Amar similarly notes the basis of Common Law for the first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, "following John Randolph Tucker's famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist case, Spies v. Illinois": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as limitations on Federal power, yet insofar as they secure and recognize fundamental rights&amp;nbsp;‚Äì common law rights&amp;nbsp;‚Äì of the man, they make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the United States...&lt;ref name='ylj1'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Bill Of Rights And The Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=April 1992|first=Akhil|last=Amar|volume=|issue=|page=1193|id= |url=|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Uviller and Merkel hold that the right to bear arms was not reserved for the state, but rather was an individual and personal right for arms only to the extent needed to maintain a well regulated militia to support the state. They also hold that a militia recognizable to the framers of the Constitution has ceased to exist in the United States resulting from deliberate Congressional legislation and also societal neglect; nonetheless, "Technically, all males aged seventeen to forty-five are members of the unorganized militia, but that status has no practical legal significance."&lt;ref name="isbn0-8223-3017-2b"&gt;{{cite book

Medieval monks might enjoy the question: is a military force that developed out of an ancient construct known as "the militia" still a militia though it boasts none of the defining characteristics of that form of military organization, and is, actually, in character the contradiction of many of them?   It's a little like the parable of Aristotle's knife: if I break the blade of my knife and replace it, and then put a new handle on it, is it still the same knife?

A few academic writers published their opinions in several works:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the text as well as a fair understanding of the contemporary ethic regarding arms and liberty, it seems to us overwhelmingly evident that the principal purpose of the Amendment was to secure a personal, individual entitlement to the possession and use of arms. We cannot, however, (as the individual rights contingent generally does) disregard entirely the first part of the text proclaiming a well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state.&lt;ref name = "UM23"&gt;Uviller, H.

Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0-8223-3017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...we understand the Second Amendment as though it read: "Inasmuch as and so long as a well regulated Militia shall be necessary to the security of a free state and so long as privately held arms shall be essential to the maintenance thereof, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." "..to us, the language of the Amendment cannot support a right to personal weaponry independent of the social value of a regulated organization of armed citizens..&lt;ref name = "UM24"&gt;Uviller, H.

== Early commentary in federal courts ==
{{See also|Firearm case law in the United States}}

In the century following the ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less interest than it does in modern times.&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_neither_model"&gt;Cornell, ''Gun Control'', p. 6. Neither of the two modern theories that have defined public debate over the right to bear arms is faithful to the original understanding of this provision of the Bill of Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of regulation was done by states, and the first case law on weapons regulation dealt with state interpretations of the Second Amendment. A notable exception to this general rule was ''Houston v. Moore'', {{ussc|18|1|1820}}, where the Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in an aside.&lt;ref&gt;Justice Story "misidentified" it as the "5th Amendment. Several public officials, including [[James Madison]] and Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, retained the confusing practice of referring to each of the ten amendments in the Bill of Rights by the enumeration found in the first draft; the fifth article is the Second Amendment.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dred Scott v. Sandford''===

In the Nineteenth century considerable attention in public discourse and the courts was directed to the issue of arming of slaves (prior to the Civil War), and later to the right of slaves to belong to militia and the arming of these individuals. Most famously this is seen in the court arguments of the 1857 court case ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', whether the slave [[Dred Scott]] could be a citizen with rights, including the right to bear arms. This debate about the rights of slaves and former slaves often included the usage of the term 'bear arms' with the meaning of individuals having or not having the right to possess firearms.

In the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]], the [[Majority opinion|opinion of the court]] stated that if [[African American]]s were considered [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]], "It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right...to keep and carry arms wherever they went."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=60&amp;invol=393|title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes|work=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;60 U.S. 393, 417 (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early commentary in state courts ==
The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution is a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] provision.  In 2010, this "fundamental" and "individual" right was "fully incorporated" with the 14th Amendment per the SCOTUS ruling made in ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'', which upheld the prior opinion made in ''District of Columbia v. Heller''. Each of the fifty states also has its own state constitution. Forty-four states have chosen to explicitly embody a right to bear arms into their state constitutions.&lt;ref name='staterkba'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statecon.htm|title=State Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms Provisions|accessdate=2008-05-10|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|year=2006|publisher=UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the state constitutions, state laws, and state courts addresses the state-based right to bear arms distinctly within its respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Thomas M. &amp; Angell, Alexis C.: ''A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest Upon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union'', p. 427. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company. 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree and the nature of the protection, prohibition, and regulation at the state level varies from state to state. The District of Columbia, not being a state, falls within the federal jurisdiction.

Approximately&lt;!-- way too many "approximately"s for two paragraphs --&gt; thirty-one states have explicitly chosen to include the right to arms for "individual right", "defense of self", "defense of home" or similarly worded reasons. Approximately thirteen states, as with the U.S. Constitution, did not choose to explicitly include "individual", "self" or "home" wording associated with a right to bear arms for their specific states.

Approximately twenty-eight states have explicitly chosen to include the right to bear arms for "security of a free state", "defense of state", "common defense" or similarly worded reasons, as with the U.S. Constitution. Approximately sixteen states did not choose to include explicitly "free state", "defense of state" or "common defense" wording for their specific state. Whether the inclusion of these kinds of wording in state constitutions has relevance to the issue of whether implicit "individual" rights exist, or whether such rights (if any) are implicitly protected by the states' constitutions or by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, remains a matter of dispute. However, since the SCOTUS has "fully incorporated" the 2nd and 14th Amendments in their 2010 opinion and order in ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'', the right to keep and bear arms is "fully applicable" to the states and limits the states on any and all regulations and restrictions they choose to take, and federal Constitutional rights take precedence over state, local and other laws that regulate to "Right of Lawful Citizens to keep and bear Arms for self-defense, a 'central component' of the 2nd Amendment" (see ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'' (SC  2010)).&lt;!-- every one of those approximatelys is quanitifiable and should be checked and given its correct value --&gt;

Regarding the state interpretations of these state and the federal constitutional rights to bear arms, state courts have addressed the meaning of these specific rights in considerable detail. Two different models have emerged from state [[jurisprudence]]: an individual right (defense of self or home) and a collective (defense of the state) right.  It should be noted, however, that the states cannot lessen or restrict any Bill of Rights guarantee that has been "fully incorporated" (American jurisprudence) and that the right that is "fully incorporated" also applies to the respective State Constitutions; again, the states can only "add to" these rights but can never "diminish" these rights by state and local laws.

This was interpreted to include the right to carry a concealed sword in a cane.  This case has been described as about "a statute prohibiting the carrying of [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons]] [that] was violative of the Second Amendment."&lt;ref name="1967hearing"&gt;United States. Anti-Crime Program. Hearings Before Ninetieth Congress, First Session. Washington: U.S. Government Print. Off, 1967, p. 246. quote: ''"...all citizens had the unabridgable right to bear arms for self-protection as well as for militia purposes and that a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons was violative of the Second Amendment (see Bliss v. Commonwealth, 2 Litt. (Ky) 90, 13 Am. December 251 (1822))...''&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, however, have seen no conflict with the Second Amendment by the Commonwealth of Kentucky's statute under consideration in ''Bliss'' since "The Kentucky law was aimed at concealed weapons. No one saw any conflict with the Second Amendment. As a matter of fact, most of the few people who considered the question at all believed amendments to the U.S. Constitution did not apply to state laws."&lt;ref name="William Weir."&gt;{{cite book

The Kentucky High Court stated in ''Bliss'', "But it should not be forgotten, that it is not only a part of the right that is secured by the constitution; it is the right entire and complete, as it existed at the adoption of the constitution; and if any portion of that right be impaired, immaterial how small the part may be, and immaterial the order of time at which it be done, it is equally forbidden by the constitution."&lt;ref name="bliss v commonwealth"/&gt; The "constitution" mentioned in this quote refers to Kentucky's Constitution.&lt;ref name="rkba1982"&gt;Right to Keep and Bear Arms, U.S. Senate. 2001 Paladin Press. {{ISBN|1-58160-254-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case prompted outrage in the Kentucky House, all the while recognizing that Section 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799) did guarantee individuals the right to bear arms.  The ''Bliss'' ruling, to the extent that it dealt with concealed weapons, was overturned by constitutional amendment with Section 26 in Kentucky's Third Constitution (1850) banning the future carrying of concealed weapons, while still asserting that the bearing of arms in defense of themselves and the state was an individual and collective right in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This recognition has remained to the present day in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Fourth Constitution, enacted in 1891, in Section 1, Article 7, that guarantees "The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and of the State, subject to the power of the General Assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed weapons." As noted in the Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in the 1980s, vol. 10, no. 1, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;155, "The first state court decision resulting from the "right to bear arms" issue was ''Bliss v. Commonwealth''. The court held that "the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire, ..." "This holding was unique because it stated that the right to bear arms is absolute and unqualified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Darell R.|title=Second Amendment Survey|journal=Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in 1980s|volume=10|issue=1|year=1982|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two states, [[Alaska]] and [[Vermont]], do not require a permit or license for carrying a concealed weapon to this day, following Kentucky's original position.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of ''Bliss'' is also seen from the defense subsequently given against a murder charge in Kentucky against Mattews Ward, who in 1852 pulled out a concealed pistol and fatally wounded his brother's teacher over an accusation regarding eating chestnuts in class. Ward's defense team consisted of eighteen lawyers, including U.S. Senator [[John J. Crittenden|John Crittenden]], former Governor of Kentucky, and former [[United States Attorney General]]. The defense successfully defended Ward in 1854 through an assertion that "a man has a right to carry arms; I am aware of nothing in the laws of God or man, prohibiting it. The Constitution of Kentucky and our Bill of Rights guarantee it. The Legislature once passed an act forbidding it, but it was decided unconstitutional, and overruled by our highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals." As noted by Cornell, "Ward's lawyers took advantage of the doctrine advanced in ''Bliss'' and wrapped their client's action under the banner of a constitutional right to bear arms. Ward was acquitted."&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_AWRM_Ward"&gt;{{cite book

=== Aymette ===

In ''Aymette v. State'', 21 Tenn. 154, 156 (1840), the Tennessee Supreme Court construed the guarantee in Tennessee's 1834 Constitution that 'the free white men of this State have a right to Keep and bear arms for their common defence.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm15138.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/tfd/id/495/rec/2 |title=Tennessee Constitution, 1834 |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that the provision was adopted with the same goals as the Federal Constitution's Second Amendment, the court wrote: "The words 'bear arms' ‚Ä¶ have reference to their military use, and were not employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress.  As the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured, is of general and public nature, to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defense, so the arms, the right to keep which is secured, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment."
* 1. The act of 1837-8, ch. 137, sec. 2, which prohibits any person from wearing any [[Bowie knife]], or [[Arkansas toothpick]], or other knife or weapon in form, shape or size resembling a Bowie knife or Arkansas toothpick under his clothes, or concealed about his person, does not conflict with the 26th section of the first article of the bill of rights, securing to the free white citizens the right to keep and bear arms for their common defense.
* 2. The arms, the right to keep and bear which is secured by the constitution, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and constitute the ordinary military equipment; the legislature have the power to prohibit the keeping or wearing weapons dangerous to the peace and safety of the citizens, and which are not usual in civilized warfare.
* 3. The right to keep and bear arms for the common defense, is a great political right. It respects the citizens on the one hand, and the rulers on the other; and although this right must be inviolably preserved, it does not follow that the legislature is prohibited from passing laws regulating the manner in which these arms may be employed.

The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Nunn v. Georgia]]'' (Nunn v. State, 1 Ga.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear ''arms'' of every description, and not ''such'' merely as are used by the ''militia'', shall not be ''infringed'', curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this ''right'', originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-2901.pdf |title=District of Columbia v.

=== Buzzard ===

In ''State v. Buzzard'' (1842, Ark), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-based, political interpretation, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared, "that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense",&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=State v. Buzzard|vol=4|reporter=Ark. (2 Pike)|opinion=18|year=1842|url=http://www.guncite.com/court/state/4ar18.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. Buzzard had carried a concealed weapon and stood "indicted by virtue of the authority of the 13th section of an act of the Legislature prohibiting any person wearing a [[pistol]], [[dirk]], large knife or sword-cane ''concealed as a weapon'', unless upon a journey, under the penalties of fine and imprisonment." Justice Lacy, in a dissenting opinion in ''Buzzard'', summarizing the majority viewpoint to which he disagreed, declared: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the words "a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State", and the words "common defense" clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Ark. and U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to keep and bear arms."&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joel Prentiss Bishop]]'s influential ''Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes'' (1873) took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop characterized as the "Arkansas doctrine", as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law.&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_AWRM_Bishop"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=... the Kansas Supreme Court had used a similar formulation of the right to bear arms a decade earlier, describing this right as one that "refers to the people as a collective body.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kansas high court declared: "That the provision in question applies only to the right to bear arms as a member of the state militia, or some other military organization provided for by law, is also apparent from the second amendment to the federal Constitution, which says: 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'"

=== Interpretive Models ===
{{Further|Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}
Three models of interpreting the right to bear arms in the United States commonly exist. These three models are founded on differing interpretations of the Second Amendment, ''"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."''

The first model, the individual-rights model, holds that a right of individuals is to own and possess firearms, much as the First Amendment protects a right of individuals to engage in free speech.&lt;ref name="dorf"/&gt; This view was confirmed by the Supreme Court in ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008) than had previous interpretations by the Court. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Heller'' there was a split among the federal courts, with nine of the federal circuit courts of appeal supporting a modified collective rights view, two of the federal circuits supporting an individual rights view, and one federal circuit court having not addressed the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The second two models focus on the preamble, or "purpose" clause, of the Amendment&amp;nbsp;‚Äì the words ''"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State."'' The second model, the collective model, holds that the right to bear arms belongs to the people collectively rather than to individuals, under the belief that the right's only purpose is to enable states to maintain a militia.

The third model, the modified collective model, holds that the right to keep and bear arms exists only for individuals actively serving in the militia, and then only pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed.&lt;ref name="dorf"&gt;{{cite web

=== Federal case commentary ===
Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]] in 2008 wrote that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions and regulations and subsequently federal court rulings have upheld existing gun prohibitions and regulations.&lt;ref name="urlThe Volokh Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‚Äì  Yet Another Early Post-''Heller'' Second Amendment Case:&lt;blockquote&gt;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/posts/1215491766.shtml |title=The Volokh Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Yet Another Early Post-''Heller'' Second Amendment Case: |work= |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nadine Strossen]], former president of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], has stated that the individual rights model must yield to reasonable regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

No right is absolute; the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy Constitutional [[strict scrutiny]] and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance."&lt;ref&gt;[[n:ACLU President Strossen on religion, drugs, guns and impeaching George Bush#Gun rights|Interview with Nadine Strossen]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the [[Fifth Circuit]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service."&lt;ref name="Emerson000"&gt;United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The cited excerpt from the ''Emerson'' decision reflects some of the court's lengthy analysis of Second Amendment jurisprudence (Spitzer 2003)(Reynolds 2002). This analysis garnered considerable attention and scrutiny by legal experts. Shortly after the decision, Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] directed the adoption of the Emerson court's view as the policy of the Justice Department in a memo to all ninety-three United States Attorneys in November 2001. In contrast, legal critics of the "individualist view" repudiated the ''Emerson'' analysis on various grounds. Judge Robert M. Parker, while concurring in the ''Emerson'' result, labeled the majority's analysis as ''obiter dicta'', irrelevant to
the outcome of the case (see ''Emerson'', Spitzer 2003). Moreover, the thoroughness of the ''Emerson'' analysis was criticized because the court's rendered opinion relied substantially on interpretations submitted in a "brief presented by one party" (Spitzer 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''United States v. Miller''====
{{Main|United States v. Miller}}

In ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|307|174|1939}}, the Supreme Court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the [[National Firearms Act]] prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered [[Any Other Weapon|Title II weapons]]:

{{quote|Jack Miller and Frank Layton "did unlawfully...transport in interstate commerce from...Claremore...Oklahoma to...Siloam Springs...Arkansas a certain firearm...a double barrel...shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length...at the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate commerce...not having registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26, United States Code, ...and not having in their possession a stamp-affixed written order...as provided by Section 1132C...&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 175.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a unanimous opinion authored by [[James Clark McReynolds|Justice McReynolds]], the Supreme Court stated "the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable."&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 177‚Äì178.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Court explained:

{{quote|In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 178.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gun rights advocates claim that the Court in ''Miller'' ruled that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of "ordinary military equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondamendment.net/2amd4.html|title=The misconstruction of United States v.

Most modern scholars recognize this fact."&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p. 139. "But when all is said and done, the only certainty about ''Miller'' is that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most modern scholars recognize this fact. For example, Professor Eugene Volokh describes Miller as 'deliciously and usefully ambiguous' in an article about using the Second Amendment as a teaching tool in constitutional law. That is probably the most accurate statement that can be made about the case."&lt;/ref&gt;

== The politics of the right to keep and bear arms ==

Interest groups, primarily in the United States, exert political pressure for and against legislation limiting the right to keep and bear arms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10367">{{Transformation rules}}

In [[logic]], a '''rule of inference''', '''inference rule''' or '''transformation rule''' is a [[logical form]] consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]], and returns a conclusion (or [[multiple-conclusion logic|conclusions]]). For example, the rule of inference called ''[[modus ponens]]'' takes two premises, one in the form "If p then q" and another in the form "p", and returns the conclusion "q". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of [[classical logic]] (as well as the semantics of many other [[non-classical logic]]s), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.

Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In [[many-valued logic]], it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are [[Recursion|recursive]] are important; i.e. rules such that there is an [[effective procedure]] for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary [[œâ-consistent theory|œâ-rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Boolos | first1 = George | last2 = Burgess | first2 = John | last3 = Jeffrey | first3 = Richard C. | title = Computability and logic | year = 2007 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge  | isbn = 0-521-87752-0 | page = 364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular rules of inference in [[propositional logic]] include ''[[modus ponens]]'', ''[[modus tollens]]'', and [[contraposition]]. First-order [[predicate logic]] uses rules of inference to deal with [[logical quantifier]]s.

==The standard form of rules of inference==
In [[formal logic]] (and many related areas), rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Premise#1
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Premise#2
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''...'''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Premise#n &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Conclusion

This expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. The exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations. In a simple case, one may use logical formulae, such as in:

: &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{A \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;B\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is the ''[[modus ponens]]'' rule of [[propositional logic]]. Rules of inference are often formulated as [[schema (logic)|schemata]] employing [[metavariable]]s.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. Reynolds|title=Theories of Programming Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OwlTC4SOccC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2009|origyear=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-10697-9|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rule (schema) above, the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe (or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as [[proposition]]s) to form an [[infinite set]] of inference rules.

A proof system is formed from a set of rules chained together to form proofs, also called ''derivations''. Any derivation has only one final conclusion, which is the statement proved or derived. If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation, then the derivation is a proof of a ''hypothetical'' statement: "''if'' the premises hold, ''then'' the conclusion holds."

== Example: Hilbert systems for two propositional logics ==
In a [[Hilbert system]], the premises and conclusion of the inference rules are simply formulae of some language, usually employing metavariables. For graphical compactness of the presentation and to emphasize the distinction between axioms and rules of inference, this section uses the sequent notation (&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;) instead of a vertical presentation of rules.

The formal language for classical [[propositional logic]] can be expressed using just negation (¬¨), implication (‚Üí) and propositional symbols. A well-known axiomatization, comprising three axiom schemata and one inference rule (''modus ponens''), is:

 (CA1) ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (CA2) ‚ä¢ (''A'' ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''C'')) ‚Üí ((''A'' ‚Üí ''B'') ‚Üí (''A'' ‚Üí ''C''))&lt;br/&gt;
 (CA3) ‚ä¢ (¬¨''A'' ‚Üí ¬¨''B'') ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (MP)  ''A'', ''A'' ‚Üí ''B'' ‚ä¢ ''B''

It may seem redundant to have two notions of inference in this case, ‚ä¢ and ‚Üí. In classical propositional logic, they indeed coincide; the [[deduction theorem]] states that ''A'' ‚ä¢ ''B'' if and only if ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí ''B''. There is however a distinction worth emphasizing even in this case: the first notation describes a [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], that is an activity of passing from sentences to sentences, whereas ''A'' ‚Üí ''B'' is simply a formula made with a [[logical connective]], implication in this case. Without an inference rule (like ''modus ponens'' in this case), there is no deduction or inference. This point is illustrated in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s dialogue called "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]" &lt;ref name="ChiaraDoets1996"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Maria Luisa Dalla Chiara |editor2=Kees Doets |editor3=Daniele Mundici |editor4=Johan van Benthem |title=Logic and Scientific Methods: Volume One of the Tenth International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science, Florence, August 1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCthvF8xLIAC&amp;pg=PA290|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4383-7|page=290|chapter=Logical consequence: a turn in style|author=Kosta Dosen}} [http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/~kosta/LOGCONS.pdf preprint (with different pagination)]&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as later attempts by [[What_the_Tortoise_Said_to_Achilles#Discussion|Bertrand Russel and Peter Winch]] to resolve the paradox introduced in the dialogue.
 
For some non-classical logics, the deduction theorem does not hold. For example, the [[three-valued logic]] of [[Jan ≈Åukasiewicz|≈Åukasiewicz]] can be axiomatized as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Merrie |last=Bergmann|title=An introduction to many-valued and fuzzy logic: semantics, algebras, and derivation systems|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88128-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 (CA1) ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (LA2) ‚ä¢ (''A'' ‚Üí ''B'') ‚Üí ((''B'' ‚Üí ''C'') ‚Üí (''A'' ‚Üí ''C''))&lt;br/&gt;
 (CA3) ‚ä¢ (¬¨''A'' ‚Üí ¬¨''B'') ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (LA4) ‚ä¢ ((''A'' ‚Üí ¬¨''A'') ‚Üí ''A'') ‚Üí ''A''&lt;br/&gt;
 (MP)  ''A'', ''A'' ‚Üí ''B'' ‚ä¢ ''B''

This sequence differs from classical logic by the change in axiom 2 and the addition of axiom 4. The classical deduction theorem does not hold for this logic, however a modified form does hold, namely ''A'' ‚ä¢ ''B'' if and only if ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí (''A'' ‚Üí ''B'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Merrie |last=Bergmann|title=An introduction to many-valued and fuzzy logic: semantics, algebras, and derivation systems|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88128-9|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissibility and derivability==
{{main|Admissible rule}}
In a set of rules, an inference rule could be redundant in the sense that it is ''admissible'' or ''derivable''. A derivable rule is one whose conclusion can be derived from its premises using the other rules. An admissible rule is one whose conclusion holds whenever the premises hold. All derivable rules are admissible. To appreciate the difference, consider the following set of rules for defining the [[natural number]]s (the [[natural deduction|judgment]] &lt;math&gt;n\,\,\mathsf{nat}&lt;/math&gt; asserts the fact that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number):

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\frac{}{\mathbf{0} \,\,\mathsf{nat}} &amp;
\frac{n \,\,\mathsf{nat}}{\mathbf{s(}n\mathbf{)} \,\,\mathsf{nat}} \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first rule states that '''0''' is a natural number, and the second states that '''s(n)''' is a natural number if ''n'' is. In this proof system, the following rule, demonstrating that the second successor of a natural number is also a natural number, is derivable:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{n \,\,\mathsf{nat}}{\mathbf{s(s(}n\mathbf{))} \,\,\mathsf{nat}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Its derivation is the composition of two uses of the successor rule above. The following rule for asserting the existence of a predecessor for any nonzero number is merely admissible:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathbf{s(}n\mathbf{)} \,\,\mathsf{nat}}{n \,\,\mathsf{nat}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is a true fact of natural numbers, as can be proven by [[Mathematical induction|induction]]. (To prove that this rule is admissible, assume a derivation of the premise and induct on it to produce a derivation of &lt;math&gt;n \,\,\mathsf{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.) However, it is not derivable, because it depends on the structure of the derivation of the premise. Because of this, derivability is stable under additions to the proof system, whereas admissibility is not. To see the difference, suppose the following nonsense rule were added to the proof system:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{}{\mathbf{s(-3)} \,\,\mathsf{nat}}
&lt;/math&gt;

In this new system, the double-successor rule is still derivable. However, the rule for finding the predecessor is no longer admissible, because there is no way to derive &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{-3} \,\,\mathsf{nat}&lt;/math&gt;. The brittleness of admissibility comes from the way it is proved: since the proof can induct on the structure of the derivations of the premises, extensions to the system add new cases to this proof, which may no longer hold.

Admissible rules can be thought of as [[theorem]]s of a proof system. For instance, in a [[sequent calculus]] where [[cut elimination]] holds, the ''cut'' rule is admissible.

The '''SFI Group System''' is the most widely used [[Classification|classification system]] for the [[Ship transport|maritime]] and offshore industry worldwide. It is an international standard, which provides a functional subdivision of technical and financial ship or rig information.

SFI consists of a technical account structure covering all aspects of ship/rig specification, and it can be used as a basic standard for all systems in the shipping/offshore industry.

More than 6000 SFI systems have been installed worldwide.

SFI is used by shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, consultancies, software suppliers, authorities and [[Classification society|classification societies]].

== Background, Purpose, and Advantages ==

=== Background ===
The '''SFI Group System''' was first released in 1972 as the result of a research project undertaken by the [[Ship Research Institute of Norway]] (SFI: Skipsteknisk Forskningsinstitutt). Today, sales, marketing and upgrading of the '''SFI Group System''' is undertaken by [http://www.spectec.net SpecTec].

=== Purpose and Advantages ===
The main purpose of the '''SFI Group System''' is to help shipping and offshore companies control operations by tying together all their procedures such as purchasing, accounting, maintenance, technical records, etc.
The '''SFI Group System''' provides major advantages for shipping and offshore operations in the following areas:
* Communication
* Computerisation
* Cooperation
* Cost Control
* Cost Comparison
* Development
* Education and Training
* Quality Control
* Standardisation

=== Scope ===
When the '''SFI Group System''' was established, the intention was that it should be capable of accommodating all relevant ship or rig types, and it should be a common code for the flow of information between different enterprises within the maritime and offshore industry.

The system should be independent of company organization and methods of ship building, ship operation, maintenance and repair. It should further lend itself to be updated with regard to new ship types and new technology. In order to meet the purpose of and the requirements to the system, the ships were divided into functions. The ship functions are common to all parties who are concerned with the specification, building and operation of ships.

In addition to the Group System with Detail Code, it may be necessary for each user to develop special codes, such as plan of finance accounts for budgeting and cost control of total company operation.

Shipyards using the '''SFI Group System''' for planning and control of production will require a supplementary company internal Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
Shipping companies using the '''SFI Group System''' for operation and maintenance planning and control, will require a coding system for consumables.

== The Problems SFI Can Solve ==

=== Controlling Shipping and Offshore Operations ===
The '''SFI Group System''' improves the control and quality assurance of activities such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting and record keeping within shipping and offshore operations.

SFI provides shipping and offshore companies, shipyards, authorities, suppliers and consultants with a common plan of technical account/codes in the handling of:
* Specifications
* Estimates
* Drawings
* Purchase
* Material Administration
* Maintenance and Repair Planning
* Instruction Material
* Budgets and Cost Control
* Files
The areas of system utilization are steadily increasing, and the system has contributed to increased efficiency in the maritime industry. The SFI Group Systemis a particularly useful tool when routines are being established according to the quality loop ([http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=41014 ref. ISO 9004, par. 5.1]).

[[File:SFI Quality Loop.jpg|thumb|right|SFI Quality Loop]]

=== Specifications ===
Specifications are normally established at different levels of detail: Outline, Contract, Building, As Built and Repair Specifications. Technical descriptions of components should be part of the As Built Specification and should follow the SFI Detail Code.

The database version of the Group System lends itself especially well to the development of the various specifications. A report generator makes it easy for the user to edit specifications according to requirements.
Specifications may be related to different Group System levels.
* Outline specifications to Primary Group level
* Functional requirements to Secondary Group level
* Functional solutions to Tertiary Group level
* Component selections to Detail Code level

=== Estimates ===
As estimates are based on specifications, they should follow the same breakdown structure. The estimates normally contain cost of material and working hours:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Hours !! Materials
|-
| 73 || Compressed air systems || ||
|-
| 731 || Starting air systems || 200 ||
|-
| 731.001 || Starting [[air compressor]] || || $150,000
|-
| 731.003 || Starting air emergency compressor ||  || $98,000
|-
| 731.005 || Starting air water/oil separator || || $17,000
|-
| 731.010 || Starting [[Pressure vessel|air tank]]s || || $33,000
|-
| 731.012 || Starting air bottles || || $9,500
|-
| 731.014 || Starting air coolers || || $12,000
|-
| 731.016 || Starting air compressor silencers || || $5,000
|}

=== Drawings and Document Handling ===
Drawings can easily be numbered according to SFI, and complex drawings in CAD systems may be split into layers to show individual installations according to the '''SFI Group System'''.

Drawing identification may incorporate a SFI Group System number. A standard drawing number may be composed as follows:

179-731-001
Ship no. ‚Äì SFI tertiary group no. ‚Äì Consecutive no.

Drawings should be numbered according to the group level if possible. The Primary and Secondary Group levels are usually used for system and arrangement drawings:

* 179-100-000: General arrangement
* 179-200-001: Profile and deck plan
* 179-350-000: Loading and discharging system
* 179-446-001: Engine stores arrangement

Item lists on arrangement drawings may also be coded according to the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Purchasing ===
A purchase is normally charged to a finance account (cost type) and to a '''SFI Group System''' number, often called a technical account (cost center).

When purchasing components, a yard may specify the individual item by the SFI Detail Code (6 digits). When a shipping company orders spare parts, these may be identified by the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers (total of 9-10 digits).

=== Material Administration ===
When components are purchased directly to order/ship, the SFI Detail Code may be used as a technical account.

The spare part manufacturer may have its own numbering system. For a shipping company it is often convenient to establish a spare part numbering system comprising the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers:
* 731.001 - Starting air compressor
* 731.001.001 - HP cylinder
* 731.001.002 - LP cylinder
* 731.001.003 - HP cylinder cover
* 731.001.004 - LP cylinder cover

=== Maintenance ===
An operation and maintenance system will often contain a register covering all maintenance units on board. These units are normally identical to the components in the Detail Code:

731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Maker:
Type:
Serial no.:
Capacity:

Procedures for preventive maintenance and class survey of a maintenance unit will be entered with job identification:

731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1
Job A - 3000 hours routine
Job B - Class survey

All records of preventive and corrective maintenance should be filed and related to the maintenance unit. The technical accounts of planned maintenance systems such as [http://www.spectec.net/en/maritime/amos-maintenance-and-procurement AMOS Maintenance and Procurement] are commonly based on the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Repair ===
Repair specifications are often based on information from the maintenance system. The repair bill should follow the repair specification structure. It is customary for the yard to quote prices to the shipping company at subgroup level.

=== Operation Budget ===
The '''SFI Group System''' is used for budgeting of maintenance and repair work, and for spare part consumption. In order to make a complete operation budget in a shipping company, it is necessary to link the Group System to a plan of finance accounts. Any suitable plan of finance accounts may be used together with SFI.

The plan of finance accounts usually covers spare parts and consumable items. Budgeting of spare parts may be performed in great detail using the '''SFI Group System'''.

=== Cost Control ===
[[Cost accounting|Cost control]] of new building or repair work is normally carried out at the tertiary Group and Detail Code levels. Direct purchases are charged to the SFI Detail Code:

Materials:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Planned !! Actual !! Difference
|-
| 731.001 || Starting air compressor || 150,000 || 158,000 || +8,000
|}

Reporting of working hours is normally carried out at the tertiary group level. Activities and jobs must be established to follow up work progress.

Materials:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Name !! Planned !! Actual !! Difference
|-
| 731 || Starting air systems || 200 || 210 || +10
|}

=== Quality Assurance ===
In relation to [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso_9000.htm ISO 9000] and [http://www.imo.org/en/Pages/Default.aspx IMO] requirements for safe operation, it is necessary to establish procedures that ensure that specification requirements and rules and regulations from authorities and classification societies are met, and that the ship/rig is operated safely.

The following procedures and instructions should be classified according to SFI:
* Surveyor‚Äôs manual
* Installation description

=== Filing ===
The '''SFI Group System''' is often used as a standard filing system for the shipping and offshore industry. SFI gives this industry a well structured and organized filing system for drawings, manuals, reports, and publications.
* Testing and commissioning procedures
* Operating, start and stop manuals
* Maintenance instructions
* Faultfinding
* Spare parts
* Tools
* List of drawings
* Certificates
* Agents

== The Coding Structure of SFI ==

=== SFI Group System (3-digit) ===
[[File:SFI Triangle.png|thumb|right|Primary Group 7]]
The SFI Group System is built up as a 3-digit decimal classification system. The ship/rig is divided into 10 Primary Groups from 0 to 9. Only Primary Groups 1 to 8 are in use. The users may use Primary Groups 0 and 9 for classifying other main components that are not covered by the SFI standard.

Each of the Primary Groups (1st digit) consists of 10 Groups (2nd digit) and each Group is divided further into 10 subgroups (3rd digit).
The Primary Groups (1st digit) of SFI for Ships is described below.

==== Primary Group 1 - General ====
Details and costs that cannot be charged to any specific function on board, e.g. general arrangement, quality assurance, launching, dry-docking and guarantee 
work.

==== Primary Group 2 - Hull Systems ====
Hull, superstructure and material protection of the vessel.

==== Primary Group 3 - Cargo Equipment ====
Cargo equipment and machinery including systems for vessel‚Äôs cargo, loading/discharging systems, cargo winches and hatches.

==== Primary Group 4 - Ship Equipment ====
Ship specific equipment- and machinery. Navigational equipment, manoeuvring machinery, anchoring equipment, and communication equipment. This group also includes special equipment such as equipment for fishing.

==== Primary Group 5 - Crew and Passenger Equipment ====
Equipment, machinery, systems etc. serving crew and passengers, for example lifesaving equipment, furniture, catering equipment and sanitary systems.

==== Primary Group 6 - Machinery Main Components ====
Primary components in the engine room, for example main and auxiliary engines, propellers, plant, boilers, and generators.

==== Primary Group 7 - Systems for Machinery Main Components ====
Systems serving main machinery components, for example fuel and lubrication oil systems, starting air system, exhaust systems and automation systems.

==== Primary Group 8 - Common Systems ====
Central ship systems, for example ballast and bilge systems, fire fighting and wash down systems, electrical distribution systems etc.

=== SFI Detail and Material Codes (6 digit) ===
The detail and material codes cover components and materials that may be related to the individual subgroups. In order to reach the component level, it might be necessary to break the subgroups further down by using a detail code. This code has not yet been possible to standardize due to the variety of equipment and numbers onboard different types of ships, and due to slightly different requirements to the code for shipyards and shipping companies.

Usually there are two different classes of components and material that are used; one class comprises components and material that are ordered directly to a ship, the other comprises components and material that are ordered to stock. Consequently, the codes are divided into two parts:

'''Detail Code''': Components that are purchased directly to order/ship. The detail code is used to define the individual component and equipment that acts in the sub system function. In the Detail Code the supplementary codes are built up from 001-099.

'''Material Code''': This code relates to material that is purchased to stock.
The relations between these codes are as follows:
* SFI Group System + Detail Code: 731.000 ‚Äì 731.099
* SFI Group System + Material Code: 731.100 ‚Äì 731.999

== User Rights for the SFI Group System ==

=== SFI User License ===
An SFI User License Certificate must be purchased from SpecTec to use the '''SFI Group System'''. One license fee will be charged for each SFI installation. This means that one license is required for each ship/site/rig that uses the coding structure of SFI. There are additional charges for each book, file or database.

== Formats of the SFI Group System ==

=== SFI Manuals ===
The SFI manuals are available in the following formats:
* A4
* A5
* A6
* Letter
The A4, A5, and Letter manuals contain the following parts:
* SFI Code Matrix
* Summary lists of primary, secondary, and tertiary groups
* Detailed descriptions of secondary and tertiary groups
* Detail Codes
* Material Codes
* Keyword register
The A6 pocket manual contains:
* SFI Code Matrix
* Summary of primary, secondary, and tertiary groups
* Keyword register

== Conclusion ==
A classification system such as the '''SFI Group System''' will make a substantial contribution to standardized and well-ordered information related to ships/rigs, and will lead to improved communication both within a company and with external parties.

The '''SFI Group System''' will make shipping and offshore operations more efficient because companies will save resources and avoid pitfalls when implementing the SFI standards. SFI can be the common denominator tying together all functions of shipping and offshore operations such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting, filing etc.

'''''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. ''enterica''''' is a subspecies of ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'', the rod-shaped, [[flagella]]ted, aerobic, [[Gram-negative]] [[bacterium]]. Many of the pathogenic [[serovar]]s of the ''S. enterica'' species are in this [[subspecies]], including that responsible for [[typhoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medical Microbiology |edition=6th |page=307 |vauthors=Murray PR, Rosenthal KS, Pfaller MA |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Mosby Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serovars==
''S. enterica'' subsp. ''enterica'' contains a large number of serovars which can infect a broad range of [[vertebrate]] hosts. The individual members range from being highly host-adapted (only able to infect a narrow range of species) to displaying a broad host range. A number of techniques are currently used to differentiate between [[serotype]]s. These include looking for the presence or absence of [[antigen]]s, [[phage typing]], molecular fingerprinting and biotyping, where serovars are differentiated by which nutrients they are able to ferment. A possible factor in determining the host range of particular serovars is phage-mediated acquisition of a small number of genetic elements that enable infection of a particular host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sternlicht M, Staaby J, Sullivan I | title = Birth order, maternal age, and mental retardation | journal = Mental Retardation | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 3‚Äì6 | date = December 1975 | pmc = 127920 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.70.5.2249-2255.2002 | pmid = 11953356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further postulated that serovars which infect a narrow range of species have diverged from ancestors with a broad host range, and have since specialised and lost the ability to infect some hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langridge GC, Fookes M, Connor TR, Feltwell T, Feasey N, Parsons BN, Seth-Smith HM, Barquist L, Stedman A, Humphrey T, Wigley P, Peters SE, Maskell DJ, Corander J, Chabalgoity JA, Barrow P, Parkhill J, Dougan G, Thomson NR | title = Patterns of genome evolution that have accompanied host adaptation in Salmonella | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 863‚Äì8 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25535353 | pmc = 4311825 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1416707112 | author13-link = Duncan Maskell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of data from 37 countries collected between 2001 and 2007 found that the most common serovar of ''Salmonella'' isolated from human cases was Enteritidis, found in an average of 43.5% of cases, followed by Typhimurium (17.1% of cases), Newport (3.5%), Infantis (1.8%), Virchow (1.5%), Hadar (1.5%), and Agona (0.8%).&lt;ref name="Global monitoring"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendriksen RS, Vieira AR, Karlsmose S, Lo Fo Wong DM, Jensen AB, Wegener HC, Aarestrup FM | title = Global monitoring of Salmonella serovar distribution from the World Health Organization Global Foodborne Infections Network Country Data Bank: results of quality assured laboratories from 2001 to 2007 | journal = Foodborne Pathogens and Disease | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 887‚Äì900 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21492021 | doi = 10.1089/fpd.2010.0787 | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/global-monitoring-of-salmonella-serovar-distribution-from-the-world-health-organization-global-foodborne-infections-network-country-data-bank-results-of-quality-assured-laboratories-from-2001-to-2007(3360b495-8158-401c-bf87-ada8a4a6b0ee).html | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One strain of ''Salmonella'' that has recently been emerging in the United States is ''Salmonella javiana''. "An outbreak occurred in 2002, there were 141 cases that occurred among the participants of the U.S. Transplant Games. Out of the 141 cases, most of the cases were either transplant recipients (34%) or people receiving immunosuppressive therapy (32%)". There is an increasing number of ''Salmonella'' serotypes that are multidrug resistant (MDR), which was identified by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Goldrick|first1 = Barbara|title = Emerging Infections: Foodborne Diseases|journal = The American Journal of Nursing|date = March 2003|volume = 103|issue = 3|pages = 105‚Äì106|jstor=29745004|doi = 10.1097/00000446-200303000-00043}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Salmonella javiana'' causes 4% of nontyphodial ''Salmonella'' infections in the United States each year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elward A, Grim A, Schroeder P, Kieffer P, Sellenriek P, Ferrett R, Adams HC, Phillips V, Bartow R, Mays D, Lawrence S, Seed P, Holzmann-Pazgal G, Polish L, Leet T, Fraser V | title = Outbreak of Salmonella javiana infection at a children's hospital | journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 586‚Äì92 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16755478 | doi = 10.1086/506483 | jstor = 10.1086/506483 | url = https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/open_access_pubs/895 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolism===
Genetic evidence suggests that the serovars can be divided into two groups ‚Äì one which causes enteric infection and has a broad repertoire of metabolic capabilities, and one which usually causes invasive infection, often in a narrow range of hosts, and shows degradation of anaerobic metabolic pathways.

The serovars can be designated fully or in a shortened form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bacterio.cict.fr:80/salmonellanom.html | title=Salmonella nomenclature | date=March 19, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415011644/http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/salmonellanom.html | archive-date=2006-04-15 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The short form lists the genus, ''Salmonella'', which is followed by the capitalized and non-italicized serovar.  The full designation for ''Salmonella'' Typhi is ''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. ''enterica'', serovar Typhi.  Each serovar can have many strains, as well, which allows for a rapid increase in the total number of [[Antigenic variation|antigenically variable]] bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk:80/Projects/Salmonella/ | title=Salmonella spp. comparative sequencing | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114165837/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Salmonella/ | archive-date=2007-11-14 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
{{main|Salmonellosis}}

Invasive strains of non-typhoidal salmonella, such as ''Salmonella'' Typhimurium ST313 have recently been labelled as causing emerging diseases in Africa. Key host immune deficiencies associated with HIV, malaria and malnutrition have contributed to a wide spread of this disease and the need to use expensive antimicrobial drugs in the poorest health services in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feasey NA, Dougan G, Kingsley RA, Heyderman RS, Gordon MA | title = Invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease: an emerging and neglected tropical disease in Africa | journal = Lancet | volume = 379 | issue = 9835 | pages = 2489‚Äì99 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22587967 | pmc = 3402672 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(11)61752-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But also bacterial factors, such as upregulated activity of the virulence gene ''pgtE'', due to a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) in its promoter region, have been shown to have a great impact upon the pathogenesis of this particular ''Salmonella'' sequence type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammarl√∂f DL, Kr√∂ger C, Owen SV, Canals R, Lacharme-Lora L, Wenner N, Schager AE, Wells TJ, Henderson IR, Wigley P, Hokamp K, Feasey NA, Gordon MA, Hinton JC | title = Salmonella | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 11 | pages = E2614‚ÄìE2623 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29487214 | pmc = 5856525 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1714718115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-consciousness''' is a heightened sense of [[self-awareness]]. It is a preoccupation with oneself, as opposed to the philosophical state of self-awareness, which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being, though the two terms are commonly used interchangeably or [[synonym]]ously.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Lipka/Thomas M. Brinthaupt ''Self-perspectives Across the Life Span'', p. 228, SUNY Press, 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unpleasant feeling of self-consciousness may occur when one realizes that one is being watched or observed, the feeling that "everyone is looking" at oneself. Some people are habitually more self-conscious than others. Unpleasant feelings of self-consciousness are sometimes associated with [[shyness]] or [[paranoia]].

==Impairment==
When feeling self-conscious, one becomes aware of even the smallest of one's own actions. Such awareness can impair one's ability to perform complex actions. 
[[Adolescence]] is believed to be a time of heightened self-consciousness. A person with a chronic tendency toward self-consciousness may be [[shyness|shy]] or [[introvert]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ray Crozier ''Shyness: Development, Consolidation, and Change'', p. 71, Routledge, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-415-22432-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Unlike [[self-awareness]], which in a philosophical context is being conscious of oneself as an individual, self-consciousness, being excessively conscious of one's appearance or manner, can be a problem at times. Self-consciousness is often associated with shyness and embarrassment, in which case a lack of pride and low [[self-esteem]] can result. In a positive context, self-consciousness may affect the development of identity, for it is during periods of high self-consciousness that people come the closest to knowing themselves objectively. Self-consciousness affects people in varying degrees, as some people are constantly self-monitoring or self-involved, while others are completely oblivious about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Branden ''[[The Psychology of Self-Esteem]]'', p. 42, Nash Publishing Corp., 1969 {{ISBN|0-8402-1109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychologist]]s frequently distinguish between two kinds of self-consciousness, private and public. '''Private self-consciousness''' is a tendency to introspect and examine one's inner self and feelings. '''Public self-consciousness''' is an awareness of the self as it is viewed by others. This kind of self-consciousness can result in self-monitoring and social anxiety. Both private and public self-consciousness are viewed as personality traits that are relatively stable over time, but they are not correlated. Just because an individual is high on one dimension doesn't mean that he or she is high on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Simon ''Identity in Modern Society'', p. 30, Blacwell Publishing, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-631-22747-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different levels of self-consciousness affect [[behavior]], as it is common for people to act differently when they "lose themselves in a crowd". Being in a crowd, being in a dark room, or wearing a disguise creates anonymity and temporarily decreases self-consciousness (see [[deindividuation]]). This can lead to uninhibited, sometimes destructive behavior.

'''Sibling rivalry''' is a type of [[competition]] or animosity among siblings, whether blood related or not.

Siblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents. The sibling bond is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as [[Parenting|parental]] treatment, [[birth order]], personality, and people and experiences outside the family.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jane Mersky Leder|title=Adult Sibling Rivalry|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/articles/199301/adult-sibling-rivalry|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|accessdate=15 May 2018|date=January 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibling rivalry is particularly intense when children are very close in age and of the same gender and/or where one or both children are [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]].&lt;ref name="sylviarimm"&gt;[http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html The Effects of Sibling Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701155521/http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html |date=2007-07-01 }} Syliva B. Rimm, Educational Assessment Service, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throughout the lifespan==
[[Image:MDRBobMomSmall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|From a young age, children are sensitive to differences in parental treatment.]]

According to observational studies by [[Judith Dunn]], children are sensitive from the age of one year to differences in parental treatment. From 18 months on siblings can understand family rules and know how to comfort and be kind to each other. By the age of 3, children have a sophisticated grasp of social rules, can evaluate themselves in relation to their siblings, and know how to adapt to circumstances within the family.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt;

Sibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents.&lt;ref name="michigan"&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/sibriv.htm Sibling Rivalry] University of Michigan Health System, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents fight for the same reasons younger children fight, but they are better equipped to physically, intellectually, and emotionally hurt and be intellectually and emotionally hurt by each other. Physical and emotional changes cause pressures in the teenage years, as do changing relationships with parents and friends. Fighting with siblings as a way to get parental attention may increase in adolescence.&lt;ref name="teenagers"&gt;[http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm Living With Your Teenager: Dealing With Sibling Rivalry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054814/http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm |date=2011-07-25 }} Donna Rae Jacobson, North Dakota State University, July 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the age group 10 to 15 reported the highest level of competition between siblings.&lt;ref name="mcnerney"&gt;[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/humannature01/FinalArticles/SiblingRivalryinDegreeand.html Sibling Rivalry in Degree and Dimensions Across the Lifespan] Annie McNerney and Joy Usner, 30 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibling rivalry can continue into adulthood, and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years. Events such as a parent‚Äôs illness may bring siblings closer together, whereas marriage may drive them apart, particularly if the in-law relationship is strained. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time. At least 80 percent of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt;

==Causes==

According to Kyla Boyse from the [[University of Michigan]], each child in a family competes to define who it is as an individual and wants to show that it is separate from its siblings.  Children may feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents‚Äô attention, discipline, and responsiveness. Children fight most in families where there is neither any understanding that fighting is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts nor any alternative way of handling such conflicts; in families in which physical fighting is forbidden but no method of non-physical conflict resolution (''e.g.'', verbal argument) is permitted, the conversion and accumulation of everyday disputes into long-simmering hostilities can have an effect nearly as corrosive.  Stress in the parents‚Äô and children‚Äôs lives can create more conflict and increase sibling rivalry.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt;

===Other psychological approaches===

[[Alfred Adler]] saw siblings as "striving for significance" within the family and felt that [[birth order]] was an important aspect of personality development. In fact, psychologists and researchers today endorse the influence of birth order, as well as age and gender constellations, on sibling relationships. However, parents are seen as capable of having an important influence on whether they are competitive or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/FrustAgg/levy.htm The Hostile Act] David M. Levy (1941) First published in Psychological Review, 48, 356-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Levy introduced the term "sibling rivalry" in 1941, claiming that for an older sibling "the aggressive response to the new baby is so typical that it is safe to say it is a common feature of family life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/laurie-kramer-interview/sibling-relationships/44340.aspx Interview with Laurie Kramer] G. Stepp (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers today generally endorse this view, noting that parents can ameliorate this response by being vigilant to favoritism and by taking appropriate preventative steps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/surviving-your-childs-adolescence/201103/adolescence-and-parental-favoritism.aspx Adolescence and parental favoritism] Carl Pickhardt (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, say researchers, the ideal time to lay the groundwork for a lifetime of supportive relationships between siblings is during the months prior to the new baby's arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/newbaby.htm Helping Your Older Child Adjust to a New Baby Sibling] University of Michigan Health System (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Parents can reduce the opportunity for rivalry by refusing to compare or typecast their children,&lt;ref name="Journal article"&gt;[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/parenting-issues/family-favoritism/43568.aspx Parenting Issues: Playing Favorites] Stepp, G. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; planning fun family activities together, and making sure each child has enough time and space of their own.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt; They can also give each child individual attention, encourage teamwork, refuse to hold up one child (such as the oldest) as a role model for the others (such as the younger children), and avoid favoritism.&lt;ref name="arkansas"&gt;[http://www.parenting-ed.org Center for Effective Parenting] Arkansas State Parent Information &amp; Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching the children positive ways to ask for attention from parents when they need it can also make it less likely that they will resort to aggressive attention-getting strategies. [[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] notes that this remedy also requires that parents "catch children being good" by responding to children's kind, helpful, and creative bids for attention.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Moore, E. &amp; Katayama, M. (2005). ''What About Me? 12 Ways to Get Your Parents' Attention Without Hitting Your Sister''. Seattle, WA: Parenting Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, by being proactive about teaching children [[emotional intelligence]], problem solving skills, negotiation skills and encouraging them to look for win-win solutions, parents can help children resolve conflicts that arise as a normal part of growing up together in the same household. A concerted effort by parents to reduce competitiveness while nurturing bonding can further help alleviate sibling rivalry.

However, according to Sylvia Rimm,  although sibling rivalry can be reduced it is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. In moderate doses, rivalry may be a healthy indication that each child is assertive enough to express his or her differences with other siblings.&lt;ref name="sylviarimm"/&gt;

Weihe&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, V. R. (1997) Sibling abuse: Hidden physical, emotional, and sexual trauma, 2nd edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that four criteria should be used to determine if questioned and/or questionable behavior is rivalry or [[sibling abuse]]. First, given that children use different conflict-resolution tactics during various developmental stages, one must rule out the possibility that the questioned behavior is in fact age-appropriate for the child exhibiting it.  Second, one must determine whether the behavior is an isolated incident or instead part of an enduring pattern: abuse is, by definition, a long-term pattern rather than occasional disagreements.  Third, one must determine if there is an "aspect of victimization" to the behavior:  rivalry tends to be incident-specific, reciprocal, and obvious to others, while abuse is characterized by secrecy and an imbalance of power. Fourth, one must determine the goal of the questioned and/or questionable behavior:  while rivalry is motivated entirely or primarily by aspects of a child's self-interest in which [[wikt:disinterest|the interests of others, including the child's rival, do not play a role]], in scenarios featuring abuse the perpetrator's ultimate interests tend to include domination, humiliation, or at least embarrassment of the victim.

==Animals==
{{main|Sibling rivalry (animals)}}
Sibling rivalry is common among various animal species, in the form of competition for food and parental attention. An extreme type of sibling rivalry occurs when young animals kill their siblings. For example, a [[black eagle]] mother lays two eggs, and the first-hatched chick pecks the younger one to death within the first few days. In the [[blue-footed booby]], there is always the emergence of a brood hierarchy. The dominant chick will attack the subordinate one in times of food scarcity, often pecking it repeatedly or driving it from the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drummond |first1=Hugh|last2=Chavelas |first2=Cecilia Garcia |title=Food Shortage Influences Sibling Aggression in the Blue-footed Booby |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=1989 |volume=37 |pages=806‚Äì819 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(89)90065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[spotted hyena]]s, sibling competition begins as soon as the second pup is born, and 25% of pups are killed by their siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulloway.org/Holcomb.pdf Birth Order, Sibling Competition, and Human Behavior] Frank J Sulloway&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[Siblicide]])

Sibling relationships in animals are not always competitive. For example, among [[wolves]], older siblings help to feed and guard the young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0501/0501_feature.html Mothers and Others] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324181241/http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0501/0501_feature.html |date=2006-03-24 }} Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Natural History Magazine, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous instances==

===In religion===
[[Image:Cain leadeth abel to death tissot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Cain leads Abel to Death'', by James Tissot.]]

The [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]] contains several examples of sibling rivalry: the story of [[Cain and Abel]] tells of one brother's jealousy after God appears to favour his sibling, and the jealousy ultimately leads to murder. [[Esau]] was jealous of his brother [[Jacob's]]   inheritance and blessing; sisters [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]] compete for the love of Jacob; [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s brothers are so jealous that they effectively sell him into slavery. The following are also present in the [[Qur'an]] and the Torah.

===In literature===
A number of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays display the incidences of sibling rivalry. [[King Lear]] provokes rivalry among his three daughters by asking them to describe their love for him; in the same play, Edmund contrives to force his half-brother Edgar into exile. In ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', sisters Kate and Bianca are shown fighting bitterly. In ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', the title character is at least partially motivated by rivalry with his brother, King Edward. In ''[[As You Like It]]'', there is obvious sibling rivalry and antagonism between Orlando and Oliver, and also between Duke Frederick and Duke Senior.

Most adaptations of [[Sherlock Holmes]] depicts sibling rivalry with his brother, [[Mycroft Holmes]].

In [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', the brothers Cal and Aron Trask are counterparts to Cain and Abel of the Bible story.

''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' contains numerous examples, such as that between [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Renly Baratheon]]. After their eldest brother [[Robert Baratheon]]'s death they contend for the Iron Throne, Stannis finally killing Renly through dark magic, though it is left unclear whether he is aware of his role in Renly's death. The history of Westeros also contains "The Dance of the Dragons", in which Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon II Targaryen fought over the Iron Throne after their father Viserys I Targaryen's death, Aegon eventually killing Rhaenyra, but being poisoned shortly after, leading to Rhaenyra's son Aegon III becoming King.

===In film and television===
Sibling rivalry is a common theme in media that features child characters, reflecting the importance of this issue in early life. These issues can include jealousy on the birth of a new baby, different sibling roles, frequent arguments, competitiveness for mother's affection, and tensions between step-siblings.

Adult siblings can also be portrayed with a rivalrous relationship, often a continuation of childhood conflicts. [[Situation comedies]] exploit this to comic effect. Sibling relationships may be shown as alternately loving and argumentative. Brothers or sisters in a similar line of work may display professional rivalry. In serious drama, conflict between siblings can be fatal, as shown in [[crime drama]]s involving such rivalries.

===Real life===
Occasionally real life instances of sibling rivalry are publicized in the mass media. Siblings who play the same sport will often be compared with each other; for example, [[American football]] players [[Peyton Manning|Peyton]] and [[Eli Manning]], or [[tennis]] players [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]]. Musicians [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] and [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] are portrayed as having a turbulent relationship, similar to that of [[Ray Davies|Ray]] and [[Dave Davies]] of [[The Kinks]]. Politicians [[Ed Miliband|Ed]] and [[David Miliband]] are likewise portrayed as having a strained relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Sociology}}
'''Social status''' is the relative respect, competence, and deference accorded to people, groups, and organizations in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauder|first1=Michael|last2=Lynn|first2=Freda|last3=Podolny|first3=Joel|title=Status: Insights from Organizational Sociology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2012|volume=38|pages=267‚Äì283|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-071811-145503|doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-071811-145503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Cameron|last2=Hildreth|first2=John|last3=Howland|first3=Laura|title=Is the Desire for Status a Fundamental Human Motive?

At its core, status is about who members of a society consider to hold more social value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = C. | last2 = Guinote | first2 = A. | year = 2018 | title = "How Status Shapes Social Cognition: Introduction to the Special Issue,"The Status of Status: Vistas from Social Cognition | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1‚Äì3 | doi=10.1521/soco.2018.36.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs about who is more or less valued (e.g., honorable, respectable, smart) are broadly shared among members of a society.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

&lt;/ref&gt; As such, people use status hierarchies to decide who gets to "call the shots," who is worthy, and who deserves access to valuable resources. In so doing, these shared cultural beliefs make unequal distributions of resources and [[Power (social and political)|power]] appear natural and fair, supporting systems of [[social stratification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley|title=Consensus and the Creation of Status Beliefs.|journal=Social Forces|date=2006|volume=85|pages=431‚Äì453|url=https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/85/1/431/2235134|doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0139|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022095315/https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/85/1/431/2235134|archivedate=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status hierarchies appear to be universal across human societies, affording valued benefits to those who occupy the higher rungs, such as better health, social approval, resources, influence, and freedom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Status hierarchies depend primarily on the possession and use of [[status symbols]]. These are cues people use to determine how much status a person holds and how they should be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goffman|first1=Erving|title=Symbols of Class Status|journal=British Journal of Sociology|date=1951|volume=2|issue=4|pages=294‚Äì304|doi=10.2307/588083|jstor=588083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such symbols can include possession of socially valuable attributes, like being conventionally beautiful or having a prestigious degree.

==Determination==

Some perspectives on status emphasize its relatively fixed and fluid aspects. Ascribed statuses are fixed for an individual at birth, while achieved status is determined by social rewards an individual acquires during his or her lifetime as a result of the exercise of ability and/or perseverance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linton|first1=Ralph|title=The Study of Man|date=1936|publisher=Appleton Century Crofts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of ascribed status include [[caste]]s, [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and beauty among others. Meanwhile, achieved statuses are akin to one's educational credentials or occupation: these things require a person to exercise effort and often undergo years of training. The term [[master status]] has been used to describe the status most important for determining a person's position in a given context.&lt;ref name="BrymLie2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Brym|author2=John Lie|title=Sociology: Your Compass for a New World, Brief Edition: Enhanced Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vje_Pl5JmkcC&amp;pg=PA88|date=11 June 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-59893-3|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Kelly, and Jill Stein.

== In different societies ==
Status refers to the relative rank that an individual holds; this includes attendant rights, duties, and lifestyle, in a [[social hierarchy]] based upon honor or [[wikt:prestige|prestige]].  Status has two different types that come along with it: achieved, and ascribed.  The word status refers to social stratification on a vertical scale.

In modern societies, [[profession|occupation]] is usually thought of as the main determinant of status, but other memberships or affiliations (such as [[ethnic group]], [[religion]], [[gender]], voluntary associations, [[fandom]], [[hobby]]) can have an influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027083043/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |archivedate=2007-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/298 |title=The Effect of Middle School Extra Curricular Activities on Adolescents' Popularity and Peer Status ‚Äì EDER and KINNEY 26 (3): 298 ‚Äì Youth &amp; Society |publisher=Yas.sagepub.com |date=1995-03-01 |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703215724/http://yas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/298 |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Achieved status]] is when people are placed in the stratification structure based on their individual merits or achievements. This status can be achieved through education, occupation, and marital status. Their place within the stratification structure is determined by society's bar, which often judges them on success, success being financial, academic, political and so on.  America most commonly uses this form of status with jobs. The higher you are in rank the better off you are and the more control you have over your co-workers.

In pre-modern societies, status differentiation is widely varied. In some cases it can be quite rigid and class based, such as with the [[India]]n [[caste]] system. In other cases, status exists without class and/or informally, as is true with some [[Hunter-Gatherer]] societies such as the [[Khoisan]], and some [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] societies. In these cases, status is limited to specific personal relationships. For example, a [[Khoisan]] man is expected to take his wife's mother quite seriously (a non-joking relationship), although the mother-in-law has no special "status" over anyone except her son-in-law‚Äîand only then in specific contexts. All societies have a form of social status.

Status is an important idea in [[social stratification]]. [[Max Weber]] distinguishes status from [[social class]],&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. 1946. "Class, Status, Party." pp. 180‚Äì95 in From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills (eds.). New York: Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt; though some contemporary empirical sociologists combine the two ideas to create [[socioeconomic status]] or SES, usually operationalised as a simple [[Index (economics)|index]] of [[income]], [[education]] and occupational prestige.

Social [[dominance hierarchy]] emerges from individual survival-seeking behaviors.

== Status inconsistency ==
{{Main|Status inconsistency}}
Status inconsistency is a situation where an individual's [[social position]]s have both positive and negative influences on his or her social status. For example, a [[teacher]] may have a positive societal image (respect, prestige) which increases their status but may earn little [[money]], which simultaneously decreases their status.

== Inborn and acquired ==
[[File:Inquilinos.gif|thumb|right|250px|Social status is often associated with clothing and possessions. Compare the foreman with a horse and high hat with the [[inquilino]] in picture. Image from 19th century rural Chile.]]
Statuses based on inborn characteristics, such as ethnicity, are called [[ascribed status]]es, while statuses that individuals gained through their own efforts are called [[achieved status]]es. Specific behaviors are associated with [[social stigma]]s, which can affect status.

Ascribed status is when one's position is inherited through family.  [[Monarchy]] is a widely recognized use of this method, to keep the rulers in one family.  This usually occurs at birth without any reference as to how that person may turn out to be a good or bad leader.

== Social mobility ==
Status can be changed through a process of [[social mobility]]. Social mobility is change of position within the stratification system. A move in status can be upward (upward mobility), or downward (downward mobility). Social mobility allows a person to move to another social status other than the one he or she was born in. Social mobility is more frequent in societies where achievement rather than ascription is the primary basis for social status.

Social mobility is especially prominent in the United States in the late 20th century, with an ever-increasing number of women entering into the workplace as well as a steady increase in the number of full-time college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00003582 |title=OLMIS ‚Äì Women in the Labor Force |publisher=Qualityinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506101718/http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00003582 |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/ |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2007 - Introduction |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506100227/http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/ |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increased education as well as the massive increase in multiple household incomes has greatly contributed to the rise in social mobility obtained by so many today. With this upward mobility; however, comes the philosophy of "[[Keeping up with the Joneses]]" that so many Americans obtain.  Although this sounds good on the surface, it actually poses a problem because millions of Americans are in credit card debt due to [[conspicuous consumption]] and purchasing goods that they do not have the money to pay for.

== Social stratification ==
{{Main|Social stratification}}
Social stratification describes the way people are placed or "stratified" in society.  It is associated with the ability of individuals to live up to some set of ideals or principles regarded as important by the society or some social group within it. The members of a social group interact mainly within their own group and to a lesser degree with those of higher or lower status in a recognized system of social stratification.  Such ties between people are often fluid and amorphous.  Some of the more common bases for such ranking include:

Groups:
* [[Wealth]]/[[Income]] (most common): Ties between persons with the same personal income
* [[Gender]]: Ties between persons of the same sex and sexuality
* Political status: Ties between persons of the same political views/status
* [[Religion]]: Ties between persons of the same religion
* [[Race (human classification)|Race]]/[[Ethnicity]]: Ties between persons of the same ethnic/racial group
* [[Social class]]: Ties between persons born into the same economic group
* [[Coolness]]: Ties between persons who have similar levels of [[popularity]]

== Max Weber's three dimensions of stratification ==
{{Main|Three-component theory of stratification}}
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] developed a theory proposing that stratification is based on three factors that have become known as "the three p's of stratification": [[property]], prestige and [[Power (sociology)|power]]. He claimed that [[social stratification]] is a result of the interaction of wealth (class), prestige status (or in German ''Stand'') and power (party).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, translators and eds., (2015).  Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society.  Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reputation|Prestige]] is a significant factor in determining one's place in the stratification system. The ownership of property is not always going to assure power, but there are frequently people with prestige and little property.
* [[Property]] refers to one's material possessions and their life chances. If someone has control of property, that person has power over others and can use the property to his or her own benefit.
* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] is the ability to do what one wants, regardless of the will of others. (Domination, a closely related concept, is the power to make others' behavior conform to one's commands). This refers to two different types of power, which are possession of power and exercising power. For example, some people in charge of the government have an immense amount of power, and yet they do not make much money.
Max Weber developed various ways that societies are organized in hierarchical systems of power. These ways are social status, class power and political power.
* Class Power: This refers to unequal access to resources. If you have access to something that someone else needs, that can make you more powerful than the person in need. The person with the resource thus has bargaining power over the other.
* Social Status (Social Power): If you view someone as a social superior, that person will have power over you because you believe that person has a higher status than you do.
* Political Power: Political power can influence the hierarchical system of power because those that can influence what laws are passed and how they are applied can exercise power over others.
There has been discussion about how Weber's three dimensions of stratification are more useful for specifying social inequality than more traditional terms like [[Socioeconomic Status]].&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Tony and Dagmar Waters 2016 Are the terms "socio-economic status" and "social status" a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber?" Palgrave Communications 2, Article number: 16002 (2016) {{cite web |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms20162 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405132923/http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms20162 |archivedate=2016-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status group ===
{{Main|Status group}}
[[Max Weber]] developed the idea of "status group" which is a translation of the German ''Stand'' (pl. ''St√§nde''). Status groups are communities that are based on ideas of lifestyles and the honor the status group both asserts, and is given by others. Status groups exist in the context of beliefs about relative prestige, privilege, and honor and can be of both a positive and negative sort. People in status groups are only supposed to engage with people of like status, and in particular, marriage inside or outside the group is discouraged.  Status groups can include professions, club-like organizations, ethnicity, race, and other groups for which pattern association.&lt;ref&gt;Weber 48-56&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pierre Bourdieu's theory on class distinction ==
The French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] developed theories of [[social stratification]] based on aesthetic taste in his work ''[[La Distinction|Distinction]]''. Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present one's social space to the world, one's aesthetic dispositions, depicts one's status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically, Bourdieu hypothesizes that these dispositions are internalized at an early age and guide the young towards their appropriate social positions, towards the behaviors that are suitable for them, and an aversion towards other lifestyles.

Bourdieu theorizes that class fractions teach aesthetic preferences to their young. Class fractions are determined by a combination of the varying degrees of social, economic, and [[cultural capital]]. Society incorporates "symbolic goods, especially those regarded as the attributes of excellence, [‚Ä¶as] the ideal weapon in strategies of distinction".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 66"&gt;Bourdieu 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Those attributes deemed excellent are shaped by the interests of the dominating class. He emphasizes the dominance of cultural capital early on by stating that "differences in cultural capital mark the differences between the classes".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 69"&gt;Bourdieu 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic dispositions are the result of social origin rather than accumulated capital and experience over time.  The acquisition of [[cultural capital]] depends heavily on "[t]otal, early, imperceptible learning, performed within the family from the earliest days of life".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 66" /&gt;  Bourdieu hypothetically guarantees that the opinions of the young are those that they are born into, the accepted "definitions that their elders offer them".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 477"&gt;Bourdieu 477&lt;/ref&gt;

He asserts the primacy of social origin and [[cultural capital]] by claiming that [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]], though acquired cumulatively over time, depend upon it. Bourdieu claims that "one has to take account of all the characteristics of social condition which are (statistically) associated from earliest childhood with possession of high or low income and which tend to shape tastes adjusted to these conditions".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 177"&gt;Bourdieu 177&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bourdieu, tastes in food, culture and presentation, are indicators of class, because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individual's fit in society.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 144"&gt;Bourdieu 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Each fraction of the dominant class develops its own aesthetic criteria. A multitude of consumer interests based on differing social positions necessitates that each fraction "has its own artists and philosophers, newspapers and critics, just as it has its hairdresser, interior decorator or tailor."&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 231"&gt;Bourdieu 231‚Äì32&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu does not wholly disregard the importance of [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]] in the formation of [[cultural capital]]. In fact, the production of art and the ability to play an instrument "presuppose not only dispositions associated with long establishment in the world of art and culture but also economic means‚Ä¶and spare time".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 75"&gt;Bourdieu 75&lt;/ref&gt; However, regardless of one's ability to act upon one's preferences, Bourdieu specifies that "respondents are only required to express a status-induced familiarity with legitimate... culture".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 63"&gt;Bourdieu 63&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Taste] functions as a sort of social orientation, a 'sense of one's place', guiding the occupants of a given... social space towards the social positions adjusted to their properties, and towards the practices or goods which befit the occupants of that position".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 466"&gt;Bourdieu 466&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, different modes of acquisition yield differences in the nature of preferences.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 65"&gt;Bourdieu 65&lt;/ref&gt;

These "cognitive structures‚Ä¶are internalized, 'embodied' social structures", becoming a natural entity to the individual.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 468"&gt;Bourdieu 468&lt;/ref&gt;  Different tastes are thus seen as unnatural and rejected, resulting in "disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance ('sick-making') of the tastes of others."&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 56"&gt;Bourdieu 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu himself believes class distinction and preferences are "most marked in the ordinary choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying outside the scope of the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 77"&gt;Bourdieu 77&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Bordieu believes that "the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning" would probably be in the tastes of food.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 79"&gt;Bourdieu 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are "an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in 'showing off' a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part)".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 79" /&gt;  The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their class fractions.

Children from the lower end of the social hierarchy are predicted to choose "heavy, fatty fattening foods, which are also cheap" in their dinner layouts, opting for "plentiful and good" meals as opposed to foods that are "original and exotic".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 177" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 79" /&gt;  These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieu's "ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness, which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy," that contrasts the "convivial indulgence" characteristic of the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 179"&gt;Bourdieu 179&lt;/ref&gt;  Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury (or freedom) and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the [[social class]]es.

The degree to which social origin affects these preferences surpasses both educational and economic capital. In fact, at equivalent levels of [[educational capital]], social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 63" /&gt;  How one describes one's social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 78"&gt;Bourdieu 78&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, across the divisions of labor "economic constraints tend to relax without any fundamental change in the pattern of spending".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 185"&gt;Bourdieu 185&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability consumption patterns remain stable.

[[Image:Southern-belle-civil-war.jpg|thumb|Cover illustration of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', September 7, 1861 showing a stereotypical Southern belle]]
The '''Southern belle''' (derived from the French word ''belle'', 'beautiful') is a [[stock character]] representing a young woman of the American [[Deep South]]'s upper socioeconomic class.

== Origin ==
The image of the Southern belle developed in the South during the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum era .281783.E2.80.931861.29|antebellum]] era.  It was based on the young, unmarried woman in the plantation-owning upper class of Southern society.&lt;ref name="richmond1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/2259 |title=History Engine: Tools for Collaborative Education and Research &amp;#124; Episodes |publisher=Historyengine.richmond.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Portrait of Sallie Ward by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1860.jpg|thumb|right|Sallie Ward, a Southern belle]]

== Characteristics ==
The image of a Southern belle is often characterized by fashion elements such as a [[hoop skirt]], a [[corset]], [[pantalettes]], a wide-brimmed [[straw hat]], and gloves. As signs of tanning were considered working-class and unfashionable during this era, [[parasol]]s and [[Hand fan|fan]]s are also often represented.&lt;ref name="richmond1"/&gt;

Southern belles were expected to marry respectable young men, and become ladies of society dedicated to the family and community.&lt;ref name="richmond1"/&gt; The Southern belle archetype is characterized by [[Southern hospitality]], a cultivation of beauty, and a flirtatious yet chaste demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deepsouthmag.com/2011/06/anatomy-of-a-southern-belle/ |title=Anatomy of a Southern Belle &amp;#124; Deep South Magazine ‚Äì Southern Food, Travel &amp; Lit |publisher=Deepsouthmag.com |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Sally Ward Lawrence Hunt Armstrong Downs|Sallie Ward]], who was born into the Southern aristocracy of Kentucky in the Antebellum South, was called a Southern belle.&lt;ref name=thekentucky&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Thomas D.|title=The Kentucky|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|pages=238‚Äì255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Southern belle archetype has been criticized as part of an overall [[Idealization and devaluation|idealization]] of the Antebellum era American South in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gawker.com/the-southern-belle-is-a-racist-fiction-1647358414|title=The 'Southern Belle' is a Racist Fiction|last=Biddle|first=Sam|date=October 17, 2014|website=Gawker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/removing-the-southern-belle-from-her-inglorious-perch/2015/08/14/ea929b2a-3f96-11e5-9561-4b3dc93e3b9a_story.html|title=Remove the Southern belle from her inglorious perch|last=Boyd|first=Elizabeth|date=August 21, 2015|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] figured strongly into the &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Plantations in the American South|region's economy]] during the [[Plantation era#Plantation era social structure|plantation era]]. In turn, the image of the idyllic Southern plantation is considered by many to be insensitive to the plight of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://southinpopculture.com/2014/10/15/the-ongoing-allure-of-the-antebellum-south/|title=The Ongoing Allure of the Antebellum South|last=Cox|first=Karen L.|date=|website=Pop South|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied. Its objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time referred to by the datum is a very different thing from the conterminous of the past and future which philosophy denotes by the name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a part of the past‚Äîa recent past‚Äîdelusively given as being a time that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named the specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the past, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time measured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively to human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past, the specious present, the real present, and the future. Omitting the specious present, it consists of three ... nonentities‚Äîthe past, which does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their conterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to us in the fiction of the specious present.&lt;ref name="JamesW" /&gt;}}

The concept was further developed by [[philosopher]] [[William James]].&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  James defined the specious present to be "the prototype of all conceived times... the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible". [[C. D. Broad]] in "Scientific Thought" (1930) further elaborated on the concept of the specious present, and considered that the Specious Present may be considered as the temporal equivalent of a sensory datum.

Finally, the claim of what precisely is being affirmed, in affirming the 'existence' of the specious present, is difficult to clarify. Philosophical theories of time do not usually interpret time to be in any unique way a production of human phenomenology, and the claim that we have some faculty by which we are aware of successive states of consciousness is trivially true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience|title=The Experience and Perception of Time|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">'''Sturgeon's revelation''' (as originally expounded by [[Theodore Sturgeon]]), commonly referred to as '''Sturgeon's law''', is an [[adage]] commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American [[science fiction author]] and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of [[artistic work|works]] in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

== History ==
A similar adage appears in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Light that Failed]]'', published in 1890. "Four-fifths of everybody's work must be bad. But the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Writings in Prose and Verse of Rudyard Kipling|author=Rudyard, K.|isbn=9785874724696|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kRELAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written reference to the adage appears in the March 1958 issue of ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'', where Sturgeon wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. is crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.&lt;ref name="venture" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Philip Klass ([[William Tenn]]), Sturgeon made this remark circa 1951, at a talk at [[New York University]] attended by Tenn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |title=&amp;#39;SF Citations for OED&amp;#39; |publisher=Jessesword.com |date=6 July 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310213832/http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was subsequently included in a talk Sturgeon gave at a 1953 [[Labor Day]] weekend  session of the [[World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/misc/slaw.html|title=James Gunn, 'Addendum: Sturgeon's Law' |publisher=Physics.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] championed Sturgeon's law as one of his seven tools for critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/05/philosopher_daniel_dennett_presents_seven_tools_for_critical_thinking.html |title=Daniel Dennett Presents Seven Tools For Critical Thinking&amp;#39; |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "90% of everything is crap.  That is true, whether you are talking about physics, chemistry, evolutionary psychology, sociology, medicine‚Äîyou name it‚Äîrock music, country western.  90% of everything is crap."  Its re-introduction to a modern audience received a positive reception, according to Dennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_tools_for_thinking/ |title=Point of Inquiry | quote=Audio segment starting at minute 39|date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original Sturgeon's law ==
Sturgeon had originally deemed Sturgeon's law to mean that "nothing is always absolutely so" in the story "The Claustrophile" in a 1956 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Claustrophile", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' August 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The second adage, variously rendered as "ninety percent of everything is crud" or "ninety percent of everything is crap", was originally known as "Sturgeon's Revelation", formulated as such in his book review column for ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]''&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'' 49, September 1957&lt;/ref&gt; in 1957. However, almost all modern uses of the term Sturgeon's law actually refer to the second, including the definition listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

The subjectile is a kind of ground used in artistic painting.  The word has also been used by [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] commented its use.&lt;ref name="Art of A"&gt;Derrida J., and  Th√©venin, P., ''The Secret Art of Antonin Artaud'', Caws, Mary Ann, The MIT Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subjectile is seen as a theory, not a fact; as a theory the subjectile is a tool that can be employed to analyse art objects to generate hypotheses concerning the relationship between subject and object in art.

Derrida mentions that the word 'subjectile' appears in an essay&lt;ref&gt; ''L‚Äôamour de L‚Äôart'' 2, no.8, Aout 1921&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Pierre Bonnard]], published in 1921.  The subjectile refers to Bonnard‚Äôs use of cardboard for painting.
The [http://www.collinslanguage.com/bilingual-dictionaries/french Concise French dictionary] translates 'subjectile' as 'Art: support (beneath paint, etc.)'. Without a support and ground the subject of a painting could not exist as it would fall away. Derrida argues that Artaud's subjectile is both ground and a support. It is stretched out, extended, beyond, through and behind the subject, it is not alien to the subject, yet ‚ÄòIt has two situations‚Äô. Derrida holds that the subjectile functions as a hypothesis, and is a subjectile itself. ‚ÄòSubjectile, the word or the thing, can take the place of the subject or of the object ‚Äì being neither one nor the other.‚Äô&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt;

[[Antonin Artaud]] mentions the subjectile three times in his writing.[[Jacques Derrida]], in his essay, ''To Unsense the Subjectile''  states ‚ÄòAll three times, he is speaking of his own drawings, in 1932, 1946, and 1947‚Äô.&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt; The first time Artaud used the word was in a letter to Andr√© Rolland de Ren√©ville, ‚ÄòHerewith a bad drawing in which what is called the subjectile betrayed me.‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;See: The original text, published in French, Artaud, Antonin, ''Oeuvres Completes'', [http://www.gallimard.fr/catalog/html/actu/index/index_artaud.html Gallimard] 1964 volume V, pp. 119 - 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, ‚ÄòThis drawing is grave attempt to give life and existence to what until today had never been accepted in art, the botching of the subjectile, the piteous awkwardness of forms crumbling around an idea after having for so many eternities labored to join it. The page is soiled and spoiled, the paper crumpled, the people drawn with the consciousness of a child.‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;See: The original text, published in French, Artaud, Antonin, ''Oeuvres Completes'', Gallimard 1984 volume XIX, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally in February 1947, ‚ÄòThe figures on the inert page said nothing under my hand. They offered themselves to me like millstones which would not inspire the drawing, and which I could cut. Scrap, file, sew, unsew, slash, and stitch without the subjectile ever complaining through father or through mother.‚Äô&lt;ref&gt;See: Paule Thevenin records the source as ‚ÄòText of February 1947, written by Artaud at Ville-√âvrard. Thevenin, Paule, Derrida, Jacques, ''Antonin Artaud, Dessins et Portraits'' Gallimard, 1986. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Derrida's essay was first published in French titled ''Forcener le Subjectile'' in 1986 by Gallimard and an abridged  English translation &lt;ref&gt; Jacques Derrida and Mary Ann Caws, ''Maddening the Subjectile'', Yale French Studies, No. 84, Boundaries: Writing &amp; Drawing (1994), pp. 154-171 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2930185 Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt; was  published later (in 1998 by MIT press). For copyright reasons the images published in the Gallimard book were excluded from the later English translation, which contains instead photographs of Artaud taken by Georges Pastier in 1947, the year before Artaud died.&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt;

The subjectile is also commented on by [[Susan Sontag]] in her introduction to the edited translation of Artaud's works.&lt;ref&gt;Artaud, A. 1988 [http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520064430 Selected Writings], (ed.) Susan Sontag, Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and further in ''The Antonin Artaud Critical Reader'', which includes texts by [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12271">'''SvƒÅtantrya''' (from the [[Sanskrit]] ''sva'' meaning ''self'' and ''tantram'' meaning ''dependence''&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 'self-dependency', or '[[free will]]') is the [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivite]] concept of divine sovereignty. ''SvƒÅtantrya'' is described as an energy that emanates from the Supreme (''Parama≈õiva''),&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; a wave of motion inside consciousness (''spanda'') that acts as the fundament of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; or in another view, the original word ([[logos]], pƒÅrƒÅvak).&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 16"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; It does not use any external instrument&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijna Philosophy&amp;nbsp;‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; as it itself is the first stage of creation.

In antithesis with the [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] concept of [[Brahman]], which is a mere conscious witness without effective power, being inflicted by the illusory power (or ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' of the Brahman), in the Kashmiri Shaivite viewpoint creation is actively willed into existence by the supreme consciousness (''[[≈öiva]]'') by the means of his irresistible will-force (''SvƒÅtantrya'').&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; This is an important aspect of the [[Pratyabhijna]] school of ''Kashmir Shaivism''.

''SvƒÅtantrya'' is a concept that goes to the root of many spiritual matters in Kashmir Shaivism,&lt;ref&gt;The Mirror of Self-Supremacy or Svatantrya-Darpana&amp;nbsp;‚Äì B.N. Pandit, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; like, the divine sovereignty of ''≈öiva'' (God),&lt;ref&gt;History of Kashmir Saivism&amp;nbsp;‚Äì B.N. Pandit, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; consciousness (''caitanya''), creative power (''vimar≈õa''), [[mantra|mantric efficiency]] and ''[[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]]''.

==Divine sovereignty==
In its acception of divine sovereignty, ''svƒÅtantrya'' is described as an absolute power of action, or, absolute power of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Saivism of Kashmir&amp;nbsp;‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; This power arises from the mirror-like ability of the supreme consciousness (''caitanya'') to contain images (''vimar≈õa'')&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Triadic mysticism&amp;nbsp;‚Äì P.E. Murphy, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;‚Äì the whole universe being a mere image shining inside this unique god-consciousness.

''SvƒÅtantrya'' has a number of traditional attributes such as: perfect fullness (of the energy of will),&lt;ref name="Vac&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Andre Padoux, p. 247"&gt;Vac&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Andre Padoux, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; self-sufficiency,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; autodetermination,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; the power of doing and undoing&amp;nbsp;‚Äì essence of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; supreme creativity,&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; sovereignty,&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; source of knowledge (''j√±ƒÅna'') and action (''kriyƒÅ'')&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; and being beyond contradictions:&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 122"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; it exists beyond laws of any kind and is the source of all laws in the universe.

==Supreme creative energy==
The Kashmir Shaivism theory of creation affirms that the world was willed into existence by the sovereign force of ''≈öiva''. Thus, the world has no external causes outside ''≈öiva's SvƒÅtantrya''.&lt;ref&gt;Towards Transcendence&amp;nbsp;‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijna Philosophy&amp;nbsp;‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This power creates multiplicity (''mƒÅyƒÅ'') from the original unity of the absolute,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 17"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;‚Äì B. Marjanovic, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, it exists inside and beyond ''mƒÅyƒÅ''.&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; It is the seed of the universe,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; the matrix (''mƒÅtrkƒÅ'') of generative phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; the ultimate creative force.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanzas on Vibration&amp;nbsp;‚Äì M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to consciousness==
Disclaimer: on this topic there is a certain amount of melding and unification of the seemingly distinct concepts of will, freedom, consciousness, speech and bliss in the speciality texts. This is due to the insufficient ability of common language to describe the mystical states of consciousness.

The ''prakƒÅ≈õa-vimar≈õa'' theory affirms the world is based on two principles: the self shining conscious light (''[[Prakasa|prakƒÅ≈õa]]'')  and its ability to contain a reflection of itself and of the creation (''vimar≈õa'').&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Divine Recognition&amp;nbsp;‚Äì K.C. Pandey, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Lakshmanjoo p. 110"&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  To reflect itself is to know absolute bliss (''ƒÅnanda'')&amp;nbsp;‚Äì thus, free will (''svƒÅtantrya''), conscious reflection (''vimar≈õa'') and bliss (''ƒÅnanda'') are three concepts describing the same reality.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vac - Andre Padoux, p. 247"&gt;Vac - Andre Padoux, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Bliss (''ƒÅnanda'') is the internal state of consciousness, its natural state. The same is true of svƒÅtantrya: it too is a fundamental quality of the subject.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 122"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Towards Transcendence&amp;nbsp;‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

SvƒÅtantrya is the first stage of creation, an undifferentiated energy, or, looking from bottom up, we could also say that it is the force that unifies all the energies of creation&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The first creation of ''svƒÅtantrya'' is the energy of will (''icchƒÅ ≈õakti''). Then come the energies of knowledge (''j√±ƒÅna ≈õakti'') and action (''kriyƒÅ ≈õakti'') and together with the energy of consciousness (''cit ≈õakti'') and the energy of bliss (''ƒÅnanda ≈õakti'') they form the supreme pentad of creation, the so-called "pure creation".&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Everything related to consciousness is also related to ''svƒÅtantrya''. Speech is seen in Kashmir Shaivism as differentiated in four classes : external (''vaikharƒ´''), mental (''madhyamƒÅ''), subtle (''pa≈õyanti'') and supreme (''parƒÅ''). ''SvƒÅtantrya'' is equated to ''pƒÅrƒÅvak'', the creative [[logos]] / ''logos spermatikos''.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 16"/&gt;

==In relation to mystical practices==
In the mystical practices of Kashmir Shaivism, ''svƒÅtantrya'' is both the sovereign will of ''≈öiva'', solely deciding the descent of divine grace (''[[≈õaktipƒÅt]]'') and the will of the adept as he becomes more and more submerged into the divine.

According to Kashmir Shaivism, spiritual realization is more than a state of illumination (defined as ''pure witness'', ''non-dual consciousness'' or ''atma-vyapti'').&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Full spiritual realization means to know bliss (''ƒÅnanda'') and to control the energies (''≈õakti'') and the mantras&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; (or, the so-called ''≈õiva-vyƒÅpti''). The root of spiritual efficiency is ''svƒÅtantrya'', the operative, dynamic aspect of the absolute.

An adept who reaches spiritual illumination needs to learn how to stabilize his experience. The Kashmir Shaivism scriptures declare that stability is based on the assimilation of the energy of ''svƒÅtantrya''.&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 149"&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the incipient practitioner aims for the experience of the nondual consciousness, the advanced ones focus on the assimilation of all the energies into non-duality. ''SvƒÅtantrya'' being the root of all energies, it becomes automatically the final step of the spiritual practice.&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 149"/&gt;

The will of such an advanced practitioner becomes more and more efficient as it identifies with the will of ''≈öiva''. Yet, his actions are necessarily without base in egoism (without the attributes of good or bad)&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;‚Äì and this is an attitude that defines the discipline of [[karma yoga]].

All the spiritual paths (''upƒÅyas''): that of ≈öiva (''≈õƒÅmbhavopƒÅya''), that of ≈öakti (''≈õƒÅktopƒÅya'') and that of the man (''ƒÅ·πáavopƒÅya'') are subsumed under the umbrella of ''svƒÅtantrya'' as it is the sole mediator of divine grace.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The adept who has attained ''svƒÅtantrya'' is beyond the need for formal meditation&amp;nbsp;‚Äì that is&amp;nbsp;‚Äì for him to meditate or to act in everyday life is identical&amp;nbsp;‚Äì he does all his actions from a state of perfect unity with ''≈öiva'' from now on. This is the culmination of the Kashmiri Shaivite spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Such an adept does not exert himself in maintaining this state of consciousness because it is his own nature. From his point of view, everything is made of just forms of consciousness, his own consciousness, also identified with the consciousness of ''≈öiva'' at this stage. The energy he possesses is the risen form of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]].&lt;ref&gt;The Aphorisms of Siva&amp;nbsp;‚Äì M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; His mantras have spiritual efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;The Aphorisms of Siva&amp;nbsp;‚Äì M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; His heart (''h·πõdaya'') is the receptacle of all objects.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;‚Äì B. Marjanovic, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmir Shaivism doctrine affirms that nothing can compel ''≈öiva'' to bestow the final spiritual realization&amp;nbsp;‚Äì it is solely based on the unconditioned ''svƒÅtantrya'', or, from the opposite perspective, there is no obstacle that can separate the disciple from becoming one with ''≈öiva'' because he has ''svƒÅtantrya'' which is the ultimate power that cannot be impeded by anything.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kashmir Shaivism there is this paradoxical concept that nothing needs to be done, as the supreme realization can appear without effort, but also, no matter what effort one undergoes, he cannot compel ''≈öiva'' to liberate his self (''ƒÅtman'').&lt;ref&gt;The Himalayan mysticism&amp;nbsp;‚Äì [[R. Nataraj]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this is not an invitation to abandon hard work but a justification for humility.

In a meditation prescribed in [[Vijnana Bhairava|Vij√±ana Bhairava Tantra]], one is supposed to unite his vital energy (''[[prana|prƒÅ·πáa]]'') with ''svƒÅtantrya'' in the mystical force center that exists 12 finger widths above the head, ''dvada≈õƒÅnta''.&lt;ref&gt;Vijnana Bhairava&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshman Joo, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
''SvƒÅtantrya'' has a number of synonyms such as: ''mahe≈õvaraya'' (from mahe≈õvara which means supreme lord),&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 17"/&gt; or ''ai≈õvarya'' (similarly, from the word I≈õvara which also means Lord).&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;‚Äì J. Singh, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; It has been personalized as the Goddess (''[[Devi]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; the virginal feminine deity ''[[Parvati|Uma]]'' (virginity being a symbol of existence outside the reach of the profane world)&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and the playful goddess ''KumƒÅrƒ´''.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Other scriptures also refer to ''svƒÅtantrya'' as the ''Glory of Siva''&lt;ref name="Swami Lakshmanjoo p. 110"/&gt; on account of it being identical to the 'ocean' of uncreated light (''prakƒÅ≈õa'') and cosmic bliss (''ƒÅnanda'')&amp;nbsp;‚Äì ''cidƒÅnanda-Ghana''.

The '''Szarvas inscription''' refers to the inscription on a bone [[needlecase|needle case]] found near [[Szarvas]] in southeastern [[Hungary]] and dating from the second half of the 8th century, the "[[Late Avar]]" period (700-791).&lt;ref&gt;[[Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas|R√≥na-Tas, Andr√°s]] (1996): A honfoglal√≥ magyar n√©p [The landtaking Hungarian nation].

==The name of the script of the Szarvas inscription==
[[File:Carphatian_Basin_Rovas_alphabet_on_coin_1996.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Picture of the bone needle case of Szarvas with Carpathian Basin Rovas alphabet on a coin issued around 1996.]]
The Hungarian archeologist, historian and linguist [[G√°bor V√©kony]] named the script used on the needle case  as ''"K√°rp√°t-medencei rov√°s√≠r√°s"'' ("Carpathian Basin Rovas script").&lt;ref&gt;V√©kony G√°bor (2004): A sz√©kely √≠r√°s eml√©kei, kapcsolatai, t√∂rt√©nete. Budapest: Nap Kiad√≥. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 203, first line of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Hossz√∫: [http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4006.pdf Proposal for encoding the Carpathian Basin Rovas script in the SMP of the UCS]. National Body Contribution for consideration by UTC and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2, January 21, 2011, revised: May 19, 2011, Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set. ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N4006&lt;/ref&gt; He often used this term in his  book, ''A sz√©kely √≠r√°s eml√©kei, kapcsolatai, t√∂rt√©nete'', e.g. in the chapter ''"A k√°rp√°t-medencei rov√°s√°b√©c√© korabeli feljegyz√©se"'' ("The contemporary record of the Carpathian Basin Rovas alphabet").

V√©kony analysed the similarities and the differences between the Old Hungarian and the Carpathian Basin scripts on page 154 of his book.&lt;ref&gt;V√©kony G√°bor (2004): A sz√©kely √≠r√°s eml√©kei, kapcsolatai, t√∂rt√©nete. Budapest: Nap Kiad√≥. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 154, first row of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; On page 232, V√©kony wrote: ''"- Aethicus Ister jelei azonosak az egykori K√°rp√°t-medencei rov√°s√≠r√°s jeleivel."'' ("The symbols of Aethicus Ister are identical to the symbols of the quondam Carpathian Basin script").&lt;ref&gt;V√©kony G√°bor (2004): A sz√©kely √≠r√°s eml√©kei, kapcsolatai, t√∂rt√©nete. Budapest: Nap Kiad√≥. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 232, eighth and ninth rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

V√©kony also writes : ''"E jel a Szarvason azonos√≠tott K√°rp√°t-medencei '''f''' alig torzult megfelel≈ëje..."'' ("This symbol is identical to the Carpathian Basin 'f' identified in Szarvas". (referring to the bone needle case found in Szarvas)&lt;ref&gt;V√©kony G√°bor (2004): A sz√©kely √≠r√°s eml√©kei, kapcsolatai, t√∂rt√©nete. Budapest: Nap Kiad√≥. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 235, second and third rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

In page 233, V√©kony writes: ''"Erre utalhat az is, hogy ez a bet≈±alak levezethet≈ë egy p√°rthus alep form√°b√≥l. Feltehet≈ë teh√°t ennek a jelnek a megl√©te a K√°rp√°t-medencei rov√°s√≠r√°sban is (a sz√©kelybe is innen sz√°rmazhatott)."'' ("This could imply also that this glyph can be derived from the Parthian Aleph form. Consequently, the existence of this symbol can be supposed in the Carpathian Basin script as well (it could originate from this to the Sz√©kely)."&lt;ref&gt;V√©kony G√°bor (2004): A sz√©kely √≠r√°s eml√©kei, kapcsolatai, t√∂rt√©nete. Budapest: Nap Kiad√≥. {{ISBN|963-9402-45-1}}, page 233, last six rows in the first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; Here the 'Szekely' refers to the ''Szekely-Hungarian Rovas'' script also known as [[Old Hungarian script]]. V√©kony's writing suggests a proposal that a Carpathian Basin Rovas script may be one of the ancestors of the Szekely-Hungarian Rovas script.

==Critics and alternative theories==
V√©kony had read the Szarvas transcription as Hungarian, thus proposing it as evidence that the Hungarian-speaking people had appeared in the region by the 7th century. There are several critics of V√©kony's theories and translations, most notably the Hungarian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and historian, [[Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas]]. The debates were summarized by Istv√°n Riba in 1999 and 2000: "many find themselves unable to accept V√©kony's theory".&lt;ref&gt;Riba,Istv√°n: J√∂ttek, honfoglaltak, f√∫jtak. R√©g√©szvita egy rov√°s√≠r√°sr√≥l [Came, settled, blown. Archaeological debate about the runic writing]. In: Heti Vil√°ggazdas√°g [Weekly Word's Economy], Vol. 21. 1999. N. 46. pp. 101-102, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riba, Istv√°n (2000). [http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no157/080.shtml "Reading the Runes: Evidence of the Dual Conquest?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316014918/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no157/080.shtml |date=16 March 2012 }}. ''The Hungarian Quarterly''. Vol. XLI. No. 157, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The key point of the critics has been that in traditional Hungarian scholarship, the existence of the Hungarian-speaking population dates from 896 (when the [[Magyars]] took over the [[History of Hungary#Middle Ages .28895.E2.80.931526.29|Carpathian Basin]] ), while the Szarvas needle case dates from the 8th century. Consequently, either the Szarvas inscription is not in Hungarian or Hungarians were in the Carpathian Basin much earlier than the late 9th century. R√≥na-Tas attempted to read the Szarvas relic in Turkic instead of Hungarian, but wrote that his transcription needed further improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas|R√≥na-Tas, Andr√°s]] (1996): A honfoglal√≥ magyar n√©p [The landtaking Hungarian nation]. Bevezet√©s a korai Magyar t√∂rt√©nelem ismeret√©be [Introduction to the knowledge of the early Hungarian history]. Budapest: Balassi Kiad√≥, pp. 108-110&lt;/ref&gt; The issue remains an open question amongst Hungarian scholars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13453">A '''two-line element set''' ('''TLE''') is a [[file format|data format]] encoding a list of [[orbital elements]] of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the ''epoch''. Using suitable prediction formula, the [[Orbital_state_vectors|state]] (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy. The TLE data representation is specific to the [[simplified perturbations models]] (SGP, [[SGP4]], [[SDP4]], SGP8 and SDP8), so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the SGP models to correctly compute the state at a time of interest. TLEs can describe the trajectories only of Earth-orbiting objects. TLEs are widely used as input for projecting the future orbital tracks of [[space debris]] for purposes of characterizing "future debris events to support [[risk analysis]], close approach analysis, [[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|collision avoidance]] maneuvering" and [[forensic analysis]].&lt;ref name=aiaa2008&gt;

The format was originally intended for [[punch card]]s, encoding a set of elements on two standard 80-column cards. This format was eventually replaced by [[text file]]s with each set of elements written to two 70-column [[ASCII]] lines. The [[United States Air Force]] tracks all detectable objects in Earth orbit, creating a corresponding TLE for each object, and makes available TLEs for non-classified objects on the website Space Track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space-track.org/|title=Introduction and sign in to Space-Track.Org|publisher=Space-track.org|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celestrak.com/|title=Celestrak homepage|publisher=Celestrak.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TLE format is a ''de facto'' standard for distribution of an Earth-orbiting object's orbital elements.

A TLE set may include a title line preceding the element data, so each listing may take up three lines in the file. The title is not required, as each data line includes a unique object identifier code.

==History==
The two-line format traces its history to seminal work by Max Lane in the early 1960s to develop mathematical models for predicting the locations of satellites based on a minimal set of data elements. His first paper on the topic, published in 1965, introduced the Analytical Drag Theory, which concerned itself primarily with the effects of drag caused by a spherically-symmetric non-rotating atmosphere.&lt;ref name=revisit&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Vallado |first2=Paul |last2=Crawford |first3=Richard |last3=Hujsak |first4=T.S. |last4=Kelso |title=Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3 |url=http://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/AIAA-2006-6753.pdf |journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joined by K. Cranford, the two published a greatly improved model in 1969 that added various harmonic effects due to Earth-Moon-Sun interactions and various other inputs.&lt;ref name=improved&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Max |last1=Lane |first2=Kenneth |last2=Cranford |journal=AIAA |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/improved-analytical-drag-theory-for-the-artificial-satellite-problem/oclc/122930989 |title=An improved analytical drag theory for the artificial satellite problem |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane's models were widely used by the military and NASA starting in the late 1960s. The improved version became the standard model for [[NORAD]] in the early 1970s, which ultimately led to the creation of the TLE format. At the time there were two formats designed for [[punch card]]s, an "internal format" that used three cards encoding complete details for the satellite (including name and other data), and the two card "transmission format" that listed only those elements that were subject to change.&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/ADCOM%20DO%20Form%2012.pdf |title=ADCOM Form 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter saved on cards and produced smaller decks when updating the databases.

Cranford continued to work on the modelling, eventually leading Lane to publish ''Spacetrack Report #2'' detailing the Air Force General Perturbation theory, or AFGP4. The paper also described two simplified versions of the system, IGP4 which used a simplified drag model, and SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) which used IGP4's drag model along with a simplified gravity model.&lt;ref name=spacetrack2&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=Max |last=Lane |first2=Felix |last2=Hoots |title=General Perturbations Theories Derived from the 1965 Lane Drag Theory |publisher=Project Space Track, Aerospace Defense Command |date=December 1979 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a081264.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the three models were slight for most objects. One year later, ''Spacetrack Report #3'' was released, included full [[FORTRAN]] source code for the SGP4 model.&lt;ref name=spacetrack3&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=Felix |last1=Hoots |first2=Ronald |last2=Roehrich |url=https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf |title=Models for Propagation of NORAD Element Sets |publisher=Project Space Track, Aerospace Defense Command |date=December 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quickly became the ''de facto'' standard model, both in the industry as well as the astronomy field.

Shortly after the publication of ''Report #3'', NASA began posting elements for a variety of visible and other well known objects in their periodic ''NASA Prediction Bulletins'', which consisted of the transmission format data in printed form. After trying for some time to convince NASA to release these in electronic form, T.S. Kelso took matters into his own hands and began manually copying the listings into text files which he distributed through his [https://celestrak.com CelesTrak] [[bulletin board system]]. This revealed a problem in NASA's [[checksum]] system, which traced back to the lack of the plus character (+) on the [[teletype]] machines used at NASA, which ultimately turned out to be a problem from the punch card era that occurred when NORAD updated from the BCD to [[EBCDIC]] [[character set]] on the computer sending out the updates. This problem went away when Kelso began to receive data directly from NORAD in 1989.&lt;ref name=controversy&gt;{{cite web |first=Ted |last=Kelso |title=Two-Line Element Set Checksum Controversy |url=http://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/checksum.asp |website=CelesTrak |date=January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGP4 model was later extended with corrections for deep space objects, creating SDP4, which used the same TLE input data. Over the years a number of more advanced prediction models have been created, but these have not seen widespread use. This is due to the TLE not containing the additional information needed by some of these formats, which makes it difficult to find the elements needed to take advantages of the improved model. More subtly, the TLE data is massaged in a fashion to improve the results when used with the SGP series models, which may cause the predictions of other models to be less accurate than SGP when used with common TLEs. The only new model to see widespread use is SGP8/SDP8, which were designed to use the same data inputs and are relatively minor corrections to the SGP4 model.

==Format==
Originally there were two data formats used with the SGP models, one containing complete details on the object known as the "internal format", and a second known as the "transmission format" that was used to provide updates to that data.

The internal format used three 80-column punch cards. Each card started with a card number, 1, 2 or 3, and ended with the letter "G". For this reason, the system was often known as the "G-card format". In addition to the orbital elements, the G-card included various flags like the launching country and orbit type (geostationary, etc.), calculated values like the [[perigee]] altitude and visual magnitude, and a 38-character comments field.

The transmission format is essentially a cut-down version of the G-card format, removing any data that is not subject to change on a regular basis, or data that can be calculated using other values. For instance, the perigee altitude from the G-card is not included as this can be calculated from the other elements. What remains is the set of data needed to update the original G-card data as additional measurements are made. The data is fit into 70 columns and does not include a trailing character. TLEs are simply the transmission format data rendered as ASCII text.

Where decimal points are assumed, they are leading decimal points. The last two symbols in Fields 10 and 11 of the first line give powers of 10 to apply to the preceding decimal. Thus, for example, Field 11 (-11606-4) translates to -0.11606E-4 (‚àí0.11606√ó10&lt;sup&gt;‚àí4&lt;/sup&gt;).

The checksums for each line are calculated by adding all numerical digits on that line, including the line number. One is added to the checksum for each negative sign (‚àí) on that line. All other non-digit characters are ignored.

Historically, the SGP algorithms defines low orbit as an orbit of less-than 225 minutes.

{{Distinguish|class (computer programming)}}

In [[computer science]], a '''type class''' is a [[type system]] construct that supports [[ad hoc polymorphism]]. This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in [[parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic]] types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and a [[type variable]] &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and means that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;.

Type classes first appeared in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell programming language]],&lt;ref&gt;"Type classes, first proposed during the design of the Haskell programming language, ..." ‚Äî[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jmorri14/pubs/morris-dissertation.pdf John Garrett Morris (2013), "Type Classes and Instance Chains: A Relational Approach" ]&lt;/ref&gt; and were originally conceived as a way of implementing [[operator overloading|overloaded arithmetic and equality operators]] in a principled fashion.&lt;ref name="kaes88parametric"&gt;{{cite conference

Since their creation, many other applications of type classes have been discovered.

== Overview ==
The programmer defines a type class by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class. In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
  (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has [[Kind (type theory)|kind]] &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (also known as &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; in the latest [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] release),&lt;ref&gt;[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/Data-Kind.html#t:Type &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt;] from &lt;code&gt;Data.Kind&lt;/code&gt; appeared in version 8 of the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the kind of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; is

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
Eq :: Type -&gt; Constraint
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The declaration may be read as stating a "type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; belongs to type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; if there are functions named &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;(/=)&lt;/code&gt;, of the appropriate types, defined on it." A programmer could then define a function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; (which determines if an element is in a list) in the following way:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
elem :: Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
elem y []     = False
elem y (x:xs) = (x == y) || elem y xs
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; with the context &lt;code&gt;Eq a&lt;/code&gt;, which constrains the types which &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can range over to those &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; which belong to the &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; type class. (''Note'': Haskell &lt;code&gt; =&gt; &lt;/code&gt; can be called a 'class constraint'.)

A programmer can make any type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; a member of a given type class &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; by using an ''instance declaration'' that defines implementations of all of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;'s methods for the particular type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.  For instance, if a programmer defines a new data type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, they may then make this new type an instance of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; by providing an equality function over values of type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; in whatever way they see fit.  Once they have done this, they may use the function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;[t]&lt;/code&gt;, that is, lists of elements of type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that type classes are different from [[Class (computer science)|classes]] in object-oriented programming languages. In particular, &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; is not a type: there is no such thing as a ''value'' of type &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;.

Type classes are closely related to parametric polymorphism. For example, note that the type of &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; as specified above would be the parametrically polymorphic type &lt;code&gt;a -&amp;gt; [a] -&amp;gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; were it not for the type class constraint "&lt;code&gt;Eq a =&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;".

== Higher-kinded polymorphism ==
A type class need not take a type variable of [[Kind (type theory)|kind]] &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; but can take one of any kind. These type classes with higher kinds are sometimes called constructor classes (the constructors referred to are type constructors such as &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, rather than data constructors such as &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;). An example is the [[monad (functional programming)|&lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt;]] class:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
class Monad m where
  return :: a -&gt; m a
  (&gt;&gt;=)  :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The fact that m is applied to a type variable indicates that it has kind &lt;code&gt;Type -&gt; Type&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. it takes a type and returns a type, the kind of &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; is thus:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
Monad :: (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Multi-parameter type classes ==
Type classes permit multiple type parameters, and so type classes can be seen as relations on types.&lt;ref&gt;[[Haskell']] page ''[http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/MultiParamTypeClasses MultiParamTypeClasses]''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] standard library, the class &lt;code&gt;IArray&lt;/code&gt; expresses a general immutable array interface. In this class, the type class constraint &lt;code&gt;IArray a e&lt;/code&gt; means that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an array type that contains elements of type &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;. (This restriction on polymorphism is used to implement [[Object type (object-oriented programming)#Unboxing|unboxed]] array types, for example.)

Like [[multimethod]]s{{Citation needed|reason=Multimethod like lisp's one are evaluated at runtime, and haskell check types at compile time. Also, there is a thread on haskell mailing list (http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2007-August/030097.html) which seams to show that implementing static multimethod needs universal types.|date=June 2013}}, multi-parameter type classes support calling different implementations of a method depending on the types of multiple arguments, and indeed return types. &lt;!--They are more efficient than multimethods{{Citation needed|reason=This is a bold claim of specific implementations made without evidence. A multimethod implementation could cache the method implementation in much the same way as the proposed "method to call is stored in a dictionary" and avoid a search. It might also be using tracing JIT compilation to achieve even greater efficiency, though this technique could of course also apply to a type class. At best, any performance advantage here seems dependent on particular implementations, rather than being fundamental to the approach, and thus not particularly noteworthy. Type classes are an excellent concept ‚Äì they have no need for inflated claims to justify them.|date=January 2017}} because they do not involve--&gt; Multi-parameter type classes do not require searching for the method to call on every call at runtime;&lt;ref&gt;In GHC, the C Core uses Girard &amp; Reynold's System F type signatures to identify a typed case for processing in the optimization phases. -- Simon Peyton-Jones "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_VzYxvbxg Into the Core - Squeezing Haskell into Nine Constructors"] Erlang User Conference, Sep 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|minute 25:12}} rather the method to call is first compiled and stored in the dictionary of the type class instance, just as with single-parameter type classes.

Haskell code that uses multi-parameter type classes is not portable, as this feature is not part of the Haskell 98 standard.&lt;!-- outdated sentence, as Haskell 98 is not the most recent standard. --&gt; The popular Haskell implementations, GHC and [[Hugs]], support multi-parameter type classes.

== Functional dependencies ==
In Haskell, type classes have been refined to allow the programmer to declare functional dependencies between type parameters&amp;mdash;a concept [[functional dependency|inspired from relational database theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jones. ''[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/fundeps.html Type Classes with Functional Dependencies]''. From Proc. 9th European Symposium on Programming. March, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Haskell']] page ''[http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/FunctionalDependencies FunctionalDependencies]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the programmer can assert that a given assignment of some subset of the type parameters uniquely determines the remaining type parameters. For example, general [[Monads in functional programming|monads]] &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; which carry a state parameter of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; satisfy the type class constraint &lt;code&gt;MonadState s m&lt;/code&gt;. In this constraint, there is a functional dependency &lt;code&gt;m -&gt; s&lt;/code&gt;. This means that for a given monad, the state type accessible from this interface is uniquely determined. This aids the compiler in [[type inference]], as well as aiding the programmer in [[type-directed programming]].

[[Simon Peyton-Jones]] has objected to the introduction of functional dependencies in Haskell on grounds of complexity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/2006-February/000289.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type classes and implicit parameters ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}

Type classes and implicit parameters are very similar in nature, although not quite the same.  A polymorphic function with a type class constraint such as:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="hs"&gt;sum :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

can be intuitively treated as a function that implicitly accepts an instance of &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="hs"&gt;sum_ :: Num_ a -&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The instance &lt;code&gt;Num_ a&lt;/code&gt; is essentially a record that contains the instance definition of &lt;code&gt;Num a&lt;/code&gt;.  (This is in fact how type classes are implemented under the hood by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.)

However, there is a crucial difference: implicit parameters are more ''flexible'' ‚Äì you can pass different instances of &lt;code&gt;Num Int&lt;/code&gt;.  In contrast, type classes enforce the so-called ''coherence'' property, which requires that there should only be one unique choice of instance for any given type.  The coherence property makes type classes somewhat antimodular, which is why orphan instances (instances that are defined in a module that neither contains the class nor the type of interest) are strongly discouraged.  On the other hand, coherence adds an additional level of safety to the language, providing the programmer a guarantee that two disjoint parts of the same code will share the same instance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIZxTQP1ifo Edward Kmett, ''Type Classes vs. the World'', Boston Haskell Meetup.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, an ordered [[set (abstract data type)|set]] (of type &lt;code&gt;Set a&lt;/code&gt;) requires a [[total order]]ing on the elements (of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;) in order to function.  This can be evidenced by a constraint &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt;, which defines a comparison operator on the elements.  However, there can be numerous ways to impose a total order.  Since set algorithms are generally intolerant of changes in the ordering once a set has been constructed, passing an incompatible instance of &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt; to functions that operate on the set may lead to incorrect results (or crashes).  Thus, enforcing coherence of &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt; in this particular scenario is crucial.

Instances (or "dictionaries") in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] type classes are just ordinary values in the language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity.&lt;ref name="scala-typeclasses"&gt;{{cite conference
 | first = Bruno 
 | last = Oliveira
 |author2=Adriaan Moors |author3=Martin Odersky
  | url = http://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~bruno/papers/TypeClasses.pdf

As a result, Scala type classes do not satisfy the coherence property and are effectively a syntactic sugar for implicit parameters.

This is an example taken from the Cats &lt;ref&gt;[http://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html typelevel.org, Scala Cats]&lt;/ref&gt; documentation:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="scala"&gt;
// A type class to provide textual representation
trait Show[A] {
  def show(f: A): String
}

// A polymorphic function that works only when there is an implicit 
// instance of Show[A] available
def log[A](a: A)(implicit s: Show[A]) = println(s.show(a))

// An instance for String
implicit val stringShow = new Show[String] {
  def show(s: String) = s
}

// The parameter stringShow was inserted by the compiler.
scala&gt; log("a string")
a string

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[Coq]] (version 8.2 onwards) also supports type classes by inferring the appropriate instances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt/TypeClassesTut/typeclassestut.pdf A Gentle Introduction to Type Classes and Relations in Coq]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent versions of [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]] 2 also provide a similar feature, called "instance arguments".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=ReferenceManual.ModellingTypeClassesWithInstanceArguments Modelling Type Classes With Instance Arguments]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other approaches to operator overloading ==
In [[Standard ML]], the mechanism of "equality types" corresponds roughly to Haskell's built-in type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;, but all equality operators are derived automatically by the compiler.  The programmer's control of the process is limited to designating which type components in a structure are equality types and which type variables in a polymorphic type range over equality types.

SML's and [[OCaml]]'s modules and functors can play a role similar to that of Haskell's type classes, the principal difference being the role of type inference, which makes type classes suitable for ''ad hoc'' polymorphism.&lt;ref name="dreyer06modular"&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Derek
 | last = Dreyer |author2=Robert Harper |author3=Manuel M.T. Chakravarty
 | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/751836.html
 | title = Modular Type Classes
 | booktitle = Technical Report TR-2006-03
 | date = April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The object oriented subset of [[OCaml]] is yet another approach which is somewhat comparable to the one of type classes.

== Related notions ==
An analogous notion for overloaded data (implemented in [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]]) is that of [[type family]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Type_families&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] supports [[trait (computer programming)|traits]], which are a limited form of type classes with coherence.&lt;ref&gt;https://aturon.github.io/blog/2017/02/06/specialization-and-coherence/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]] has typeclasses, although they are not exactly the same as in Haskell. {{Explain|date=May 2018}}

In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], type classes are a [[programming idiom]] which can be implemented with existing language features such as implicit parameters, not a separate language feature per se. Because of the way they are implemented in Scala, it is possible to explicitly specify which type class instance to use for a type at a particular place in the code, in case of ambiguity. However, this is not necessarily a benefit as ambiguous type class instances can be error-prone.

The proof assistant [[Coq (proof assistant)|Coq]] has also supported type classes in recent versions. Unlike in ordinary programming languages, in Coq, any laws of a type class (such as the monad laws) that are stated within the type class definition, must be mathematically proved of each type class instance before using them.
