'''{{mp|(163132) 2002 CU|11}}''', provisional designation {{mp|2002 CU|11}}, is a bright, sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]].&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt;

== Description ==

{{mp|2002 CU|11}} was discovered on 7 February 2002 by [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19 using a {{convert|1.0|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2002-C44"/&gt; It has an estimated diameter of {{convert|730|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Wayback2002-03"/&gt; The asteroid was listed on [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] with a [[Torino Scale]] rating of 1 on 20 March 2002.&lt;ref name="Wayback2002-03"/&gt;

With an observation arc of 44 days, {{mp|(163132) 2002 CU|11}} showed a 1 in 9,300 chance of [[Impact event|impacting]] Earth in 2049.&lt;ref name="spaceguard"/&gt; It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 26 April 2002.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt; It is now known that on 3 September 2049 the asteroid will be {{convert|0.0843|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;

Even though using an [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] of 27 June 2015 gives {{mp|2002 CU|11}} an Earth-[[Minimum orbit intersection distance|MOID]] of {{convert|0.0000093|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}},&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; the asteroid does not make any threatening approaches to Earth in the foreseeable future.

The '''Additron''' was an electron tube designed by Dr. [[Josef Kates]], circa 1950, to replace the several individual electron tubes and support components required to perform the function of a single bit digital [[full adder]]. Dr. Kates developed the Additron with the intention of increasing the likelihood of success and reliability while reducing the size, power consumption and complexity of the University of Toronto Electronic Computer, ([[UTEC]])&lt;ref&gt;Vardalas JN (2001). ''The Computer Revolution in Canada'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-22064-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Additron neither went into production at the Canadian [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company]], where the prototypes were built, nor was it used in the UTEC machine.  It did make a widely publicized appearance at the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]] operating an electronic game of [[Tic-Tac-Toe]], dubbed ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', to show the marvels of electronic computing.

The tube was registered with the [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association|Radio Television Manufacturing Association ]]&lt;ref&gt;RTMA Engineering Department, Release #951, 20 March 1951&lt;/ref&gt; on 20 March 1951 as type 6047.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/201/6/6047.pdf |publisher=Rogers Majestic Corp.|title= 6047 data sheet, RTMA Engineering Dept.

The '''Atlantic Meridional Transect''' (abbreviated as '''AMT''') is a multi-decadal [[oceanography|oceanographic]] programme that undertakes biological, chemical and physical research during annual voyages between the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and destinations in the South Atlantic. The ongoing AMT programme was begun in 1995 to assess biological processes in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the [[Eddy (fluid_dynamics)#Mesoscale ocean eddies|mesoscale]] through to [[oceanic basin|basin]]-scale. An early activity of the programme was the [[calibration]] of measurements and products produced by the [[SeaWiFS]] (1997-2010) satellite-based sensor for ocean [[chlorophyll]].

The AMT programme is led by [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]], with support from the [[National Oceanography Centre]]. It is currently funded by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC). Since its inception in 1995, the programme has undertaken 26 research cruises with 256 scientists drawn from 22 countries.&lt;ref name="aboutAMT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amt-uk.org/About-AMT |title=About AMT |date=2017 |website= |publisher= |access-date=November 16, 2017 |quote=Since 1995 ... [this] has involved a total of 26 research cruises with 256 scientists from 22 countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMT programme has provided data for more than 300 [[scientific publication|refereed publications]],&lt;ref name="pubsAMT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amt-uk.org/Publications |title=Publications |date=2017 |website= |publisher= |access-date=November 16, 2017 |quote=To date the AMT programme has produced over 300 refereed journal articles, including three special issues of journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 75 [[PhD thesis|PhD theses]].&lt;ref name="aboutAMT"/&gt;

The return cruise track of the AMT programme operates between the UK in the North Atlantic and the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Chile]] or [[South Africa]] in the southern hemisphere, and its total distance can be up to {{convert|13000|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amt-uk.org/Cruises |title=Cruises |date=2017 |website= |publisher= |access-date=November 16, 2017 |quote=... the annual return passage of research ships ... [is] a distance of up to 13,500km}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track crosses a number of [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] provinces, including [[Primary production#Oceanic production|productive]] [[temperate climate|temperate]] and [[Upwelling#Equatorial|equatorial upwelling]] systems, and the [[Oligotroph#Ocean|oligotrophic]] northern and southern Atlantic [[ocean gyre]]s. In sampling this diverse range of [[plankton]]ic [[ecosystem]]s, the cruises of the AMT programme provide a consistent dataset over a broad spatial scale, and play an important role in understanding the oceanic [[carbon cycle]].

The '''Aztec Ruins National Monument''' preserves [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]] structures in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of New Mexico. This [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] is close to both the town of [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]] and the [[Animas River]], and it is about {{convert|12|mi}} northeast of [[Farmington, New Mexico]]. The [[Salmon Ruins]] and Heritage Park, which also has Puebloan structures, is about {{convert|9.5|mi}} south of the monument. The Aztec ruins date from the 11th to the 13th centuries. American settlers in the 19th century named them the "Aztec ruins" based on their erroneous belief that the [[Aztec|Aztec civilization]] built them.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The site was declared "Aztec Ruin National Monument" on January 24, 1923. After a boundary change, "Ruin" was changed to "Ruins" on July 2, 1928.

As a historical property of the [[National Park Service]], the monument was administratively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966. The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] listed the Chaco Culture as a [[World Heritage Site]] on December 8, 1987. That listing specifically included the Aztec ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/353 | title=World Heritage List: Chaco Culture | publisher=[[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] | accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument is on the [[Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway (New Mexico)|Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway]], which is one of New Mexico's [[New Mexico Scenic Byways|Scenic Byways]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ Trail of the Ancients.] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821002106/http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ | date=August 21, 2014}} New Mexico Tourism Department.

The property was part of a 160-acre (65 ha) homestead owned by H.D. Abrams, who supported the ruins preservation. The [[H.D. Abrams House]] in Aztec is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=18eaa6d8-0b0d-42fc-a6db-827703c16d1b|website=NPS.gov|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11613">{{short description|A measure of misalignment between the gradient of pressure and the gradient of density in a fluid}}
{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}
[[Image:Baroclinic fluid.png|thumb|right|300px|Density lines and [[isobar (meteorology)|isobar]]s cross vertically in a baroclinic fluid (top). A surface map where density is related to temperature will also show isobars and [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]]s crossing, but horizontally.]]
In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''baroclinity''' (often called '''baroclinicity''') of a stratified fluid is a measure of how misaligned the gradient of pressure is from the gradient of density in a fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, J., and R.A. Plumb. 2007. Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics. Academic Press,&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Holton|2004|p=77}} In [[meteorology]] a baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure; contrast this with a [[barotropic]] atmosphere, for which the density depends only on the pressure. In atmospheric terms, the barotropic zones of the Earth are generally found in the central latitudes, or [[tropics]], whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid-latitude/polar regions.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Baroclinity is proportional to:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla p \times \nabla \rho&lt;/math&gt;

which is proportional to the sine of the angle between surfaces of constant [[pressure]] and surfaces of constant [[density]].  Thus, in a ''barotropic'' fluid (which is defined by zero baroclinity), these surfaces are parallel.{{sfnp|Gill|1982|p=122|ps=: ″The strict meaning of the term ′barotropic′ is that the pressure is constant on surfaces of constant density...″}}{{sfnp|Tritton|1988|p=179|ps=: ″In general, a barotropic situation is one in which surfaces of constant pressure and surfaces of constant density coincide; a baroclinic situation is one in which they intersect.″}}{{sfnp|Holton|2004|p=74|ps=: ″A barotropic atmosphere is one in which density depends only on the pressure, &lt;math&gt;\rho = \rho(p) &lt;/math&gt;, so that isobaric surfaces are also surfaces of constant density.″}}

Areas of high atmospheric baroclinity are characterized by the frequent formation of [[cyclone]]s.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Baroclinic instability==
Baroclinic instability is a fluid dynamical instability of fundamental importance in the [[atmosphere]] and in the [[oceans]].  In the atmosphere it is the dominant mechanism shaping the [[cyclone]]s and [[anticyclone]]s that dominate [[weather]] in mid-latitudes.  In the ocean it generates a field of [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] (100&amp;nbsp;km or smaller) [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] that play various roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of [[Flow tracer|tracer]]s.  Baroclinic instability is a concept relevant to ''rapidly rotating'', ''strongly [[Atmospheric stratification|stratified]]'' fluids.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Whether a fluid counts as ''rapidly rotating'' is determined in this context by the [[Rossby number]], which is a measure of how close the flow is to solid body rotation.  More precisely, a flow in solid body rotation has [[vorticity]] that is proportional to its [[angular velocity]].  The Rossby number is a measure of the departure of the vorticity from that of solid body rotation.  The Rossby number must be small for the concept of baroclinic instability to be relevant. When the Rossby number is large, other kinds of instabilities, often referred to as inertial, become more relevant.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The simplest example of a stably stratified flow is an incompressible flow with density decreasing with height.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In a compressible gas such as the atmosphere, the relevant measure is the vertical gradient of the [[entropy]], which must increase with height for the flow to be stably stratified.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The strength of the stratification is measured by asking how large the vertical shear of the horizontal winds has to be in order to destabilize the flow and produce the classic [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability]]. This measure is called the ''[[Richardson number]]''.  When the Richardson number is large, the stratification is strong enough to prevent this shear instability.{{fact|date=May 2018}}
 
Before the classic work of [[Jule Charney]] and [[Eric Eady]] on baroclinic instability in the late 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charney|first1=J. G.|title=The dynamics of long waves in a baroclinic westerly current|journal=Journal of Meteorology|date=1947|volume=4|issue=5|pages=136–162|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1947)004&lt;0136:TDOLWI&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1947JAtS....4..136C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eady|first1=E. T.|title=Long Waves and Cyclone Waves|journal=Tellus|date=August 1949|volume=1|issue=3|pages=33–52|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1949.tb01265.x|bibcode=1949TellA...1...33E}}&lt;/ref&gt; most theories trying to explain the structure of mid-latitude eddies took as their starting points the high Rossby number or small Richardson number instabilities familiar to fluid dynamicists at that time.  The most important feature of baroclinic instability is that it exists even in the situation of rapid rotation (small Rossby number) and strong stable stratification (large Richardson's number) typically observed in the atmosphere.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The energy source for baroclinic instability is the [[potential energy]] in the environmental flow.  As the instability grows, the [[center of mass]] of the fluid is lowered.  
In growing waves in the atmosphere, cold air moving downwards and equatorwards displaces the warmer air moving polewards and upwards.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Baroclinic instability can be investigated in the laboratory using a rotating, fluid filled [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]]. The annulus is heated at the outer wall and cooled at the inner wall,  and the resulting fluid flows give rise to baroclinically unstable waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadiga|first1=B. T.|last2=Aurnou|first2=J. M.|title=A Tabletop Demonstration of Atmospheric Dynamics: Baroclinic Instability|journal=Oceanography|date=2008|volume=21|issue=4|pages=196–201|doi=10.5670/oceanog.2008.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb "Lab demos from MIT's Programmes in Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526205303/http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb |date=2011-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "baroclinic" refers to the mechanism by which [[vorticity]] is generated.  Vorticity is the curl of the velocity field.  In general, the evolution of vorticity can be broken into contributions from advection (as vortex tubes move with the flow), [[vortex stretching|stretching]] and twisting (as vortex tubes are pulled or twisted by the flow) and baroclinic vorticity generation, which occurs whenever there is a density gradient along surfaces of constant pressure.  Baroclinic flows can be contrasted with [[barotropic]] flows in which density and pressure surfaces coincide and there is no baroclinic generation of vorticity.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The study of the evolution of these baroclinic instabilities as they grow and then decay is a crucial part of developing theories for the fundamental characteristics of midlatitude weather.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Baroclinic vector==
Beginning with the equation of motion for a frictionless fluid (the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]) and taking the curl, one arrives at the [[Vorticity equation|equation of motion for the curl of the fluid velocity]], that is to say, the [[vorticity]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

In a fluid that is not all of the same density, a source term appears in the [[vorticity equation]] whenever surfaces of constant density ([[isopycnic]] surfaces) and surfaces
of constant pressure ([[wikt:isobaric|isobaric]] surfaces) are not aligned. The [[material derivative]] of the local vorticity is given by:{{fact|date=May 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{D\vec\omega}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial \vec \omega}{\partial t} + (\vec u \cdot \vec \nabla) \vec \omega = (\vec \omega \cdot \vec \nabla) \vec u - \vec \omega (\vec \nabla \cdot \vec u) + \underbrace{\frac{1}{\rho^2}\vec \nabla \rho \times \vec \nabla p }_{\text{baroclinic contribution}}
&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;\vec u&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity and &lt;math&gt;\vec \omega = \vec \nabla \times \vec u&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vorticity]],{{Sfnp|Pedlosky|1987|p=22}} &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is pressure, and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is density). The baroclinic contribution is the vector:{{sfnp|Gill|1982|p=238}}

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\rho^2} \vec \nabla \rho \times \vec \nabla p
&lt;/math&gt;

This vector, sometimes called the solenoidal vector,{{sfnp|Vallis|2007|p=166}} is of interest both in compressible fluids and in incompressible (but inhomogeneous) fluids. Internal [[gravity wave]]s as well as unstable Rayleigh–Taylor modes can be analyzed from the perspective of the baroclinic vector. It is also of interest in the creation of vorticity by the passage of shocks through inhomogeneous media, such as in the [[Richtmyer–Meshkov instability]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Experienced divers are familiar with the very slow waves that can be excited at a [[thermocline]] or a [[halocline]], which are known as ''internal waves''. Similar waves can be generated between a layer of water and a layer of oil. When the interface between these two surfaces is not horizontal and the system is close to hydrostatic equilibrium, the gradient of the pressure is vertical but the gradient of the density is not. Therefore the baroclinic vector is nonzero, and the sense of the baroclinic vector is to create vorticity to make the interface level out. In the process, the interface overshoots, and the result is an oscillation which is an internal gravity wave. Unlike surface gravity waves, internal gravity waves do not require a sharp interface. For example, in bodies of water, a gradual gradient in temperature or salinity is sufficient to support internal gravity waves driven by the baroclinic vector.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The '''Climate Action Plan (CAP) ''' is a set of strategies intended to guide community efforts for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Those strategies have focused on improving energy efficiency and conservation in our homes and businesses—the source of nearly three-fourths of local emissions. The plan also promotes strategies to [[Emissions reduction#Reduction efforts|reduce emissions]] from transportation, which account for over 20 percent of our local greenhouse gas sources.

==General information==
In November 2006, citizens of [[Boulder, Colorado]], voted to approve Ballot Issue No. 202, authorizing the city council to levy and collect an [[excise tax]] from residential, commercial and industrial electricity customers for the purpose of funding a climate action plan(1)City of Boulder R.S. 3–12, accessed 2010-02-02 http://www.colocode.com/boulder2/chapter3-12.htm to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The plan outlines programs to increase energy efficiency, increase renewable energy use, reduce emissions from motor vehicles, and take other steps toward the goal of meeting the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

Beginning April 1, 2007 and expiring March 31, 2013, the initial tax rate was set at $0.0022/kWh for residential customers, $0.0004/kWh for commercial customers, and $0.0002/kWh for industrial customers. The city council has the authority to increase the tax after the first year up to a maximum permitted tax rate of $0.0049/kWh for residential customers; $0.0009/kWh for commercial customers; and $0.0003/kWh for industrial customers. Voluntary purchases of utility-provided [[wind power]] are exempt from the tax.

==History==
By 1 November 2013, the comet was visible to the [[naked eye]] near the [[Beehive Cluster]] (M44), about halfway between [[Jupiter]] and [[Regulus]].&lt;ref name=Kronk/&gt; It became more impressive than [[comet ISON]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;T131108"/&gt; In binoculars, the comet has the appearance of a green, unresolved [[globular cluster]].

C/2013 R1 made its closest approach to Earth on 19 November 2013 at a distance of {{convert|0.3967|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}},&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; and reached an [[apparent magnitude]] of about 4.5.&lt;ref name="Yoshida"/&gt; On 27 November 2013 the comet was in the constellation of [[Canes Venatici]], near the bottom of the handle of the [[Big Dipper]]. From 28 November until 4 December 2013, the comet was in the constellation [[Boötes]]. On 1 December 2013 it passed the star [[Beta Boötis]].&lt;ref name="astrobob131129"/&gt; From 4 December until 12 December 2013, the comet was in the constellation [[Corona Borealis]].

From 12 December until 14 January 2014, the comet was in the constellation [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]]. On 14 December 2013, it passed the star [[Zeta Herculis]].&lt;ref name="astrobob131129"/&gt; The comet came to [[Apsis|perihelion]] (closest approach to the Sun) on 22 December 2013 at a distance of {{convert|0.81|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from the Sun.&lt;ref name="MPEC2013-V48"/&gt; At perihelion, the comet had an [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] of 51 degrees from the Sun. By September 2014, the comet had fainted to magnitude 18.&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-R69"/&gt;

[[Elephant]]s have been depicted in mythology, symbolism and popular culture. They are both revered in religion and respected for their [[war elephant|prowess in war]]. They also have negative connotations such as being a symbol for an unnecessary burden.  Ever since the [[stone age]], when elephants were represented by ancient [[petroglyphs]] and [[cave art]], they have been portrayed in various forms of art, including pictures, sculptures, music, film, and even architecture.

The [[Asian elephant]] appears in various [[Asian religions|religious traditions]] and mythologies. They are treated positively and are sometimes revered as deities, often symbolising strength and wisdom.  Similarly, the [[African elephant]] is seen as the wise chief who impartially settles disputes among the forest creatures in African fables,&lt;ref name="Natures-Ways(2006)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nature's Ways Lore, Legend, Fact and Fiction.|year=2006|publisher=F+W Media|location=Newton Abbot|isbn=9780715333938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6jRwf2eY6kC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 December 2012|chapter=Animal Ways}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] [[African traditional religion|tradition]] holds that they are human chiefs from the past.&lt;ref name="A-gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elephant|url=http://www.a-gallery.de/docs/mythology.htm|work=Myths, legends, beliefs and traditional stories from Africa|publisher=A-gallery|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth is supported and guarded by mythical [[World Elephant]]s at the compass points of the [[cardinal directions]], according to the [[Hindu cosmology]] of [[ancient India]].  The classical [[Sanskrit literature]] also attributes earthquakes to the shaking of their bodies when they tire.  Wisdom is represented by the elephant in the form of the deity [[Ganesh]], one of the most popular gods in the [[Hindu religion]]'s [[Hindu pantheon|pantheon]].  Sometimes known as Ganesha, this deity is very distinctive in having a human form with the head of an elephant.  This was put on after the human head was either was cut off or burned, depending on the version of the story from various Hindu sources. Lord Ganesha's birthday (rebirth) is celebrated as the Hindu festival known as [[Ganesha Chaturthi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festivals : Ganesh Chaturthi|url=http://www.swaminarayan.org/festivals/ganeshchaturthi/index.htm|publisher=[[Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha]]|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In [[Japanese Buddhism]], their adaptation of Ganesha is known as [[Kangiten]] ("Deva of Bliss"), often represented as an elephant-headed male and female pair shown in a standing embrace to represent [[unity of opposites#Coincidentia oppositorum|unity of opposites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanford|first1=James H.|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Robert L.|title=Ganesh : studies of an Asian god|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791406563|page=289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oF-Hqih3pBAC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;pg=PA289|chapter=Literary Aspects of Japan's Dual-Gaņeśa Cult}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu iconography]], many ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' are associated with a mount or vehicle known as a ''[[vāhana]]''.  In addition to providing a means of transport, they symbolically represent a divine attribute. The elephant ''vāhana'' represents wisdom, divine knowledge and royal power; it is associated with [[Lakshmi]], [[Brihaspati]], [[Shachi]] and [[Indra]].
[[Indra]] was said to ride on a flying [[White elephant (animal)|white elephant]] named [[Airavata]], who was made the King of all elephants by Lord Indra.  A white elephant is rare and given special significance. It is often considered sacred and symbolises royalty in Thailand and Burma, where it is also considered a symbol of good luck.  In Buddhist iconography, the elephant is associated with [[Queen Māyā of Sakya]], the mother of [[Gautama Buddha]].  She had a vivid dream foretelling her pregnancy in which a white elephant featured prominently.&lt;ref name=BuddhaNet&gt;{{cite web|title=Life of Buddha (part 1) : Queen Maha Maya's Dream|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/lifebuddha/1lbud.htm|website=BuddhaNet|publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the royal sages, the white elephant signifies royal majesty and authority; they interpreted the dream as meaning that her child was destined for greatness as a universal monarch or a ''buddha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ed|first1=Kevin Trainor, general|title=Buddhism : the illustrated guide|date=2004|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Elephants remain an integral part of religion in South Asia and some are even featured in various religious practices.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Jacqueline L. Schneider ; foreword by Ronald V.|title=Sold into extinction : the global trade in endangered species|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=0313359393|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Temple elephants]] are specially trained captive elephants that are lavishly [[caparison]]ed and used in various temple activities. Among the most famous of the temple elephants is [[Guruvayur Keshavan]] of [[Kerala, India]]. They are also used in festivals in [[Sri Lanka]] such as the [[Esala Perahera]].

In the version of the [[Chinese zodiac]] used in [[Northern Thailand]], the last year in the 12-year cycle – called "Year of the [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]" in China – is known instead as "Year of the Elephant", reflecting the importance of elephants in Thai culture.

In Islamic tradition, the year 570 is when the Prophet [[Muhammad]] was born and is known as the [[Year of the Elephant]].&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=W. Montgomery|title=Muhammad : prophet and statesman|date=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0198810784|page=7|edition=[Repr]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year, [[Abraha]], ruler of [[Yemen]] tried to conquer [[Mecca]] and demolish the [[Kaaba]], reportedly in retaliation for the previous Meccan defilement of [[Al–Qalis Church, Sana'a|Al–Qalis Church]] in [[Sana'a]], a cathedral Abraha had constructed.&lt;ref name="Hajjah"&gt;Hajjah Adil, Amina, "''Prophet Muhammad''", ISCA, 1 Jun 2002, {{ISBN|1-930409-11-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his plan was foiled when his white elephant named Mahmud refused to cross the boundary of Mecca.  The elephant, who led Abraha's forty thousand men, could not be persuaded with reason or even with violence, which was regarded as a crucial omen by Abraha's soldiers. This is generally related in the five [[Ayah|verses]] of the [[Sura|chapter]] titled '[[Al-Fil|The Elephant]]'{{efn|[[Sura]] 105: ''[[Al-Fil]]'' ({{lang-ar|سورة الفيل}} — {{lang-en|The Elephant}})}} in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mir|first=Mustansir|title=Elephants, Birds of Prey, and Heaps of Pebbles: Farāhī's Interpretation of Sūrat al-Fīl|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|year=2005|volume=7|issue=1|pages=33–47|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25728163?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102582220031|doi=10.3366/jqs.2005.7.1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, [[medieval art]]ists depicted the mutual killing of both [[Eleazar]] the [[Maccabee]] and a [[war elephant]] carrying an important [[Seleucid]] general as described in the [[apocrypha]]l book of [[1 Maccabees]].  The early illustrators knew little of the elephant and their portrayals are highly inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval Bestiary : Elephant|url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast77.htm|publisher=Medieval Bestiary|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unfamiliarity with the exotic beast has also made elephants a subject of widely different interpretations thus giving rise to mythological creatures.  The story of the [[blind men and an elephant]] was written to show how reality may be viewed from differing perspectives. The source of this [[parable]] is unknown, but it appears to have originated in India.  It has been attributed to [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Jainism|Jainists]], and [[Sufism|Sufis]], and was also used by [[Discordianism|Discordians]]. The scattered skulls of prehistoric [[dwarf elephant]]s, on the islands of [[Crete]] and [[Sicily]] may have formed the basis of belief in existence of [[cyclops|cyclopes]],{{efn|The plural of cyclops is cyclopes ("sigh-KLO-peez")&lt;ref name="AMNH-Giants"/&gt;}} the one-eyed [[giant (mythology)|giants]] featured in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] (c. 800~600 BC).  As early as the 1370s, scholars had noted that the skulls feature a large [[nasal cavity]] at the front that could be mistaken for a singular eye socket;&lt;ref name="AMNH-Giants"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Giants|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/mythic-creatures/land-creatures-of-the-earth/greek-giants|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the skulls, twice the size of a human's, looked as if they could belong to giant humanoids.&lt;ref name="AMNH-Giants"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek and Roman Mythology.|year=2007|publisher=MobileReference.com|location=Boston|isbn=9781605010915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TkTOgNrm7noC&amp;pg=PT329&amp;dq=cyclops+pygmy+elephant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xrbGUI-aKImQiQer2YCQBA&amp;redir_esc=y|chapter=Cyclops}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that the [[Behemoth]] described in the [[Book of Job]] may be the elephant due to its grazing habits and preference to rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slifkin|first=Natan|title=Sacred monsters : mysterious and mythical creatures of Scripture, Talmud and Midrash|year=2007|publisher=Zoo Torah|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|isbn=1933143185|pages=183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1fdxxS26RYC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=behemoth+elephant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oLjGUJj1CO-diAeH6ICwAw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=behemoth%20elephant&amp;f=false|chapter=Behold the Behemoth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Art==

From Stone age [[rock-art]] to Modern age [[Street art|street-art]], the elephant has remained a popular subject for artists.

===Prehistoric===
[[Prehistoric North Africa]]ns depicted the elephant in [[Paleolithic age]] rock art. For example, the Libyan [[Tadrart Acacus]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]], features a rock carving of an elephant from the last phase of the [[Pleistocene epoch]] (12,000–8000 BC)&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock-Art Sites of Tadrart Acacus|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/287|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; rendered with remarkable realism.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily(2012)Dec5&gt;{{cite web

===Ancient===
[[File:Mamallapuram rock carvings.jpg|thumb|''[[Descent of the Ganges (Mahabalipuram)|Descent of the Ganges]]'' [[rock relief]] at [[Mahabalipuram]], 7th-century]]
Indian [[rock relief]]s include a number of depictions of elephants, notably the ''[[Descent of the Ganges (Mahabalipuram)|Descent of the Ganges]]'' at [[Mahabalipuram]], a large 7th-century Hindu scene with many figures that uses the form of the rock to shape the image.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, J.C., The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent, 2nd edn. 1994, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, {{ISBN|0300062176}}, pp. 278-83&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Unakoti]], [[Tripura]] there is an 11th-century group of reliefs related to [[Shiva]], including several elephants.

[[Indian painting]] includes many elephants, especially ones ridden for battle and royal transport in [[Mughal miniature]]s.

==Politics and secular society==
The elephant is also depicted by various political groups and in secular society.

===In Asia===
Asian cultures admire the high intelligence and good memory of Asian elephants. As such, they symbolise wisdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guading|first=Madonna|title=The signs and symbols bible : the definitive guide to mysterious markings|year=2009|publisher=Sterling Pub.

They are used as a representative of various political parties such as [[United National Party]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] of India. The [[Elephants in Kerala culture|Elephants of Kerala]] are an integral part of the daily life in [[Kerala]], South India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=Elephants+Kerala+culture&amp;as_brr=3|title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|volume=One (A To Devo)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Indian elephant]]s are loved, revered, groomed and given a prestigious place in the state's culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2yWe6ulHkEC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Elephants+Kerala+culture&amp;as_brr=3|title=South India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There they are often referred to as the 'sons of the ''[[Sahyadri|sahya]]''.' The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the [[Government of Kerala]]. The elephant is also on the flag of the [[Kingdom of Laos]] with three elephants visible, supporting an umbrella (another symbol of royal power) until it became a republic in 1975. Other Southeast Asian realms have also displayed one or more white elephants.

The elephant also lends its name to some landmarks in Asia. [[Elephanta Island]] (also called "Gharapuri Island") in [[Mumbai Harbour]] was given this name by 17th century [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorers who saw a monolithic basalt sculpture of an elephant near the entrance to what became known as the [[Elephanta Caves]]. The Portuguese attempted to take it home with them but ended up dropping it into the sea because their chains were not strong enough. Later, the British moved this elephant to the Victoria and Albert Museum (now [[Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum]]) in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;HT Cafe, Mumbai, Monday, 4 June 2007 p. 31; Article: "Lord of the Islands" by Jerry Pinto&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
[[File:Keten Olifant.jpg|thumb|Collar of the Danish Order of the Elephant.]]
{{See also|History of elephants in Europe}}
Aside from being a curiosity for Europeans, the elephant also became a symbol of military might from the experience of fighting foreign powers that fielded [[war elephant]]s throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brosius|first=Maria|title=The Persians: an introduction|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415320895|pages=200|edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Alexander the Great]]'s victory over [[King Porus]] of India, the captured war elephants became a symbol of [[Imperialism|imperial power]], being used as an emblem of the [[Seleucid]] [[Diadoch]] empire. Later, when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wanted a monument to his own imperial power, he decreed that a colossal bronze [[Elephant of the Bastille|elephant fountain]] be cast from guns captured at his victorious [[Battle of Friedland]], for the site where the [[Bastille]] once stood.&lt;ref name=Bingham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=Denis|title=The Bastille, Volume 2|date=1901|publisher=J.

The [[Order of the Elephant]] ({{lang-da|Elefantordenen}}) is the highest [[Order (decoration)|order]] of Denmark.  This very select religious organization was founded by [[Christian I of Denmark|King Christian I]] in 1478, using the elephant as a symbol of docility, sobriety and piety;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lach|first1=Donald F.|title=Asia in the making of Europe.|date=1970|publisher=University of Chicago Press.|location=Chicago|isbn=0226467503|pages=132–133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0hcC3Jo2MMC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; instituted in its current form in 1693 by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]].

[[File:Castororpollux.jpg|thumb|One of the elephants shot for its [[Elephant meat|meat]] at Paris in December 1870.]]
The killing and eating of the elephants [[Castor and Pollux (elephants)|Castor and Pollux]] from the [[Jardin des Plantes|Botanical gardens]] during the 1870 [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)|Siege of Paris]] received considerable attention at the time. This became emblematic of the hardships and degradation caused by siege and war, especially since the two elephants were previously very popular with the Parisian public.

The city of [[Catania]], Sicily has an immemorial connection with the elephant. The local sorcerer [[Heliodorus of Catania|Heliodorus]], was credited with either riding a magic elephant or transforming himself into this animal. Under Medieval Arab rule Catania was known as ''Medinat-Al-Fil'' or ''Balad-Al-Fil'' (City/State of the Elephant). The symbol of the city is the ''Fontana dell'Elefante'' (Fountain of the Elephant) assembled in its present form in 1736 by [[Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]].

[[File:Elephant &amp; Castle, London, England.jpg|thumb|left|Iconic statue at London's [[Elephant &amp; Castle tube station]]]]
In Central London, England, an area known as the "[[Elephant and Castle]]" (or "The Elephant") is centered on a major road intersection and a station of the [[London Underground]].  The "Castle" in the location's name refers to a medieval perception of a [[Howdah]]. The [[Heraldry|heraldic]] elephant and castle has also been associated with the city of [[Coventry]], England since medieval times, where it denotes religious symbolism{{efn|"The elephant is seen, not only as a beast so strong that he can carry a tower – Coventry's castle – full of armed men, but also as a symbol of Christ's redemption of the human race."&lt;ref name="Coventry-CC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coat of Arms : History of the Coat of Arms |url=http://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/1001/lord_mayor-general_information/888/coat_of_arms |publisher=Coventry City Council |accessdate=13 June 2014 |ref=CCC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225117/http://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/1001/lord_mayor-general_information/888/coat_of_arms |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and with the town of [[Dumbarton, Scotland]].{{efn|''cf'': [[:File:Civic Arms, Dumbarton.JPG| Dumbarton Civic Coat of Arms]] and [[:File:Dumbarton FC logo.svg|Dumbarton Football Club crest]]}}  More recently in Britain, [[Welephant]], a red elephant cartoon character with a fireman's helmet, was originally used as a mascot by [[fire brigades in the United Kingdom]] to promote fire safety for children and has become the mascot for the Children's Burn Trust.&lt;ref name=Welephant&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the National Fire Safety Charity for Children |url=http://www.welephant.co.uk/history2.htm |work=Welephant web site |publisher=National Fire Safety Charity for Children |accessdate=4 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728130553/http://www.welephant.co.uk/history2.htm |archivedate=28 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elephant as the symbol for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the United States originated in an 1874 political cartoon of an Asian elephant by [[Thomas Nast]] in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.  This cartoon, titled "Third Term Panic", is a parody of [[Aesop's fable]],{{efn|Although the caption quotes the fable, Nast attributes it to —''[[Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship|Shakespear or Bacon]]''}} "[[The Ass in the Lion's Skin]]".  It depicts an elephant (labelled ''The Republican Vote'') running toward a ''chasm of chaos''; frightening a [[donkey|jackass]]{{efn|Contrary to popular belief, Nast did not originate the donkey (a derogatory reference to [[Andrew Jackson|Andrew "Jackass" [Jackson]]]) as the symbol of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the parties got their animal symbols|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-the-parties-got-their-animal-symbols/|work=(CBS News)|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=Donald|title=The art of ill will : the story of American political cartoons|year=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0814719856|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in a lion's skin (labelled ''[[Caesarism]]'') which scatters animals representing various interests.

The elephant has entered into popular culture through various [[idiom]]atic expressions and [[adage]]s.

The phrase "Elephants never forget" refers to the belief that elephants have excellent memories. The variation "Women and elephants never forget an injury" originates from the 1904 book ''Reginald on Besetting Sins'' by British writer Hector Hugh Munro, better known as [[Saki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiquotelang|en|Saki#Reginald (1904)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Jenkins | date=1 June 2001 | title=Why Elephants Never Forget | first=Dr. Orville Boyd | url=http://orvillejenkins.com/words/elephant.html | accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This adage seems to have a basis in fact, as reported in ''[[Scientific American]]'':

::Remarkable [[Explicit memory|recall power]], researchers believe, is a big part of how elephants survive. Matriarch elephants, in particular, hold a store of social knowledge that their families can scarcely do without, according to research conducted on elephants at [[Amboseli National Park]] in Kenya.&lt;ref name="Sci-Am"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ritchie|first=James|title=Fact or Fiction?: Elephants Never Forget|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=elephants-never-forget|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[Seeing the Elephant]]" is a 19th-century Americanism denoting a world-weary experience;&lt;ref name="Wilton(2006)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilton|first1=Dave|date=13 June 2006|title=elephant, to see the|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/comments/elephant_to_see_the/|website=Wordorigins.org|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used by soldiers, pioneers and adventurers to qualify new and exciting adventures such as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="Wilton(2006)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeing the Elephant|url=http://www.nha.org/history/hn/HNelephant.htm|website=Historic Nantucket|publisher=Nantucket Historical Association|accessdate=30 July 2014|quote=Originally published in the ''Historic Nantucket'', Vol 48, no. 3 (Summer 1999), p. 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEEING THE ELEPHANT|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/01/news/seeing-the-elephant.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=30 July 2014|date=1 March 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "[[white elephant]]" has become a term referring to an expensive burden, particularly when much has been invested with false expectations. The term 'white elephant sale' was sometimes used in Australia as a synonym for [[jumble sale]]. In the U.S., a [[White elephant gift exchange]] is a popular winter holiday party activity. The idiom [[Elephant in the room]] tells of an obvious truth that no one wants to discuss, alluding to the animal's size compared to a small space. "[[Seeing pink elephants]]" refers to a drunken hallucination and is the basis for the [[Pink Elephants on Parade]] sequence in the 1941 [[Disney animated feature]], ''[[Dumbo]]''.  "Jumbo" has entered the English language as a synonym for "large".{{efn|As a product size, by 1886 (cigars); ''Jumbo jet'' attested by 1964.&lt;ref name="Jumbo"/&gt;}} [[Jumbo]] originally was the name of a huge elephant acquired by circus showman [[P.

===Literature===
[[File:'The Steam House' by Léon Benett 018.jpg|thumbnail|[[Léon Benett]]'s illustration of [[Jules Verne]]'s mechanical elephant from ''[[The Steam House]]'' (1880)]]
The elephant is viewed in both positive and negative lights in similar fashion as humans in various forms of literature. In fact, [[Pliny the Elder]] praised the beast in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' as one that is closest to a human in sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance Beasts: Of Animals, Humans, and Other Wonderful Creatures|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252091339|pages=172–173|editor=Erica Fudge|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elephant's different connotations clash in [[Ivo Andrić]]'s novella ''The Vizier's Elephant''. Here the citizens of [[Travnik]] despise the young elephant who symbolises the cruelty of the unseen [[Vizier]]. However, the elephant itself is young and innocent despite unknowingly causing havoc due to youthful play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Priča o vezirovom slonu/The Story of the Vizier's Elephant|url=http://www.ivoandric.org.rs/html/the_story_of_the_vizier_s_elep.html|publisher=The Ivo Andrić Foundation|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tarzan]] novels of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], ''[[Tantor]]'' is the generic term for "elephant" in the fictional [[simian]]  ''[[Mangani]]'' language, but is associated with a particular elephant who eventually becomes Tarzan's faithful companion. Other elephant characters that are shown in a positive light include [[Jean de Brunhoff]]'s [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]] and [[Dr. Seuss]]' [[Horton the Elephant|Horton]]. [[Jules Verne]] featured a steam-powered mechanical elephant in his 1880 novel ''[[The Steam House]]''.  In addition, the animal is depicted in its military use through the [[oliphaunt]]s of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy and the alien invaders of [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s 1985 science fiction novel, ''[[Footfall]]''.

Notable short stories featuring elephants include [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s "[[Toomai of the Elephants]]" and "[[The Elephant's Child]]"; as well as [[Mark Twain]]'s "[[The Stolen White Elephant]]". [[George Orwell]] wrote an [[Allegory|allegorical]] [[essay]], "[[Shooting an Elephant]]"; and in "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]", [[Ernest Hemingway]] used the allegorical white elephant, alluding to a pregnancy as an unwanted gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnston|first1=Kenneth G.|title=Hills Like White Elephants|journal=Studies in American Fiction|date=Autumn 1982|volume=10|issue=2|pages=230–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animal is also seen in historical novels. ''[[The Elephant's Journey]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''A Viagem do Elefante'', 2008) is a novel by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1998 : José Saramago|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/index.html|work=The Nobel Prize in Literature|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Saramago]].

Sprague de Camp]]. It concerns the adventures of a [[Thessalian]] [[cavalry]] commander who has been tasked by [[Alexander the Great]] to bring an elephant captured from [[King Porus]] of India, to [[Athens]] as a present for Alexander's old tutor, [[Aristotle]].

Elephants can also represent the hugeness and wildness of the imagination, as in [[Ursula Dubosarsky]]&lt;!-- and Andrew Joyner--&gt;'s 2012 children's book, ''Too Many Elephants in This House'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyner|first=Ursula Dubosarsky ; illustrated by Andrew|title=Too many elephants in this house|year=2012|publisher=Penguin Books Australia|location=Camberwell, Vic.|isbn=0670075469|pages=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9780670075461}}&lt;/ref&gt;   which also plays with the notion of the [[elephant in the room]].&lt;ref&gt;Review by Robin Morrow "Too Many Elephants in This House" Magpies Vol.27 2012 p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  An imaginary elephant can (perhaps) become real, as with the elusive [[Heffalump]].  Although never specified as an elephant in [[A. A. Milne]]'s [[Winnie the Pooh]] stories, a heffalump physically resembles an elephant; and [[E. H. Shepard]]'s illustration shows an Indian elephant.  "''Heffalump''" has since been defined as "a child's term for an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary

===Sports===
The elephant is used as a mascot or logo for various sports groups.

Circus showman [[P. T. Barnum]] donated the stuffed hide of [[Jumbo]] the elephant to [[Tufts University]]'s in 1885, where Jumbo soon became the mascot for their sports teams.  However, all that remains of Jumbo are some ashes stored in a peanut butter jar and a piece of his tail following a fire in 1975.  "Jumbo's spirit lives on" in the peanut butter jar which is ceremoniously passed on to successive Athletic Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumbo the Elephant, Tufts' Mascot|url=http://www.tufts.edu/home/get_to_know_tufts/history/jumbo/|website=Get to Know Tufts|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mascot for the [[Oakland Athletics]] (A's) baseball team is based on the figurative white elephant. The story of picking the mascot began when [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]' manager [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] told reporters that Philadelphia manufacturer [[Benjamin Shibe]], who owned the controlling interest in the new team, had a "white elephant on his hands"; manager [[Connie Mack]] defiantly adopted the white elephant as the team mascot.{{efn|Over the years, the A's elephant mascot has appeared in various colours other than white, and was briefly replaced by a mule}}  The A's are sometimes, but infrequently, referred to as the 'Elephants' or 'White Elephants'.  Their mascot is nicknamed [[Stomper]].

[[University of Alabama]]'s [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Crimson Tide]] mascot has been an elephant since 1930 after a sportswriter wrote of a fan yelling "Hold your horses, the elephants are coming!" as the football team rumbled onto the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Al|url=http://www.rolltide.com/sports/c-cheer/spec-rel/big-al.html|work=Crimson Tide|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their elephant-costumed "[[Big Al (mascot)|Big Al]]" officially debuted at the [[1979 Sugar Bowl]].

[[Catania, Italy]] uses the elephant to represent [[Catania Elephants|their football team]], referencing the animal that has represented their city since ancient times.

The elephant is also represented in music such as [[Henry Mancini]]'s hit song "[[Baby Elephant Walk]]", which has been described as "musical shorthand for kookiness of any stripe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mills|first1=Ted|title=Henry Mancini : ''Hatari!'' : Review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hatari!-mw0000200845|website=AllMusic|publisher=All Media Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American band [[the White Stripes]]' fourth album was entitled ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]] ''in honour of the animal's brute strength and closeness to its relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiCrescenzo|first=Brent|title=The White Stripes: Elephant|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8652-elephant/|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate=8 February 2013|date=1 April 2003|quote=The album title refers to the endangered animal's brute power and less honored instinctual memory for dead relatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hit single "[[Elephant (Alexandra Burke song)|Elephant]]" by British recording artist [[Alexandra Burke]] is based on the expression "[[elephant in the room]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Love|first=Ryan|title=Alexandra Burke interview: 'Elephant is just the beginning'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/interviews/a359339/alexandra-burke-interview-elephant-is-just-the-beginning.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=24 January 2013|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Nellie the Elephant]]" is a children's song first released in 1956 and since covered by many artists including the punk-rock band [[Toy Dolls]];&lt;ref name=NIEHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Nellie the Elephant (lyrics only) |url=http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/games/songs/childrens/nellie.htm |work=NIEHS Kids Pages |publisher=National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228061858/http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/games/songs/childrens/nellie.htm |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television===
The elephant is also featured in film and on television. Thailand has produced various movies about the animal, from the 1940 historical drama film ''[[King of the White Elephant]]'' to the 2005 martial-arts action film, ''[[Tom-Yum-Goong]]''.{{efn|US title: ''The Protector'', UK title: ''Warrior King''}} In the West, the elephant was popularised by ''[[Dumbo]]'', the elephant who learns to fly in the 1941 [[Disney animated feature]] of the same name.  Kipling's "[[Toomai of the Elephants]]" was adapted as the 1937 British adventure film ''[[Elephant Boy (film)|Elephant Boy]]''.  In popular modern films, [[Tai (elephant)|Tai the elephant-actress]] has portrayed Bo Tat in ''[[Operation Dumbo Drop]]'' (1995), Vera in ''[[Larger than Life (film)|Larger than Life]]'' (1996) and Rosie in ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011).

On television, ''[[Nellie the Elephant (TV series)|Nellie the Elephant]]'' is a 1990 UK cartoon series inspired by the song of the same name, featuring Scottish singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] voicing Nelly. [[Britt Allcroft]] adapted  "Mumfie" the elephant from Katherine Tozer's series of children's books,{{efn|The first book ''Mumfie Marches On'', published during World War II (1942) was suggested by the British government; which culminates in the capture of Adolph Hitler by Mumfie and allies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Owen Dudley|title=British children's fiction in the Second World War|date=2003|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0748616519|pages=318, 350|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8h87i1OaEgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} originally in a '70s televised [[puppet show]] and then in the '90s animated ''[[Magic Adventures of Mumfie]]'' series.

===Games===
The elephant can also be found in games. In [[shatranj]], the medieval game from which [[chess]] developed, the piece corresponding to the modern [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] was known as [[Alfil (chess)|''Pil'' or ''Alfil'']] ("Elephant"; from Persian and Arabic,{{efn|From Persian پيل pīl; al- is the Arabic for "the"}} respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golombek|first=Harry|title=Chess : a history|year=1976|publisher=Putnam|location=New York|isbn=0399115757|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Indian [[chaturanga]] game the piece is also called "Elephant" (''Gaja''). The same is true in [[Chinese chess]],{{efn|''Xiangqi'' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|象棋}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Xiàngqí''), sometimes translated as "the elephant game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Play Chinese Chess : Xiangqi|url=http://ancientchess.com/page/play-xiangqi.htm|publisher=AncientChess.com|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} which has an elephant piece ("Xiàng", 象) that serves as a defensive piece, being the only one that may not cross the river dividing the game board. In the Japanese [[shogi]] version, the piece was known as the "''Drunken'' Elephant"; however, it was dropped by order of the [[Emperor Go-Nara]] and no longer appears in the version played in contemporary Japan. Even with modern Chess, the word for the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] is still ''Alfil'' in Spanish, ''Alfiere'' in Italian, ''Feel'' in Persian, and "Elephant" (Слон) in Russian. All of these games originally simulated a kind of battlefield, thus this piece represented a [[war elephant]]. In the present-day canonical [[Staunton chess set]], the piece's deep groove, which originally represented the elephant's tusks, is now regarded as representing a bishop's (or abbot's) [[mitre]]. The Asian subspecie was included in [[Far Cry 4]]'s handbook, comparing the animal to Pagan Min's nobility and humility.

==Architecture==
In the 18th-century, French architect [[Charles Ribart]] planned to build a three-level elephant building at the Paris site where the [[Arc de Triomphe]] was eventually built.  Nothing became of this, but in the early 19th-century, [[Napoleon]] conceived of an even larger elephant structure, the [[Elephant of the Bastille]].  Although the ambitious project was never completed with its intended bronze elephant, a full-sized plaster and wood-frame model stood in its place.  After Napoleon's defeat, this structure eventually became a neglected eyesore, and a setting in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 novel, ''[[Les Misérables]]''.

Three multi-story elephant shaped buildings were built in America by [[James V. Lafferty]] in the 1880s.  The largest, seven-story, thirty-one room [[Elephantine Colossus]] served as a hotel, concert hall, and attraction on [[Coney Island]] before it burned down in 1896.  The six-story [[Lucy the Elephant]] is the only remaining of the three, and survives as a tourist attraction near [[Atlantic City]].  These giant elephant structures, however, are dwarfed by the 32-story [[Bangkok]] [[Elephant Tower]] in Thailand.  This iconic elephant-inspired building reflects the influence of the elephant in Thai culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chang (Elephant) Building|url=http://www.bkkkids.com/activities/chang-elephant-building/|publisher=BKK Kids|accessdate=10 March 2014|date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6461">'''Digital mapping''' (also called digital [[cartography]]) is the process by which a collection of data is compiled and formatted into a virtual image. The primary function of this technology is to produce [[map]]s that give accurate representations of a particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The technology also allows the calculation of distances from one place to another.

Although digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer applications the main use of these maps is with the [[Global Positioning System]], or [[GPS]] satellite network, used in standard [[automotive navigation system]]s.

==History==

===From paper to paperless===
The roots of digital mapping lie within traditional paper maps such as the [[Thomas Guide]] and [[Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas]]. Paper maps provide basic landscapes similar to digitized road maps, yet are often cumbersome, cover only a designated area, and lack many specific details such as road blocks. In addition, there is no way to “update” a paper map except to obtain a new version. On the other hand, digital maps, in many cases, can be updated through synchronization with updates from company servers.

===Expanded capabilities===
Early digital maps had the same basic functionality as paper maps—that is, they provided a “virtual view” of roads generally outlined by the terrain encompassing the surrounding area. However, as digital maps have grown with the expansion of GPS technology in the past decade, live traffic updates,&lt;ref name = "Live Traffic Updates"&gt;"Navigation device assisting road traffic congestion management." FreshPatents.com. 9 March 2007. http://www.freshpatents.com/Navigation-device-assisting-road-traffic-congestion-management-dt20080925ptan20080234921.php. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; points of interest and service locations have been added to enhance digital maps to be more “user conscious."&lt;ref name = "EET"&gt;Husby, Jonathon. "In-car navigation matures beyond ‘Point A to Point B’." Electronic Engineering Times. 28 Jan. 2008. http://www.automotivedesignline.com. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional “virtual views” are now only part of digital mapping. In many cases, users can choose between virtual maps, satellite (aerial views), and hybrid (a combination of virtual map and aerial views) views. With the ability to update and expand digital mapping devices, newly constructed roads and places can be added to appear on maps.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Three-dimensional maps of landscapes can be generated using [[3D scanner]]s or [[3D reconstruction]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Remondino, Fabio. "[https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/3/6/1104htm Heritage recording and 3D modeling with photogrammetry and 3D scanning]." Remote Sensing 3.6 (2011): 1104-1138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
Digital maps heavily rely upon a vast amount of data collected over time. Most of the information that comprise digital maps is the culmination of satellite imagery as well as street level information. Maps must be updated frequently to provide users with the most accurate reflection of a location. While there is a wide spectrum on companies that specialize in digital mapping, the basic premise is that digital maps will accurately portray roads as they actually appear to give "life-like experiences." &lt;ref name = "Tele Atlas"&gt;"City Maps" Tele Atlas BV. 2008. http://www.teleatlas.com/OurProducts/MapEnhancementProducts/CityMaps/index.htm. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality and use==

===Computer applications===
Proprietary and non-proprietary computer programs and applications provide imagery and street-level map data for much of the world.

===Scientific applications===
The development of mobile computing ([[PDAs]], [[tablet computer|tablet PCs]], [[laptops]], etc.) has recently (since about 2000) spurred the use of digital mapping in the sciences and [[applied science]]s. {{as of|2009}}, science fields that use digital mapping technology include [[geology]] (see [[Digital geologic mapping]]), [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[land surveying]], [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[Environmental science|environmental]], and [[archaeology]].

===GPS navigation systems===
The principal use by which digital mapping has grown in the past decade has been its connection to [[Global Positioning System]] ([[GPS]]) technology.&lt;ref name = "GPS"&gt;"United States Updates Global Positioning System Technology." America.gov. 3 Feb. 2006. http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/February/20060203125928lcnirellep0.5061609.html. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; GPS is the foundation behind digital mapping navigation systems.

==== How it works ====

The coordinates and position as well as [[atomic time]] obtained by a [[Earth|terrestrial]] GPS receiver from GPS satellites [[orbiting]] [[Earth]] interact together to provide the digital mapping programming with points of origin in addition to the destination points needed to calculate distance. This information is then analyzed and compiled to create a map that provides the easiest and most efficient way to reach a destination.
:More technically speaking, the device operates in the following manner:&lt;ref name = "U.S. G.P.S."&gt;"How Does GPS Work?" Smithsonian Institution. 1998. http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/gps/work.html. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# GPS receivers collect data from at least four GPS satellites orbiting the Earth, calculating position in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]].
# The GPS receiver then utilizes position to provide [[GPS coordinates]], or exact points of latitudinal and longitudinal direction from GPS satellites.
# The points, or coordinates, output an accurate range between approximately "10-20 meters" of the actual location.
# The beginning point, entered via GPS coordinates, and the ending point, (address or coordinates) input by the user, are then entered into the digital mapping software.
# The mapping software outputs a real-time visual representation of the route. The map then moves along the path of the driver.
# If the driver drifts from the designated route, the navigation system will use the current coordinates to recalculate a route to the destination location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1479">{{refimprove|date=December 2008}} The '''Energy functional''' is the total [[energy (physics)|energy]] of a certain system, as a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the system's [[Classical mechanics|state]].

In the [[energy principles in structural mechanics|energy methods]] of simulating the dynamics of complex structures, a state of the system is often described as an element of an appropriate [[function space]]. To be in this state, the system pays a certain cost in terms of energy required by the state. This energy is a scalar quantity, a function of the state, hence the term ''functional''. The system tends to develop from the state with higher energy (higher cost) to the state with lower energy, thus local minima of this functional are usually related to the stable stationary states. Studying such states is part of the [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization problems]], where the terms ''energy functional'' or ''cost functional'' are often used to describe the objective function.

==Examples==
* In [[Hamiltonian system]]s, the energy functional is given by the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

The '''Environment of [[Albania]]''' is characterised by unique flora and fauna and a variety of landforms contained within a small nation. It also consists of different [[ecoregions]], which represent the natural [[Geography of Albania|geographical]] [[ecosystem]], water systems, [[weather]], [[renewable resources]] and influences upon them.

Of the factors caused by human intervention that can affect this [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], activities that sustain the [[economy of Albania]] such as [[mining]] and [[forestry]] are notably influential. The environment strongly influences public health in Albania, as for example [[air pollution]] and [[smog]] in [[urban area]]s such as in [[Tirana]] can result in great distress for those with [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] conditions such as [[asthma]].

== Geography ==
{{Hatnote|[[File:commons-logo.svg|12px|link=|alt=]] Main article: [[Geography of Albania]]; See also: [[commons:Atlas of Albania|Atlas of Albania]] at [[Wikimedia Commons]]}} 

[[Albania]] is a small predominantly mountainous country between [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]] and [[Southern Europe]], on facing the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian
n Sea|Ionian sea]]s within the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It has a total area of {{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=off}}, bordering [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]] to the northeast, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to the east and [[Greece]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albania country profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17679574|website=bbc.com|location=Europe|language=English|date=19 June 2017|quote=Albania is a small, mountainous country in the Balkan peninsula, with a long Adriatic and Ionian coastline.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[39th parallel north|39° N]] and between longitudes [[21st meridian east|21°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]]. Its coastline length is {{convert|476|km|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Albania pdf"&gt;{{cite web| author=Eftimi, R. |url=http://aguas.igme.es/igme/publica/tiac-02/ALBANIA-I.pdf|title=SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON SEAWATER-FRESHWATER RELATIONSHIP IN ALBANIAN COASTAL AREA|publisher=ITA Consult}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|240}} and extends along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]]s.

== Climate ==

With Albania's coastline facing the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian sea]]s, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, [[Albania]] has a high number of climatic regions for such a small area. The coastal lowlands have typically mediterranean climate; the highlands have a continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.

Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.

[[Phytogeographically]], Albania is part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] specifically, part of the [[Illyrian Provinces|Illyrian]] province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom|Boreal kingdom]]. Albania is divided into three ecoregions including [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests|Dinaric mixed forests]], [[Balkan mixed forests]] and [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests|Pindus mixed forests]]. Further, [[Biome]]s in Albania include [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] and [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]], that are all in the [[Palearctic ecozone]]. Due to its climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions, Albania is one of the richest in Europe in terms of [[Biodiversity of Albania|biodiversity]]. Almost 30% of the entire flora and 42% fauna in the entire European contitent can be found in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity Albania|url=https://www.climatechangepost.com/albania/biodiversity/|website=climatechangepost.com|language=English|quote=Some of the 30% of the European plant species, and 42% of the European mammals can be found in the country. Albania's variety of wetlands, lagoons and large lakes also provide critical winter habitat for migratory birds (1).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 799 [[Protected areas of Albania|Albanian protected areas]], which covers a surface of {{convert|4600|km2|hectare}}. These include 15 [[National Parks of Albania|national park]]s, 5 protected landscape areas, 29 [[Strict Nature Reserve/Wilderness Area|nature reserves]], 4 protected resource areas and 750 [[Natural monument|nature monument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity and Protected Areas-- Albania|url=http://www.catsg.org/balkanlynx/04_land-use/4_3_protected-area/protected-areas/Pdfs/EarthTrends_2003_Protected_areas_in_Albania.pdf|website=catsg.org|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albania, Europe|url=https://www.protectedplanet.net/country/ALB|website=protectedplanet.net|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national parks covering a surface area of {{convert|210668.48|hectare|km2|}} or roughly 13.65% of the overall territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjedisi.gov.al/files/userfiles/Biodiversiteti/ZM&amp;PK-Pershkrim.pdf Përshkrimi i Rrjetit aktual të zonave të mbrojtura]&lt;/ref&gt; The nation host also 8 archaeological parks covering a surface area of {{convert|1120|hectare|km2|}}.

The '''Fleming valve''', also called the '''Fleming oscillation valve''', was a thermionic valve or [[vacuum tube]] invented in 1904 by Englishman  [[John Ambrose Fleming]] as a [[detector (radio)|detector]] for early [[radio receiver]]s used in [[electromagnetic waves|electromagnetic]] [[wireless telegraphy]].  It was the first practical [[vacuum tube]] and the first [[thermionic diode]], a vacuum tube whose purpose is to conduct current in one direction and block current flowing in the opposite direction.   The thermionic diode was later widely used as a [[rectifier]] — a device which converts [[alternating current]] (AC) into [[direct current]] (DC) — in the [[power supply|power supplies]] of a wide range of electronic devices, until beginning to be replaced by the [[selenium rectifier]] in the early 1930s and almost completely replaced by the [[semiconductor diode]] in the 1960s.  The Fleming valve was the forerunner of all vacuum tubes, which dominated electronics for 50 years.  The [[IEEE]] has described it as "one of the most important developments in the history of electronics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Fleming_Valve,_1904 |title=Milestones:Fleming Valve, 1904 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is on the [[List of IEEE Milestones]] for [[electrical engineering]].

==How it works==
[[File:Marconi Valve Tuner.jpg|thumb|Valve receiver made by Marconi Co. has two Fleming valves, in case one burns out]]

The valve consists of an evacuated glass bulb containing two [[electrode]]s: a [[cathode]] in the form of a "[[electrical filament|filament]]", a loop of carbon or fine tungsten wire, similar to that used in the light bulbs of the time, and an [[anode]] ([[plate electrode|plate]]) consisting of a sheet metal plate.  Although in early versions the anode was a flat metal plate placed next to the cathode, in later versions it became a metal cylinder surrounding the cathode.  In some versions, a grounded copper screen surrounded the bulb to shield against the influence of external electric fields.

In operation, a separate current flows through the cathode "filament", heating it so that some of the [[electron]]s in the metal gain sufficient energy to escape their parent atoms into the vacuum of the tube, a process called [[thermionic emission]].  The AC to be rectified is applied between the filament and the plate.  When the plate has a positive voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are attracted to it and an electric current flows from filament to plate.  In contrast, when the plate has a negative voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are not attracted to it and no current flows through the tube (unlike the filament, the plate does not emit electrons).  As current can pass through the valve in one direction only, it therefore "[[rectifier|rectifies]]" an AC to a pulsing DC current.

This simple operation was somewhat complicated by the presence of residual air in the valve, as the vacuum pumps of Fleming's time were unable to create as high a vacuum as exists in modern vacuum tubes.  At high voltages, the valve could become unstable and oscillate, but this occurred at voltages far above those normally used.

==History==
The Fleming valve was the first practical application of [[thermionic emission]], discovered in 1873 by [[Frederick Guthrie]].  As a result of his work on the [[incandescent light bulb]], [[Thomas Edison]] made his own discovery of the phenomenon in 1880, which led to it being called the ''[[Edison effect]]''.  Edison was granted a patent for this device as part of an electrical indicator in 1884, but did not find a practical use for it. Professor Fleming of [[University College London]] consulted for the [[Edison Electric Light Company]] from 1881-1891, and subsequently for the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]]. 

In 1901 Fleming designed the transmitter used by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] in the first transmission of radio waves across the Atlantic from [[Poldhu]], [[England]], to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. The distance between the two points was about {{convert|3,500|km|mi}}. Although the contact, reported November 12, 1901, was widely heralded as a great scientific advance at the time, there is also some skepticism about the claim, because the received signal, the three dots of the [[Morse code]] letter "S", was so weak the primitive receiver had difficulty distinguishing it from [[sferics|atmospheric radio noise]] caused by static discharges, leading later critics to suggest it may have been random noise.  Regardless, it was clear to Fleming that reliable transatlantic communication with the existing transmitter required more sensitive receiving apparatus.   

[[Image:FRec var.jpg|thumb|[[Thermionic diode]] valves derived from the Fleming valve, from the 1930s ''(left)'' to the 1970s ''(right)'']]

The receiver for the transatlantic demonstration employed a [[coherer]], which had poor sensitivity and degraded the tuning of the receiver. This led Fleming to look for a detector which was more sensitive and reliable while at the same time being better suited for use with tuned circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/nc4ar/radio.htm Radio Communications: A Brief Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/static/pioneer.htm John Ambrose Fleming (1849-1945) By W A Atherton, Published in Wireless World August 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 Fleming tried an Edison effect bulb for this purpose, and found that it worked well to rectify high frequency oscillations and thus allow detection of the rectified signals by a [[galvanometer]]. On November 16, 1904, he applied for a US patent for what he termed an oscillation valve. This patent was subsequently issued as number 803,684 and found immediate utility in the detection of messages sent by Morse code.

===Oscillation valves===
The Fleming valve proved to be the start of a technological revolution. After reading Fleming's 1905 paper on his oscillation valve, American engineer [[Lee DeForest]] in 1906 created a three-element vacuum tube, the [[Audion tube|Audion]], by adding a wire [[control grid|grid]] between cathode and anode.  It was the first electronic [[amplifier|amplifying]] device, allowing the creation of [[amplifier]]s and continuous wave [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]].   De Forest quickly refined his device into the [[triode]], which became the basis of long-distance [[telephone]] and radio communications, [[radar]]s, and early digital computers for 50 years, until the advent of the transistor in the 1960s.  Fleming sued De Forest for infringing his valve patents, resulting in decades of expensive and disruptive litigation, which were not settled until 1943 when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled Fleming's patent invalid.&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court invalidated the patent because of an improper disclaimer and later maintained the technology in the patent was known art when filed. For more see, [http://www.mercurians.org/1998_Fall/misreading.htm Misreading the Supreme Court: A Puzzling Chapter in the History of Radio]. Mercurians.org. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Power applications===
Later, when [[vacuum tube]] equipment began to be powered from wall power by transformers instead of batteries, the Fleming valve was developed into a [[rectifier]] to produce the DC plate (anode) voltage required by other vacuum tubes.  Around 1914 [[Irving Langmuir]] at [[General Electric]] developed a high voltage version called the [[Kenotron]] which was used to power [[x-ray tube]]s.  As a rectifier, the tube was used for high voltage applications but its high internal resistance made it inefficient in low voltage, high current applications.  Until vacuum tube equipment was replaced by transistors in the 1970s, radios and televisions usually had one or more diode tubes.

'''Gravity Probe B''' ('''GP-B''') was a [[satellite]]-based mission to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at 650 km (400 mi) altitude, crossing directly over the poles.

The satellite was [[List of Thor and Delta launches (2000–2009)#2004|launched on 20 April 2004]] on a [[Delta II]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; its aim was to measure [[spacetime|spacetime curvature]] near [[Earth]], and thereby the [[stress–energy tensor]] (which is related to the distribution and the motion of matter in space) in and near Earth. This provided a test of [[general relativity]], [[gravitomagnetism]] and related models. The [[principal investigator]] was [[Francis Everitt]].

Initial results confirmed the expected [[geodetic effect]] to an accuracy of about 1%. The expected [[frame-dragging]] effect was similar in magnitude to the current [[noise]] level (the noise being dominated by initially unmodeled effects due to nonuniform coatings on the gyroscopes). Work continued to model and account for these sources of error, thus permitting extraction of the frame-dragging signal. By &lt;time datetime="2008-08"&gt;August 2008&lt;/time&gt;, the frame-dragging effect had been confirmed to within 15% of the expected result,&lt;ref name = "Gugliotta2009"&gt;

In an article published in the journal ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' in &lt;time&gt;2011&lt;/time&gt;, the authors reported analysis of the data from all four gyroscopes results in a geodetic drift rate of {{val|−6601.8|18.3|ul=mas|upl=yr}} and a frame-dragging drift rate of {{val|−37.2|7.2|u=mas|up=yr}}, in good agreement with the general relativity predictions of {{val|−6606.1|0.28|errend=%|u=mas/yr}} and {{val|−39.2|0.19|errend=%|u=mas/yr}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=PRL/&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:Gravity Probe B.jpg|thumb|Gravity Probe B with solar panels folded.]]

Gravity Probe B was a relativity [[gyroscope]] experiment funded by [[NASA]]. Efforts were led by [[Stanford University]] physics department with [[Lockheed Martin]] as the primary subcontractor. Mission scientists viewed it as the second gravity experiment in space, following the successful launch of [[Gravity Probe A]] (GP-A) in &lt;time&gt;1976&lt;/time&gt;.

The mission plans were to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging. This was to be accomplished by measuring, very precisely, tiny changes in the direction of spin of four gyroscopes contained in an Earth satellite orbiting at 650&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (400&amp;nbsp;[[statute mile|mi]]) altitude, crossing directly over the poles. The gyroscopes were intended to be so free from disturbance that they would provide a near-perfect [[space-time]] reference system. This would allow them to reveal how space and time are "warped" by the presence of the Earth, and by how much the Earth's rotation "drags" space-time around with it.

The [[geodetic effect]] is an effect caused by space-time being "curved" by the mass of the Earth. A gyroscope's axis when [[parallel transport]]ed around the Earth in one complete revolution does not end up pointing in exactly the same direction as before. The angle "missing" may be thought of as the amount the gyroscope "leans over" into the slope of the space-time curvature. A more precise explanation for the space curvature part of the geodetic precession is obtained by using a nearly flat cone to model the space curvature of the Earth's gravitational field. Such a cone is made by cutting out a thin "pie-slice" from a circle and gluing the cut edges together. The spatial geodetic precession is a measure of the missing "pie-slice" angle. Gravity Probe B was expected to measure this effect to an accuracy of one part in 10,000, the most stringent check on general relativistic predictions to date.

The much smaller [[frame-dragging]] effect is an example of [[gravitomagnetism]]. It is an analog of [[magnetism]] in [[classical electrodynamics]], but caused by rotating masses rather than rotating electric charges. Previously, only two analyses of the [[laser-ranging]] data obtained by the two [[LAGEOS]] satellites, published in &lt;time&gt;1997&lt;/time&gt; and &lt;time&gt;2004&lt;/time&gt;, claimed to have found the frame-dragging effect with an accuracy of about 20% and 10% respectively,&lt;ref&gt;

The launch was planned for &lt;time datetime="2004-04-19"&gt;19 April 2004&lt;/time&gt; at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] but was scrubbed within 5 minutes of the scheduled launch window due to changing winds in the upper atmosphere. An unusual feature of the mission is that it only had a one-second launch window due to the precise orbit required by the experiment. On &lt;time datetime="2004-04-20 09:57:23-07:00"&gt;20 April, at 9:57:23 AM&lt;/time&gt; [[Time zone|PDT]] (&lt;time datetime="2004-04-20 16:57:23Z"&gt;16:57:23&lt;/time&gt; [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) the spacecraft was launched successfully. The satellite was placed in orbit at &lt;time datetime="2004-04-20 11:12:33-07:00"&gt;11:12:33&lt;/time&gt; AM (&lt;time datetime="2004-04-20 18:12:33Z"&gt;18:12:33&lt;/time&gt; UTC) after a cruise period over the south pole and a short second burn. The mission lasted 16 months.
 	
Some preliminary results were presented at a special session during the [[American Physical Society]] meeting in &lt;time datetime="2007-04"&gt;April 2007&lt;/time&gt;. NASA initially requested a proposal for extending the GP-B data analysis phase through &lt;time datetime="2007-12"&gt;December 2007&lt;/time&gt;. The data analysis phase was further extended to &lt;time datetime="2008-09"&gt;September 2008&lt;/time&gt; using funding from [[Richard Fairbank]], Stanford and NASA, and beyond that point using non-NASA funding only.&lt;ref name = "Gugliotta2009"/&gt; Final science results were reported in &lt;time&gt;2011&lt;/time&gt;.

[[Image:Gravity Probe B Confirms the Existence of Gravitomagnetism.jpg|thumb]]

The ''Gravity Probe B'' experiment comprised four [[Gyroscope#London moment|London moment gyroscopes]] and a reference [[telescope]] sighted on HR8703 (also known as [[IM Pegasi]]), a [[binary star]] in the constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. In [[polar orbit]], with the gyro spin directions also pointing toward HR8703, the frame-dragging and geodetic effects came out at right angles, each gyroscope measuring both.

The gyroscopes were housed in a [[Dewar flask|dewar]] of [[superfluid]] [[helium]], maintaining a temperature of under {{convert|2|K|C F|sigfig=3|abbr=out|lk=on}}. Near-[[absolute zero]] temperatures were required to minimize molecular interference, and enable the [[lead]] and [[niobium]] components of the gyroscope mechanisms to become [[superconductivity|superconductive]].

At the time of their manufacture, the gyroscopes were the most nearly spherical objects ever made.  (Two gyroscopes still hold that record, but third place has been taken by the silicon spheres made by the [[Kilogram#Avogadro project|Avogadro project]].)  Approximately the size of [[ping pong]] balls, they were perfectly round to within forty [[atom]]s (less than {{val|10|u=nm}}). If one of these spheres were scaled to the size of the Earth, the tallest mountains and deepest ocean trench would measure only 
{{convert|2.4|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were composed of [[fused quartz]] and coated with an extremely thin layer of [[niobium]].  A primary concern was minimizing any influence on their spin, so the gyroscopes could never touch their containing compartment.  They were held suspended with electric fields, spun up using a flow of helium gas, and their spin axes were sensed by monitoring the magnetic field of the superconductive niobium layer with [[SQUID]]s. (A spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field precisely aligned with the rotation axis; see [[London moment]].)

[[IM Pegasi]] was chosen as the guide star for multiple reasons. First, it needed to be bright enough to be usable for sightings. Then it was close to the ideal positions near at the [[celestial equator]] of the [[Equatorial coordinate system|sky coordinates]]. Also important was its well understood motion in the sky, which was helped by the fact that this star emits relatively strong [[Radio astronomy|radio signals]]. In preparation for the setup of this mission, astronomers analyzed the radio-based position measurements with respect to far distant quasars taken over several years to understand its motion as precisely as needed.

==History==
[[Image:Gravity Probe turning axis.gif|thumb|A representation of the geodetic effect.]]

The conceptual design for this mission was first proposed by an [[MIT]] professor, George Pugh, who was working with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in &lt;time&gt;1959&lt;/time&gt; and later discussed by [[Leonard Schiff]] ([[Stanford]]) in &lt;time&gt;1960&lt;/time&gt; at Pugh's suggestion, based partly on a theoretical paper about detecting frame dragging that Schiff had written in &lt;time&gt;1957&lt;/time&gt;. It was proposed to NASA in &lt;time&gt;1961&lt;/time&gt;, and they supported the project with funds in &lt;time&gt;1964&lt;/time&gt;. This grant ended in &lt;time&gt;1977&lt;/time&gt; after a long phase of [[engineering]] research into the basic requirements and tools for the satellite.

In &lt;time&gt;1986&lt;/time&gt; NASA changed plans for the [[Space Shuttle|shuttle]], which forced the mission team to switch from a shuttle-based launch design to one that was based on the Delta 2, and in &lt;time&gt;1995&lt;/time&gt; tests planned of a prototype on a shuttle flight were cancelled as well.

Gravity Probe B marks the first time in history that a university has been in control of the development and operations of a space satellite funded by NASA.

Total cost of this project was about $750 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/73870/title/Gravity_Probe_B_finally_pays_off_ |title=Gravity Probe B finally pays off |author=Devin Powell |date=4 May 2011 |work=Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;'''&lt;time datetime="2005-09-26"&gt;26 September 2005&lt;/time&gt;'''
: The calibration phase ended with liquid helium still in the dewar. The spacecraft was returned to science mode pending the depletion of the last of the liquid helium.

;'''&lt;time datetime="2006-02"&gt;February 2006&lt;/time&gt;'''
: Phase I of data analysis complete

;'''&lt;time datetime="2006-09"&gt;September 2006&lt;/time&gt;'''

:  Publication of GP-B Special Volume (Volume #32, Issue #22) in the peer-reviewed journal, ''[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Focus issue: Gravity Probe B |journal=Classical and Quantum |author=Clifford M Will |date=17 November 2015 |volume=32 |issue=22 |publisher=IOP |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0264-9381/page/Focus-issue-on-Gravity-Probe-B |accessdate=3 September 2016 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/32/22/220301 |bibcode=2015CQGra..32v0301W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On &lt;time datetime="2007-02-09"&gt;9 February 2007&lt;/time&gt;, it was announced that a number of unexpected signals had been received  and that these would need to be separated out before final results could be  released. In &lt;time datetime="2007-04"&gt;April&lt;/time&gt; it was announced that the spin axes of the gyroscopes were affected by torque, in a manner that varied over time, requiring further analysis to allow the results to be corrected for this source of error. Consequently, the date for the final release of data was pushed back several times. In the data for the frame-dragging results presented at the &lt;time datetime="2007-04"&gt;April 2007&lt;/time&gt; meeting of the American Physical Society, the random errors were much larger than the theoretical expected value and scattered on both the positive and negative sides of a null result, therefore causing skepticism as to whether any useful data could be extracted in the future to test this effect.

In &lt;time datetime="2007-06"&gt;June 2007&lt;/time&gt;, a detailed update was released explaining the cause of the problem, and the solution that was being worked on. Although electrostatic patches caused by non-uniform coating of the spheres were anticipated, and were thought to have been controlled for before the experiment, it was subsequently found that the final layer of the coating on the spheres defined two halves of slightly different [[Volta potential|contact potential]], which gave the sphere an electrostatic axis. This created a classical dipole torque on each rotor, of a magnitude similar to the expected frame dragging effect. In addition, it dissipated energy from the [[polhode|polhode motion]] by inducing currents in the housing electrodes, causing the motion to change with time. This meant that a simple time-average polhode model was insufficient, and a detailed orbit by orbit model was needed to remove the effect. As it was anticipated that "anything could go wrong", the final part of the flight mission was calibration, where amongst other activities, data was gathered with the spacecraft axis deliberately mis-aligned for &lt;time datetime="PT24h"&gt;24 hours&lt;/time&gt;, to exacerbate any potential problems. This data proved invaluable for identifying the effects. With the electrostatic torque modeled as a function of axis misalignment, and the polhode motion modeled at a sufficiently fine level, it was hoped to isolate the relativity torques to the originally expected resolution.

Stanford agreed to release the raw data to the public at an unspecified date in the future. It is likely that this data will be examined by independent scientists and independently reported to the public well after the final release by the project scientists. Because future interpretations of the data by scientists outside GP-B may differ from the official results, it may take several more years for all of the data received by GP-B to be completely understood.

===NASA review===
A review by a panel of 15 experts commissioned by NASA recommended against extending the data analysis phase beyond &lt;time&gt;2008&lt;/time&gt;. They warned that the required reduction in noise level (due to classical torques and breaks in data collection due to solar flares) "is so large that any effect ultimately detected by this experiment will have to overcome considerable (and in our opinion, well justified) skepticism in the scientific community".&lt;ref&gt;

===Data analysis after NASA===
NASA funding and sponsorship of the program ended on &lt;time datetime="2008-09-30"&gt;30 September 2008&lt;/time&gt;, but GP-B secured alternative funding from [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref name = "Gugliotta2009"/&gt; that enabled the science team to continue working at least through &lt;time datetime="2009-12"&gt;December 2009&lt;/time&gt;. On &lt;time datetime="2008-08-29"&gt;29 August 2008&lt;/time&gt;, the 18th meeting of the external GP-B Science Advisory Committee was held at Stanford to report progress. The ensuing SAC report to NASA states:

{{quote|The progress reported at SAC-18 was truly extraordinary and we commend the GPB team for this achievement. This has been a heroic effort, and has brought the experiment from what seemed like a state of potential failure, to a position where the SAC now believes that they will obtain a credible test of relativity, even if the accuracy does not meet the original goal. In the opinion of the SAC Chair, this rescue warrants comparison with the mission to correct the flawed optics of the Hubble Space Telescope, only here at a minuscule fraction of the cost.|SAC #18 Report to NASA}}

The Stanford-based analysis group and NASA announced on &lt;time datetime="2011-05-04"&gt;4 May 2011&lt;/time&gt; that the data from GP-B indeed confirms the two predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/may/gravity-probe-mission-050411.html |title=Stanford's Gravity Probe B confirms two Einstein theories |website=Stanford News |publisher=Stanford University |date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings were published in the journal [[Physical Review Letters]].&lt;ref name=PRL&gt;{{cite journal | author=Everitt | display-authors=etal | date=2011| title=Gravity Probe B: Final Results of a Space Experiment to Test General Relativity| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume = 106 | issue = 22 | page=221101 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.221101 |arxiv =1105.3456 | bibcode=2011PhRvL.106v1101E | pmid=21702590}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The prospects for further experimental measurement of frame-dragging after GP-B were commented on in the journal [[Europhysics Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = L.

'''Green Charge Networks, LLC''' is an [[energy storage]] company based in [[Santa Clara, California]] that goes by the name Green Charge. Founded in 2009, Green Charge focuses on helping businesses and institutions reduce [[peak demand]] charges through a combination of predictive software and battery hardware the company calls "power efficiency.".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lacy, [http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Distributed-Storage-Coming-to-Your-Neighborhood-7-Eleven "Distributed Storage Coming to Your Neighborhood 7-11"], ''Greentechmedia'',  February 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy storage projects==
The first pilot GreenStation intelligent demand reduction system was installed in July 2011 at a 7-Eleven in New York. Triple Pundit notes that the success of that first pilot project to "reduce grid demand, boost power efficiency and deliver savings month after month has driven GCN’s rapid transition from pilot stage to commercial scale."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Burger, [http://www.triplepundit.com/2014/02/7-eleven-avis-walgreens-reduce-peak-power-demand-realize-big-energy-savings "7-Eleven, Avis, Walgreens Reduce Peak Power Demand For Big Energy Savings"], ''Triple Pundit'',  February 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The first GreenStation garnered some attention when it survived [[Hurricane Sandy]] and then saved the 7-Eleven store 56 percent on their utility bills during New York's 2013 summer heat wave.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Schroeder, [http://domesticfuel.com/2014/02/18/green-charge-networks-help-save-green/ "Green Charge Networks Help Save Green"], ''Domestic Fuel'',  February 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2014 Green Charge announced that it had signed 1.5 MW of energy storage projects with high-profile clients including 7-Eleven, Avis, Walgreens and others.&lt;ref&gt;Green Charge Networks, [http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/02/prweb11551684.htm "Businesses and Municipalities Look to Save Money Through Smart Grid Technologies"], ''PR Web'',  February 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The company has set a goal of completing 5 MW by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kelly-Detwiler, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/03/31/green-charge-networks-in-some-markets-cost-effective-energy-storage-is-already-here/ "Green Charge Networks: In Some Markets, Cost-Effective Energy Storage Is Already Here"], ''Forbes'', March 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power efficiency==
Green Charge claims to be the first company to offer Power Efficiency Leases. Similar to the way that solar leases helped solar become mainstream by allowing more homeowners to go solar with zero money down, Green Charge aims to help more businesses utilize energy storage by offering systems at zero upfront cost.&lt;ref&gt;Green Charge, [http://www.greenchargenet.com/power-efficiency-products "Products"], ''Green Charge Networks website'', Accessed February 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of power efficiency builds off the difference between energy (kWh) and power (kW). Energy efficiency focuses on reducing the amount of energy consumed while power efficiency focuses on reducing the rate at which energy is used, also known as [[peak demand]].&lt;ref&gt;BizEE, [http://www.energylens.com/articles/kw-and-kwh "kW and kWh Explained"], ''BizEE: Energy Lens'', Accessed February 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Green Charge received $12 million in a grant from the [[United States Department of Energy]] in 2011. The company received further funding from angel investor Richard Lowenthal, founder and CTO of car charging network [[Coulomb Technologies|ChargePoint]], in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;CleantechIQ Staff, [http://cleantechiq.com/2013/12/doe-backed-distributed-storage-startup-receives-first-angel-funding "DOE-Backed Distributed Storage Startup Receives First Angel Funding"], ''CleantechIQ'', December 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Green Charge received $10 million in financing from TIP Capital to finance energy storage projects for their customers with zero upfront cost.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kelly-Detwiler, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/03/31/green-charge-networks-in-some-markets-cost-effective-energy-storage-is-already-here/ "Green Charge Networks: In Some Markets, Cost-Effective Energy Storage Is Already Here"], ''Forbes'', March 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Green Charge secured $56 million in capital from K Road DG, a distributed energy and smart grid solution company.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Clancy, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherclancy/2014/07/29/green-charge-networks-gets-56-million-infusion/ "Green Charge Networks Gets $56 Million Infusion"], ''Forbes'', July 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;Iris Dorbian, [https://www.pehub.com/2014/07/green-charge-bags-56-mln/ "Green Charge bags $56 mln"], ''PE HUB'', July 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, [[Engie]] acquired an 80 percent stake in Green Charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Grejs River''' ({{lang-da|Grejs Å}}) is an approximately {{convert|22|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} river in [[Vejle Municipality]] in [[Denmark]]. Its source is [[Fårup Lake]], south of the village of [[Jelling]]. It starts by heading east through a [[tunnel valley]], then turns south to run through '''Grejs Valley''' ({{lang-da|Grejsdalen}}), the largest [[gorge]] in Denmark, until it reaches the city of [[Vejle]].&lt;ref name="leksikon"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bohn, Helle|title=Grejsdalen|language=Danish|website=Leksikon|publisher=Gyldendal|date=28 January 2014|access-date=25 September 2016|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Jylland/Grejsdalen}}&lt;/ref&gt; North of Vejle, it splits into two branches, Omløbsåen ("Bypass River") and Mølleåen ("Mill River"). Omløbsåen runs west around the city centre to meet [[Vejle River]], while Mølleåen flows through the city and empties into Vejle River just south of the city centre.

==Grejs Valley==

[[File:Grejsdalen set fra skaerbaekbakken mod Vejle - N Bredal.jpg|thumb|19th-century drawing of Grejs Valley by Niels Andreas Bredal]]

A section of the Grejs River runs through Grejs Valley ({{lang-da|Grejsdalen}}), the largest gorge in Denmark. The gorge is about {{convert|1|km|mi}} long and {{convert|50|to|70|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name="leksikon"/&gt; The gorge's cliffs are primarily [[travertine]] and [[limestone]], some of which has been quarried as a building material. The traditional churches in nearby Hornstrup, Hover, and Jelling, as well as the modern Grejs Church, are built with Grejs Valley stone.&lt;ref name="visitvejle"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Grejså moser.jpg|thumb|Grejs River near its source at Fårup Lake]]

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Grejs River was used as a source of water power for about 14 [[watermill]]s, which powered textile, paper, and metal factories.&lt;ref name="leksikon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="visitvejle"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--staff author--&gt;|title=Grejsdalen|language=Danish|website=VisitVejle|access-date=25 September 2016|url=http://www.visitvejle.dk/grejsdalen-gdk607947}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Grejs Mølle Klædefabrik (Grejs Mill Textile Factory) was the country's largest private textile factory in 1830, employing 150 people. At the height of its activity around the turn of the twentieth century, the river had the highest concentration of industrial mills in the country.

As of 2016, a [[pumping station]] was under construction at the confluence of Vejle River and the Omløbsåen branch of Grejs River in order to prevent high water levels in Vejle River and Vejle Fjord from backing up into Grejs River and causing floods.&lt;ref name="tvsyd"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nygaard, Jørgen|title=Rejsegilde på Vejles værn mod oversvømmelser|trans-title=Topping out for Vejle's flood protection|language=Danish|website=TV Syd|date=1 August 2016|access-date=25 September 2016|url=http://www.tvsyd.dk/artikel/rejsegilde-paa-vejles-vaern-mod-oversvoemmelser}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jv"&gt;{{cite web|author=Johansen, Kaare|title=Første test af sluse og pumpeanlæg|trans-title=First test of sluice and pump system|language=Danish|website=JydskeVestkysten|date=8 July 2016|access-date=25 September 2016|url=http://www.jv.dk/artikel/2340656:Trekanten--Foerste-test-af-sluse-og-pumpeanlaeg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, {{convert|220|ha}} of the upper Grejs River and the nearby [[Lerbæk Forest]] were set aside as a nature preserve, and in 2007, an additional {{convert|35|ha}} were added to the preserve.&lt;ref name="fredninger"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--staff author--&gt;|title=Grejs Ådal|trans-title=Grejs River Valley|language=Danish|publisher=Danmarks Naturfredningsforening|access-date=25 September 2016|url=http://www.fredninger.dk/fredning/grejs-aadal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was also designated a [[Natura 2000]] nature conservation area.&lt;ref name="natura 2000"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--staff author--&gt;|title=Natura 2000-planer 2016-21|trans-title=Natura 2000 Plans 2016-21|language=Danish|publisher=Agency for Water and Nature Management, Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark|access-date=25 September 2016|url=http://svana.dk/natur/natura-2000/natura-2000-planer/natura-2000-planer-2016-21/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Trade association|membership organisation]] which promotes [[best practice]] across the voluntary [[Personal carbon trading|carbon market]].&lt;ref name="TheAge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T7195727016&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T7195727021&amp;cisb=22_T7195727020&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=314239&amp;docNo=12|title=New international standards organisation hopes for plenty of carbon copies|last=Murphy|first=Mathew|format=fee required|date=9 June 2008|work=The Age|publisher=The Age Company|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICROA’s membership consists of those established carbon reduction and [[Carbon offset|offset]] providers based in the United States, European and [[Asia-Pacific]] markets which commit to the ICROA Code of Best Practice.&lt;ref name="TheAge"/&gt;

ICROA was established in 2008 to provide [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] of the voluntary carbon market.&lt;ref name="TheAge"/&gt;  Members produce an annual report demonstrating compliance with the ICROA Code. The ICROA Code promotes a combined ‘reduce and offset’ approach&lt;ref name="BusinessGreen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2248349/voluntary-carbon-market-sees|title=Offsetters predict end to the downturn as customers return|last=Young|first=Tom|date=24 August 2009|work=BusinessGreen|publisher=Incisive Media|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to carbon management and has specific requirements for how members provide their carbon footprinting, [[Greenhouse Gas]] (GHG) reduction advice and offsetting services.

== History ==

ICROA was launched by eight carbon reduction and offset providers on June 9, 2008.&lt;ref name="Murray20080609"&gt;{{cite web | last = Murray | first = James | date = June 9, 2008 | title = New global offset trade group aims to clean up market | work = BusinessGreen | url = http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2218548/global-offset-trade-group-aims | accessdate = August 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the initial eight, ICROA has been open to new members which meet its membership criteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Climate Neutral Group and First Climate Join Leading Alliance of Carbon Reduction and Offset Providers (press release) | work = International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance | date = September 3, 2008 | url = http://www.icroa.org/pdf/ICROA-New-Members-Press-Release-04.09.08.pdf | accessdate = August 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PolicyFramework"&gt;{{cite book | year = 2009 | title = Programme and Policy Framework 2009 | publisher = International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance | url = http://icroa.org/pdf/ICROA-Programme-and-Policy-Framework-v-2009.pdf | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was reflected in their early announcement that they intended to increase fourfold over the following twelve months.&lt;ref name="Murray20080728"&gt;{{cite web | last = Murray | first = James | date = July 28, 2008 | title = Offset group aiming to quadruple in size | work = BusinessGreen | url = http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2222661/offset-group-aiming-quadruple | accessdate = August 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the co-chairman of the organization, Jonathan Shopley, stated in 2008 that most offset providers would not be qualified to join.&lt;ref name="Taylor20080813"&gt;{{cite web | last = Taylor | first = Ian | date = August 13, 2008 | title = Carbon-offset provider association faces criticism | work = Travel Weekly | url = http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2008/08/13/28494/carbon-offset-provider-association-faces-criticism.html | accessdate = August 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ICROA headquartered in the [[United Kingdom]], the eight founding members consisted of five British firms (Carbon Clear, [[The Carbon Neutral Company]], ClimateCare, co2balance and Targetneutral), two from the [[United States]] (Native Energy and [[TerraPass]]), and one from [[Australia]] (Climate Friendly).&lt;ref name="TheAge" /&gt;  Current membership is eleven companies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Membership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icroa.org/contact.html|title=ICROA Members|publisher=ICROA|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ICROA Code of Best Practice ==

The ICROA Code is available in full on the ICROA website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icroa.com/pdf/ICROA-Programme-and-Policy-Framework-v-2009.pdf ICROA Code of Best Practice ]&lt;/ref&gt; The key points are:

# Members will help their customers to measure their [[carbon footprint]] according to accepted international standards, and will set their emissions reduction targets based on scientific assessments.
# The ICROA Code explicitly recognizes that offsetting alone is not a sound approach to carbon management, therefore members should support a ‘reduce and offset’ approach to carbon management.
# Offsetting projects must meet the following criteria: real, permanent, independently verified, unique and additional. So far ICROA accepts the following standards: Clean Development Mechanism/Joint Implementation, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Voluntary Carbon Standard. ICROA may also use offsets from approved Government schemes. This is on the proviso that the Government scheme certified offsets will only be used within the context of the Government scheme and will not be sold as voluntary offsets outside the context of the scheme, unless these methodologies have been separately approved by ICROA. Schemes that have approved for use so far by ICROA members are: [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] Climate Leaders.
# ICROA members must follow the ICROA Code, and produce an annual report demonstrating their compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stoddard | first = Tim | date = February 17, 2009 | title = Voluntary Carbon Needs Self-Regulation and Global Code of Conduct | work = EcoSystem Marketplace | url = http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/article.opinion.php?component_id=6522&amp;component_version_id=9766&amp;language_id=12 | accessdate = August 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In February 2009, ICROA criticised the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] quality assurance scheme for carbon offsets as it did not include voluntary emissions cuts (VERS).  In a statement a spokesman said, "Unfortunately, it still fails to recognise VERs and we feel very strongly there's no reason for this."&lt;ref name="ENDS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T7196489561&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T7196489564&amp;cisb=22_T7196489563&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=235906&amp;docNo=7|title=Carbon offset providers to reject government code|format=fee required|date=24 February 2009|work=ENDS Report|publisher=Haymarket Publishing Services|pages=12|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn ICROA was criticised by Dr Bruce Elliott, managing director of carbon offset company [[Clear (UK company)|Clear]] which had achieved accreditation under the government scheme.&lt;ref name="DECC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://offsetting.defra.gov.uk/cms/approved-offsets/ |title=The UK Government's Quality Assurance Scheme for Carbon Offsetting |publisher=Department of Energy and Climate Change |accessdate=2009-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921050744/http://offsetting.defra.gov.uk/cms/approved-offsets/ |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot stated that, "The trade body which represents offset organisations who sell VERs, ICROA, have unsurprisingly been vociferous in their criticism of the scheme.  Many of its members have substantial investments in VER projects which now face an uncertain future without the government’s backing.  This financial conflict of interest is readily apparent in their persistent public criticism of a scheme which matches or sets higher standards than its own code of conduct for the majority of criteria."&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.clear-offset.com/|title=Carbon offsets now approved by the UK Government|last=Elliott|first=Bruce|date=5 February 2009|work=The Clear Blog|publisher=Clear|accessdate=2009-08-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522053700/http://blog.clear-offset.com/|archivedate=22 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, The UK Government's Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) for Carbon Offsetting, closed down. In a letter to the members of the QAS Advisory Board, including ICROA, the Head of DECC's Low Carbon Economy Unit stated 'The carbon market has moved on substantially since the introduction of the QAS and we now believe it is for the market to set best practice for carbon offsetting.'

'''James Colnett''' (1753 &amp;ndash; 1 September 1806) was an officer of the British [[Royal Navy]], an explorer, and a [[maritime fur trade]]r. He served under [[James Cook]] during Cook's [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] of exploration. Later he led two private trading expeditions that involved collecting [[sea otter]] pelts in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of North America and selling them in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], where the [[British East India Company]] maintained a trading post. Wintering in the recently discovered [[Hawaiian Islands]] was a key component of the new trade system. Colnett is remembered largely for his involvement in the [[Nootka Crisis]] of 1789&amp;mdash;initially a dispute between British traders and the [[Spanish Navy]] over the use of [[Nootka Sound]] on [[Vancouver Island]] that became an international crisis that led Britain and Spain to the brink of war before being peacefully resolved through diplomacy and the signing of the [[Nootka Conventions]].

Due to Colnett's central role in the initial incident that sparked the international crisis, Colnett's account of his second fur trading voyage, including the events at Nootka Sound in 1789, was published in 1940, as part of the [[Champlain Society|Champlain Society's]] General Series. His first trading voyage journal remained unpublished until 2005.&lt;ref name=ohq&gt;{{cite web |title= A Voyage to the North West Side of America: The Journals of James Colnett, 1786–89 (book review) |publisher= Oregon Historical Quarterly |url= http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ohq/106.1/br_7.html |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Colnett was born in [[Devon]] at [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]] in 1753, and was [[baptism|baptised]] on 18 October 1753 at [[Stoke Damerel]] parish church, [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite book |last=David | chapter=Colnett, James (bap. 1753, d. 1806)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/64852| title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were James and Sarah (née Lang) Colnett. He had two older sisters and one younger brother.&lt;ref name=robson&gt;{{cite web |title= The Men who sailed with Captain James Cook |author= John Robson |url=http://pages.quicksilver.net.nz/jcr/~cookmen31.html |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known about his life until he joined the Royal Navy as an able-bodied seaman in 1770.&lt;ref name=galois&gt;{{cite book |last= Galois |first= Robert |title= Voyage to the Northwest Side of America: The Journals of James Colnett, 1786-89 |date= 2004 |publisher= University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |isbn= 978-0-7748-0855-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WX9HiIsiMZgC |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colnett joined the Royal Navy in June 1770, initially serving as an able seaman aboard {{HMS|Hazard|1749|6}}, and then aboard {{HMS|Scorpion|1746|6}} as a [[midshipman]] under Lieutenant [[James Cook]] from September until December 1771, when both Cook and Colnett moved to {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}}.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Colnett served as a midshipman during Cook's second voyage to the Pacific Ocean between 1772 and 1775.&lt;ref name=ohq/&gt; After returning to England in 1775, Colnett continued to serve in the Royal Navy during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], being appointed gunner aboard {{HMS|Juno|1757|6}} on 1 January 1776 and then as [[Master (naval)|master]] of {{HMS|Adventure|1771|6}}.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He rose in the ranks, passing his lieutenant's examination on 4 February 1779, and ten days later, on 14 February, he was appointed third lieutenant of {{HMS|Bienfaisant|1758|6}}.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Voyage to the Northwest Side of America'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He was with ''Bienfaisant'' until 1783, when he joined {{HMS|Pegase|1782|6}} as her first lieutenant.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; On 17 August 1786 he went on half pay as work for naval officers fell following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tovell&gt;{{cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= University of British Columbia Press |date= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC |page= 352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1786 and 1791 Colnett led two private fur-trading ventures. With the Royal Navy's approval and a leave of absence he was first given command of a two-vessel fur trading expedition to the Pacific Northwest coast, Hawaii, and China. The vessels included the ''[[Prince of Wales (merchant ship)|Prince of Wales]]'' and ''[[Princess Royal (sloop)|Princess Royal]]''. Afterwards, a second expedition was organized with the ''Argonaut'' and the ''Princess Royal''. The second expedition culminated in the [[Nootka Crisis]].&lt;ref name=tovell/&gt; The first voyage was under the aegis of the London-based [[King George's Sound Company]], first known as Richard Cadman Etches and Company, which owned the ships. The second was a joint venture of the King George's Sound Company and [[John Meares]] and his partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Colnett |first= James |editor= F.W.

The idea had its origins in Cook’s third voyage, during which sea otter pelts obtained along the northwest coast of America, from Nootka Sound northwards, were sold for high prices and great profit in Canton.&lt;ref name=jmr&gt;[http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/ConJmrBookReview.105 A Voyage to the North West Side of America: The Journals of James Colnett, 1786-89 (book review)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817135914/http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/ConJmrBookReview.105 |date=17 August 2007 }}, Journal for Maritime Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==First fur trading voyage, 1786-1788==
During the first fur-trading venture Colnett was in command of a two-vessel expedition. Colnett himself was captain of the 171-ton ship ''Prince of Wales''. The second vessel was the 65-ton sloop ''[[Princess Royal (sloop)|Princess Royal]]'', under [[Charles Duncan (fur-trader)|Charles Duncan]]. The ships were owned by the King George's Sound Company, or Richard Cadman Etches and Company, and operated under licenses from the [[South Sea Company]] and the [[East India Company]], which had a monopoly on British trade in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut'', p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships left England on 23 September 1786, rounded [[Cape Horn]], and reached the Pacific Northwest late in the summer of 1787. After trading for furs with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples]] in the vicinity of the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], [[Aristazabal Island]], and [[Banks Island (British Columbia)|Banks Island]], Colnett and Duncan sailed to the Hawaiian Islands where they spent the winter. While on the coast of present-day [[British Columbia]] they had a series of [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] encounters with some of the [[Kitkatla]] [[Tsimshian]]. In Hawaii they were involved in several violent conflicts with the islanders, including one at [[Waimea Bay, Hawaii|Waimea Bay]], during which between five and fourteen [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] were killed.&lt;ref name=galois-allpages&gt;''Voyage to the Northwest Side of America'', pp. 9, 11, 17, 62, 99, 263-264, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

During his voyage, Colnett became the first European to see parts of the southern Queen Charlotte Islands. [[Juan José Pérez Hernández|Juan Pérez]] had visited the northern Queen Charlottes in 1774, but had not gone ashore. Colnett and his crew were among the first Europeans to set foot on the islands. They were also the first British explorers to contact the Tsimshian and southern Heiltsuk people.&lt;ref name=abc-colnett&gt;[http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=1990 Colnett, James], ABCBookWorld&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his primary focus was collecting sea otter pelts, Colnett explored the complex coastline in detail, apparently in hopes of finding the fabled [[Northwest Passage]]. His journal contains twelve maps of various channels, harbours, inlets, and other coastal features.&lt;ref name=ohq/&gt;

After spending the winter of 1787-88 in Hawaii, Colnett and Duncan returned to the Pacific Northwest to acquire more furs. Once on the coast they parted ways and operated separately, unlike the previous year when they remained in company. After trading through the summer Charles Duncan heading south for Nootka Sound. Before arriving he heard from fellow fur trader [[John Meares]] that Colnett was not at Nootka. Therefore, Duncan did not stop there but instead continued trading for furs south of Nootka Sound, in the vicinity of [[Clayoquot Sound]] and near the entrance of the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]. In August 1788 Duncan sailed the ''Princess Royal'' to Hawaii where he found Colnett and the ''Prince of Wales''. Together they sailed to Canton, China, arriving in late November 1788. They sold their cargo of sea otter pelts. The ''Prince of Wales'' was taken back to England via the [[Cape of Good Hope]], but James Colnett stayed in China. The ''Princess Royal'' also remained in order to carry out a second fur trading voyage starting the next year.&lt;ref name=galois-allpages/&gt; Colnett was given command of another two-vessel expedition. The ''Argonaut'' sailed under Colnett, with the ''Princess Royal'' under Thomas Hudson.

==Second fur trading voyage, 1789-1791==
During the time of Colnett's first voyage two other British ships, owned by [[John Meares]] and his partners, were trading on the North West coast. Meares had chosen not to pay for licenses from the East India Company and South Sea Company, instead striving to conceal the ship's illegal conduct by using the Portuguese flag. During the winter of 1788-89 the owners of all four vessels decided to form a joint venture under the protection of the licenses, although the South Sea Company license applied only to the ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Princess Royal''. The joint venture had no firm name; Meares called it variously "The Associated Merchants of London and India" or "The United Company of British Merchants Trading to the North West Coast of America". Colnett called it "The South Sea Company of London". It was loosely referred to as "this united Company". In early 1789 Colnett was given command of the joint undertaking as a whole. He was made captain of the ''Argonaut'' and given command over its tender, the ''Princess Royal'', under Thomas Hudson. The goal of the joint venture was not just to send vessels to the North West coast but also to set up a permanent trading post at Nootka Sound, to be named Fort Pitt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut'', p. xxi-xxii, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Meares claimed he had purchased land there from Chief [[Maquinna]] of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] (Nootka) people. The post could be built on Meares's land.&lt;ref name=abc-colnett/&gt; Later, the question of whether Meares had actually acquired land from Maquinna become an issue of contention. Even if he had there were unresolvable questions about the amount of land purchased and its location. In time Chief Maquinna denied that any such purchase had been made, saying instead that the Spanish had the only rightful claim to land at Nootka Sound. Meares, one of the primary forces behind the venture, hoped that a permanent post at Nootka Sound would establish his own dominance in the lucrative marine fur trade. However, before the British ships arrived Spanish forces had already occupied the harbour and established their own fort. By the time Colnett's ''Argonaut'' arrived at Nootka Sound, the first phase of the crisis had already begun. The Spanish had taken control of the port and seized Captain [[William Douglas (sea captain)|Douglas]] and his ship.&lt;ref name=abc-colnett/&gt;

==Nootka Crisis==

===Background===
Before the Nootka Crisis of 1789, Spain had long held that all foreign sailors in the Pacific Ocean were to be treated as enemies. Spanish claims of sovereignty, especially on the west coasts of the Americas, dated back centuries. One of the first serious threats to the Spanish claim came from the extension of Russian fur trading activity from Siberia to Alaska during the middle and later parts of the 18th century. Spain reacted not only by expanding the foothold already gained in [[Alta California]] but also by launching a series of exploration and reconnaissance voyages from [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]], Mexico, to Alaska. The purpose of these voyages was not only to ascertain the Russian threat but to reinforce their claims of sovereignty by right of first-discovery and through the use of formal possession-taking rituals, which were still regarded as a meaningful part of international law. Another purpose was to search for a possible Northwest Passage, which, if it existed and fell under the control of another nation such as Britain, could prove disastrous to New Spain's Pacific coast. [[Juan José Pérez Hernández|Juan Pérez]] was the first to sail to the far north, reaching the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1774. Subsequent expeditions were launched in 1775, 1779, and 1788. Detailed information about Russian activities in Alaska was acquired in 1788, including ominous indications that Russia might seize control of Nootka Sound. This, in addition to the rapidly increasing numbers of fur traders working the Pacific Northwest coast&amp;mdash;mainly British but also American and others&amp;mdash;coupled with Spain's firm claim of sovereignty north to 61°N latitude (the vicinity of [[Prince William Sound]], Alaska), and the lack of any Spanish outpost north of California, made it imperative that a firm stand be taken. During the 1780s Nootka Sound had become the focal point of all these conflicting factors. It was perhaps not the best port of the region, but it was well known and well charted, fairly easy to reach, and usefully located at a general base of operations and a place of rendezvous. Over the years it had become the fur-trader's primary harbour and gathering point. Factors such as these resulted in Russia, Britain, and Spain all deciding to build a fort there, in order to solidify their claims and interests. From Spain's perspective, which had long regarded the entire region as Spanish territory, the occupation of Nootka Sound would be the first step toward creating a new province of New Spain, north of California and south of Alaska. Implicit in such a plan was the restriction of free trade by other nations, a policy the Spanish had long enforced within the lands of the empire.&lt;ref name=abc-quadra&gt;[http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=3010 Bodega y Quadra, Juan Francisco], ABCBookWorld&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the British government, since the days of Queen Elizabeth, had been that its subjects had the right to navigate the ocean and visit, trade, and make settlements anywhere not already occupied by a civilized nation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut'', p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spanish claim the Sound===
In 1789 a Spanish expedition under [[Esteban José Martínez Fernández y Martínez de la Sierra|Estebàn José Martínez]] set sail from San Blas in order to occupy Nootka Sound. Arriving on 5 May 1789, the Spanish quickly built a few buildings and a small fort with the Spanish flag clearly displayed. Martinez formally occupied the land and began checking the papers of visiting vessels. Two American fur trading ships were already anchored in the sound, one of which was the ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]'', and more arrived later, including the ''[[Lady Washington]]'', under [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]]. Soon after Martínez secured control of the Nootka Sound a number of other vessels arrived, including the ''Princess Royal'', under Thomas Hudson, along with ''Iphigenia'' ([[William Douglas (sea captain)|William Douglas]]); the ''Argonaut'', under James Colnett, and ''North West America'', under Robert Funter&amp;mdash;all British fur trading vessels. Martínez was particularly troubled by the appearance of Colnett's ''Argonaut''. Not only was the ''Argonaut'' carrying material and supplies obviously intended for the construction of a permanent base, but a group of Chinese laborers were also on board, one of the first examples of "[[coolie]]" labour in the Pacific Northwest. Martínez, whose warships gave him ''de facto'' control, asserted Spanish sovereignty. After a heated exchange between the two men, Martínez had Colnett arrested, along with the crew of the ''Argonaut''. Martínez wrote in his journal about personal insults slung at him by Colnett. He was also irritated by Colnett having sailed the ''Argonaut'' under Portuguese rather than a British flag, which he felt was deceptive.&lt;ref name=beyondthemap&gt;[http://www.beyondthemap.ca/english/historical_nootka.html Nootka Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716165618/http://www.beyondthemap.ca/english/historical_nootka.html |date=16 July 2009 }}, Beyond the Map&lt;/ref&gt; After a complicated series of events, Martínez ended up with three captured ships and their crews, including the ''Argonaut'', ''Princess Royal'', and ''[[John Meares|North West America]]''. Hudson had taken the ''Princess Royal'' into Nootka Sound earlier and had been allowed to leave on the condition he proceed to China. Instead, he collected more furs from the region and returned to Nootka Sound, expecting Martínez would no longer be there. Hudson did not intend to enter the sound but the ''Princess Royal'' was becalmed on an incoming tide. A Spanish longboat captured the ship and towed it in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haycox |first= Stephen |title= Alaska: An American Colony |date= 2006 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-98629-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=natRq6WCu4oC |pages= 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoners were eventually released and the ships returned. The Chinese workers were forced to help build [[Fort San Miguel]], a small battery of Spanish cannon overlooking the entrance to Friendly Cove, the main harbour of Nootka Sound at the time.&lt;!--I'm sure there is a reference source for this, I'm just having trouble finding it--&gt;

===Nootka Conventions===
The British ships captured by Martínez, along with Colnett and his crew, still prisoners, were taken to the Spanish naval base at San Blas, Mexico. In Britain, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] soon learned what had happened to the British ships, officers, and crews. The arrest of James Colnett, who was after all still an officer of the Royal Navy, was particularly troublesome in England.&lt;ref name=abc-quadra/&gt; Angered by the incident and by ongoing competition with Spain for the Pacific Northwest, the British threatened war. France, a Spanish ally, was coping with the early stages of the [[French Revolution]] and would not be able to fight for Spain in an armed conflict. Without the French, Spain could not realistically secure their massive North and South American territories in the event of war with Britain. Bowing to pressure from Britain, Spain agreed to sign the [[Nootka Conventions]] in 1790, ending the Nootka Crisis and beginning the first phase of the Spanish withdrawal from the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name=beyondthemap/&gt; Three separate Nootka Conventions were signed and it took over five years to resolve the many outstanding problems. Among other things, Spain agreed to restore the captured ships to their owners and pay them an indemnity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= The Nootka Connection: Europe and the Northwest Coast 1790-1795 |date= 1980 |publisher= Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-88894-279-6 |pages= 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both nations sent officials to Nootka Sound in order to carry out the details of the Nootka Conventions. [[George Vancouver]] served as Britain's representative at Nootka, while [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] served as Spain's. While both were respectful toward one another and even became friends, they could not reach an agreement about how to carry out their instructions. They decided instead to await further instructions. At this time, they decided to name the large island on which Nootka was now proven to be located as "Quadra and Vancouver Island". Years later, as Spanish influence declined, the name was shortened to simply Vancouver Island.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voyage of George Vancouver 1791-1795, Volume 1'', ed: W. Kaye Lamb, Hakluyt Society, 1984, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain continued to occupy Nootka Sound until 28 March 1795. Under the Nootka Convention, Britain and Spain agreed not to establish any permanent base at Nootka Sound, but ships from either nation could visit. The two nations also agreed to prevent any other nation from establishing sovereignty.&lt;ref name=fryer&gt;{{cite book |last= Fryer |first= Mary Beacock |title= Battlefields of Canada |date= 1986 |publisher= Dundurn Press |isbn= 1-55002-007-2 |pages= 131–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further trading===
After the initial crisis at Nootka Sound, James Colnett was taken to San Blas, New Spain, and kept under Spanish custody until released in May 1790. His company's ship, the ''Argonaut'' was returned to his command. He was still not permitted to leave until July, after which he sailed north to [[Clayoquot Sound]] where he resumed his fur trading activities. In early 1791, he revisited Nootka Sound.&lt;ref name=abc-colnett/&gt; By then [[Francisco de Eliza]] was the Spanish commandant at Nootka. Colnett had been given a passport by the Vice Roy of New Spain allowing him to sail to Nootka Sound in order to receive the ''Princess Royal'', which had been seized in 1789, but to then  leave the coast because it was, the Vice Roy said, Spanish territory. Colnett was also forbidden to trade with the indigenous peoples. However, when Colnett arrived at Nootka he told Eliza, the commandant, that the passport had been lost at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= The Nootka Connection: Europe and the Northwest Coast 1790-1795 |date= 1980 |publisher= Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-88894-279-6 |page= 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colnett spent about five months trading along the coast, acquiring about 1,100 sea otter pelts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut'', pp. xxviii, 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Colnett arrived at Nootka Sound the ''Princess Royal'' had sailed to San Blas, arriving there about 13 November 1790.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut'', pp. 184-185&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it could not be returned to Colnett as required by the Nootka Conventions. The governments of Spain and Britain agreed that the vessel would be returned to its owners in [[Macau]]. [[Manuel Quimper]] sailed it from San Blas to the [[Philippines]], stopping at Hawaii on the way. Another Spanish officer was to take the vessel from the Philippines to Macau. Meanwhile, Colnett, having finished trading on the North West coast also sailed to China via Hawaii. By chance both Colnett and Quimper arrived at Hawaii in March 1791. The two met. Colnett demanded that the ''Princess Royal'' be turned over at once, while Quimper explained his orders were to take it to the Philippines. Colnett became angry and prepared to seize the ship by force. The quarrel was calmed by John Kendrick Jr. (sometimes known as Juan Kendrick) who had come to Nootka in 1788 aboard the [[Columbia Rediviva]] with his father [[John Kendrick (American sea captain)|John Kendrick]], entered Spanish service as a pilot, and was now on board the ''Princess Royal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nokes |first= Richard |title= Almost a Hero The Voyages of John Meares, R.N., to China, Hawaii and the Northwest Coast |date=1998 |publisher=WSU Press |pages= 147–148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quimper slipped away at a convenient time and sailed to [[Manila]], arriving in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pethick |first= Derek |title= The Nootka Connection: Europe and the Northwest Coast 1790-1795 |date= 1980 |publisher= Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-88894-279-6 |pages= 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colnett sailed from Hawaii to China, arriving at Macau on 30 May 1791. To his chagrin he found that the Chinese officials had prohibited all ships with furs from entering the port of Canton. China was at war with Russia and thought the ban on fur trading would injure Russia. The prohibition was imposed in early 1791 and lifted on 30 May 1792.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut'', pp. 229, 237&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to sell his cargo, Colnett sailed to Japan in a bold but unsuccessful attempt to trade there. Thus the ''Argonaut'' under Colnett was the first British ship to try to re-open trade with Japan since 1673, when the East India Company's ship ''Return'' tried and likewise failed. Eventually Colnett was able to sell some of his furs in northern China. He then sailed for England with his remaining cargo, which he sold to the East India Company for ₤9,760.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Captain James Colnett aboard the Argonaut'', p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 1792, he sailed to the [[Galapagos Islands]] on behalf of private whaling interests. His work led to the development of whaling near the Galapagos Islands.&lt;ref name=abc-colnett/&gt; The maps from the survey carried out in 1793, 1794 are inscribed by Captain James Colnett of the Royal Navy in the merchant-ship Rattler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chart of the Galapagos, surveyed in the merchant ship Rattler, and drawn by Capt.

==Later life==
Colnett returned to England after the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and was promoted to commander on 19 December 1794.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He was given command of the sloop {{HMS|Merlin|1780|6}}, and in March 1795 examined the coastal defences of the east coast of England from the [[River Thames]] to [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] aboard the [[galley]] {{HMS|Hawk|1795|6}}, subsequently producing a report for the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He was advanced to [[post-captain]] on 4 October 1796 and appoint to command {{HMS|Hussar|1784|6}} the following day.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; His period of command was short-lived, ''Hussar'' was wrecked off the coast of [[Brittany]] and Colnett was captured and imprisoned for six months by the French.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; On his release he was tried by court-martial for the loss of his ship, but was acquitted.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; After his release he tried to convince the Royal Navy to launch a surprise attack against Spain's poorly defended Pacific coast.&lt;ref name=abc-colnett/&gt; On 29 June 1802, he was appointed to command the transport {{HMS|Glatton|1795|6}}, on what became his last Pacific voyage.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In command of ''Glatton'', he sailed on 23 September with 399 convicts and some free settlers to Australia.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Only 12 of the convicts died during the voyage. Before departing Sydney, Colnett unsuccessfully petitioned Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] for a free pardon for one of the female convicts, so that she might share his cabin for the return voyage to England.&lt;ref&gt;Bladen 1979, p.414&lt;/ref&gt;  His petition having failed, Colnett set sail for home with a cargo of timber for use in the Royal dockyards.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;  He remained in command of ''Glatton'' until 7 March 1805, when he retired on half-pay. He died at his lodgings at [[Great Ormond Street]] in London on 1 September 1806.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; The bulk of his estate he left to his daughter, Elizabeth, although he had never married.&lt;ref&gt;''A Voyage to the North West Side of America'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Wharram''' (born 15 May 1928 in [[Manchester]], [[England]]) is a multihull pioneer and designer of [[catamaran]]s.
 
==Polynesian beginnings==
In 1953, after long studies into the records of boats of the Pacific in the libraries and museums of Britain, and inspired by [[Eric de Bisschop]]'s book ''The voyage of the Kaimiloa'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysailing.com.au/news/master-multihull-sailor-and-designer-james-wharram-celebrates-historic-atlantic-crossing "Master multihull sailor and designer James Wharram celebrates historic Atlantic crossing"], m15 September 2015, ysailing.com.au &lt;/ref&gt; he designed and built the first British ocean-going double-canoe-catamaran, the ''Tangaroa'' (length {{convert|23|ft|6|in|m}}) and in 1955–56 sailed with Jutta Schultze-Rohnhof and Ruth Merseburger,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t72lKIpb3VY "Â £200 Boat Prepares To Cross The Atlantic"], 1955, British Pathé &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailfeed.com/2013/09/dead-gal-ruth-wharram/ "Ruth Wharram"], Obituary, September 6, 2013, SAILfeed.com &lt;/ref&gt; across the Atlantic to Trinidad – the beginning of [[cruising (maritime)|cruising]] and [[transatlantic crossing]] with a catamaran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cruisingworld.com/sailboats/40-best-catamarans-and-trimarans-ever?image=25 "''No list of influential multihulls would be complete without the work of James Wharram...''"], July 10, 2014, Cruising World&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doane2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles J. Doane|title=The Modern Cruising Sailboat: A Complete Guide to its Design, Construction, and Outfitting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88OrMVCYf5cC&amp;pg=PA29|date=6 December 2009|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No scholars in the Western world at this time believed that the [[Polynesians]] had boats capable of directed ocean voyages. Wharram believed otherwise and set out to prove it by doing it himself. He followed this first Atlantic crossing by building a 40-foot V-hull double canoe, ''[[Rongo (catamaran)|Rongo]]'', in Trinidad in 1957–58, with [[Bernard Moitessier]]'s help, and sailing her across the North Atlantic in 1959 from New York to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cruisingworld.com/sailboats/english-catamaran-designer-honored "English Catamaran Designer Honored"], April 20, 2013, ''Cruising World''&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first west-to-east crossing of the Atlantic by catamaran or multihull.

The story was told by Wharram in the 1969 book ''Two Girls Two Catamarans''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenoldies.biz/James%20Wharam%20US%20-%20Multicoques%20World%20SE5.pdf "James Wharram: Celestial Adventurer or Visionary Architect?"], Philippe Echelle, Multihulls World&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1973 Wharram was assisted by his co-designer Hanneke Boon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://outrig.org/pioneers_jb.html#wharram "James Wharram"], outrig.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987-92 James and his partners built a new flagship, the 63-foot catamaran ''Spirit of Gaia'', which they sailed into the Pacific and round the world, to study Indo-Pacific canoe-craft (1994–98).

==The Lapita Voyage==
In 2008-9 James Wharram and Hanneke Boon conceived the Lapita Voyage expedition, sailing two double canoes based on traditional Polynesian hullform, from the Philippines to [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]] in the Solomon Islands. The ‘Lapita Voyage’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/lapita_voyage.html Lapita Voyage]&lt;/ref&gt; was a major expedition in Experimental Marine Archaeology. It was the first exploration of one possible migration route into the Central Pacific by Ethnic sailing craft.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Wharram Catamaran Designs==

Wharram designs are inspired by Polynesian double canoes and typically have an open deck, with small deckpod(s) for crew shelter. James Wharram combined boat building with studies of Polynesian culture. Most modern catamarans are built as a single rigid structure thereby sustaining greater forces and stresses in waves, whereas on Wharrams the separate hulls are connected to the crossbeams with (synthetic) rope lashings, in true Polynesian style. The flexibility of the Wharram system makes the boats suffer less stress in ocean waves.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Derek, ''Multihulls for Cruising and Racing'', Adlard Coles, London 1990 p. 16, {{ISBN|0-7136-6414-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rig on Wharrams since the early 1980s is the 'Wharram Wingsail Rig',&lt;ref&gt;Wharram, James: [http://wharram.com/site/how-we-design/wharramwingsail Wharram Wingsail Rig]&lt;/ref&gt; an appropriate tech squareheaded rig with low turbulence pocket round the mast and a short adjustable gaff at the head. The advantages of this rig are simplicity, low turbulence and the fact that it can be lowered in a following wind at any time. The Centre of effort on all Wharram rigs is kept low, giving them very good stability.  No full-size Wharram has been known to have capsized.&lt;ref&gt;Wharram, James: ''[http://wharram.com/site/node/97 The Wharram Design Book. Building Yourself A Modern Sea-Going Polynesian Catamaran]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the cabin interiors are designed to flexy-space principles, the concept being multi-purpose space on a human scale, in which less is more and the simpler the construction, the better. The slim v-shaped hulls have a very good speed/length ratio and all have canoe sterns, giving minimum drag, even when loaded. This hullshape requires no keels or boards to sail to windward, giving hulls with little draft and easy beachability. Wharram also keeps freeboards low for minimum windage.&lt;ref&gt;Wharram, James: [http://wharram.com/site/how-we-design/freeboardandwindage Freeboard and Windage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lignum vitae''' is a [[wood]], also called '''guayacan''' or '''guaiacum''',&lt;ref&gt;OED entry&lt;/ref&gt; and in parts of Europe known as '''Pockholz''', from trees of the genus ''[[Guaiacum]]''. The trees are indigenous to the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America and have been an important export crop to Europe since the beginning of the 16th century. The wood was once very important for applications requiring a material with its extraordinary combination of [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[toughness]], and [[density]]. It is also the national tree of [[the Bahamas]] and the [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] national flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 |title=National Symbols of Jamaica 
 |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/this%20is%20jamaica/symbols.html 
 |publisher=Jamaica Information Service 
 |postscript= 
 |deadurl=yes

 |archivedate=2006-06-19 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The wood is obtained chiefly from ''[[Guaiacum officinale]]'' and ''[[Guaiacum sanctum]]'', both small, slow growing trees. All species of the genus ''Guaiacum'' are now listed in Appendix II of [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) as potentially [[endangered species]]. Demand for the wood has been reduced by modern [[materials science]], which has led to [[polymer]], [[alloy]]s and [[composite material]]s that can take lignum vitae's place.

==Name==
"Lignum vitae" is [[Latin]] for "wood of life", and derives its name from its medicinal uses; lignum vitae resin has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions from [[cough]]s to [[arthritis]], and chips of the wood can also be used to brew a [[tea]]. 

Other names for lignum vitae include '''palo santo''' (Spanish for "holy wood") '''Aura palo santo''' and "bastard greenheart" (not to be confused with true Greenheart ''[[Chlorocardium rodiei]]'', a popular wood in shipbuilding, cabinetry, and [[woodturning]] but a completely different timber); lignum vitae is also one of the numerous hard, dense woods loosely referred to as "[[ironwood]]".

==Description==
Lignum vitae is hard and durable, and is also the densest wood traded (density: 1.23 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;);&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=density heaviest wood – WolframAlpha
  |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density+heaviest+wood
  |accessdate=2012-10-26
  |publisher=WolframAlpha
|postscript=
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; it will easily sink in [[water]]. On the [[Janka hardness test|Janka Scale of Hardness]], which measures hardness of woods, lignum vitae ranks highest of the trade woods, with a Janka hardness of 4500&amp;nbsp;[[Janka hardness test|lbf]] (compared with [[Olneya]] at 3260&amp;nbsp;lbf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wood-database.com/desert-ironwood/|title=Desert Ironwood - The Wood Database - Lumber Identification (Hardwood)|website=www.wood-database.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[African Blackwood]] at 2940&amp;nbsp;lbf, [[Hickory]] at 1820&amp;nbsp;lbf, [[Northern Red Oak|red oak]] at 1290&amp;nbsp;lbf, [[Pinus classification|Yellow Pine]] at 690&amp;nbsp;lbf, and [[Balsa]] at 100&amp;nbsp;lbf). The densest of all woods is [[ Allocasuarina luehmannii ]].

Various other hardwoods may also be called lignum vitae and should not be confused with it. The best-known come from ''[[Bulnesia arborea]]'' and ''[[Bulnesia sarmientoi]]'' (in the same [[Larreoideae|subfamily]] as ''Guaiacum'') and are known as [[Bulnesia|Verawood]] or [[Argentina|Argentine]] lignum vitae; they are somewhat similar in appearance and working qualities as genuine lignum vitae. Some hardwoods from [[Australasia]] (e.g., ''[[Vitex lignum-vitae]]'' and some species of ''[[Acacia]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus]]'') are also referred to as lignum vitae.

==Uses==
Due to the density of the wood, [[bail (cricket)|cricket bails]], in particular "heavy bails" used in windy conditions, are sometimes made of lignum vitae.  It is also sometimes used to make [[Bowls|lawn bowls]], [[croquet]] mallets, and [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]] balls.   The wood also has seen widespread historical usage in [[Mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]] and for wood carvers' mallets.

It was the traditional wood used for the British police [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheon]] until recently, due to its density (and strength), combined with the relative softness of wood compared to metal, thereby tending to bruise or stun rather than simply cut the skin.

The [[belaying pin]]s and [[deadeye]]s aboard [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] and many other sailing ships were made from lignum vitae. Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the severity of typical marine weathering conditions, and also resisted jamming in their mortise holes. The [[sheave]]s of [[block (sailing)|block]]s on sailing vessels were made of lignum vitae until the introduction of modern synthetics.

Due to lignum vitae's toughness, it can also be used as a [[lapping|lap]] in the process of cutting gems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The wood is covered with powdered industrial diamond, attached to a spindle, and used to smooth rough surfaces of gems.

Master clockmaker [[John Harrison]] used lignum vitae in the bearings and gears of his [[pendulum clock]]s and his first three [[marine chronometer]]s (all of which were large clocks rather than watches), since the wood is self-lubricating. The use of lignum vitae eliminates the need for [[Horology|horological]] [[lubricating oil]]; 18th-century horological oil would become viscous and reduce the accuracy of a timepiece under unfavourable conditions (including those that prevail at sea).

For the same reason it was widely used in water-lubricated shaft bearings for ships and hydro-electric power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wenatcheeworld.com/news/2014/aug/08/rare-tour-of-rock-island-dam-takes-visitors-below-the-columbia/|title=Rare tour of Rock Island dam takes visitors below the Columbia|first=The Wenatchee|last=World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[stave bearing|stern-tube bearing]]s of ship propellers &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ytwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HR6mT6nEIsb5ggf8ovSZAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Fitting Ships With Wooden Bearings"]. ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', April 1952, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; until the 1960s saw the introduction of sealed [[white metal]] [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. According to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association website, the shaft bearings on the WWII submarine {{USS|Pampanito|SS-383}} were made of this wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
  |url=http://www.maritime.org/pamphist.htm |title=History and Crew OF USS Pampanito (SS-383)
  |accessdate=2009-07-12
  |publisher=San Francisco Maritime National Park Association
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aft main shaft strut bearings for {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571}}, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, were composed of this wood.  Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the [[Conowingo Dam#Construction and hydroelectric power generation|Conowingo hydroelectric plant]] on the lower [[Susquehanna River]] were made from lignum vitae.  The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from lignum vitae. Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with lignum vitae and are too numerous to list here.&lt;ref&gt;Discussions with various utilities operating these plants, beginning with an affiliate of the Nebraska Public Power District in 1976.  In 1976, NPPD affiliates were still using lignum vitae when turbine bearing replacements were needed.  Some of those replacements are likely to still be in service.  Lignum vitae bearings are also found in larger units at several dams in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Railroads of San Francisco]] (an ancestor of the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]]) began installing lignum vitae insulators to support heavy feeder wires for their trolley system in 1904.  The reason for the adoption of lignum vitae was its ability to withstand the high stress at high temperature, a problem posed by heavy cables turning corners heated by high current overloads.  Many of these insulators survived the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fires, despite temperatures high enough to soften the iron poles and melt the copper cables.&lt;ref&gt;S. L. Foster (June 9, 1917), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z45NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1051#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Taking Care of Corner Stresses from Large D.C. Feeders"], ''The Electric Railway Journal'', Vol. XLIX, No. 23, pages 1051–1053.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these lasted into the 1970s with a small number remaining in service into the first decade of the 2000s (most of these came down when the overhead 600 V DC feeders were replaced with a new system of underground feeders, the rest coming out of service as aging crossarms supporting the remaining overhead feeders were replaced).

It was also used extensively in the manufacture of British Railways Mark 1 Rolling Stock, as a 'bump stop' in the bogies (the 'frame' that carries the wheels).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reference was doubly salacious, referring to both the bark tea's [[Contraception|contraceptive]] qualities {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} and the phallic symbolism of the hard wood.

According to [[T. H. White]]'s version of the [[King Arthur]] story ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', lignum vitae, from which the wand of [[Merlin]] is made, has magical powers.

[[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s novel ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' includes a bathtub made of this wood in one of the main characters' homes. His novel ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]'' also refers to the use of this wood in making a cane for the blind Poncio Vicario.

American folksinger [[Pete Seeger]] fashioned the neck of his trademark [[banjo]] from lignum vitae.

In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel [[Bleak House]], one of the characters, Matthew Bagnet is referred to as lignum vitae, "... in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy."

[[Claire Waight Keller]] included the tree to represent Jamaica in [[Meghan Markle|Meghan Markle's]] [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|wedding]] veil, which included the distinctive flora of each [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/wedding-dress-bridesmaids%E2%80%99-dresses-and-page-boys-uniforms|title=The Wedding Dress, Bridesmaids’ Dresses and Page Boys' Uniforms|first=|last=Jenny.minard|date=19 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lactarius piperatus BS11.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Lactifluus piperatus]]'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Lactifluus''.]]
'''''[[Lactifluus]]''''' is a genus of [[milk cap]] fungi in the family Russulaceae. Its species were formerly classified in ''[[Lactarius]]'' but have been split off as separate genus based on [[molecular phylogenetic]] evidence. A 2017 revision divided the genus in four subgenera:  ''Lactifluus'', ''Lactariopsis'', ''Gymnocarpi'' and ''Pseudogymnocarpi''. Within the subgenera, [[section (biology)|sections]] have been recognised, but not all of the roughly 150 species could be assigned to named sections.&lt;ref name="DeCrop2017"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12246">[[Image:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Topography of Europe]]This page lists the highest natural elevation of each sovereign state on the continent of [[Europe]] [[Boundaries between continents|defined]] [[Physical geography|physiographically]]. States sometimes associated with Europe politically and culturally, but not geographically part of Europe, are not included in this list of physical features (with the exception of Cyprus - marked with a N/A rank entry).

'''Not all points in this list are mountains or hills''' - some are simply elevations that are not distinguishable as geographical features.

Notes are provided where territorial disputes or inconsistencies affect the listings. Some countries such as [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Netherlands]] ([[Saba]]), [[Spain]] ([[Canary Islands]]), and [[Turkey]] ([[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]) have part of their territory and their high points outside of Europe; their non-European high points are listed with a N/A rank entry underneath their continental peak.

Kosovo has two entries. For more details about [[List of mountains in Serbia|Serbian]] and [[List of mountains in Kosovo|Kosovan]] highest points and ranks see [[Talk:List of highest points of European countries|Talk]] page as well as the discussion at [[List of mountains in Kosovo]] and its [[List of mountains in Kosovo|Talk]] page.

Three other entries of partially recognized countries with highest points in Europe are listed and ranked in ''Italic''. For more details see [[List of states with limited recognition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33438">The following is only a sample of natural gas and petroleum product accidents for this era. Gas and oil leaks and explosions were not tracked in an organized fashion except by fire marshals. Many leaks, fires, and explosions were not recorded unless they occurred in population centers with newspapers to report them.&lt;ref&gt;Many early twentieth-century newspapers have been digitized and are searchable online. The U.S. Library of Congress provides access to 2,493 newspapers at https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/. Some states have digitized their newspapers; see Colorado Historic Newspapers at https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org and Utah Digital Newspapers at https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/. Many public libraries also provide online access to the early ''New York Times'', ''Boston Globe'' and other newspapers, or databases such as ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, the [[Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration]] (PHMSA), a United States [[Department of Transportation]] agency, would be established to develop and enforce regulations for the safe and environmentally sound operation of the United States' pipelines, and to collect data on pipeline leaks, accidents, and explosions.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1900s==

* On December 20, 1900, at [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania]], two children were fatally burned and five injured in a gas explosion and fires that destroyed three houses. The explosions were caused by the breaking of a valve gate on the Fort Pitt Gas Line, which allowed leaking gas to seep into the houses' cellars, following water pipes from the street.&lt;ref&gt;"Seven Persons Injured," Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 20 Dec 1900, p. 11, https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/50364775/?terms=gas%2Bexplosion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss was estimated at $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Hotel Blown Up and Three Killed," Warren Sheaf (Warren, Marshall County, Minn.), 28 Jan 1904, Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers, Library of Congress,  &lt;http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059228/1904-01-28/ed-1/seq-7/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Winchester, Massachusetts]], on December 1, 1904, a lighted match dropped into a sewer manhole by an employee of the Arlington gaslight company set off an explosion which injured five gas line repairmen and blew the steel manhole cover 30 feet into the air. The gas ignited along the sewer line into Rangeley, where two more manhole covers were blown into the air. The gas company's official statement was that the gas was ignited by a spark from a pickaxe.&lt;ref&gt;"One Seems Likely to Die: Explosion of Gas in Manhole. Five Men Hurt," Boston Daily Globe, 1 Dec 1904, pg. 1, ProQuest, accessed 2018.01.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A gas explosion in August 1907 shook Boston's South End after new machinery ignited a gas leak in the one-story brick engine house of the Boston Consolidated Gas Company, where natural gas was pumped to three huge reservoirs holding 2,000,000 cubic feet of gas. The engineer, knowing the fire could spread to the reservoirs, ignored his burning clothes and rushed to close the valves between the engine house and the reservoirs, saving the South End from a disaster. Seven workmen including the engineer were seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;"Explosion of Gas Scares South End," Boston Daily Globe [Boston, Mass.], 16 Aug 1907: 1, ProQuest, accessed 2018.01.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a partial '''list of strawberry cultivars'''. [[Garden strawberry|Strawberries]] come in a wide assortment of commercially available [[cultivar]]s (cultivated varieties).  Differences between cultivars may include the date the fruit ripens, disease resistance, freezing quality, firmness, berry size, berry shape, and flavor.  Many different cultivars have been developed at the [[University of California]] (Davis campus), by Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc. (Watsonville, California), the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]] and [[East Malling Research Station]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodyear|first1=Dana|title=Strawberry Valley|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/how-driscolls-reinvented-the-strawberry/amp|accessdate=16 August 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all the strawberries listed below are cultivars of ''Fragaria'' × ''ananassa''.&lt;!--Note to editors: please keep the multiplication sign outside the quote marks otherwise it is italicised in certain browsers.--&gt; Two cultivars listed here ('Frel' (&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;Pink Panda&lt;/span&gt;) and 'Samba' (&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;Red Ruby&lt;/span&gt;)) are [[Fragaria × Comarum hybrids|bigeneric hybrid]]s, grown mainly for their flower colour rather than their fruit, using a closely related species (''Potentilla palustris'' = ''[[Comarum palustre]]'') to introduce pink or red colouration to the flowers.

The cultivar ''Fragaria'' × ''ananassa''&lt;!--Note to editors: please keep the multiplication sign outside the quote marks otherwise it is italicised in certain browsers.--&gt; 'Variegata' is grown mainly for the decorative qualities of its variegated foliage.

The '''Madagascar succulent woodlands''' are a [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] in southwestern and central western [[Madagascar]]. They are threatened by [[Anthropogenic hazard|various human activities]].

==Geography==

The succulent woodlands are found in the southwest and centre-west of Madagascar, in the [[rain shadow]] region that receives less moisture than the east and the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]]. The climate is [[Hot semi-arid climate|tropical and dry]], with rainfall ranging from 575 to 1,330 mm per year, and a marked dry season from May to October.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-succulent-woodlands"/&gt;

To the north, the succulent woodlands make a transition into the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], while to the south, they border the even drier [[Madagascar spiny thickets]] and to the east, the [[Madagascar subhumid forests]].&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-succulent-woodlands"/&gt;

==Flora==

The vegetation is similar to the dry deciduous forests to the north, but includes more dry-adapted, [[xerophytic]] species. Forests, reaching {{convert|15|m|ft}} in height, contain trees and shrubs of the families [[Burseraceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Fabaceae]], and [[Sapindaceae]]. Notable endemics include two species of [[baobab]], ''[[Adansonia za]]'' and ''[[Adansonia grandidieri|A. grandidieri]]'' ([[near threatened]] and [[endangered]], respectively), and succulents in the genus ''[[Pachypodium]]''.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-succulent-woodlands"/&gt;

==Fauna==

Between 60 and 90 bird species and eight [[lemur]] species are found in the ecoregion and a number of mammals, frogs, and reptiles are endemic to the area.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-succulent-woodlands"/&gt; A notable lemur species is the endangered [[Madame Berthe's mouse lemur]], the world's smallest primate.&lt;ref name="Goodman2003"/&gt;

==Threats and conservation==

The Madagascar succulent woodlands are threatened by burning, logging (which impacts species such as the endemic tree ''[[Hazomalania voyroni]]''), cattle and [[goat farming]], and hunting of several mammals. Protected areas include [[Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park]], [[Andranomena Reserve]], [[Kirindy Mitea National Park]], and [[Kirindy Forest]].&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-succulent-woodlands"/&gt;

N&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is geographic or true north, N&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is magnetic north, and δ is magnetic declination]]

'''Magnetic declination''', or '''magnetic variation''', is the [[azimuth|angle]] on the [[horizontal plane]] between [[Magnetic North Pole|magnetic north]] (the direction the north end of a [[compass]] needle points, corresponding to the direction of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] lines) and [[true north]] (the [[cardinal direction|direction]] along a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] towards the geographic [[North Pole]]). This angle varies depending on position on the Earth's surface and [[polar wandering|changes over time]].

Somewhat more formally, [[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator|Bowditch]] defines variation as “the angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes east or west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. The angle between magnetic and grid meridians is called grid magnetic angle, grid variation, or grivation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowditch |first=Nathaniel |title=American Practical Navigator|year=2002 |publisher=Paradise Cay Publications |isbn=9780939837540 |page=849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, declination is positive when magnetic north is east of true north, and negative when it is to the west. ''[[Isogon]]ic lines'' are lines on the Earth's surface along which the declination has the same constant value, and lines along which the declination is zero are called ''agonic lines''. The lowercase Greek letter δ (delta) is frequently used as the symbol for magnetic declination.

The term ''[[magnetic deviation]]'' is sometimes used loosely to mean the same as magnetic declination, but more correctly it refers to the error in a compass reading induced by nearby metallic objects, such as iron on board a ship or aircraft.

Magnetic declination should not be confused with ''[[magnetic inclination]]'', also known as magnetic dip, which is the angle that the Earth's magnetic field lines make with the downward side of the horizontal plane.

== Declination change over time and location ==
Magnetic declination varies both from place to place and with the passage of time. As a traveller cruises the east coast of the United States, for example, the declination varies from 16 degrees west in Maine, to 6 in Florida, to 0 degrees in Louisiana, to 4 degrees east (in Texas). The declination at London, UK is one degree 7 minutes west (2014), and as the country is quite small that figure is fairly good for the whole. It is reducing, and scientists predict that in about 2050 it will be zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find the magnetic declination at your location|url=http://www.magnetic-declination.com/ |publisher=Magnetic-Declination.com |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most areas, the spatial variation reflects the irregularities of the flows deep in the Earth; in some areas, deposits of [[iron]] [[ore]] or [[magnetite]] in the Earth's crust may contribute strongly to the declination. Similarly, [[secular phenomena|secular]] changes to these flows result in slow changes to the field strength and direction at the same point on the Earth.

|[[File:Mv-world.jpg|thumb | 350px | NIMA Magnetic Variation Map 2000]]

The magnetic declination in a given area  may (most likely will) change slowly over time, possibly as little as 2–2.5&amp;nbsp;degrees every hundred years or so, depending upon how far from the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic poles]] it is. For a location closer to the pole like [[Ivujivik]], the declination may change by 1&amp;nbsp;degree every three years. This may be insignificant to most travellers, but can be important if using magnetic bearings from old charts or [[metes and bounds|metes]] (directions) in old deeds for locating places with any precision.

As an example of how variation changes over time, see the two charts of the same area (western end of [[Long Island Sound]]), below, surveyed 124 years apart.  The 1884 chart shows a variation of 8 degrees, 20 minutes West.  The 2008 chart shows 13 degrees, 15 minutes West.

== Determining declination ==
[[Image:IsraelCVFRmag.jpg|thumb|130px|Magnetic declination indicated on an Israeli map. The arrows show true north, grid north and magnetic north, and the caption explains that the average yearly change in the magnetic declination is 0°03′ eastward.]]

=== Direct measurement ===
[[Image:Deklinationsnadel hg.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antique declinometer]]
The magnetic declination at any particular place can be measured directly by reference to the [[celestial pole]]s—the points in the heavens around which the stars appear to revolve, which mark the direction of true north and true south. The [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] used to perform this measurement is known as a ''declinometer''.

The approximate position of the north celestial pole is indicated by [[Polaris]] (the North Star). In the northern hemisphere, declination can therefore be approximately determined as the difference between the magnetic bearing and a visual bearing on Polaris.  Polaris currently traces a circle 0.73° in radius around the north celestial pole, so this technique is accurate to within a degree.  At high latitudes a [[plumb-bob]] is helpful to sight Polaris against a reference object close to the horizon, from which its bearing can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://earthsci.org/education/fieldsk/declin.htm|title=Magnetic declination, what it is , how to compensate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear|left}}

===Determination from maps and models ===
A rough estimate of the local declination (within a few degrees) can be determined from a general isogonic chart of the world or a continent, such as those illustrated above. Isogonic lines are also shown on [[aeronautical chart|aeronautic]]al and [[nautical chart]]s.

Larger-scale local maps may indicate current local declination, often with the aid of a schematic diagram. Unless the area depicted is very small, declination may vary measurably over the extent of the map, so the data may be referred to a specific location on the map. The current rate and direction of change may also be shown, for example in [[arcminute]]s per year. The same diagram may show the angle of [[grid north]] (the direction of the map's north-south grid lines), which may differ from true north.

On the [[topographic map]]s of the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS), for example, a diagram shows the relationship between magnetic north in the area concerned (with an arrow marked "MN") and true north (a vertical line with a five-pointed star at its top), with a label near the angle between the MN arrow and the vertical line, stating the size of the declination and of that angle, in degrees, [[angular mil|mil]]s, or both.

A prediction of the current magnetic declination for a given location (based on a worldwide [[empirical model]] of the deep flows described above) can be obtained online from a web page operated by the [[National Geophysical Data Center]], a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Geomagnetism |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination |title=Estimated Value of Magnetic Declination |publisher=NOAA National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is built with all the information available to the map-makers at the start of the five-year period it is prepared for. It reflects a highly predictable rate of change,{{clarify | reason = Is this trying to say that changes in declination *are* highly predictable, or just that the model assumes this?|date=February 2014}} and is usually more accurate than a map—which is likely months or years out of date—and almost never less accurate.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Software===
The [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) provides source code written in C that is based on the [[World Magnetic Model]] (WMM). The source code is free to download and includes a data file updated every five years to account for movement of the magnetic north pole.

== Using the declination ==

=== Adjustable compasses ===
[[Image:Boussole.jpg|thumb|left|x300px|Adjustable compass set to a declination of 0° and a bearing of 307°]]
A magnetic compass points to magnetic north, not geographic north.  Compasses of the style commonly used for hiking include a declination adjustment in the form of a  [[bezel setting|bezel]] which swivels relative to the base plate. To establish a declination the bezel is rotated until the desired number of degrees plus or minus lie between the bezel’s designation N (for North) and the direction indicated by the magnetic end of the needle (usually painted red). This allows the user to establish a true bearing for travel or orientation by aligning the embossed red indicator arrow on the base plate with a landmark or heading on a map. A compass thus adjusted can be said to be reading “true north” instead of magnetic north (as long as it remains within an area on the same isogonic line).

In the image above the bezel’s N has been aligned with the direction indicated by the magnetic end of the compass needle, reflecting a magnetic declination of 0 degrees.  The arrow on the base plate indicates a bearing of 307 degrees. 
{{-}}

=== Non-adjustable compasses ===
[[Image:Compensating magnetic declination.svg|300px|thumb|left|How to compensate for magnetic declination when reading a compass. In this example, the declination is 14°E (+14°), so the compass card points to a "north" 14 degrees to the East of true North. To obtain a true bearing, add 14 degrees to the bearing shown by the compass.]]
To work with both true and magnetic bearings, the user of a non-adjustable compass needs to make simple calculations that take into account the local magnetic declination.  The example on the left shows how you would convert a magnetic bearing (one taken in the field using a non-adjustable compass) to a true bearing (one that you could plot on a map) by ''adding'' the magnetic declination.  The declination in the example is 14°E (+14°).  If, instead, the declination was 14°W (-14°), you would still “add” it to the magnetic bearing to obtain the true bearing:  40°+ (-14°) = 26°.

The opposite procedure is used in converting a true bearing to a magnetic bearing.  With a local declination of 14°E, a true bearing (perhaps taken from a map) of 54° is converted to a magnetic bearing (for use in the field) by ''subtracting'' the declination:  54° - 14° = 40°.  If, instead, the declination was 14°W (-14°), you would still “subtract” it from the true bearing to obtain the magnetic bearing:  54°- (-14°) = 68°.

== Navigation ==
On aircraft or vessels there are three types of [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]]: true, magnetic, and compass bearing. Compass error is divided into two parts, namely magnetic variation and [[magnetic deviation]], the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) variation indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north.

Compass, magnetic and true bearings are related by:

&lt;math&gt;T = M + V&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;M = C + D&lt;/math&gt;

The general equation relating compass and true bearings is

&lt;math&gt;T = C + V + D&lt;/math&gt;

Where

&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is Compass bearing

&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is Magnetic bearing

&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is True bearing

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is Variation

&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is compass Deviation

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;0, D&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; for Westerly Variation and Deviation

&lt;math&gt;V&gt;0, D&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for Easterly Variation and Deviation

To calculate true bearing from compass bearing (and known deviation and variation):

*Compass bearing + deviation = magnetic bearing
*Magnetic bearing + variation = true bearing.

To calculate compass bearing from true bearing (and known deviation and variation):

*True bearing − variation = Magnetic bearing 
*Magnetic bearing − deviation = Compass bearing.

These rules are often combined with the mnemonic "West is Best, East is least"; that is to say, add W declinations when going True headings to Magnetic Compass, and subtract E ones.

Another simple way to remember which way to apply the correction for Continental USA is:
* For locations east of the agonic line (zero declination), roughly east of the Mississippi: The magnetic bearing is always bigger.
* For locations west of the agonic line (zero declination), roughly west of the Mississippi: The magnetic bearing is always smaller.

Common abbreviations are:
*TC = true course;
*V  = variation (of the Earth's magnetic field);
*MC = magnetic course (what the course would be in the absence of local declination);
*D  = deviation caused by magnetic material (mostly iron and steel) on the vessel;
*CC = compass course.

===Deviation===
[[Magnetic deviation]] is the angle from a given magnetic bearing to the related bearing mark of the compass. Deviation is positive if a compass bearing mark (e.g., compass north) is right of the related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass' north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°.  Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on the orientation of the boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to compass bearing to obtain magnetic bearing.

===Air navigation===
Magnetic declination has a very important influence on [[air navigation]], since the most simple aircraft navigation instruments are designed to determine headings by locating magnetic north through the use of a compass or similar magnetic device.

Aviation sectionals (maps / charts) and databases used for air navigation are based on true north rather than magnetic north, and the constant and significant slight changes in the actual location of magnetic north and local irregularities in the planet's magnetic field require that charts and databases be updated at least twice each year to reflect the current magnetic variation correction from true north.{{clarify | reason = Why would charts based on true north need to be updated to reflect changes in magnetic variation?|date=February 2014}}

For example, as of March 2010, near San Francisco, magnetic north is about 14.3 degrees east of true north, with the difference decreasing by about 6 minutes of arc per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomagmodels/struts/calcDeclination According to NOAA Geophysical Data Center on-line model]&lt;/ref&gt;

When plotting a course, most small aircraft pilots plot a trip using true north on a sectional (map), then convert the true north bearings to magnetic north for in-plane navigation using the magnetic compass. During flight, the pilot derives the correct compass course by adding or subtracting the local variation displayed on a sectional.

Radionavigation aids located on the ground, such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]s, are also checked and updated to keep them aligned with magnetic north to allow pilots to use their magnetic compasses for accurate and reliable in-plane navigation.

[[Runway]]s are designated by a number between 01 and 36, which is generally one tenth of the magnetic [[azimuth]] of the runway's [[Course (navigation)|heading]]: a runway numbered 09 points east (90°), runway 18 is south (180°), runway 27 points west (270°) and runway 36 points to the north (360° rather than 0°).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/Chap2/aim0203.html Federal Aviation Administration Aeronautical Information Manual, Chapter 2, Section 3 Airport Marking Aids and Signs part 3b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118165015/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap2/aim0203.html |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to magnetic declination, changes in runway designators have to occur at times to keep their designation in line with the runway's magnetic heading. An exception is made for runways within the [[Northern Domestic Airspace]] of Canada; these are numbered relative to true north because proximity to the magnetic North Pole makes the magnetic declination large.

[[GPS]] systems used for air navigation can use magnetic north or true north. In order to make them more compatible with systems that depend on magnetic north, magnetic north is often chosen, at the pilot's preference. The GPS receiver natively reads in true north, but can elegantly calculate magnetic north based on its true position and data tables; the unit can then calculate the current location and direction of the north magnetic pole and (potentially) any local variations, if the GPS is set to use magnetic compass readings.

[[Image:NMSC-Australia.JPG|thumb|300px|National Marine Science Centre, Coffs Harbour, Australia]]

The '''National Marine Science Centre''' (NMSC) is part of the School of Environment, Science and Engineering, at [[Southern Cross University]]. Located in [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]], [[New South Wales]], on the east coast of [[Australia]] and adjacent to the [[Solitary Islands Marine Park]], where both tropical and temperate currents meet. This interesting setting provides practical opportunities in the study of marine science and management for both students and researchers.

The NMSC has a state-of-the-art flow-through seawater supply system. Drawing water from Charlesworth Bay, high quality filtered seawater is available on tap in the laboratories, hatchery, aquarium rooms and tank farm. Identified as one of the best systems in Australia, the supply of seawater supports a range of experimental research activities and specialist laboratories, and is backed up by a standby generator and an elaborate alarm system.

==Science==
Undergraduate and graduate courses are offered by [[Southern Cross University]]. 
*Bachelor of Marine Science and Management
*Bachelor of Environmental Science/Bachelor of Marine Science and Management
*Bachelor of Science with Honours
*Master of Marine Science and Management

Research is undertaken by resident scientific staff. Principal areas are:-
*[[Biodiversity]] of [[Ocean|marine]] and [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[habitat]]s
*Patterns and [[Marine biology|biological processes]] in marine communities
*Human induced impacts on marine systems
*[[Fishing|Fisheries]] and [[marine park]] management
*Marine resource economics and management
*Values in the marine economy
*Capacity development of marine scientists and managers

==History==
The Centre was opened on 15 November 2001 by [[John Anderson (Australian politician)|John Anderson]] [[Parliament of Australia|MP]], Deputy [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Originally a collaboration between the University of New England and Southern Cross University, it took its first students in 2002. The centre was funded from the [[Government of Australia]]'s Centenary of Federation Fund. The Centre became solely managed through Southern Cross University in 2010.

The Centre is sited within the grounds of the [[Novotel]] Pacific Bay Resort, a few kilometers north of [[Coffs Harbour]]. The building was at one time the resort's sports centre, [[gym]]nasium, [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, and alfresco restaurant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7464">A '''Primary Knock-on Atom''' or '''PKA''' is an atom that is displaced from its [[Bravais lattice|lattice]] site by [[irradiation]]; it is, by definition, the first atom that an incident particle encounters in the target. After it is displaced from its initial lattice site, the PKA can induce the subsequent lattice site displacements of other atoms if it possesses sufficient energy, or come to rest in the lattice at an [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] site if it does not.

Most of the displaced atoms resulting from electron irradiation and some other types of irradiation are PKAs, since these are usually below the [[threshold displacement energy]] and do not have sufficient energy to displace more atoms. In other cases like fast neutron irradiation, most of the displacements result from higher energy PKAs colliding with other atoms as they slow down to rest.&lt;ref name="Kinchin"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/18/1/301 | volume=18 | title=The Displacement of Atoms in Solids by Radiation | journal=Reports on Progress in Physics | pages=1–51| bibcode=1955RPPh...18....1K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collision Models ==

Atoms can only be displaced if, upon bombardment, the energy they receive exceeds a threshold energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''. Likewise, when a moving atom collides with a stationary atom, both atoms will have energy greater than ''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' after the collision only if the original moving atom had an energy exceeding 2''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''. Thus, only PKAs with an energy greater than 2''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' can continue to displace more atoms and increase the total number of displaced atoms.&lt;ref name="Kinchin" /&gt; In cases where the PKA does have sufficient energy to displace further atoms, the same truth holds for any subsequently displaced atom.

In any scenario, the majority of displaced atoms leave their lattice sites with energies no more than two or three times ''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''. Such an atom will collide with another atom approximately every mean interatomic distance traveled, losing half of its energy during the average collision. Assuming that an atom that has slowed down to a kinetic energy of 1 eV becomes trapped in an interstitial site, displaced atoms will typically be trapped no more than a few interatomic distances away from the vacancies they leave behind.&lt;ref name="Kinchin" /&gt;

There are several possible scenarios for the energy of PKAs, and these lead to different forms of damage. In the case of electron or [[gamma ray]] bombardment, the PKA usually does not have sufficient energy to displace more atoms. The resulting damage consists of a random distribution of [[Frenkel defect]]s, usually with a distance no more than four or five interatomic distances between the interstitial and vacancy. When PKAs receive energy greater than ''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' from bombarding electrons, they are able to displace more atoms, and some of the Frenkel defects become groups of interstitial atoms with corresponding vacancies, within a few interatomic distances of each other. In the case of bombardment by fast-moving atoms or ions, groups of vacancies and interstitial atoms widely separated along the track of the atom or ion are produced. As the atom slows down, the cross section for producing PKAs increases, resulting in groups of vacancies and interstitials concentrated at the end of the track.&lt;ref name="Kinchin" /&gt;

== Damage Models ==

A thermal spike is a region in which a moving particle heats up the material surrounding its track through the solid for times of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; s. In its path, a PKA can produce effects similar to those of heating and rapidly quenching a metal, resulting in Frenkel defects. A thermal spike does not last long enough to permit annealing of the Frenkel defects.&lt;ref name="Kinchin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinkman"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1721810 | volume=25 | title=On the Nature of Radiation Damage in Metals | journal=Journal of Applied Physics | pages=961| bibcode=1954JAP....25..961B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different model called the displacement spike was proposed for fast neutron bombardment of heavy elements. With high energy PKAs, the region affected is heated to temperatures above the material’s melting point, and instead of considering individual collisions, the entire volume affected could be considered to “melt” for a short period of time. The words “melt” and “liquid” are used loosely here because it is not clear whether the material at such high temperatures and pressures would be a liquid or a dense gas. Upon melting, former interstitials and vacancies become “density fluctuations,” since the surrounding lattice points no longer exist in liquid. In the case of a thermal spike, the temperature is not high enough to maintain the liquid state long enough for density fluctuations to relax and interatomic exchange to occur. A rapid “quenching” effect results in vacancy-interstitial pairs that persist throughout melting and resolidification. Towards the end of the path of a PKA, the rate of energy loss becomes high enough to heat up the material well above its melting point. While the material is melted, atomic interchange occurs as a result of random motion of the atoms initiated by the relaxation of local strains from the density fluctuations. This releases stored energy from these strains that raises the temperature even higher, maintaining the liquid state briefly after most of the density fluctuations disappear. During this time, the turbulent motions continue so that upon resolidification, most of the atoms will occupy new lattice sites. Such regions are called displacement spikes, which, unlike thermal spikes, do not retain Frenkel defects.&lt;ref name="Kinchin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinkman" /&gt;

Based on these theories, there should be two different regions, each retaining a different form of damage, along the path of a PKA. A thermal spike should occur in the earlier part of the path, and this high-energy region retains vacancy-interstitial pairs. There should be a displacement spike towards the end of the path, a low-energy region where atoms have been moved to new lattice sites but no vacancy-interstitial pairs are retained.&lt;ref name="Brinkman" /&gt;

== Cascade Damage ==

The structure of cascade damage is strongly dependent on PKA energy, so the PKA energy spectrum should be used as the basis of evaluating microstructural changes under cascade damage. In thin gold foil, at lower bombardment doses, the interactions of cascades are insignificant, and both visible vacancy clusters and invisible vacancy-rich regions are formed by cascade collision sequences.  The interaction of cascades at higher doses was found to produce new clusters near existing groups of vacancy clusters, apparently converting invisible vacancy-rich regions to visible vacancy clusters. These processes are dependent on PKA energy, and from three PKA spectra obtained from fission neutrons, 21 MeV self-ions, and fusion neutrons, the minimum PKA energy required to produce new visible clusters by interaction was estimated to be 165 keV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3115(96)00446-1 | bibcode=1996JNuM..233.1080S | volume=233-237 | title=Primary knock-on atom energy dependence of cascade damage formation and interaction | journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials | pages=1080–1084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 25 v. Chr. 001.jpg|thumb|[[Pompeii]]an fresco of Peitho (left) taking [[Eros (god)|Eros]] to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and Anteros, circa 25 BCE, [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Naples National Museum]].]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Peitho''' ({{lang-grc|Πειθώ|Peithō|Persuasion}}) is the [[goddess]] who personifies [[persuasion]] and [[seduction]]. Her [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[name]] is [[Suadela]] or Suada.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] reports that after the unification of [[Athens]], [[Theseus]] set up a cult of [[Aphrodite Pandemos]] and Peitho on the south slope of [[Acropolis of Athens]]. According to the same author, they had also a sanctuary and a cult at [[Sicyon]]. In her role as an attendant or companion of Aphrodite, Peitho was intimately connected to the goddess of love and beauty. Ancient artists and poets explored this connection in their works. The connection is even deeper in the context of Ancient Greek marriage because a suitor had to negotiate with the father of a young woman for her hand in marriage and offer a bridal price in return for her. The most desirable women drew many prospective suitors, and persuasive skill often determined their success.

Aphrodite and Peitho were sometimes conflated to a certain extent, with the name Peitho appearing in conjunction with, or as an [[epithet]] of, Aphrodite's name. This helps to demonstrate how the relationship between persuasion and [[love]] (or desire) was important in Greek culture. Peitho's ancestry is somewhat unclear. According to [[Hesiod]] in the ''[[Theogony]]'', Peitho was the daughter of the Titans [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'', 346-349.&lt;/ref&gt; which would make her an [[Oceanid]] and therefore sister of such notable goddesses as [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]], [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]], and [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]. However, Hesiod's classification of Peitho as an Oceanid is contradicted by other sources. 

When [[Zeus]] ordered the creation of the first woman, [[Pandora]], it was Peitho and the [[Charities]] who put golden necklaces around her neck, and the rich-haired Hours crowned Pandora's head with spring flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Works and Days]]'', 69-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Peitho is identified as a member of the [[Charites]] by [[Hermesianax]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 9.35.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nonnus]], in his ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', describes them as including Peitho, [[Pasithea]], and [[Aglaea|Aglaia]], all three of them daughters of [[Dionysus]] and Aphrodite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 24.261.&lt;/ref&gt; She is most commonly considered a daughter of Aphrodite. Nonnus also lists Peitho as the wife of Hermes, the messenger of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'', 8.220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'', 48.230.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in another source, Peitho is the first wife of [[Phoroneus]], and the mother of [[Aegialeus (King of Argos)|Aegialeus]] and [[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apia]]&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on Euripides' Orestes 920.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preben Maegaard''' (born September 25, 1935), is a Danish [[renewable energy]] pioneer, author and expert. Since the oil crisis in 1974 he has worked for the [[energy transition|transition]] from [[fossil fuel]]s to renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkecenter.net/mediafiles/folkecenter/pdf/Preben_Maegaard_English_biography_03_2007.pdf  Preben Maegaard, Executive director]&lt;/ref&gt;
Preben Maegaard is co-founder of the [[Nordic Folkecenter for Renewable Energy]], established in 1983, and its director 1984 till 2013 (www.folkecenter.net).

== Work ==

Preben Maegaard works locally, nationally and internationally at the organisational, political and technological levels within broad spectrum of renewable energy technologies. 
From 1979 to 1984 Preben Maegaard was chairman of the Danish Renewable Energy Association (OVE),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orgve.dk Danish Renewable Energy Association (OVE)]&lt;/ref&gt; since 1991, vice-president of [[Eurosolar]] (the European Renewable Energy Association) and in 2006, appointed senior vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurosolar.org EUROSOLAR]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992 he has been co-ordinator of the European Solar Prize in Denmark and member of the European Solar Prize Jury. In 1995 he became Member of Senate, UTER, Technical University, Havana. In 1996 and the following years, Preben Maegaard was member of the board of EUROSUN, an intergroup set up by the European Parliament. Since 1999, he has been a board member of the European Renewable Energies Federation (EREF) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eref-europe.org European Renewable Energies Federation (EREF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and Renewable Energy Adviser to the President of Mali, Alpha Konare, leading to the establishment of the Mali Folkecenter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malifolkecenter.org Mali Folkecenter]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he became a chairperson of the Committee of the World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcre.org World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE)]&lt;/ref&gt; When the World Wind Energy Association (WWEA) was founded in 2001, he became its first president, a position he held till 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwindea.org World Wind Energy Association (WWEA)]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, the World Wind Energy Institute (WWEI) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwei.nu World Wind Energy Institute (WWEI)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130909125553/http://www.wwei.nu/ |date=2013-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was initiated in Kingston, Canada, involving seven institutes from China, Brazil, Cuba, Canada, Russia, Egypt and Denmark. Preben Maegaard was appointed the first president of the WWEI. He was co-founder of the SolarSuperState Association &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.SolarSuperState.com SolarSuperState Association]&lt;/ref&gt; when it was founded in 2012 and became its first president.

As the director of the Folkecenter he has been responsible for the technological innovation of windmills, including design, construction and implementation of sizes from 20 to 525&amp;nbsp;kW, farm biogas digesters from 50 to 1000 m3 as well as integrated energy systems including hydrogen and biofuels for transport. The technological development and implementation activities took place in cooperation with DS Trade and Industry (www.ds-net.dk). The Folkecenter has under his leadership provided transfer of renewable energy technology to many countries, and set up numerous pilot projects worldwide. In 2002, the liberal government suspended the national renewable energy development and implementation activities and programs in which Preben Maegaard held positions. Danish State support to the Folkecenter received since 1983 was suspended as well. Since 2005, Folkecenter has received funding from the Energifonden and since 2012 support from the Danish state.

Preben Maegaard has served on several Danish national governmental committees and councils for the development and implementation of renewable energy as member of: 
* Renewable Energy Steering Group (1981-1991); 
* National Board of Technology;  National Renewable Energy Council in Denmark (1991-1996); 
* National Committee Biomass for Energy (1985-1989); 
* National Committee for Solar Energy (1995-2002); 
* National Committee for Wave Power (1997-2002); 
* National Committee for Hydrogen from Renewable for Transport Purposes (1998-2002).

For over three decades, Preben Maegaard has been conference director, organiser, speaker and/or participant of numerous national and international seminars, workshops and conferences, chairman of the World Wind Energy Conferences: WWEC2003 in Cape Town, WWEC2004 in Beijing and WWEC2005 in Melbourne (www.wwindea.org). Preben Maegaard is author and/or co-author of numerous reports, books, articles and periodicals in Danish, English, German and Japanese within the field of renewable energy and sustainable development and has received a number of awards.

'''Project Kaisei''' (from 海星, ''kaisei'', "ocean planet" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]&lt;ref name=Mercury1Sep09/&gt;) is a scientific and commercial mission to study and clean up the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]], a large body of floating debris trapped in the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the currents of the [[North Pacific Gyre]].&lt;ref name="Times02May09"/&gt; Discovered by [[NOAA]], the patch is estimated to contain 20 times the density of floating debris compared to the global average.&lt;ref name="Times02May09"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article6207231.ece|title=Pacific Bin|date=2009-05-02|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[[The Times]] | location=London|first=Martin|last=Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to study the extent and nature of the debris with a view to capturing, detoxifying, and recycling the material, and is organised by the '''Ocean Voyages Institute''', a California-based [[501c3]] non-profit organisation dealing with marine preservation.&lt;ref name="ProjectKaiseiBackground"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projectkaisei.org/background.html |title=Who is behind Project Kaisei? |date=n.d. |accessdate=2009-08-05 |publisher=Project Kaisei |work=[http://www.projectkaisei.org/index.html project website] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804032516/http://www.projectkaisei.org/background.html |archivedate=4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProjectKaiseiHomepage05Aug09"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projectkaisei.org/index.html|title=The Mission|date=n.d.|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Project Kaisei|work=[http://www.projectkaisei.org/index.html project website]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC04Aug09"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8184397.stm|title=Voyage to study plastic 'island'|date=2009-08-04|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[[BBC News]]|first=Judith|last=Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is based in [[San Francisco]] and [[Hong Kong]].

==History==
Project Kaisei was started in late 2008 by three co-founders from the [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco Bay Area]], all with many years of ocean stewardship and activities behind them. As [[ocean]] lovers, Mary being a long time [[sailor]], George a [[surfer]] and expert on [[surfboard]] design, and Doug with his open water swimming and paddling racing, each had different contacts and abilities to contribute to the group. With Doug living in [[Hong Kong]], the group set up two points of operation on either side of the [[Pacific]] ([[San Francisco]] and [[Hong Kong]]) to help begin to bring all parties to the table to stem the flow of plastic and marine debris into our ocean.&lt;ref name="ProjectHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectkaisei.org/kaisei_history.aspx|title=Kaisei History|accessdate=2011-05-27|publisher=Project Kaisei|format=aspx|work=[http://www.projectkaisei.org/index.html project website]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project goals==
The project was launched on 19 March 2009, with plans for an initial phase of scientific study of the plastic debris in the North Pacific Gyre and feasibility study of the recovery and recycling technologies.  The goal is to bring about a global collaboration of science, technology and solutions, to help remove some of the floating waste. New catch methods for the debris are being studied, which would have low energy input and low marine life loss.  Technologies for remediation or recycling are being evaluated, to potentially create secondary products from the waste, which in turn could help subsidize a larger scale cleanup.&lt;ref name="ProjectKaiseiLaunch19Mar09"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.projectkaisei.org/press/031909%20Project%20Kaisei%20Launches%20Mission%20to%20the%20Plastic%20Vortex_FINAL.pdf|title=Project Kaisei Launches Mission to the Plastic Vortex|date=2009-03-19|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Project Kaisei|format=pdf|work=[http://www.projectkaisei.org/index.html project website]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has completed two expeditions, one in the summer of 2009, and one in 2010.  New data on the issue has been collected, and more research and planning needs to be done in order to understand the metrics and costs associated with a larger scale cleanup effort. Planning is now taking place for future research and expeditions to take place which would allow for the testing of new capture technologies and equipment, as well as the demonstration of some of the remediation or recycling technologies that could be used.

==Initial voyage==
In August 2009, the initial study and feasibility voyage phase of Project Kaisei began, conducted by two vessels, the 174-foot (53-meter) diesel powered research vessel [[R/V]] [[RV New Horizon|''New Horizon'']], and the project flagship, the 150-foot (46-meter) [[tall ship]] [[Kaisei (ship)|''Kaisei'']].&lt;ref name="BBC04Aug09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NationalGeographic31Jul09"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090731-ocean-trash-pacific.html|title=Giant Ocean-Trash Vortex Attracts Explorers|date=2009-07-31|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFeely, Megan, "Earath's Eighth Continent," ''common ground''July/August,2009,  pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New Horizon'', owned by the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], left San Diego on 2 August 2009 on the Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition (SEAPLEX), set to last until 21 August.&lt;ref name="ProjectKaiseiHomepage05Aug09"/&gt; The SEAPLEX expedition is funded by the [[University of California, San Diego]], the National Science Foundation with supplemental funding from the Project Kaisei.&lt;ref name="SeaplexMission"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sio.ucsd.edu/Expeditions/Seaplex/|title=SEAPLEX The Mission|date=n.d.|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later the ''Kaisei'' a smaller tall ship, owned by the Ocean Voyages Institute, departed San Francisco on 4 August, and was expected to undertake a 30-day voyage.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg04Aug09"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601130&amp;sid=a5yzD_9Ce4EM|title=Tall Ship Sets Sail for ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’ (Update1) |date=2009-08-04|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kaisei'' was to investigate the size and concentration of the debris field, and explore retrieval methods, while the ''New Horizon'' would join her and study the effect of the debris field on marine life.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg04Aug09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time01Aug09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1914145,00.html|title=Expedition Sets Sail to the Great Plastic Vortex|date=2009-08-01|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[[Time.com]] | first=Bryan | last=Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensive sampling===
On reaching the patch, 1,000 miles from the Californian coast, ''New Horizon'' began intensive sampling on 9 August.&lt;ref name=NSFRelease27Aug09/&gt; The crew took samples every few hours around the clock, using nets of various sizes and collecting samples at various depths.&lt;ref name=UCSDNews28Sep09/&gt; ''New Horizon'' returned on Friday 21 August 2009.&lt;ref name=NSFRelease27Aug09/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReutersUK28Aug09/&gt; SEAPLEX reported their initial findings on Thursday 27 August 2009, declaring that the patch stretched at least 1,700 miles across, and that from 100 consecutive surface samples taken along that 1,700 path track taken through the patch, plastic was found in every one.&lt;ref name=ReutersUK28Aug09&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7194">[[Image:Rabbitsfoot.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Victorian silver mounted rabbit's foot charm]]
In some cultures, the '''foot of a [[rabbit]]''' is carried as an [[amulet]] believed to bring [[good luck]]. This belief is held by individuals in a great number of places around the world, including Europe, China, Africa, and North and South America. This belief likely has existed in Europe since 600 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI9Weq6q9dEC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22rabbit's+foot%22+celtic#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rabbit's%20foot%22%20celtic&amp;f=false | title=Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things | publisher=HarperCollins | date=1989 | accessdate=July 25, 2012 | author=Panati, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; among [[Celts|Celtic people]]. In variations of this [[superstition]], the donor rabbit must possess certain attributes, have been killed in a particular place, killed by a particular method, or by a person possessing particular attributes (e.g., by a [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] man).

==The rabbit foot charm in North American culture==
The belief in [[American folklore|North American folklore]] may originate in the system of [[African American]] folk [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] known as "[[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]]". A number of strictures attached to the charm that are now observed mostly in the breach: 

* First, not any foot from a rabbit will do: it is the left hind foot of a rabbit that is useful as a charm.
* Second, not any left hind foot of a rabbit will do; the rabbit must have been shot or otherwise captured in a [[cemetery]].
* Third, at least according to some sources, not any left hind foot of a rabbit shot in a cemetery will do: the [[lunar phase|phase]] of the [[moon]] is also important. Some authorities say that the rabbit must be taken in the [[full moon]], while others hold instead that the rabbit must be taken in the [[new moon]]. Some sources say instead that the rabbit must be taken on a Friday, or a rainy Friday, or [[Friday the 13th]]. Some sources say that the rabbit should be shot with a [[silver bullet]], while others say that the foot must be cut off while the rabbit is still alive.&lt;ref name=ellis&gt;Ellis, Bill: ''Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture'' (University of Kentucky, 2004), {{ISBN|0-8131-2289-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a substitute for bones from a human corpse==
[[Image:Rabbit foot blues.jpg|thumb|325px|The cover to "Rabbit Foot Blues", a [[blues]] song by [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], links the rabbit's foot tradition with the bones of the dead.]]
The various rituals suggested by the sources, though they differ widely one from another, share a common element of the uncanny, and the reverse of what is considered [[omen|good-omened]] and [[augury|auspicious]]. A rabbit is an animal into which [[shapeshifting]] [[witch]]es such as [[Isobel Gowdie]] claimed to be able to transform themselves. Witches were said to be active at the times of the full and new moons.

These widely varying circumstances may share a common thread of suggestion that the true lucky rabbit's foot is actually cut from a shapeshifted witch. The suggestion that the rabbit's foot is a substitute for a part from a witch's body is corroborated by other folklore from hoodoo. [[Willie Dixon]]'s song "[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]" mentions a "[[black cat bone]]" along with his [[mojo (African American culture)|mojo]] and his [[John the Conqueror]]: all are artifacts in hoodoo magic. Given the traditional association between [[black cat]]s and [[witchcraft]], a black cat bone is also potentially a substitute for a human bone from a witch. Hoodoo lore also uses graveyard dust, soil from a cemetery, for various magical purposes. Dust from a [[Goodness and value theory|good]] person's grave keeps away evil; dust from a sinner's grave is used for more nefarious magic. The use of graveyard dust may also be a symbolic appropriation of the parts of a corpse as a [[relic]], and a form of [[sympathetic magic]].&lt;ref name=ellis /&gt;

In any case, the rabbit's foot is dried out and preserved, and carried around by [[gambling|gamblers]] and other people who believe it will bring them luck. Rabbit's feet, either authentic or imitation, are frequently sold by curio shops and vending machines. Often, these rabbit's feet have been [[dye]]d various colors, and they are often turned into [[keychain]]s. Few of these rabbit's feet carry any [[warranty]] concerning their [[provenance]], or any evidence that the preparers have made any effort to comply with the rituals required by the original tradition. Some may be confected from [[fake fur]] and [[latex]] "bones"
. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] wrote in his autobiography that he had been given a gold-mounted rabbit's foot by [[John L. Sullivan]], as well as a penholder made by [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] out of a horseshoe. A 1905 anecdote also tells that [[Booker T. Washington]] and Baron [[Ladislaus Hengelmuller]], the ambassador from [[Austria]], got their overcoats confused when they were both in the [[White House]] to speak with President Roosevelt; the ambassador noticed that the coat he had taken was not his when he went to the pockets searching for his gloves, and instead found "the left hind foot of a graveyard rabbit, killed in the dark of the moon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.historycooperative.org/btw/Vol.8/html/437.html | title=The Booker T.

In addition to being mentioned in blues lyrics, the rabbit's foot is mentioned in the American [[folk song]] "[[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight]]", once popular in [[minstrel show]]s; one line goes: "And you've got a rabbit's foot To keep away de hoo-doo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJM_PrFI2scC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=Come+along+get+you+ready,+wear+your+bran,+bran+new+gown#v=onepage&amp;q=Come%20along%20get%20you%20ready%2C%20wear%20your%20bran%2C%20bran%20new%20gown&amp;f=false | title=The Voices That Are Gone: Themes in Nineteenth-Century American Popular Song | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=1997 | accessdate=July 25, 2012 | author=Finson, Jon W. | pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humorist R. E. Shay is credited with the witticism, "Depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but remember it didn't work for the rabbit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theotherpages.org/quote-02c.html R.E. Shay] quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erste ultraschall-aufgeschlossene-Flachsfaser.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Setralit: worldwide first SEM micrograph of ultrasonically opened flax fibers]]
'''Setralit''' is a technical natural fiber based on plant fibers whose property profile has been modified selectively in order to meet different industrial requirements. It was first manufactured in 1989 by Jean-Léon Spehner, an Alsatian engineer, and further developed by the German company ECCO Gleittechnik GmbH. The name “Setralit“ is derived from the French company Setral S.à.r.l. which is a subsidiary company of ECCO, where Spehner was employed at that time. Setralit was officially described first in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;“For Man and Environment” - Technology News International, issue Dec. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ecco-logo.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|ECCO-Logo]]
In the late eighties and early nineties [[asbestos]] in [[Friction|friction pads]] was banned at first in Germany and subsequently in the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]]. Consequently, the friction lining industry was looking for a substitute that was suitable as a reinforcing as well as a [[fiber|processing fiber]]. At the same time the EU established and subsidized a mandatory property [[set-aside]] to restrict the grain production. Only plants für use in industry could be grown on the set-aside land without affecting subsidies. Both the EU and the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] supplied money to boost the development of new materials and new manufacturing processes of such “[[renewable resources]]”, first of all for [[bast fiber]] plants like [[flax]] and – since 1996 – [[hemp]] with low [[THC]] content.

Against this background ECCO took part in joint project for the utilization of flax fibers in [[brake]] and [[clutch]] linings, funded by the German Federal Department for Research and Technology (BMFT). During this project several Setralit fiber types were being used for the first time. They had been generated by a chemical, thermal and/or mechanical treatment of  [[tow|flax tow]] which is a side product of the textile industry. The German [[popular press]] praised this approach as a ”sensational invention“.&lt;ref&gt;“Münchner erfand die Bio-Bremse” – Abendzeitung Munic, 28/29th of Sept. 1991 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the varying properties of the base material of first generation Setralit turned out to be a serious disadvantage because these variations affected the performance characteristics of the final product in an unforeseeable way. These differences are mainly being caused by growth and harvest conditions and as such are being influenced by the climate as well as by short-term weather fluctuations in the growing area. These effects are particularly critical during [[retting|dew retting]].

[[File:Setralit Nfu 31-2 (fibrillierte Naturfaser).jpg|thumb|250px|fibrillated Setralit fiber]]
In order to avoid this problem ECCO developed an [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] [[decomposition]] process (named “ultrasonic break-down“) at the end of the 90’s. Thanks to this controllable, physico-chemical extraction most of the associated material of the [[plant fibers]] ([[lignin]], [[pectin]], [[waxes]], [[adhesive|natural adhesives]], [[fragrances]] and [[dyestuff]]s, as well as [[dust]], [[bacteria]], and [[spores|fungi spores]]) is removed or destroyed. These second generation Setralit-fibers show an immensely smaller range of property variations compared to those of the first generation, which makes them more attractive for industrial use.

Following this, ECCO developed a series of Setralit types for various industrial end applications in cooperation with several industry partners in the construction, plastic and paper industries. In 2005, a fibrillated Setralit fiber managed to achieve the industrial breakthrough. This type is mainly used as a substitute for aramid pulp (Kevlar, Twaron et al.) for example in friction pads.

The omnipresent political discussions about [[sustainability]], protection of the natural resources, and reduction of [[global warming]] gases push the Setralit fiber into the focus of new industrial users.

According to the Nova Institute, Hürth, Germany, in the future there is no alternative to the increased substantial use of agricultural raw materials. Bio-based substances such as biodegradable and durable [[bio plastics]], natural fiber reinforced (bio) plastics ([[composite material|bio composites]]) and [[Wood plastic composite|wood-plastic composites (WPC)]] form an interesting new class of materials thereby.

==Production (Setralit process)==
[[File:USAN3-A5.jpg|thumb|250px|Ultrasonic technical plant]]
Setralit production is two-staged. During the first step the raw material is being subjected to an aqueous [[ultrasound|ultrasonic procedure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecco-fibre.net/ultraschalltechnologie-de.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308075618/http://www.ecco-fibre.net/ultraschalltechnologie-de.htm |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by washing and drying. During the second step of conditioning the so-cleaned Setralit-fiber is specifically threatened depending on its end use. In general this step is merely mechanical (cutting, grinding, fibrillating etc.), but it can also be combined with a thermal or chemical treatment. The term ''Setralit process'' means the combination of two (or more) manufacturing steps in a row. [[Decomposition]] of the plant fiber bundles leaves the basic physical properties of the elementary fibers unaffected; therefore Setralit is still identified as a [[natural fiber]].

The chemical fiber extraction by ultrasound is controllable, as are the following conditioning processes. Thus the properties can be fitted to the requirements of the end products – within the range that nature of fiber allows.

In principle, any plant fibers can be considered as raw material. However, bast fibers of annuals ([[flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[kenaf]] et al.) are preferred. Appropriate are stem fibers of perennial plants ([[Urtica dioica|nettle]], [[ramie]]), leaf fibers ([[sisal]], [[abaca]], cabuja, curaua) plus seed and fruit fibers ([[cotton]], [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]], [[coir]]). In contrast, the application of the Setralit technique to herbage ([[bamboo]], [[miscanthus]], [[bagasse]], [[cereal]], [[rice]] and [[Straw|corn straw]]) and [[wood]] has only been explored rudimentarily.

The Setralit techniques are applied either on crushed dry straw of bast fiber plants (mechanical fiber extraction) or on decorticated fibers (long fibers, flax tow). In the first case the fiber has to be separated mechanically, after the ultrasonic break-down, from its non-fibrous components (shives). As a benefit one gets clean shives as a byproduct which can serve as a raw material for high quality fiber powder. With the help of modified Setralit techniques the shives may also be upgraded separately.

==Characteristics==
[[File:SETRALIT TYPE 1 ultraschallbehandelt stark fibrilliert Hanf 2-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Setralit type 1: Natural fiber, ultrasonically treated, highly fibrillated (hemp)]]
[[File:SETRALIT TYPE 2 ultraschallbehandelt schwach fibrilliert Flachs 2-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Setralit type 2: Natural fiber, ultrasonically treated, slightly fibrillated (flax)]]
Concerning the technical characteristics, Setralit fibers differ remarkably from the raw fibers from which they were extracted from. The distinctive attribute of Setralit compared to a conventionally gained fiber is the reproducibility of its technical properties. These are being produced by standardized treatment processes. As conventional natural fibers mainly reflect the quality variations of the primary material, these are being evened out by ultrasonic extraction.

'''Other differing characteristics are:'''
* High cleanliness
* Brighter color
* Higher temperature resistance
* Customized and constant quality
* Rapid, high, and equal water absorption.
The different, mostly mechanical conditioning actions of step two lead to a range of well defined Setralit-types that differ in appearance as well as in technical characteristics. These properties are suited for the possible application of a certain Setralit-type. They are stated in the [[datasheet|technical datasheet]]. The [[specification]] describes the permitted variation of such parameters.

(*2) In this context “fibril” means a part of a fiber whose diameter is smaller than one third of the original fiber (mother or stem fiber). This line is drawn arbitrarily.

The mechanical strength values of Setralit-fibers reflect those of the primary material (e.g. flax, hemp, ramie fiber). The ultrasonic procedure does not lead to a damage of the fiber. Any losses in strength properties are due only to the mechanical wear during the second processing step.

==Applications==
[[File:Handschuhfach PP-NF CG.jpg|thumb|200px|Example for a possible future use of: glove compartment made of hemp fiber reinforced plastic with polypropylene (PP) matrix produced by NF injection molding.]]
Setralit® is a raw material for industrial manufacturing and allows multifunctional utilization. It can be substituted expensive synthetic fiber (e.g. aramid) in challenging technical applications.

It can either be processed to form a fiber reinforced composite (semi-finished product, compound) or be used directly in final products (fiber-reinforced building materials, gaskets, fiber mats etc.).

Example for a possible future use of: glove compartment made of hemp fiber reinforced plastic with polypropylene (PP) matrix produced by NF injection molding.

'''Areas of application for Setralit®-fibers''
* [[Friction|Friction Linings]]: today they represent the main application area of Setralit. Its use is important in mechanical engineering, because abrasion is non-harmful to the health of the operating personnel in contrast to the materials used previously (see 3.2).
* [[Brake lining]]s for vehicles consisting of many very different components including fillers and temperature resistant resins may contain Setralit fibers. The most important markets for brake linings are [[Europe]], Japan and the United States, closely followed by emerging Asian economies India and China. Although the use of asbestos in friction linings has been prohibited in the EU since 1989, elevated asbestos levels are still detected there in areas which include a lot of braking like junctions, motorway exits, landing strips, or railroad stations.
* Building sector: [[plaster]], [[Mortar (masonry)|dry mortar]], [[fiber cement]], [[concrete]], [[concrete|aerated concrete]], [[plaster|hard plaster]], [[Road surface|floor pavement]], lime-sand brick, [[Cardboard (paper product)|gypsum cardboard]], [[insulating materials]], insulating boards, dispersion paints.
* Plastics: [[semi-finished]] [[composite material|composites]], prepregs, [[Sheet Moulding Composite|SMC]], [[Bulk moulding compound|BMC]], [[injection molding]], formed parts, [[polymers|fiber reinforced polymers]], especially [[biopolymers]].
* Textiles: [[clothes]], [[Textiles|home textiles]], industrial textiles, [[geotextiles]], [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]s, spunlace mats, [[medical]] and [[sanitary]] articles.
* Chemical industry: [[friction|friction linings]], [[sealants]], [[filter (chemistry)|filtering agents]], [[filler (materials)|filler materials]], [[thixotropic]] agents, [[bitumen]], [[rubber]], [[Polishing|polishing agents]], [[putties]], [[adhesives]].
* Paper: [[technical papers]], [[cardboard boxes]], specialty papers.
* Other applications: (especially for shives and other by-products): [[Bedding|animal bedding]], bulk solids, animal food (pectin et al.), [[biogas]], energy generation.
'''The fiber length of the technical Setralit® fiber is linked to general application fields as follows:'''
* Long fiber, &gt; 100&amp;nbsp;mm: textile applications
:[[Yarn]], [[cloth]], fiber mats (e.g. heat insulation mats&lt;ref name="hanf"/&gt;)
* Short fiber, 0.5 – 10&amp;nbsp;mm: reinforcement fiber, textile short fiber
:Material reinforcement (e.g. plastic injection molding, aerated concrete &lt;ref name="flachs"&gt;“Flachs, Hanf – Werkstoffe aus der Natur” – Form 148, Zeitschrift für Gestaltung 1994 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;), spunlace nonwoven&lt;ref name="flachs"/&gt;
* Process fiber &lt; 1&amp;nbsp;mm
:Improvement of manufacturing processes (e.g. friction pads&lt;ref name="flachs"/&gt;)

==Brand name Setralit==

[[File:Schina sea 88.png|thumb|upright|South China Sea]]
The '''South China Sea Islands''' consist of over 250 [[island]]s, [[atoll]]s, [[cays]], shoals, [[reef]]s, and sandbars in the [[South China Sea]], none of which have indigenous people, few of which have any natural water supply, many of which are naturally under water at high tide, while others are permanently submerged.

==Geography==
The features are grouped into three archipelagos, plus the Macclesfield Bank and Scarborough Shoal. Collectively they have a total land surface area of less than 15&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at low tide:

[[File:Karta CN SouthChinaSea.PNG|thumb|right|Locations in the South China Sea]]
The islands are located on a shallow [[continental shelf]] with an average depth of 200 metres. However, in the Spratlys, the sea floor drastically changes its depth, and near the Philippines, the Palawan Trough is more than 5,000 metres deep. Also, there are some parts that are so shallow that navigation becomes difficult and prone to accidents.

The sea floor contains [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] [[granite]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s. The [[Abyssal zone|abysses]] are caused by the formation of the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Cenozoic]].

Except one [[volcano|volcanic]] island, the islands are made of [[coral reef]]s of varying ages and formations.

===Biogeography===
These islands listed here compose the South China Sea Islands [[ecoregion]], in the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] [[biome]].  Other islands in the South China Sea are not [[biogeography|biogeographically]] included.

===Resources===
There are [[mineral]]s, [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] deposits on the islands and under their nearby seafloor, also an abundance of sealife, such as fish, animals and vegetation, traditionally exploited as food by all the claimant nations for thousands of years—mostly without disputes that could risk war. In the 20th century, since the WW2 settlements failed to resolve ownership of such lesser areas of land, seas and islands—and because of the [[economic]], [[military]], and [[transport]]ational importance—their control, especially that of the Spratlys, has been in dispute between China and several [[Southeast Asia]]n countries, such as Vietnam, from the mid-20th century onwards. True occupation and control are shared between the claimants (see [[#Claims and control|claims and control]] below).

== Names ==
The South China Sea Islands were discussed from the 4th century BC in the Chinese texts ''[[Yizhoushu]]'', ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', and ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'', but only implicitly as part of the "Southern Territories" ({{zh|c=南州|p=Nán Zhōu|links=no}}) or "South Sea" ({{lang|zh|南海}}, ''Nán Hǎi''). During the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–206 BC), government administrators called the South China Sea Islands the "Three Mysterious Groups of Islands" ({{lang|zh|三神山}}, ''Sān Shén Shān''). But during the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty (23-220), the South China Sea was renamed "Rising Sea" ({{lang|zh|漲海}}, ''Zhǎng Hǎi''), so the islands were called the "Rising Sea Islands" ({{lang|zh|漲海崎头}}, ''Zhǎnghǎi Qítóu''). During the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]], they were known as the "Coral Islands" ({{lang|zh|珊瑚洲}}, ''Shānhú Zhōu''). From the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) to the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1912), various names were used for the islands, but in general ''Changsha'' and permutations referred to the [[Paracel Islands]], while ''Shitang'' referred to the [[Spratly Islands]]. These variations included, for the Paracels: ''Jiǔrǔ Luózhōu'' ({{lang|zh|九乳螺洲}}), ''Qīzhōu Yáng'' ({{lang|zh|七洲洋}}), ''Chángshā'' ({{lang|zh|长沙}}), ''Qiānlǐ Chángshā'' ({{lang|zh|千里长沙}}), and ''Qiānlǐ Shítáng'' ({{lang|zh|千里石塘}}); for the Spratlys: ''Shítáng'' ({{lang|zh|石塘}}), ''Shíchuáng'' ({{lang|zh|石床}}), ''Wànlǐ Shítáng'' ({{lang|zh|万里石塘}}), and ''Wànlǐ Chángshā'' ({{lang|zh|万里长沙}}).&lt;ref name="Shen"&gt;{{cite journal|title=China's Sovereignty over the South China Sea Islands: A Historical Perspective |first=Jianming |last=Shen |journal=Chinese Journal of International Law |year=2002 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=94–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Qing, the names ''Qianli Changsha'' and ''Wanli Shitang'' were in vogue, and Chinese fishermen from [[Hainan]] named specific islands from within the groups, although the Qing officially named 15 large islands in 1909. During China's [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican era]] (1912-1949), the government named the Spratlys ''Tuánshā Qúndǎo'' ({{lang|zh|团沙群岛}}) and then ''Nánshā Qúndǎo'' ({{lang|zh|南沙群岛}}); the Paracels were ''Xīshā Qúndǎo'' ({{lang|zh|西沙群岛}}); Republican authorities mapped over 291 islands, reefs, and banks in surveys in 1932, 1935, and 1947. The [[People's Republic of China]] has retained the Republican-era names for the island groups, supplementing them with a list of 287 names for islands, reefs, banks, and shoals in 1983.&lt;ref name="Shen"/&gt; From 2011-2012, China's [[State Oceanic Administration]] named 1,660 nameless islands and islets under its claimed jurisdiction; in 2012, China announced plans to name a further 1,664 nameless features by August 2013. The naming campaign is intended to consolidate China's sovereignty claim over [[Sansha]] ({{lang|zh|三沙}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-10/16/c_131910462.htm|title=China to name territorial islands|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=26 October 2012|publisher=Xinhua|location=Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt; a city which includes islands from the ''Xisha'' (Paracel), ''Nansha'' (Spratly and [[James Shoal]]) and ''Zhongsha'' ({{lang|zh|中沙}}, ''Zhōngshā''; [[Macclesfield Bank]], [[Scarborough Shoal]], and others) groups.

== History ==
From 1405 to 1433,  [[Zheng He]] commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa in [[Ming dynasty]] in China. 
In 1421, Zheng prepared the 6 edition  [[Mao Kun map]], usually referred to by Chinese people as Zheng He's Navigation Map (simplified Chinese: 郑和航海图; traditional Chinese: 鄭和航海圖; pinyin: Zhèng Hé hánghǎi tú), which included South China Sea Islands.

The countries with the most extensive activity in the South China Sea Islands are [[China]] and [[Vietnam]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In the 19th century, as a part of the occupation of [[French Indochina|Indochina]], [[France]] claimed control of the Spratlys until the 1930s, exchanging a few with the [[United Kingdom|British]]. During [[World War II]], the South China Sea islands were all occupied by [[Japan]]. After the end of World War II, Japan returned all the South China Sea Islands back to China, which had been agreed by the Allied Nations.

The [[People's Republic of China]], founded in 1949, claimed the islands as part of the province of [[Guangdong|Canton]] (Guangdong), and later of the [[Hainan]] special administrative region.

The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) named 132 of the South China Sea Islands in 1932 and 1935. In 1933, the Chinese government lodged an official protest to the French government after its occupation of [[Taiping Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/explore/todd.html Todd C. Kelly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228071356/http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/explore/todd.html |date=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], the Chinese government received the islands from the surrendering Japanese, according to international treaties made by the Allied Nations. In 1947, the Ministry of Interior of China renamed 149 of the islands. Later, in November 1947, the Secretaritat of Guangdong Government of China was authorised to publish the ''Map of the South China Sea Islands''.

The [[Japan]]ese and the [[France|French]] renounced their claims as soon as their respective occupations or colonisations ended.

In 1958, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) issued a declaration defining its territorial waters within what is known as the [[nine-dotted line]] which encompassed the [[Spratly Islands]]. North Vietnam's prime minister, [[Phạm Văn Đồng]], sent a diplomatic note to [[Zhou Enlai]], stating that "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam respects this decision." The diplomatic note was written on 14 September and was publicised in ''Nhan Dan'' newspaper (Vietnam) on 22 September 1958. Regarding this letter, there have been many arguments on its true meaning and the reason why [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] decided to send it to [[Zhou Enlai]]. In an interview with BBC Vietnam, Dr. Balázs Szalontai provided the following analysis of this issue:

{{quote|The general context of the Chinese declaration was the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held in 1956, and the resulting treaties signed in 1958, such as the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone. Understandably, the PRC government, though not being a member of the U.N., also wanted to have a say in how these issues were dealt with. Hence the Chinese declaration of September 1958. In these years, as I said before, North Vietnam could hardly afford to alienate China. The [[Soviet Union]] did not give any substantial support to Vietnamese reunification, and neither South Vietnamese leader [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] nor the U.S. government showed readiness to give consent to the holding of all-Vietnamese elections as stipulated by the Geneva Agreements. On the contrary, Diem did his best to suppress the Communist movement in the South. This is why Pham Van Dong felt it necessary to take sides with China, whose tough attitude toward the Asian policies of the U.S. offered some hope. And yet he seems to have been cautious enough to make a statement that supported only the principle that China was entitled for 12-mile territorial seas along its territory but evaded the issue of defining this territory. While the preceding Chinese statement was very specific, enumerating all the islands (including the Paracels and the Spratlys) for which the PRC laid claim, the DRV statement did not say a word about the concrete territories to which this rule was applicable. Still, it is true that in this bilateral territorial dispute between Chinese and Vietnamese interests, the DRV standpoint, more in a diplomatic than a legal sense, was incomparably closer to that of China than to that of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Vietnam, Về lá thư của Phạm Văn Đồng năm 1958, January 24, 2008. The English text of the interview is downloadable at https://www.academia.edu/6174115/Interview_North_Vietnam_and_Chinas_Maritime_Territorial_Claims_1958 .&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Citation needed|reason=Dead link|date=May 2018}}

It was also argued that, [[Pham Van Dong]] who represented North Vietnam at that time had no legal right to comment on a territorial part which belonged to the South Vietnam represented by [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]. Therefore, the letter has no legal value and is considered as a diplomatic document to show the support of the government of North Vietnam to the PRC at that time.&lt;ref name=TND20140602&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thanhniennews.com/politics/late-vietnam-pms-letter-gives-no-legal-basis-to-chinas-island-claim-26821.html |title=Late Vietnam PM’s letter gives no legal basis to China’s island claim |author=Thao Vi |date=2 June 2014 |website= |publisher=Thanh Nien News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In China, in 1959, the islands were put under an administrative office (办事处/''banshichu''). In 1988, the office was switched to the administration of the newly founded [[Hainan Province]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The PRC strongly asserted its claims to the islands, but in the late 1990s, under the [[new security concept]], the PRC put its claims less strongly.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  According to the [[Kyodo News]], in March 2010 PRC officials told US officials that they consider the South China Sea a "core interest" on par with Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-23/u-s-says-settling-south-china-sea-disputes-leading-diplomatic-priority-.html Clinton Signals U.S. Role in China Territorial Disputes After Asean Talks] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' 2010--07-23&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2010 the Communist Party-controlled [[Global Times]] stated that "China will never waive its right to protect its core interest with military means"&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/editorial/2010-07/555723.html American shadow over South China Sea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729150618/http://opinion.globaltimes.cn/editorial/2010-07/555723.html |date=29 July 2010 }} ''[[Global Times]]'' 26 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and a Ministry of Defense spokesman said that "China has indisputable sovereignty of the South Sea and China has sufficient historical and legal backing" to underpin its claims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-30/china-has-indisputable-sovereignty-in-south-china-sea-defense-aide-says.html China Says Its South Sea Claims Are `Indisputable'] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; China added a tenth-dash line to the east of Taiwan island in 2013 as a part of its official sovereignty claim to the [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|disputed territories in the South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234936.pdf |title= Limits in the Seas |publisher= Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs, U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thanhniennews.com/commentaries/new-tendashed-line-map-revealed-chinas-ambition-28816.html |title= New ten-dashed line map revealed China's ambition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the People's Republic of China and Vietnam, the [[Republic of China]] (i.e. Taiwan), [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the [[Philippines]] also claim and occupy some islands. Taiwan claims all the Spratly Islands, but occupies only one island and one shelf including [[Taiping Island]]. Malaysia occupies three islands on its continental shelf. The Philippines claim most of the Spratlys and call them the Kalayaan Group of islands, and they form a distinct municipality in the province of [[Palawan]]. The Philippines, however, occupy only eight islands. Brunei claims a relatively small area, including islands on Louisa Reef.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkuto/record/B31951296 Regional strategic considerations in the Spratly Islands dispute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indonesia]]'s claims are not on any island, but on maritime rights. (See [[South China Sea]])

== Flora and fauna ==

There are no known native terrestrial animals. Birds include [[booby|boobies]] and [[seagull]]s, which are very common on the islands. Their [[faeces]] can build up to a layer from 10&amp;nbsp;mm to 1 m annually.

There are around 100–200 [[native plant]] species on the islands. For example, the Paracels have 166 native species, but later the Chinese and the Vietnamese introduced 47 more species, including [[peanut]], [[sweet potato]], and various [[vegetable]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">A '''strainmeter''' is an instrument used by [[geophysicist]]s to measure the
[[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of the Earth.
Linear strainmeters measure the changes in the distance between two points,
using either a solid piece of material (over a short distance)
or a [[laser]] [[interferometer]] (over a long distance, up to several hundred meters).
The type using a solid length standard was invented by [[Benioff]] in 1932,
using an iron pipe; later instruments used rods made of fused [[quartz]].
Modern instruments of this type can make measurements of length changes over
very small distances, and are commonly placed in [[boreholes]] to measure
small changes in the diameter of the borehole.
Another type of borehole instrument detects changes in a volume filled with
fluid (such as [[silicone]] oil).
The most common type is the [[dilatometer]] invented by Sacks and Evertson in the USA
(patent 3,635,076);
a design that uses specially shaped volumes to measure the [[strain tensor]]
has been developed by Sakata in Japan.

All these types of strainmeters can measure [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] over frequencies
from a few [[Hertz|Hz]] to periods of days, months, and years. This allows them to measure
signals at lower frequencies than can be detected with [[seismometers]].
Most strainmeter records show signals from the [[earth tide]]s, and [[seismic wave]]s
from [[earthquake]]s.
At longer periods, they can also record the gradual accumulation of [[stress (physics)]]
caused by [[plate tectonics]], the release of this stress in [[earthquake]]s,
and rapid changes of stress following earthquakes.

The most extensive network of strainmeters is installed in [[Japan]];
it includes mostly [[quartz]]-bar instruments in tunnels and borehole strainmeters,
with a few laser instruments.
Starting in 2003 there has been a major effort (the Plate Boundary Observatory)
to install many more strainmeters along the Pacific/North-America plate boundary
in the [[United States]].
The aim is to install about 100 borehole strainmeters,
primarily in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]], and five laser strainmeters,
all in [[California]].

'''Temple tanks''' are [[water well|well]]s or [[reservoir]]s built as part of the temple complex near Indian temples. They are called pushkarini, kalyani, kunda, sarovara, tirtha, talab, pukhuri, etc. in different languages and regions of [[India]]. Some tanks are said to cure various diseases and maladies when bathed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some are [[stepwell]]s with many steps at the sides.

==Tank design==
Since ancient times, the design of water storage has been important in India's temple architecture, especially in western India where dry and monsoon seasons alternate. Temple tank design became an art form in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Culture/Archit/Stepw.html |title=Architecture - Stepwells |publisher= |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the art of tank design is the large, geometically spectacular Stepped Tank at the Royal Center at the ruins of [[Vijayanagara]], the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, surrounding the modern town of [[Hampi]].  It is lined with green [[diorite]] and has no [[Plumbing fixture#Inlets and drains|drain]]. It was filled by [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/hampi/lt01.html |title=Great Tank |publisher=art-and-archaeology |accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tanks are used for ritual cleansing and during rites of consecration. The water in the tank is deemed to be sacred water from the [[Ganges River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Binda| last= Thapar | year= 2004 | title= Introduction to Indian Architecture | edition=  | publisher= Periplus Editions | location=Singapore | pages= 43 | isbn=  0-7946-0011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stepwell==
In India, a [[stepwell]] is a deep masonry well with steps going down to the water level in the well. It is called a  ''vav'' in west India and a ''baoli'' in north India. Some were built by kings and were richly ornamented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indoarch.org/arch_glossary.php |title=Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent - glossary |publisher= |accessdate=2006-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often were built by nobility, some being for secular use from  which anyone could obtain water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/Rural/Traditional2.htm#Kere |title= Vav / vavdi / Baoli / Bavadi - Traditional stepwells |publisher= |accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Haridra Nadhi]] is the largest temple tank in [[India]], maybe in the world. It is in [[Mannargudi]], [[Thiruvarur District]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is the temple tank of one of the largest Hindu temples, the [[Rajagopalaswamy Temple, Mannargudi]].

The area of the temple tank is 23 acres (93,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is also called as Daughter of [[Kaveri river]].

== Kalyani ==
'''Kalyani''', also called '''''pushkarni''''', are ancient [[Hindu]] stepped [[bathing]] wells.

These wells were typically built near [[Hindu temple]]s to accommodate bathing and cleansing activities before prayer. They are also used for immersion of [[Ganesha]] idols during [[Ganesha Chaturthi]].

==Sarovar==
In [[Sikhism]] temple tanks are called "Sarovar".&lt;ref name="Harban Singh 1998"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Sikhism |author=Harban Singh | year=1998 |publisher= Punjabi University |url=http://www.advancedcentrepunjabi.org/eos/SAROVAR.html |isbn=978-81-7380-530-1 |pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TerraSAR-X''', an [[imaging radar]] [[Earth observation satellite]], is a joint venture being carried out under a public-private-partnership between the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) and [[Astrium|EADS Astrium]]. The exclusive commercial exploitation rights are held by the geo-information service provider [[Astrium]]. TerraSAR-X was launched on 15 June 2007 and has been in operational service since January 2008. With its twin satellite [[TanDEM-X]], launched 21 June 2010, TerraSAR-X acquires the data basis for the [[WorldDEM]], the worldwide and homogeneous [[Digital elevation model|DEM]] available from 2014.

==Satellite and mission==
[[Image:First bistatic radar image acquired by the twin satellites TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X in tandem flight.jpg|thumb|Radar image]]

With its [[phased array]] [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) antenna ([[X-band]] wavelength 31&amp;nbsp;mm, frequency 9.6&amp;nbsp;GHz), TerraSAR-X acquires new high-quality radar images of the entire planet whilst circling Earth in a [[polar orbit]] at 514&amp;nbsp;km altitude. The orbit is selected such that the satellite flies in a [[sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous dusk-dawn orbit]], which means that it moves along the day-night boundary of the Earth and always presents the same face to the sun, ensuring an optimum energy supply via the solar cells. TerraSAR-X is designed to carry out its task for five years, independent of weather conditions and illumination, and reliably provides radar images with a resolution of up to 1m.

Features of TerraSAR-X:
*resolution of up to 1&amp;nbsp;m,
*excellent radiometric accuracy,
*geometric accuracy unrivalled by any other commercial spaceborne sensor,
*quick site access time of 2.5 days max. (2 days at 95% probability) to any point on Earth,
*unique agility (rapid switches between imaging modes and polarisations)

==TerraSAR-X imaging modes==
TerraSAR-X acquires radar data in the following three main imaging modes:
* SpotLight: up to 1&amp;nbsp;m resolution, scene size 10&amp;nbsp;km (width) × 5&amp;nbsp;km (length);
* StripMap: up to 3&amp;nbsp;m resolution, scene size 30&amp;nbsp;km (width) × 50&amp;nbsp;km (length);
* ScanSAR: up to 16&amp;nbsp;m resolution, scene size 100&amp;nbsp;km (width) × 150&amp;nbsp;km (length);&lt;ref&gt;StripMap &amp; ScanSAR: acquisition length extendable to up to 1,650&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{Commons category|TerraSAR-X}}

In addition, the unique design of TerraSAR-X's SAR antenna allows a variety of polarimetric combinations: single or dual polarization and even full polarimetric data takes, are possible.

Depending on the desired application, one of four different product types (processing levels) can be selected
*Single Look Slant Range Complex (SSC)
*Multi Look Ground Range Detected (MGD)
*Geocoded Ellipsoid Corrected (GEC)
*Enhanced Ellipsoid Corrected (EEC)

== TanDEM-X and WorldDEM Akida ==
TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements) is a second, very similar spacecraft launched successfully on 21 June 2010 from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Since October 2010, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X fly in a close formation at distances of only a few hundred metres and record data synchronously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlr.de/blogs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5919/9754_read-268/ DLR - Blogs - The satellites have 'eye contact'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
This unique twin satellite constellation will allow the generation of WorldDEM, the global digital elevation models (DEMs). With an unprecedented accuracy, coverage and quality – WorldDEM is a consistent DEM of the Earth’s land surface is envisaged to be acquired and generated within three years after launch.  Available from 2014, WorldDEM is to feature a vertical accuracy of 2m (relative) and 10m (absolute), within a horizontal raster of approximately 12x12 square meters, slightly varying depending on the geographic latitude.&lt;ref&gt;GIM International: Weber, Marco; Koudogbo, Fifamè,January 2009, TerraSAR-X 1m Spaceborne Radar - Use, Features, Products and TanDEM-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of radar ==
[[Radar]] stood originally for ''Radio Detection and Ranging'' and contains traditionally:
* Range finding (EDM) by means of the time a reflected signal needs to return;
* Direction measurement over the adjustment of the antenna, and recently;
* also different analysis such as SAR, polarization, Interferometry etc.

Satellite radar entered use more than fifteen years after optical camera systems did. The resolution (detail sharpness) is in principle lower, but radar can gather information at any time of the day or night and independent of [[cloud cover]]. This contributes significantly to the reliability of the system, a much-desired property.

Early radar satellite techniques were e.g. the Altimetrie (leveling over the sea), NASA's [[SEASAT]] (launched in 1978), regulation of waves/wind or soil data. The military has used radar since the late 1930s and radar satellites at least since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;(Jensen, J. R. 2007. Remote Sensing of the Environment: An Earth Resource Perspective)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations with TerraSAR X==

TerraSAR X will exhibit some technical-industrial novelties. One of these innovations is a kind of zoom shot, with the resolution and scanning field vice versa changeable in a 1:10 relationship, either a larger area to grasp or a small area with the highest possible resolution.

Furthermore, the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] can be aligned by electronics within an angle range so that the point of view is adjustable. Earlier radar satellites could radiate the antenna only in one direction.

==Scanning and trajectory==

With the adjustable angle radar sensor - along with other course refinements ([[precession]] by the earth flattening) - any place on earth can be observed preferentially within 1–3 days.

For a specific point on the Earth's equator, TerraSAR X has a revisit cycle of 11 days. The revisit time decreases towards the poles, e.g. northern Europe has a revisit time of typically 3–4 days.

==Ground segment==

The ground operating mechanism and controls for the TerraSAR X is developed by the DLR in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]].
It consists of Mission Operating Equipment, the [[Payload (air and space craft)|Payload]] [[ground segment|Ground Segment]] and the Instrument Operation and Calibration Segment. At the base of the ground segment lies the German Space Operation Center (GSOC), the German Remote Sensing Datum Center (DFD) as well as Institutes for Methodology of Remote Sensing (MF) and the Institute for High-Frequency Engineering and Radar Systems (HR) which are all part of the DLR.

==Applications==

Applications of the high-resolution TerraSAR-X radar imagery include:

*'''Topographic Mapping:''' 2D and 3D, in scales down to 1:25,000, map updates
*'''Surface Movement:''' Based on timeseries acquired by TerraSAR-X over the same area surface displacements caused by subsurface mining, oil-/gas extraction, infrastructure construction, excavations, or underground engineering can be visualised.&lt;ref&gt;GeoBerichte 14, Landesamt für Bergbau, Energie und Geologie in Niedersachsen:Schrage, Thomas;Jacob, Philipp , June 2009, Flächenverbrauch und Bodenversigelung in Niedersachsen.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Change Detection:'''  for the monitoring of large-scale construction projects, infrastructure networks, monitoring and documentation of changes and developments
*'''Land Cover and Land Use Mapping:''' accurate and up-to-date land cover / land use informations, also from places, where it is difficult to get informations with using other technologies because of permanent cloud cover
*'''Defence and Security Applications:''' Applications include effective mission planning, the quick assessment of natural or manmade disasters or border control through detection of paths (changes), fences and moving objects
*'''Rapid Emergency Response:''' due to its rapid revisit time TerraSAR-X is a reliable source of information in case of natural or man-made disasters (e.g. earth quakes, floods, military conflicts etc.) providing reliable information for disaster management and response allowing the recognition and assessment of damages to populated areas and traffic infrastructure, the identification of focus areas, and an efficient coordination of rescue actions.&lt;ref&gt;GIM International: Balz, Timo; Scheuchl, Bernd;Li, Deren, October 2008, The Sichuan Earthquake(1)-Satellite Imagery for Rapid Response.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GIM International: Shao, Yun; Scheuchl, Bernd, November 2008, The Sichuan Earthquake (2)- Spaceborne SAR in Earthquake Response.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Environmental applications:''' e.g. forest monitoring, flood monitoring,&lt;ref&gt;GIM International: Koudogbo, Fifamè; Müller, Marc; Scheuchl, Bernd, December 2008, The Sichuan Earthquake (3)- Satellite-based Global Flood Response.&lt;/ref&gt; water quality applications
*'''Further applications''' currently under evaluation: Traffic Monitoring, Maritime applications, vegetation monitoring

==Scientific use of TerraSAR-X data==

The scientific use of the TerraSAR-X data will be coordinated through the TerraSAR-X Science Service System by the DLR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.terrasar-x.dlr.de/ TerraSAR-X Science Service System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The new-quality data records, as provided by TerraSAR-X, will offer a vast amount of new research incentives, for instance in ecology, geology, hydrology and oceanography. The smallest movements of the Earth's surface (plate tectonics, volcanism, earthquake) are further scientific fields of application.

==Commercial use of TerraSAR-X data==

In order to ensure the commercial success of the mission, [[Astrium|EADS Astrium]] founded its 100% subsidiary [[Infoterra Ltd|Infoterra]] in 2001; the company being responsible for establishing a commercial market for TerraSAR-X data as well as TerraSAR-X-based geo-information products and services.

The '''Tropic of Cancer''', which is also referred to as the '''Northern Tropic''', is the most northerly circle of [[latitude]] on [[Earth]] at which the [[Sun]] can be [[zenith|directly overhead]]. This occurs on the [[June solstice]], when the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHP Science Labs|url=http://www.neoprogrammics.com/obliquity_of_the_ecliptic/|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}} north of the [[Equator]].

Its [[Southern Hemisphere]] counterpart, marking the most southerly position at which the Sun can be directly overhead, is the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. These tropics are two of the five major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] that mark maps of Earth; the others being the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle]]s and the [[Equator]]. The positions of these two circles of latitude (relative to the Equator) are dictated by the tilt of Earth's [[rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]] relative to the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of its orbit]].

==Name==
When this line of latitude was named in the last centuries BC, the Sun was in the [[constellation]] [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] ([[Latin]] for ''[[crab]]'') at the [[June solstice]], the time each year that the Sun reaches its zenith at this latitude. Due to the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]], this is no longer the case; today the Sun is in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] at the June solstice. The word "tropic" itself comes from the Greek "trope (τροπή)", meaning turn (change of direction, or circumstances), inclination, referring to the fact that the Sun appears to "turn back" at the solstices.

==Geography==
{{kml}}
The Tropic of Cancer's position is not fixed, but constantly changes because of a slight wobble in the Earth's longitudinal alignment relative to its orbit around the Sun. Earth's axial tilt varies over a 41,000 year period from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees and currently resides at about 23.4 degrees.  This wobble means that the Tropic of Cancer is currently drifting southward at a rate of almost half an arcsecond (0.468″) of latitude,  or 15 metres, per year (it was at exactly 23° 27′N in 1917 and will be at 23° 26'N in 2045).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm Montana State University: Milankovitch Cycles &amp; Glaciation]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806021244/http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm |date=August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[axial tilt]] and [[circle of latitude#Movement of the Tropical and Polar circles|circles of latitude]] for further information.

North of the tropic are the [[subtropics]] and the [[temperate climate|North Temperate Zone]]. The equivalent line of latitude south of the Equator is called the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], and the region between the two, centered on the Equator, is the [[tropics]].

There are approximately 13 hours, 35 minutes of daylight during the summer solstice. During the winter solstice, there are 10 hours, 41 minutes of daylight.

Starting at the [[prime meridian]] and heading eastward, the Tropic of Cancer passes through the following countries and territories:

==Climate==
[[File:axial tilt vs tropical and polar circles.svg|thumb|400px|Relationship between Earth's axial tilt (&amp;#949;) to the tropical and polar circles]]
Excluding cooler highland regions in China, the climate at the Tropic of Cancer is generally hot and dry except for easterly coastal areas where [[Precipitation types#Orographic|orographic rainfall]] can be very heavy, in some places reaching {{convert|4|m|in|-1}} annually. Most regions on the Tropic of Cancer experience two distinct seasons: an extremely hot summer with temperatures often reaching {{convert|45|C|F}} and a warm winter with maxima around {{convert|22|C|F}}. Much land on or near the Tropic of Cancer is part of the [[Sahara Desert]], while to the east the climate is torrid [[monsoon]]al with a short wet season from June to September and very little rainfall for the rest of the year.

The highest mountain on or adjacent to the Tropic of Cancer is [[Yushan (mountain)|Yushan]] in [[Taiwan]]; though it had glaciers descending as low as {{convert|2800|m|ft|-1}} during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], none survive and at present no glaciers exist within {{convert|470|km|mi|-1}} of the Tropic of Cancer; the nearest currently surviving are the [[Minyong Glacier|Minyong]] and [[Baishui Glacier|Baishui]] in the [[Himalayas]] to the north and on [[Iztaccíhuatl]] to the south.

==Circumnavigation==
According to the rules of the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]], for a flight to compete for a round-the-world speed record, it must cover a distance no less than the length of the Tropic of Cancer, cross all [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]], and end on the same airfield where it started.

Length of the Tropic on 11 December 2015, at 23°26′14″N is '''{{convert|36,788|km|mi}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/RhumbSolve RhumbSolve online rhumb line calculator].&lt;/ref&gt;

For an ordinary [[circumnavigation]] the rules are somewhat relaxed and the distance is set to a rounded value of at least {{convert|36,770|km|mi}}.

Areas of '''tropical peat''' are found mostly in [[South East Asia]] (about 70% by area) although are also found in Africa, Central and South America and elsewhere around the Pacific Ocean. Tropical peatlands are significant [[carbon sink]]s and store large amounts of [[carbon]] and their destruction can significantly impact on the amount of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]. Tropical peatlands are vulnerable to destabilisation through human and climate induced changes. Estimates of the area (and hence volume) of tropical peatland vary but a reasonable estimate is in the region of {{convert|380000|km2}}.

Although tropical peatlands only cover about 0.25% of the Earth's land surface they contain 50,000-70,000 million tonnes of carbon (about 3% global soil carbon). In addition, tropical peatlands support diverse [[ecosystems]] and are home to a number of endangered species including the [[Orangutan]]. 

The native [[peat swamp forests]] contain a number of valuable timber-producing trees plus a range of other products of value to local communities, such as bark, resins and latex. Land-use changes and fire, mainly associated with plantation development and logging (deforestation and drainage), are reducing this carbon store and contributing to [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions. 

The problems that result from development of tropical peatland stem mainly from a lack of understanding of the complexities of this ecosystem and the fragility of the relationship between peat and forest. Once the forest is removed and the peat is drained, the surface peat [[oxidise]]s and loses stored carbon rapidly to the atmosphere (as carbon dioxide). This results in progressive loss of the peat surface, leading to local flooding and, due to the large areas involved, global climate change. Failure to account for such emissions results in underestimates of the rate of increase in atmospheric GHGs and the extent of human induced [[climate change]].

In [[fluid dynamics]], '''turbulence''' or '''turbulent flow''' is any pattern of fluid motion characterized by [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] changes in [[pressure]] and [[flow velocity]].  It is in contrast to a [[laminar flow]] regime, which occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between those layers.&lt;ref name=Batchelor&gt;{{cite book | last=Batchelor | first=G. | title=Introduction to Fluid Mechanics | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbulence is commonly observed in everyday phenomena such as [[Breaking wave|surf]], fast flowing rivers, billowing storm clouds, or smoke from a chimney, and most fluid flows occurring in nature and created in engineering applications are turbulent.&lt;ref name="ting-surf"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Coastal Engineering|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=131–160|year=1996|title=Dynamics of surf-zone turbulence in a spilling breaker|last1=Ting|first1=F.

L.|title=A First Course in Turbulence|year=1972|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/first-course-turbulence}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Turbulence is caused by excessive kinetic energy in parts of a fluid flow, which overcomes the damping effect of the fluid's viscosity. For this reason turbulence is easier to create in low viscosity fluids, but more  difficult in highly viscous fluids. In general terms, in turbulent flow, unsteady [[vortices]] appear of many sizes which interact with each other, consequently [[Drag (physics)|drag]] due to friction effects increases. This would increase the energy needed to pump fluid through a pipe, for instance. However this effect can also be exploited by devices such as aerodynamic [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] on aircraft, which deliberately "spoil" the laminar flow to increase drag and reduce lift.

The onset of turbulence can be predicted by a dimensionless constant called the [[Reynolds number]], which calculates the balance between kinetic energy and viscous damping in a fluid flow. However, turbulence has long resisted detailed physical analysis, and the interactions within turbulence create a very complex situation. [[Richard Feynman]] has described turbulence as the most important unsolved problem of classical physics.&lt;ref name="eames-quoting-feynman"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]|title=New developments in understanding interfacial processes in turbulent flows|last1=Eames|first1=I.|last2=Flor|first2=J.

* Smoke rising from a [[cigarette]] is mostly turbulent flow. However, for the first few centimeters the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]]. The smoke [[Plume (fluid dynamics)|plume]] becomes turbulent as its [[Reynolds number]] increases, due to its flow velocity and characteristic length increasing.
* Flow over a [[golf ball]]. (This can be best understood by considering the golf ball to be stationary, with air flowing over it.) If the golf ball were smooth, the [[boundary layer]] flow over the front of the sphere would be laminar at typical conditions. However, the boundary layer would separate early, as the pressure gradient switched from favorable (pressure decreasing in the flow direction) to unfavorable (pressure increasing in the flow direction), creating a large region of low pressure behind the ball that creates high [[form drag]].  To prevent this from happening, the surface is dimpled to perturb the boundary layer and promote transition to turbulence. This results in higher skin friction, but moves the point of boundary layer separation further along, resulting in lower form drag and lower overall drag.

==Features==
[[File:False color image of the far field of a submerged turbulent jet.jpg|thumb|right|Flow visualization of a turbulent jet, made by [[Planar laser-induced fluorescence|laser-induced fluorescence]]. The jet exhibits a wide range of length scales, an important characteristic of turbulent flows.]]
Turbulence is characterized by the following features:

; Irregularity : Turbulent flows are always highly irregular. For this reason, turbulence problems are normally treated statistically rather than deterministically. Turbulent flow is chaotic. However, not all chaotic flows are turbulent.

; Diffusivity : The readily available supply of energy in turbulent flows tends to accelerate the homogenization (mixing) of fluid mixtures.  The characteristic which is responsible for the enhanced mixing and increased rates of mass, momentum and energy transports in a flow is called "diffusivity".

Turbulent diffusion is usually described by a turbulent [[diffusion coefficient]]. This turbulent diffusion coefficient is defined in a phenomenological sense, by analogy with the molecular diffusivities, but it does not have a true physical meaning, being dependent on the flow conditions, and not a property of the fluid itself. In addition, the turbulent diffusivity concept assumes a constitutive relation between a turbulent [[flux]] and the gradient of a mean variable similar to the relation between flux and gradient that exists for molecular transport. In the best case, this assumption is only an approximation. Nevertheless, the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows, and many models have been postulated to calculate it. For instance, in large bodies of water like oceans this coefficient can be found using [[Lewis Fry Richardson|Richardson]]'s four-third power law and is governed by the [[random walk]] principle.  In rivers and large ocean currents, the diffusion coefficient is given by variations of Elder's formula.

;[[Rotationality]] : Turbulent flows have non-zero vorticity and are characterized by a strong three-dimensional vortex generation mechanism known as [[vortex stretching]]. In fluid dynamics, they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in the stretching direction—due to the conservation of angular momentum. On the other hand, vortex stretching is the core mechanism on which the turbulence energy cascade relies to establish the structure function.{{clarify|date=October 2014}} In general, the stretching mechanism implies thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements. As a result, the radial length scale of the vortices decreases and the larger flow structures break down into smaller structures. The process continues until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic energy can be transformed by the fluid's molecular viscosity into heat. This is why turbulence is always rotational and three dimensional. For example, atmospheric cyclones are rotational but their substantially two-dimensional shapes do not allow vortex generation and so are not turbulent. On the other hand, oceanic flows are dispersive but essentially non rotational and therefore are not turbulent.

;[[Dissipation]] : To sustain turbulent flow, a persistent source of energy supply is required because turbulence dissipates rapidly as the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy by viscous shear stress. Turbulence causes the formation of [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] of many different length scales. Most of the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is contained in the large-scale structures. The energy "cascades" from these large-scale structures to smaller scale structures by an inertial and essentially [[Inviscid flow|inviscid]] mechanism.  This process continues, creating smaller and smaller structures which produces a hierarchy of eddies.  Eventually this process creates structures that are small enough that molecular diffusion becomes important and viscous dissipation of energy finally takes place.  The scale at which this happens is the [[Kolmogorov microscales|Kolmogorov length scale]].

Via this [[energy cascade]], turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a [[mean flow]]. The eddies are loosely defined as coherent patterns of flow velocity, vorticity and pressure. Turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for each length scale ([[wavenumber]]). The scales in the energy cascade are generally uncontrollable and highly non-symmetric. Nevertheless, based on these length scales these eddies can be divided into three categories.
; Integral time scale
The integral time scale for a Lagrangian flow can be defined as:

&lt;math&gt;T = \left ( \frac{1}{\langle u'u'\rangle} \right )\int_{0}^{\infty} \langle u'u'(\tau)\rangle d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

where u' is the velocity fluctuation, and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time lag between measurements.&lt;ref name="Tennekes 1972"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Course in Turbulence|last=Tennekes|first=Hendrik|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Integral length scales 
: Largest scales in the energy spectrum. These eddies obtain energy from the mean flow and also from each other. Thus, these are the energy production eddies which contain most of the energy. They have the large flow velocity fluctuation and are low in frequency. Integral scales are highly [[anisotropic]] and are defined in terms of the normalized two-point flow velocity correlations. The maximum length of these scales is constrained by the characteristic length of the apparatus. For example, the largest integral length scale of pipe flow is equal to the pipe diameter. In the case of atmospheric turbulence, this length can reach up to the order of several hundreds kilometers.: The integral length scale can be defined as
: &lt;math&gt;L = \left ( \frac{1}{\langle u'u'\rangle} \right ) \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \langle u'u'(r)\rangle dr&lt;/math&gt;
: where r is the distance between 2 measurement locations, and u' is the velocity fluctuation in that same direction.&lt;ref name="Tennekes 1972"/&gt;
; [[Kolmogorov microscales|Kolmogorov length scales]] : Smallest scales in the spectrum that form the viscous sub-layer range. In this range, the energy input from nonlinear interactions and the energy drain from viscous dissipation are in exact balance. The small scales have high frequency, causing turbulence to be locally [[isotropic]] and homogeneous.
; [[Taylor microscale]]s : The intermediate scales between the largest and the smallest scales which make the inertial subrange. Taylor microscales are not dissipative scale but pass down the energy from the largest to the smallest without dissipation. Some literatures do not consider Taylor microscales as a characteristic length scale and consider the energy cascade to contain only the largest and smallest scales; while the latter accommodate both the inertial subrange and the viscous sublayer. Nevertheless, Taylor microscales are often used in describing the term “turbulence” more conveniently as these Taylor microscales play a dominant role in energy and momentum transfer in the wavenumber space.

Although it is possible to find some particular solutions of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] governing fluid motion, all such solutions are unstable to finite perturbations at large Reynolds numbers. Sensitive dependence on the initial and boundary conditions makes fluid flow irregular both in time and in space so that a statistical description is needed. The [[Russia]]n mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] proposed the first statistical theory of turbulence, based on the aforementioned notion of the energy cascade (an idea originally introduced by [[Lewis Fry Richardson|Richardson]]) and the concept of [[self-similarity]].  As a result, the [[Kolmogorov microscales]] were named after him. It is now known that the self-similarity is broken so the statistical description is presently modified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fnfal/papers/PhysToday.pdf weizmann.ac.il]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, a complete description of turbulence remains one of the [[unsolved problems in physics]].

According to an apocryphal story, [[Werner Heisenberg]] was asked what he would ask [[God]], given the opportunity. His reply was: "When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: Why [[Theory of relativity|relativity]]? And why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshak|first=Alex|title=3D radiative transfer in cloudy atmospheres|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzg6wnpHyCUC|year=2005|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-3-540-23958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar witticism has been attributed to [[Horace Lamb]] (who had published a noted text book on [[Hydrodynamics]])—his choice being [[quantum electrodynamics]] (instead of relativity) and turbulence. Lamb was quoted as saying in a speech to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], "I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullin|first=Tom|date=11 November 1989|title=Turbulent times for fluids|journal=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=P.

A more detailed presentation of turbulence with emphasis on high-Reynolds number flow, intended for a general readership of physicists and applied mathematicians, is found in the [[Scholarpedia]] articles by Benzi and Frisch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Turbulence|title=Turbulence|website=Scholarpedia|first1=R.|last1=Benzi|author2-link=Uriel Frisch|first2=U.|last2=Frisch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Falkovich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cascade_and_scaling |first=G. |last=Falkovich|website=Scholarpedia|title=Cascade and scaling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many scales of meteorological motions; in this context turbulence affects small-scale motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stull|first=Roland B.|title=An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology|date=1994|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht [u.a.]|isbn=978-90-277-2769-5|page=20|edition=reprint of 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Onset of turbulence==
[[File:Laminar-turbulent transition.jpg|thumb|right|The plume from this candle flame goes from laminar to turbulent. The Reynolds number can be used to predict where this transition will take place]]The onset of turbulence can be predicted by the [[Reynolds number]], which is the [[ratio]] of inertial forces to [[viscous]] forces within a fluid which is subject to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in what is known as a [[boundary layer]] in the case of a bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falkovich|first=G.|date=2011|title=Fluid Mechanics|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}{{missing ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ability to predict the onset of turbulent flow is an important design tool for equipment such as piping systems or aircraft wings, but the Reynolds number is also used in scaling of fluid dynamics problems, and is used to determine [[dynamic similitude]] between two different cases of fluid flow, such as between a model aircraft, and its full size version. Such scaling is not always linear and the application of Reynolds numbers to  both situations allows scaling factors to be developed. 
A flow situation in which the [[kinetic energy]] is significantly absorbed due to the action of fluid molecular [[viscosity]] gives rise to a [[laminar flow]] regime. For this the dimensionless quantity the [[Reynolds number]] ({{math|Re}}) is used as a guide.

With respect to [[Laminar flow|laminar]] and turbulent flow regimes:

* laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion;
* turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by inertial forces, which tend to produce chaotic [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], [[Vortex|vortices]] and other flow instabilities.

The Reynolds number is defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sommerfeld|first=Arnold|date=1908|title=Ein Beitrag zur hydrodynamischen Erkläerung der turbulenten Flüssigkeitsbewegüngen|trans-title=A Contribution to Hydrodynamic Explanation of Turbulent Fluid Motions|journal=International Congress of Mathematicians|volume=3|pages=116–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho v L}{\mu} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* {{mvar|[[Rho (letter)|ρ]]}} is the [[density]] of the fluid ([[SI units]]: kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* {{mvar|v}} is a characteristic velocity of the fluid with respect to the object (m/s)
* {{mvar|L}} is a characteristic linear dimension  (m)
* {{mvar|[[Mu (letter)|μ]]}} is the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the [[fluid]] (Pa·s or N·s/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or kg/(m·s)).

While there is no theorem directly relating the non-dimensional Reynolds number to turbulence, flows at Reynolds numbers larger than 5000 are typically (but not necessarily) turbulent, while those at low Reynolds numbers usually remain laminar. In [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation|Poiseuille flow]], for example, turbulence can first be sustained if the Reynolds number is larger than a critical value of about 2040;&lt;ref name=Recrit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avila|first=K.|first2=D.|last2=Moxey|first3=A.|last3=de Lozar |first4=M. |last4=Avila |first5=D. |last5=Barkley|author5-link=Dwight Barkley |author6=B. Hof |title=The Onset of Turbulence in Pipe Flow|journal=Science|date=July 2011|volume=333|issue=6039|pages=192–196|doi=10.1126/science.1203223|pmid=21737736|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6039/192|bibcode = 2011Sci...333..192A }}&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, the turbulence is generally interspersed with laminar flow until a larger Reynolds number of about 4000.

The transition occurs if the size of the object is gradually increased, or the [[viscosity]] of the fluid is decreased, or if the [[density]] of the fluid is increased.

==Heat and momentum transfer==
When flow is turbulent, particles exhibit additional transverse motion which enhances the rate of energy and momentum exchange between them thus increasing the [[heat transfer coefficient|heat transfer]] and the [[friction]] coefficient.

Assume for a two-dimensional turbulent flow that one was able to locate a specific point in the fluid and measure the actual flow velocity {{math|'''v''' {{=}} (''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'',''v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} of every particle that passed through that point at any given time. Then one would find the actual flow velocity fluctuating about a mean value:

:&lt;math&gt;v_x = \underbrace{\overline{v_x}}_\text{mean value} + \underbrace{v'_x}_\text{fluctuation} \quad \text{and} \quad v_y=\overline{v_y} + v'_y \,;&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for temperature ({{math|''T'' {{=}} {{overline|''T''}} + ''T′''}}) and pressure ({{math|''P'' {{=}} {{overline|''P''}} + ''P′''}}), where the primed quantities denote fluctuations superposed to the mean. This decomposition of a flow variable into a mean value and a turbulent fluctuation was originally proposed by [[Osborne Reynolds]] in 1895, and is considered to be the beginning of the systematic mathematical analysis of turbulent flow, as a sub-field of fluid dynamics. While the mean values are taken as predictable variables determined by dynamics laws, the turbulent fluctuations are regarded as stochastic variables.

The heat flux and momentum transfer (represented by the shear stress {{mvar|τ}}) in the direction normal to the flow for a given time are

==Kolmogorov's theory of 1941{{anchor|Kolmogorov's theory}}==

Richardson's notion of turbulence was that a turbulent flow is composed by "eddies" of different sizes. The sizes define a characteristic length scale for the eddies, which are also characterized by flow velocity scales and time scales (turnover time) dependent on the length scale. The large eddies are unstable and eventually break up originating smaller eddies, and the kinetic energy of the initial large eddy is divided into the smaller eddies that stemmed from it. These smaller eddies undergo the same process, giving rise to even smaller eddies which inherit the energy of their predecessor eddy,  and so on. In this way, the energy is passed down from the large scales of the motion to smaller scales until reaching a sufficiently small length scale such that the viscosity of the fluid can effectively dissipate the kinetic energy into internal energy.

In his original theory of 1941, [[Kolmogorov]] postulated that for very high [[Reynolds number]]s, the small scale turbulent motions are statistically isotropic (i.e. no preferential spatial direction could be discerned). In general, the large scales of a flow are not isotropic, since they are determined by the particular geometrical features of the boundaries (the size characterizing the large scales will be denoted as {{mvar|L}}). Kolmogorov's idea was that in the Richardson's energy cascade this geometrical and directional information is lost, while the scale is reduced, so that the statistics of the small scales has a universal character: they are the same for all turbulent flows when the Reynolds number is sufficiently high.

Thus, Kolmogorov introduced a second hypothesis: for very high Reynolds numbers the statistics of small scales are universally and uniquely determined by the [[kinematic viscosity]] {{mvar|ν}} and the rate of energy dissipation {{mvar|ε}}. With only these two parameters, the unique length that can be formed by dimensional analysis is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \left(\frac{\nu^3}{\varepsilon}\right)^\frac14 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is today known as the Kolmogorov length scale (see [[Kolmogorov microscales]]).

A turbulent flow is characterized by a hierarchy of scales through which the energy cascade takes place. Dissipation of kinetic energy takes place at scales of the order of Kolmogorov length {{mvar|η}}, while the input of energy into the cascade comes from the decay of the large scales, of order {{mvar|L}}. These two scales at the extremes of the cascade can differ by several orders of magnitude at high Reynolds numbers. In between there is a range of scales (each one with its own characteristic length {{mvar|r}}) that has formed at the expense of the energy of the large ones. These scales are very large compared with the Kolmogorov length, but still very small compared with the large scale of the flow (i.e. {{math|''η'' ≪ ''r'' ≪ ''L''}}). Since eddies in this range are much larger than the dissipative eddies that exist at Kolmogorov scales, kinetic energy is essentially not dissipated in this range, and it is merely transferred to smaller scales until viscous effects become important as the order of the Kolmogorov scale is approached. Within this range inertial effects are still much larger than viscous effects, and it is possible to assume that viscosity does not play a role in their internal dynamics (for this reason this range is called "inertial range").

Hence, a third hypothesis of Kolmogorov was that at very high Reynolds number the statistics of scales in the range {{math|''η'' ≪ ''r'' ≪ ''L''}} are universally and uniquely determined by the scale {{mvar|r}} and the rate of energy dissipation {{mvar|ε}}.

The way in which the kinetic energy is distributed over the multiplicity of scales is a fundamental characterization of a turbulent flow. For homogeneous turbulence (i.e., statistically invariant under translations of the reference frame) this is usually done by means of the ''energy spectrum function'' {{math|''E''(''k'')}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the modulus of the wavevector corresponding to some harmonics in a Fourier representation of the flow velocity field {{math|'''u'''('''x''')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}) = \iiint_{\mathbb{R}^3} \hat{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{k})e^{i \mathbf{k \cdot x}} \mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{k} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''û'''('''k''')}} is the Fourier transform of the flow velocity field. Thus, {{math|''E''(''k'')d''k''}} represents the contribution to the kinetic energy from all the Fourier modes with {{math|''k'' &lt; {{abs|'''k'''}} &lt; ''k'' + d''k''}}, and therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac12\left\langle u_i u_i \right\rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty}E(k)\mathrm{d}k \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}⟨''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩}} is the mean turbulent kinetic energy of the flow. The wavenumber {{mvar|k}} corresponding to length scale {{mvar|r}} is {{math|''k'' {{=}} {{sfrac|2π|''r''}}}}. Therefore, by dimensional analysis, the only possible form for the energy spectrum function according with the third Kolmogorov's hypothesis is

:&lt;math&gt;E(k) = C \varepsilon^\frac23 k^{-\frac53} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|C}} would be a universal constant. This is one of the most famous results of Kolmogorov 1941 theory, and considerable experimental evidence has accumulated that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Uriel Frisch|first=U. |last=Frisch |title=Turbulence: The Legacy of A. N. Kolmogorov |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1995 |isbn=9780521457132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this success, Kolmogorov theory is at present under revision. This theory implicitly assumes that the turbulence is statistically self-similar at different scales. This essentially means that the statistics are scale-invariant in the inertial range. A usual way of studying turbulent flow velocity fields is by means of flow velocity increments:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{u}(r) = \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{r}) - \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}) \,;&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the difference in flow velocity between points separated by a vector {{math|'''r'''}} (since the turbulence is assumed isotropic, the flow velocity increment depends only on the modulus of {{math|'''r'''}}). Flow velocity increments are useful because they emphasize the effects of scales of the order of the separation {{mvar|r}} when statistics are computed.  The statistical scale-invariance implies that the scaling of flow velocity increments should occur with a unique scaling exponent {{mvar|β}}, so that when {{mvar|r}} is scaled by a factor {{mvar|λ}},

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{u}(\lambda r)&lt;/math&gt;

should have the same statistical distribution as

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\beta \delta \mathbf{u}(r)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

with {{mvar|β}} independent of the scale {{mvar|r}}. From this fact, and other results of Kolmogorov 1941 theory, it follows that the statistical moments of the flow velocity increments (known as ''structure functions'' in turbulence) should scale as

:&lt;math&gt;\Big\langle \big ( \delta \mathbf{u}(r)\big )^n \Big\rangle = C_n (\varepsilon r)^\frac{n}{3} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the brackets denote the statistical average, and the {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} would be universal constants.

There is considerable evidence that turbulent flows deviate from this behavior. The scaling exponents deviate from the {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|3}}}} value predicted by the theory, becoming a non-linear function of the order {{mvar|n}} of the structure function. The universality of the constants have also been questioned. For low orders the discrepancy with the Kolmogorov {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|3}}}} value is very small, which explain the success of Kolmogorov theory in regards to low order statistical moments. In particular, it can be shown that when the energy spectrum follows a power law

:&lt;math&gt;E(k) \propto k^{-p} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 3}}, the second order structure function has also a power law, with the form

:&lt;math&gt;\Big\langle \big (\delta \mathbf{u}(r)\big )^2 \Big\rangle \propto r^{p-1} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

Since the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function only deviate slightly from the {{sfrac|2|3}} value predicted by Kolmogorov theory, the value for {{mvar|p}} is very near to {{sfrac|5|3}} (differences are about 2%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=J.|last1=Mathieu|first2=J.|last2=Scott|title=An Introduction to Turbulent Flow|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000}}{{missing ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus the "Kolmogorov −{{sfrac|5|3}} spectrum" is generally observed in turbulence. However, for high order structure functions the difference with the Kolmogorov scaling is significant, and the breakdown of the statistical self-similarity is clear. This behavior, and the lack of universality of the {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} constants, are related with the phenomenon of intermittency in turbulence. This is an important area of research in this field, and a major goal of the modern theory of turbulence is to understand what is really universal in the inertial range.

In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Xochiquetzal''' ({{lang-nci-IPA|Xōchiquetzal|ʃoːtʃiˈketsaɬ}}), also called '''Ichpochtli''' {{lang-nci-IPA|Ichpōchtli|itʃˈpoːtʃtɬi||}}, meaning "maiden",&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;''Nahuatl Dictionary.'' (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved September 1, 2012, from [http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso link]&lt;/ref&gt; was a goddess associated with concepts of fertility, beauty, and female sexual power, serving as a protector of young mothers and a patroness of pregnancy, childbirth, and the crafts practised by women such as weaving and embroidery. In pre-Hispanic Maya culture, a similar figure is [[Goddess I]].

==Name==
The name ''Xōchiquetzal'' is a compound of ''[[wikt:xochitl|xōchitl]]'' (“flower”) and ''[[wikt:quetzalli|quetzalli]]'' (“precious feather; quetzal tail feather”). In Classical Nahuatl morphology, the first element in a compound modifies the second, and thus the goddess' name can literally be taken to mean “flower precious feather”, or ”flower quetzal feather”. Her alternative name, ''Ichpōchtli'', corresponds to a personalized usage of ''[[wikt:ichpochtli|ichpōchtli]]'' (“maiden, young woman”).

==Description==
[[Image:Ichpuchtli.jpg|thumb|left|Xochiquetzal in [[Codex Borgia]].]]

Unlike several other figures in the complex of Aztec female earth deities connected with agricultural and sexual fecundity, Xochiquetzal is always depicted as an alluring and youthful woman, richly attired and symbolically associated with vegetation and in particular flowers. By connotation, Xochiquetzal is also representative of human desire, pleasure, and excess, appearing also as patroness of artisans involved in the manufacture of luxury items.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen (1991, p.163); Miller &amp; Taube (1993, p.190); Smith (2003, p.203)&lt;/ref&gt;

She was followed by a retinue consisting of [[birds]] and [[butterfly|butterflies]].  Worshippers wore animal and flower masks at a festival, held in her honor every eight years. Her twin was [[Xochipilli]] and her husband was [[Tlaloc]], until [[Tezcatlipoca]] kidnapped her and she was forced to marry him.  At one point, she was also married to [[Centeotl]] and [[Xiuhtecuhtli]].  By [[Mixcoatl]], she was the mother of [[Quetzalcoatl]].

Ichpōchtli is an alternative form of Xochiquetzal representative of beauty, sex, crafts, fertility, dance, music, singing, weaving, magic, and love spells. [[Tagetes|Marigolds]] are sacred to her.

Anthropologist Hugo Nutini identifies her with the [[Virgin of Ocotlan]] in his article on patron saints in [[Tlaxcala]].&lt;ref&gt;Nutini (1976), ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;
