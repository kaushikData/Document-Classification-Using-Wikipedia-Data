      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15838">The '''2012 Malawian constitutional crisis''' occurred from April 5, 2012 - April 7, 2012 after senior members of the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Malawi)|Democratic Progressive Party]]-led [[Cabinet of Malawi|cabinet]] failed to notify the public of the death of the sitting president, [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] on April 5. Instead, cabinet ministers held a series of meetings in [[Lilongwe]], [[Malawi]] without vice-president [[Joyce Banda]] with the aim of undermining the constitution and Banda's succession to Presidency.&lt;ref name = "death"&gt;{{cite web|title = Malawi announces president's death|work = Aljazeera News, Africa|date = April 7, 2012|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/04/20124773013110727.html|accessdate = 2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  News confirming his death had, however, quickly spread across the country (and to the Malawian diaspora) through word of mouth, cellphone [[text messages]], Malawian [[bloggers]], [[Twitter]], Facebook, and on listservs by the end of the day on April 5, 2012.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201204130303.html allAfrica.com: Malawi: Social Media Activism Takes Root (Page 1 of 4)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the failure to announce his death resulted in speculation over the real health of the president and over whether the succession procedures would be followed as outlined in the constitution. According to the constitution, the vice-president takes over but there had been no official word on a successor or communication with the vice-president. Amidst growing speculation, the Cabinet announced that the president's brother, [[Peter Mutharika]], the foreign minister, was the new President of the party on April 6.&lt;ref name = "death" /&gt; The Cabinet only announced his death two days after his death, after which Banda became Malawi's first female President.&lt;ref name = "death" /&gt;

==Background==
President [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] had increasingly begun to consolidate his power during his second term. He groomed his brother, [[Peter Mutharika]], a lawyer and the Minister of Foreign Affairs as his successor. This meant that he by-passed his sitting Vice President, [[Joyce Banda]] but expected her to support this bid. Instead, wa Mutharika caused factions within his [[Democratic Progressive Party]] and fired Banda and Second Vice President [[Khumbo Kachali]] from their positions in the government and the party in 2010. According to the [[Constitution of Malawi]], however, a vice president has to be removed through an impeachment process requiring a majority of the [[National Assembly (Malawi)|National Assembly]]. Therefore, the Malawi court declared this act unconstitutional. The court declared that he could fire Banda from his party but not from the government because the removal process for these positions were different. A party vice president can be removed in accordance with that party's internal process. However, a vice president, who is voted in with the presidential position, can only be removed through a legally sanctioned impeachment process.&lt;ref name = "death" /&gt; As such, Banda was regarded as the legal vice president even though she was also not vice president of the DPP party. Mutharika knew that he would not garner the majority in parliament due to factions within the party over the succession of the presidency and therefore he proceeded to frustrate Banda in order to force her to resign as Vice President. She refused to resign and continued in her capacity as vice president of the country, although under constant duress and harassment. Her security detail was changed and several of her privileges were redirected to Mutharika's brother Peter. Banda then formed a new political party, the [[People's Party (Malawi)|People's Party]], in 2011.

===Constitution===
According to section 83, subsection 4 of Malawi's constitution, "whenever there is a vacancy in the office of President, the First Vice-President shall assume that office for the remainder of the term and shall appoint another person to serve as First Vice-President for the remainder of the term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sdnp.org.mw/constitut/chapter8.html#83 | title=Constitution of Malawi | date=1998 | accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis in detail==

===Thursday, April 5===
President Mutharika had private meetings with Member of Parliament [[Patricia Kaliati]] and later Lilongwe legislator [[Agnes Penemulungu]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nyasatimes.com/2012/05/28/callista-recounts-cagey-events-to-bingus-death/ | title=Callista recounts cagey events to Bingu’s death | work=Nyasa Times | date=28 May 2012 | accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of a heart attack during the meeting with Penemulungu and was declared [[dead on arrival]] at the local hospital.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zeleza.com"&gt;[http://zeleza.com/blogging/u-s-affairs/president-mutharika-president-joyce-banda-malawi-chikosa-mozesi-silungwe zeleza.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417214509/http://zeleza.com/blogging/u-s-affairs/president-mutharika-president-joyce-banda-malawi-chikosa-mozesi-silungwe |date=April 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior members of the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Malawi)|Democratic Progressive Party]]-led cabinet did not notify the public of the death of the President from a heart attack. However, news confirming his death spread quickly across the country (and to the Malawian diaspora) through word-of-mouth, cellphone [[text messages]], Malawian bloggers, Twitter, Facebook, and on listservs throughout the day.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"/&gt; An online newspaper, the ''Malawian Democrat'', first broke the news to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.malawidemocrat.com/bingu-wa-mutharika-is-dead/ | title=Bingu wa Mutharika is dead | work=Malawian Democrat | date=5 April 2012 | accessdate=1 July 2015 | location=Lilongwe | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627060638/http://www.malawidemocrat.com/bingu-wa-mutharika-is-dead/ | archive-date=2013-06-27 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An online journalist, Andrew Evans, from ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' used Twitter to confirm reports and broke the news to international press. News of the possibility of a cover-up began to spread throughout the country and abroad.&lt;ref name="digitalnomad"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalnomad.nationalgeographic.com/2012/04/06/at-the-scene-of-malawian-presidents-death/ | title=At the Scene of Malawi President's Death | publisher=National Geographic Society | work=Digital Nomad | date=6 April 2012 | accessdate=1 July 2015 | author=Evans, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malawian army switched its security detail and went to the home of Vice President [[Joyce Banda]] in order to protect her in accordance with the constitution of Malawi. Extra police were deployed to the streets as a precautionary measure.

The initial emergency meetings took place at the residence of the vice president of the party, [[Goodall Gondwe]]. The ministers present included [[Ken Lipenga]], [[Catherine Gotani Hara]], and [[Peter Mutharika]], but it is largely unclear who supported the coup and who opposed it since this was not a unanimous decision. It is known that Mutharika accepted his nomination as the DPP president.&lt;ref name="nyasatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nyasatimes.com/2012/04/14/exposed-failed-plot-to-swear-peter-mutharika-at-night/ | title=Exposed!

===Friday, April 6===
Senior government officials made statements to the media that the President was not well and was being flown to South Africa but no official announcements were made. Vice President [[Joyce Banda]] thereafter informed the nation that President Mutharika was unwell and that she had contacted South Africa about the President’s condition.&lt;ref name="zeleza.com"/&gt; She also informed the nation that if he became incapacitated that the Constitution would take its course. Amidst growing speculation, the cabinet announced that the president's brother, [[Peter Mutharika]], the foreign minister, would be the new President of the DPP.&lt;ref name = "death" /&gt;

Senior members of the cabinet led by [[Patricia Kaliati]], Minister of Information, appeared on television and announced that the president was not well and that the country would be updated on his health. They further stated that Vice President Banda was ineligible to succeed Mutharika because she had formed her own political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decapost.com/world/africa/2012/04/09/reports-in-malawi-of-mutharikas-death-worry-us_s_1134199.html |accessdate=April 22, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Midnight Six====
The Midnight Six is the term used to refer to the cabinet Ministers that were involved in the coup and who appeared on television at midnight: 
* [[Patricia Kaliati]], Minister of Information and Civic Education.
* [[Henry Mussa]], Minister of local Government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Dr. [[Jean Kalilani]], Minister of Health
* [[Simon Vuwa Kaunda]], Minister of Sports
* [[Nicholas Dausi]], Deputy Minister in the Office of the President
* [[Kondwani Nakhumwa]], Deputy Minister of foreign Affairs.

Their public appearance and support for the statements on national television means that they are all inextricably linked to the coup plot.&lt;ref name="nyasatimes.com"/&gt; There is debate on whether or not the involvement of these six will lead to legal prosecution for attempted treason.&lt;ref name="nyasatimes.com"/&gt;

=== Saturday, April 7 ===
The ''Malawi News'' printed a headline entitled, "Bingu Dead". The senior members of the government thereafter announced President Mutharika's death.&lt;ref name="zeleza.com"/&gt; Vice President [[Joyce Banda]] was thus sworn in as President.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; [[Catherine Gotani Hara]] announced in a radio interview on Radio zodiak that there had been an attempt at circumventing the constitution since April 5, when the president had actually died. She noted that [[Peter Mutharika]], an internationally renowned constitutional lawyer, had not been following the proper constitutional process.&lt;ref name="zeleza.com"/&gt;

==International reaction==
The [[United States of America|US]], one of Malawi's donors, expressed alarm at the official silence and said it was confident that the constitution would be upheld and came out in support of Banda.&lt;ref name = "death" /&gt; The constitutional succession has a direct impact on donor funding in Malawi. Keith Somerville, a career journalist with the BBC and visiting lecturer at the University of Kent, described Malawi's international financial crisis: "Britain is Malawi's main bilateral donor and was expected to provide aid worth £90m in 2011, before the rupture in relations. The German government halved its budget support contribution in 2011 and the US government's Millennium Challenge Corporation is withholding a 350 million dollar grant to rehabilitate Malawi's failing energy network. Donor aid accounts for 40 per cent of Malawi's national budget. The US government has already put out a positive statement saying, 'By following constitutional procedures for this transition, the government and people of Malawi have reaffirmed their commitment to democratic principles ...We stand with the people of Malawi during their time of mourning, and look forward to deepening the partnership between our nations.'"&lt;ref name="UofKent"&gt;{{cite web | title = Keith Somerville, profile | work = Politic and International Relations | publisher = University of Kent | url = http://www.kent.ac.uk/politics/about-us/staff/members/somerville.html | accessdate = 2012-04-21 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131215190128/http://www.kent.ac.uk/politics/about-us/staff/members/somerville.html | archive-date = 2013-12-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In January 2013, a commission of inquiry published a 90-page report about the events surrounding Mutharika's death. On March 10, the police began arresting the Midnight Six and others involved in the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-03-11/malawi-arrests-six-former-officials-over-coup-conspiracy |accessdate=March 11, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included Midnight Six members Patricia Kaliati, Henry Mussa, and Kondwani Nankhumwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/malawi-ex-ministers-arrested-over-coup/story-e6frfkui-1226595071418#ixzz2NF3rMXxs | title=Malawi ex-ministers arrested over 'coup' | work=News.com.au | date=11 March 2013 | agency=AFP | accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included Peter Mutharika (President Mutharika's brother), Goodall Gondwe, the Minister of Economic Development, and the Chief Secretary, [[Bright Msaka]]. The arrests sparked protest from DPP supporters in Blantyre who smashed cars and destroyed property. The crowds were dispersed through tear gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/03/11/3279326/malawi-arrests-alleged-coup-plotters.html |accessdate=March 11, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 13, 12 top officials had been arrested in relation to the attempted coup, this included ex-ministers [[Henry Mussa]], [[Simon Vuwa Kaunda|Symon Vuwa Kaunda]], [[Jean Kalilani|Jean Kalirani]], [[Patricia Kaliati]], [[Kondwani Nankhumwa]], the Deputy Chief Secretary to the Government, [[Necton Mhura]] and [[Duncan Mwapasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.malawitoday.com/news/128468-dpp-supporters-cause-chaos-lilongwe | title=DPP supporters cause chaos in Lilongwe | work=Malawi Today | date=13 March 2013 | accessdate=1 July 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702084856/http://www.malawitoday.com/news/128468-dpp-supporters-cause-chaos-lilongwe# | archive-date=2015-07-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abram Petrovich{{Efn | The Russian middle name or [[patronym]] is based on the father's first name; in this case it is based on the godfather's, Peter the Great.}} Gannibal,''' also '''Hannibal''' or '''Ganibal,''' or '''Abram Hannibal''' or '''Abram Petrov''' ({{lang-ru |Абра́м Петро́вич Ганниба́л}}; 1696 – 14 May 1781&lt;ref name="Лихауг Lihaug 2006 31–38"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Лихауг [Lihaug] | first = Э.

Kidnapped as a child, Gannibal was taken to [[Russia]] and presented as a gift to [[Peter the Great]], where he was freed, adopted and raised in the Emperor's court household as his [[Godparent|godson]].&lt;ref name=godson&gt;Phillips, Mike. [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/blackeuro/pushkinback.html "Pushkin's African background – the Pushkins and the Gannibals."] [[British Library]]. Retrieved May 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannibal eventually rose to become a prominent member of the imperial court in the reign of Peter's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. He had 11 children, most of whom became members of the [[Russian nobility]]; he was a great-grandfather of the author and poet [[Alexander Pushkin]].&lt;ref name=slav/&gt;

==Early life==
The main reliable accounts of Gannibal's life come from ''[[The Moor of Peter the Great]],'' Pushkin's unfinished biography of his great-grandfather, published after Pushkin's death in 1837. Scholars argue that Pushkin's account may be inaccurate due to the author’s desire to elevate the status of his ancestors and family. There are a number of contradictions between the biographies of Pushkin and the German novel, ''The [[wikt:blackamoor|Blackamoor]] of Peter the Great'' based on his great-grandfather.&lt;ref name="Nepomnyashchy"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Catharine Theimer Nepomnyashchy |editor2=Nicole Svobodny |editor3=Ludmilla A.

[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/162650 "Dark star of the Enlightenment. How did an African slave surmount 18th-century attitudes to become a top military commander and intimate of Peter the Great? Maggie Gee charts an extraordinary life."], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 8 August 2005. Retrieved May 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research by the scholars [[Dieudonné Gnammankou]] and [[Hugh Barnes]] has established that the late general was instead likely born in [[Central Africa]], in an area bordering [[Lake Chad]] in present-day [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name="Nsl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nepomnyashchy" /&gt;

===Abduction===
[[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], the former professor at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at the [[Addis Ababa University|University of Addis Ababa]] in Ethiopia, believed the young Abram, Ibrahim or Abraham, as he named him, was born around 1698. He was the son of a minor "prince" or chief whose capital was [[Logone-Birni|Logon]] (now part of present-day [[Cameroon]]). His father was relatively affluent taking several wives and having 19 children. However, after his father died in battle trying to defend his territory from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], Abram was abducted and taken to [[Constantinople]] by ship. His sister, Lagan, is said to have drowned in the sea in a desperate attempt to save her brother.

Abram stayed in the [[Ottoman Empire]] for about a year in the service of Sultan [[Ahmed III]]'s household. At the time, the Russian ambassador [[Sava Vladislavich|Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky]], representing [[Peter the Great]], was looking for "a few clever little African slaves" for the Tsar's palace in [[Moscow]], as was the custom in those days at the great courts in Europe. On orders of Vladislavich's superiors (one of whom was [[Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy]], great-grandfather of the celebrated writer [[Leo Tolstoy]]), Abram was selected for this purpose and soon ransomed from the Sultan's viziers with a [[Bribery|bribe]]. In 1704, the ambassador immediately dispatched him by land to Moscow in order to be presented to Tsar Peter the Great.

The Tsar is noted to have taken a liking to the boy’s intelligence and potential for military service, and brought the child into his household.&lt;ref name="Nepomnyashchy"/&gt;
Abram was [[baptism|baptized]] in 1705, in [[Church of St. Paraskeva, Vilnius|St. Paraskeva Church]] in [[Vilnius]], with Peter as his godfather.&lt;ref name=godson/&gt; The date of Gannibal’s baptism held personal significance; he used that date as his birthday because he did not know his actual date of birth.&lt;ref name="Nepomnyashchy"/&gt;

Abram valued his relationship with his godfather, as well as that of Peter's daughter ([[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]), and was loyal to them as if they were family.&lt;ref name="Nepomnyashchy"/&gt;
Starting at a young age the boy Abram would travel alongside the emperor during his military campaigns, and at these military journeys he served as his godfather’s [[valet]].&lt;ref name=allison&gt;Blakely, Allison.

==Education==
[[File:Hannibal and Suvorov.png|thumb|1888 artist's conception of Gannibal speaking with [[Alexander Suvorov]].]]
In 1717, Abram was sent to [[Metz]] to receive an education in the arts, sciences and warfare from the highest institutes available. By then he was fluent in several languages and excelled in [[mathematics]] and [[geometry]]. In 1718 Abram joined the [[French Army]] with hopes of pleasing his godfather by expanding his learning in [[military engineering]].&lt;ref name=allison /&gt; He enrolled in the royal artillery academy at [[La Fère]] in 1720.

During Abram's studies, conflict broke out between [[France]] and [[Spain]], and he fought for France in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]], rising to the rank of captain. While fighting in the French war against Spain, Abram received a head injury and was captured by the Spanish army. He was released in 1722 and continued his studies in Metz.&lt;ref name=allison /&gt;

It was during his time in France that Abram adopted the surname "Gannibal" in honor of the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal]] (''Gannibal'' being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian).&lt;ref name= princes&gt;Schmemann, Serge.

Retrieved June 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Paris]] he met and befriended such [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] figures as the [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] and [[Voltaire]] (this claim by his biographer [[Hugh Barnes]] is disputed by reviewer Andrew Kahn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powells.com/review/2005_10_02.html Black Russian – A Review by Andrew Kahn of Hugh Barnes' ''Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211161751/http://www.powells.com/review/2005_10_02.html |date=December 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Voltaire called Gannibal the "dark star of the Enlightenment".&lt;ref name=hugh&gt;Barnes, Hugh.

Retrieved May 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannibal returned to Russia the following year and his advanced training enabled him to apply and successfully acquire posts first as an engineer and then as a mathematics tutor for one of the Tsar's private guard units.&lt;ref name= allison /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:A Hanibal signature.jpg|thumb|Letter signed by A. Ganibal (note only one 'n') on 22 March 1744. [[Tallinn]] City Archives.]]
Gannibal's education was completed by 1723 and he was due to return to Russia. After the death of Peter in 1725, [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]] gained power in Russia due to his good standing with Peter. However, Menshikov was not fond of Gannibal and was suspicious of his foreign origins and superior education.&lt;ref name=allison/&gt; Gannibal was exiled to [[Siberia]] in 1727, some 4,000 miles to the east of [[Saint Petersburg]]. He was pardoned in 1730 due to his technical skills, and completed his service in Siberia in 1733. During this time he built a fortress and led several construction projects, where he became a master engineer.

[[Elizabeth of Russia]] became the new monarch in 1741. Gannibal became a prominent member of her court, rose to the rank of major-general, and became superintendent of Reval (now [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]), a position he held from 1742 to 1752. A letter signed on 22 March 1744 by "A. Ganibal" is held at the Tallinn City Archives. In 1742, the Empress Elizabeth gave him the [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve|Mikhailovskoye estate]] in [[Pskov Oblast]] with hundreds of [[serfdom|serfs]].&lt;ref name=hugh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieudonne Gnammankou|Gnammankou, Dieudonné]].

Retrieved May 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired to this estate in 1762.

In an official document that Gannibal submitted in 1742 to Empress Elizabeth, while petitioning for the rank of [[nobility]] and a [[coat of arms]], he asked for the right to use a family crest emblazoned with an [[elephant]] and the mysterious word "FVMMO", which may mean "homeland" in the [[Biu–Mandara languages|Kotoko language]]. In his book, ''Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg'', Hugh Barnes writes of meeting with the sultan of Logone-Birni, who gave him the same translation of the word.&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; However, Frances Somers-Cocks, author of ''The Moor of St Petersburg: In the Footsteps of a Black Russian'', met the same sultan and received a different translation for FVMMO. She also suggested that FVMMO stands for the [[Latin]] expression ''Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Omnino'' which means "Fortune has changed my life entirely."&lt;ref name=slav/&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Gannibal I A.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Gannibal]], Abram's son]]
Gannibal married twice. His first wife was Evdokia Dioper, a [[Greeks|Greek]] woman. The couple married in 1731. Dioper despised her husband, whom she was [[forced marriage|forced to marry]]. The marriage between Dioper and Gannibal was very volatile and he suspected her of infidelity early in their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Parry (academic)|Parry, Albert]] (1923). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713691?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Abram Hannibal, the Favorite of Peter the Great."] [[Journal of Negro History]] '''8'''.4: 359–66. [[JSTOR]]. Retrieved May 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Gannibal’s suspicions were confirmed when Dioper gave birth to a white daughter.&lt;ref name= "Nepomnyashchy" /&gt; When Gannibal found out that she had been unfaithful to him, he had her arrested and thrown into prison, where she spent eleven years.

Gannibal began living with another woman, Christina Regina Siöberg (1705–1781), daughter of Mattias Johan Siöberg and wife Christina Elisabeth d'Albedyll, and married her [[bigamy|bigamously]] in Reval, in 1736, a year after the birth of their first child and while he was still lawfully married to his first wife. His divorce from Dioper did not become final until 1753, upon which a fine and a penance were imposed on Gannibal, and Dioper was sent to a [[convent]] for the rest of her life. Gannibal's second marriage was nevertheless deemed lawful after his divorce. Gannibal’s second marriage to Christina was much happier and he appreciated her fidelity and affection towards him.&lt;ref name= "Nepomnyashchy" /&gt;

On her paternal side, Gannibal’s second wife was descended from noble families in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Germany]]: Siöberg ([[Sweden]]), [[Galtung (noble family)|Galtung]] ([[Norway]]), and Grabow ([[Denmark]]) / von Grabow ([[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]).&lt;ref name="Лихауг Lihaug 2006 31–38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lihaug | first = Elin Galtung | trans-title = From Brandenburg to Scandinavia, the Baltics and Russia.

Abram Gannibal and Christine Regina Siöberg had ten children, including a son, Osip. Osip in turn would have a daughter, Nadezhda, the mother of [[Alexander Pushkin]].

Some British aristocrats descend from Gannibal, including [[Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster]] and her sister, [[Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn]].

==Legacy==
===Debate over Gannibal's place of birth===
Gannibal's actual place of birth continues to be uncertain, and is subject to speculation by modern historians. Until recent scholarly field work, it was generally assumed that he originated in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=slav&gt;Marsden, Phillip. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview4 "From Slave to Slav."] [[theguardian.com]], October 21, 2005. Retrieved June 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiefly Russian scholars for many years believed that he was from the vicinity of [[Medri Bahri]], an ancient kingdom in present-day [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;*Smith (1957, p. 245) postulates that "Logon" stood "on the northern side of the Mareb River in what is now called [[Eritrea]]".
*Troyat (1957, p. 244) asserts that the place of Hannibal's origin was "on the banks of the Mareb River in what is now Eritrea".
*N. Ismailov posits that the Logon was located in the "[[Hamasien]] Eritrean plateau" (see Pankhurst, 1961, p. 423).
*Yosief (2000, pp. 36–40) notes that at the time, the overall ruler of [[Medri Bahri]] Eritrea was Degezmati Habtesulus of [[Tseazega]], who was in control of the region from 1679 till 1719.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter he wrote to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, Gannibal stated that he was from the town of "Logon"&lt;ref name=princes/&gt; or "Lagone".&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; Anthropologist [[Dmitry Anuchin]] wrote an essay about Alexander Pushkin in which he theorized that "Lagone" referred to Logo-chewa in Eritrea.&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; In 1999, the Russian Institute in [[Addis Ababa]], the capital of Ethiopia, also campaigned for a [[commemorative stamp]] to honor Pushkin's [[Anniversary|bicentennial]].&lt;ref name=slav/&gt;

The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea each claim that Gannibal was born in their respective territories. Under this belief, the Ethiopian government named a street in Addis Ababa after Alexander Pushkin, Gannibal's great-grandson. It also placed a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of him near the [[African Union]] headquarters in 2002, and arranged for a statue of Pushkin to be transferred from [[Moscow]] to Addis Ababa in 2014.&lt;ref name=addis&gt;[http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/145795/addis-ababa-awaits-pushkin-statue-from-moscow "Addis Abab awaits Pushkin statue from Moscow."] ''www.worldbulletin.net'', October 8, 2014. Retrieved June 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the notion that Gannibal may have been born in Ethiopia holds little currency with the general Ethiopian population.&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; The Eritrean government asserts that Gannibal was instead born in Loggo Sarda,&lt;ref name="addis"/&gt; an area in modern Eritrea.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;[http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=9342704&amp;fid=1676&amp;c=eritrea "Loggo Sarda: Eritrea."] ''www.geographic.org.'' Retrieved June 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It also erected its own statue of Pushkin and named a street for him in 2009.&lt;ref name=addis/&gt;

[[Vladimir Nabokov]] cast doubt on Gannibal's ancestry, based on research findings during his work translating Pushkin's novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''. Nabokov disagreed with Anuchin's theory, stating that it was just as likely that Gannibal was referring to "the Lagona region of [[equatorial Africa]], south of [[Lake Chad]]."&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; Support for Anuchin's theory of Ethiopian birth declined after it was exposed as racially based, implying that "[[Hamites|hamitic]]" Ethiopian origins better explained Gannibal's success than "[[negroid]]" origins.&lt;ref name=slav/&gt;

The [[Benin]]ean historian [[Dieudonné Gnammankou]], an expert on Russia,&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; studied Russian, French and African sources and argued that Gannibal was indeed from [[Logone-Birni]] and was most likely the son of a chief in the ancient sultanate. In 1995, Gnammankou asserted that the "Logon" Gannibal wrote about was actually Logone, capital of the old [[Kotoko kingdom]] of Logone-Birni, now located in northern [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=princes/&gt; He believed that the pattern of slave trade around Lake Chad made that region a more plausible likelihood for Gannibal's birthplace than [[Gondar]], [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; Gnammankou's biography of Gannibal was translated into Russian, and was voted the best book on Pushkin at the 1999 Moscow Book Fair.&lt;ref name=princes/&gt;

Gnammankou's findings were in turn buttressed by the field work of Hugh Barnes. After consulting with the Sultan of Logone-Birni, Barnes found that an inscription on Gannibal's crest, which was hitherto undecipherable, corresponded with the term for "homeland" in the local [[Biu–Mandara languages|Kotoko language]] of central Africa.&lt;ref name=slav/&gt; Barnes's book has been criticised for its negative portrayal of Gannibal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/35773247/Review_of_Gannibal_The_Moor_of_Petersburg_by_Hugh_Barnes " Review of Hugh Barnes on Gannibal by O.A. Ladimeji"] retrieved January 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor at La Fère===
In November, 2010, representatives from [[Russia]] and [[Estonia]], the ambassador of [[Cameroon]], and the sultan of Logone-Birni went to [[La Fère]], France to unveil a [[commemorative plaque]] honoring Abram Petrovich Gannibal as a graduate of La Fère's royal artillery academy. The academy, which closed in the 1990s, had been started by [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] shortly before Gannibal's enrollment there in 1720. The plaque declares that he was a graduate of the royal artillery academy of La Fere, and later became chief military engineer and general-in-chief of the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. It also notes that Gannibal is the great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet. Dieudonné Gnammankou, whose research into Gannibal's background was largely responsible for the ceremony at La Fère taking place, also served as the main speaker at a [[symposium]] following the event.&lt;ref name=princes/&gt;

===Literature===
Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel ''The Moor of Peter the Great''. After leaving school in 1817, Pushkin met Abram's last surviving son, Peter. He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to "get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather."&lt;ref name=peter&gt;Phillips, Mike. [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/blackeuro/pushkinnegro.html "The Negro of Peter the Great."] [[British Library]]. Retrieved June 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Pushkin spoke often about his African heritage, and how he had suffered [[Racism|racist]] taunts about his own appearance. He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for ''The Moor of Peter the Great''.&lt;ref name=peter/&gt; A stage version of the work was written by Carlyle Brown and premiered at the [[Alabama Shakespeare Festival]]'s 13th Southern Writers' Project in March 2001.&lt;ref name=carlyle&gt;Litchfield, Robyn Bradley.

===Art and film===
Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] comedy movie ''[[How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor]]'', although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's ''Moor of Peter the Great''.&lt;ref name=tsar&gt;[http://www.rusfilm.pitt.edu/2006/taleofhow.htm "Tale of How Tsar Peter Married off His Negro."] ''www.rusfilm.pitt.edu'', 2006.

There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the [[Battle of Lesnaya]] by [[Pierre-Denis Martin (1663–1742)|Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger]]. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France.&lt;ref name="Nepomnyashchy"/&gt; A portrait by [[Adriaan Schoonebeeck]] is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal.&lt;ref name=allison/&gt; Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate.&lt;ref name=slavonica&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=John|title=Looking For Abram Hannibal|journal=Slavonica|year=2003|volume=9|issue=1|pages=19–33|doi=10.1179/sla.2003.9.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Lesnaya painting, the young boy is dressed in traditional slave attire, which Gannibal did not wear due to his status under Peter the Great.&lt;ref name=slavonica/&gt;

The '''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds''', or '''African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement''' ('''AEWA''') is an independent international treaty developed under the auspices of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s [[Convention on Migratory Species]]. It was founded to coordinate efforts to conserve bird species migrating between European and African nations, and its current scope stretches from the Arctic to South Africa, encompassing the Canadian archipelago and the Middle East as well as Europe and Africa.

The agreement focuses on bird species that depend on [[wetlands]] for at least part of their lifecycle and cross international borders in their migration patterns. It currently covers 254 species.&lt;ref&gt;http://aewa.eaudeweb.ro/en/species&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9832">'''Amina Lawal Kurami''' (born 1972) is a [[Nigeria]]n woman. On March 22, 2002, an [[Islamic]] [[Sharia in Nigeria|Sharia]] court (in [[Funtua|Funtua, Nigeria]] in the northern state of [[Katsina State|Katsina]]) sentenced her to death by [[Stoning#Stoning within present day Islam|stoning]] for [[Adultery#Islam|adultery]] and for conceiving a child out of [[Legitimacy (family law)|wedlock]]. The person she identified as the father of the child was not prosecuted for lack of evidence and deemed innocent by the court without any [[DNA paternity testing#DNA profiling|DNA tests]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/26/world/facing-death-for-adultery-nigerian-woman-is-acquitted.html?pagewanted=1 Facing Death for Adultery, Nigerian Woman Is Acquitted]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amina's conviction sparked an international controversy. It was overturned by a Sharia Court of Appeals which ruled that it violated Islamic law, and she later remarried.&lt;ref name=who-speaks&gt;{{Cite book|author=John L.

==Background==

{{Further|Zina}}

Amina was the second Nigerian woman condemned to death by stoning for engaging in sex before marriage. The first woman, [[Safiya Hussaini]], had her sentence overturned in March 2002 on her first appeal. Sharia law was established in northern Nigeria's mostly Muslim state Zamfara in 2000 and has since spread to at least twelve other states.&lt;ref name="msmagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.msmagazine.com/news/uswirestory.asp?id=8064 Amina Lawal Wins Appeal Against Stoning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/nigeria/ninews008.htm Nigeria: Amina Lawal’s Death Sentence Quashed but Questions Remain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/articles/amina_lawal.htm |title=Amina Lawal: Sex, Pregnancy and Muslim Law |access-date=2010-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503115854/http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/articles/amina_lawal.htm |archive-date=2010-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigerian woman fights stoning"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2116540.stm Nigerian woman fights stoning]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals and acquital==

On August 19, 2002, Amina's first appeal against the stoning sentence was rejected by an Islamic court in Katsina State of Nigeria. The appeals judge stated that the sentence would be carried out as soon as Kurami weaned her daughter from breast-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmagazine.com/news/uswirestory.asp?id=6837 FMF And NOW Protest Woman’s Death Sentence At Nigerian Embassy]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second appeal was put in motion and on September 25, 2003 Amina's sentence of death by stoning for adultery was overturned by a five-judge panel of Katsina State Sharia Court of Appeal. Four of the five judges ruled that the conviction violated Islamic law on a number of points, which included: the defendant's right to proper legal defense was not ensured; the circumstantial evidence of her pregnancy was not sufficient; the confession of the accused was not valid; and only one instead of the required three judges was present at the time of conviction.&lt;ref name=who-speaks/&gt;&lt;ref name=hauwa/&gt;&lt;ref name="msmagazine.com"/&gt;

Baobab for Women's Human Rights, an [[NGO]] based in Nigeria, took up her case, which was argued by Nigerian lawyers trained in both secular and Sharia law. Amina's lawyers included [[Hauwa Ibrahim]], a prominent human rights lawyer known for her [[pro bono]] work for people condemned under Sharia law. In their successful defense of Amina Lawal, lawyers used the notion of "extended pregnancy" (dormant [[foetus]]), arguing that under Sharia law, a five-year interval is possible between human conception and birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/isl_adul1.htm religioustolerance.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (Two years prior to the date of her daughter's birth, she was still married to her husband.)&lt;ref name="Nigerian woman fights stoning"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hauwa/&gt;

== Reactions==

The affair exposed civil and religious tensions between the [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] regions of Nigeria. The sentence also caused widespread outrage in the West, and a number of campaigns were launched to persuade the [[Nigerian government]] to overturn the sentence. Several contestants of the [[Miss World]] beauty contest, to be held in Nigeria in 2002, pulled out of the contest to protest against Amina Lawal's treatment. ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' had a special report on Amina Lawal and encouraged viewers to send protest e-mails to the Nigerian Ambassador to the United States - over 1.2 million e-mails ensued.

A 2002 Petition called "save Amina" gathered a few thousand signatures then a 2003 e-communication with the subject line "“Please Stop the International Amina Lawal Protest Letter Campaigns" signed by Ayesha Iman and Sindi Medar-Gould who represented two Nigerian Human Rights organizations said the "save Amina" petition had some inaccuracies including a false assertion that execution of the sentence was imminent. They further contested that "There is an unbecoming arrogance in assuming that international human rights organizations or others always know better than those directly involved, and therefore can take actions that fly in the face of their express wishes".&lt;ref name=rwj&gt;{{cite book|first1=ed. by Andreas|last1=Follesdal|last2=Jaggar|first2=Alison|last3=Pogge|first3=Thomas|title=Real world justice : grounds, principles, human rights, and social institutions|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1402031410|pages=36–37|url=http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|access-date=2015-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912020643/http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|archive-date=2015-09-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jaggar&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaggar|first1=Alison M.|title="Saving Amina": Global Justice for Women and Intercultural Dialogue|journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date=28 September 2012|volume=19|issue=03|pages=55–75|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00554.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2003, the official response of the Embassy of Nigeria in the Netherlands to the then Sharia-based trial of the State of Katsina in Nigeria, was that no court had given a stoning order on Lawal. They claimed the reports were "unfounded and malicious" and were "calculated to ridicule the Nigerian judicial system and the country’s image before the international community." They claimed no knowledge of such a case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigerianembassy.nl/Amina.htm nigerianembassy.nl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031218200956/http://www.nigerianembassy.nl/Amina.htm |date=December 18, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambassador A.A. Agada of the Embassy of Nigeria in Washington D.C., U.S., was more forthcoming in recognizing the case of Amina and stated on 29 August 2003: "the Embassy wishes to inform that Malama Amina Lawal has three levels of courts of appeal before the final determination of her case. The Embassy hereby assures the general public that Malama Lawal's right to a fair hearing under the Nigerian Constitution is guaranteed. Therefore due appellate processes will be followed to ensure the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The case of Amina Lawal|url=http://nigeriaembassyusa.org/082703.shtml|accessdate=9 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125131900/http://nigeriaembassyusa.org/082703.shtml|archivedate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
As noted in the Author Q&amp;A at the end of [[Will Ferguson]]'s novel ''419'', the fictional character Amina—a young pregnant woman fleeing the Sharia states of northern Nigeria on foot—was based on the real life case of Amina Lawal.

[[Image:APHIS.svg|right|thumb|APHIS emblem - no longer used April 2013, USDA Policy Directive]]
The '''Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service''' ('''APHIS''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) based in [[Riverdale Park, Maryland|Riverdale, Maryland]] responsible for protecting animal health, animal welfare, and plant health.  APHIS is the lead agency for collaboration with other agencies to protect U.S. agriculture from invasive pests and diseases.  APHIS is the National Plant Protection Authority for the U.S. government, and the agency's head of veterinary services is Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States{{Citation needed|reason=http://www.usphs.gov/profession/veterinarian/cpo.aspx Chief Veterinary Officer, http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wps/portal/banner/aboutaphis?urile=wcm%3Apath%3A%2FAPHIS_Content_Library%2FSA_About_APHIS%2FSA_APHIS_Leadership Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services’|date=May 2015}}.

==History==
APHIS was created in 1972 by Secretary’s Memorandum No. 1769.

The origins of the agency predate creation of USDA, to 1854 when the Office of Entomologist, Agricultural Section, U.S. Patent Office was created.  It was the first of three agencies that eventually were merged to form APHIS.&lt;ref name="nara"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/463.html#463.1|title=National Archives, Records of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881, a Cattle Commission was created in the Department of the Treasury that three years later was transferred to USDA.&lt;ref name="nara"/&gt;  Plant quarantine functions followed in 1912 when USDA's Federal Horticultural Board was created.  Between the 1880s and 1930s these evolved into the USDA Bureaus of Entomology, of Animal Industry, and of Plant Quarantine, respectively.&lt;ref name="nara"/&gt;

In 1953 the three bureaus were combined into the Agricultural Research Service.  In 1971, the animal and plant regulatory functions were separated from ARS to create a new entity known as Animal and Plant Health Services.  In 1972, the meat and poultry inspection divisions of the Consumer and Marketing Service (later known as the [[Agricultural Marketing Service]]) were added to APHS, thus creating the contemporary APHIS.&lt;ref name="aphis1"&gt;{{cite web|title=APHIS website|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, many APHIS agricultural border inspectors were transferred to [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], a unit of the newly created [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]].

APHIS is the primary agency responsible for responding to animal and plant disease(s) and pest emergencies as well as to other emergencies as set forth by the National Response Plan (NRP) completed in 2005 (APHIS Strategic Plan 2003-2008).

The originally-stated purpose of APHIS is to “protect the animal and plant resources of the nation” and  carry out “a poultry and meat inspection program.”&lt;ref name="secmemo"&gt;Secretary’s Memorandum 1762&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern articulation of APHIS’s mission is “protecting and promoting U.S. agricultural health, regulating genetically engineered organisms, administering the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] and carrying out wildlife damage management activities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/about_aphis/|title=APHIS website: About APHIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APHIS aims to protect American animals, plants, and the agricultural industry by offering:
* Protection from invasive non-native plants, animals, insects, and diseases
* Monitoring and management of existing agricultural pests and diseases
* Resolution and management of trade issues related to animal or plant health
* Prevention or cessation of the inhumane treatment (of animals)

The threats and challenges within APHIS' scope include:
* Non-compliant biotech events
* [[Invasive species]]
* Agricultural animal/plant health threats
* [[Agro-terrorism|Agricultural bioterrorism]]
* [[Sanitary and phytosanitary measures and agreements|Sanitary and phytosanitary trade barriers]]
* [[Human-wildlife conflict|Wildlife conflicts]] and [[Wildlife disease|diseases]]
* [[Zoonotic]] diseases
* [[Animal welfare]] issues

===Statutory authorities===
APHIS is granted specific authority under several federal statutes:

'''Animal Health Protection Act''', {{usc|7|8301}} ''et seq.''
Governs the prevention, detection, control, and eradication of diseases and pests of animals, where "animal" is defined as "any member of the animal kingdom (except a human)."  {{usc|7|8302}} (1) (West 2009).

'''Animal Welfare Act (Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966)''', {{usc|7|2131}} ''et seq.''
Originally intended to prevent the theft of pets for sale to research facilities, the AWA now broadly regulates minimum standards of care and treatment of animals in research, exhibition, transport, and by dealers.  It exempts birds, rats, or mice bred for use in research, horses not used for research, cold blooded animals, and all farm animals used in the production of “food and fiber.”  It provides for licensing and registration of all animal dealers and exhibitors.

'''[[Horse Protection Act of 1970|Horse Protection Act]]''', {{usc|15|1821|1831}}
Prohibits horses subjected to a process called “soring” (injecting or applying chemicals to a horse’s forelegs to accentuate its gait) from participating in and being transported to exhibitions, sales, shows, or auctions.

'''Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931''', {{usc|7|426|426c}} 
Provides broad authority for investigation, demonstrations and control of “injurious animal species” (mammalian predators, rodents and birds.) Amended in 1991 to prevent the inadvertent introduction of brown tree snakes into other areas of the United States from Guam.

'''Lacey Act''', {{usc|16|3371|3378}}
Makes it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase any fish or wildlife or plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law, treaty, or regulation of the United States or in violation of any Indian tribal law whether in interstate or foreign commerce.

'''Plant Protection Act''', {{usc|7|7701}} ''et seq.''
Consolidates all or part of ten existing USDA plant health laws into one comprehensive law. Gives USDA the authority to regulate and to prohibit or restrict the importation, exportation, and the interstate movement of plants, plant products, certain biological control organisms, noxious weeds, and plant pests.

'''Federal Seed Act, Title III''', {{usc|7|1551|1611}}
Requires accurate labeling and purity standards for seeds in commerce, and prohibits the importation and movement of adulterated or misbranded seeds.

'''Honeybee Act''', {{usc|7|281|286}}
Prohibits or restricts the importation or entry of honeybees and honeybee semen into or through the United States in order to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees, as well as genetically undesirable germ plasm and undesirable bee species.

'''Animal quarantine laws:'''
{{usc|21|101}} allows the President, by proclamation, to suspend the importation of all or any class of animals for a limited time, whenever, in his opinion, it is necessary for the protection of animals in the United States against infectious or contagious diseases.

{{usc|21|113a}} authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish research facilities for hoof and mouth disease and other animal diseases which “in the opinion of the Secretary” constitute a threat to U.S. livestock.  Mandates strict controls for the use of any live virus at such research facilities.  Permits the Secretary to hire up to five technical experts or scientists at a maximum paygrade of GS-18.  (This appears to be one of the most prescriptive statutes that USDA administers.)

{{usc|21|114i}} authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and carry out a program for the eradication of pseudorabies in United States swine populations.

'''Virus-Serum-Toxin Act''', {{usc|21|151|158}}

==Organization==
APHIS is divided into six operational programs units:
* Animal Care (AC): Determines and promotes standards of humane care and treatment of animals through inspections and educational efforts.
* Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS): Protects agricultural and natural resources by ensuring safe development of genetically engineered organisms using a science-based regulatory framework. 
* International Services and Trade Support Team (IS): Provides international animal and plant health expertise to safeguard American agricultural health and promote U.S. agricultural trade.
* [[Plant Protection and Quarantine]] (PPQ): Safeguards agriculture and natural resources from risks associated with the entry, establishment, or spread of pests and noxious weeds. 
* Veterinary Services (VS): Protects and improves the health, quality, and marketability of our nation's animals, animal products, and [[veterinary biologic]]s by preventing, controlling, and/or eliminating animal diseases, and monitoring, and promoting animal health and productivity.
* [[Wildlife Services]] (WS): Provides leadership to resolve wildlife conflicts and create a balance allowing people and wildlife to peacefully coexist.

APHIS is also divided into three management support units (Legislative and Public Affairs, Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services, and Policy and Program Development), and two offices that support government-wide initiatives: the Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and Office of Civil Rights Enforcement and Compliance.&lt;ref name="aphis1"/&gt;

The current APHIS Administrator, Mr. Kevin Shea, was appointed in June 2013.&lt;ref name="shea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/about_aphis/leadership_bios/shea_bio.shtml|title=APHIS website, Shea biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His immediate predecessor, Dr. Greg Parham, was appointed in April 2011.

The Deputy Administrator for Veterinary Services also functions as Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States, and represents the U.S. Government at the [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE).  APHIS Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) is the [[National Plant Protection Authority]]; the Deputy Administrator for PPQ represents the United States in the [[North American Plant Protection Organization]] and other international fora related to plant health and quarantine.

In addition to its domestic operations, APHIS International Services staff several overseas offices, including [[Agricultural attaché#United States|veterinary and plant health attachés]] in U.S. diplomatic missions as well as technicians carrying out disease and pest eradication and control programs.

==Budget==
APHIS has a budget of approximately $800 million annually and employs about 7,000 people, about 5,000 of which are deployed as inspectors at ports, borders and on farms.

==Criticism==
In 2014, The USDA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) criticized the Service for a number of issues including its failure to efficiently allocate resources and its failure to administer appropriate fines for animal welfare violations among other issues. The report found the Service conducted inspections at facilities that did not have any animals regulated under the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] (AWA). According to the report, “[Animal Care] did not make the best use of its limited resources, which could have been assigned to inspect other more problematic facilities, including breeders, dealers, and exhibitors.” The Service was also criticized for prematurely closing cases that involved “grave (e.g., animal deaths) or repeat welfare violations.” When the service did levy fines against institutions for AWA violations, the Inspector General’s report found “penalties that were reduced by an average of 86 percent from… authorized maximum penalty per violation. Consequently, 26 of the 30 violators in our sample received” and that the Service “grant[ed] good faith reductions without merit or us[ed] a smaller number of violations than the actual number.” According to the USDA’s report, APHIS agreed with the findings and will begin implanting reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harden|first1=Gil H|title=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services Oversight of Research Facilities|journal=USDA Office of Inspector General|date=9 December 2014|url=http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/33601-0001-41.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[USDA]] OIG published a report which identified numerous failures on the part of APHIS’ Animal Care (AC) unit to adequately enforce the AWA, including:
*failure of AC’s Eastern Region to aggressively pursue “enforcement actions against violators of the AWA”; 
*failure to fine violators sufficiently, creating a climate in which “violators consider the monetary stipulation as a normal cost of conducting business rather than a deterrent for violating the law”; 
*failure on the part of the USDA’s Veterinary Medical Officers (VMOs) to ensure that facilities provided them with basic data on the research facilities such as “the number of animals used in research” and the number of “unexpected animal deaths”;
*failure on the part of [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees]] (IACUC) to effectively monitor animal care activities, in particular, veterinary care and review of painful procedures; and
*failure on the part of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) to ensure the use of non-animal methodologies where such research avenues exist.

The OIG audit further reported that at almost one-third of facilities, IACUCs failed to ensure that principal investigators (PIs) considered alternatives to painful procedures; the report cites this failure on the part of IACUCs as being the most frequent AWA violation at animal research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Robert W|title=Audit Report: APHIS Animal Care Program Inspection and Enforcement Activities|journal=USDA Office of Inspector General|date=30 September 2005|url=http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/33002-03-SF.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2017, the USDA Animal Care Search Tool, a searchable database containing documents with details about the animals held by individual US animal research facility together with inspection and action reports, was removed from public access, with a stated reason of protecting personal information. The removal affects inspection reports, research facility annual reports, regulatory correspondence (such as official warnings), and certain enforcement records. Information from these documents can now only be requested via a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare|title=Animal Welfare: USDA Animal Care Search Tool &lt;sidebar link&gt;|website=United States Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This removal has been criticized as substantially limiting information on animal care in US institutions, and of inhibiting access to what is still available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/feds-go-dark-on-animal-research|title=It Just Got Much Harder To Know What’s Going On In US Animal Research Labs|newspaper=BuzzFeed News|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Berman hearing''' is a provision under [[California]] law for the administrative resolution of [[wage]] claims under the California Labor Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of the California Labor Code, §98.  The hearing is named after [[Howard Berman]], the member of the California State Assembly who instituted it.&lt;ref&gt;''Post v. Palo/Haklar &amp; Associates'' 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 674 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Banks''' (born July 24, 1985)&lt;ref name="calindex"/&gt; is a former [[American football]] [[linebacker]]. He signed with the [[Atlanta Falcons]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) on April 3, 2013.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000236456/article/brian-banks-reportedly-released-by-atlanta-falcons |title=Brian Banks released by Atlanta Falcons |publisher=NFL.com |date=2013-08-30 |access-date=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks previously signed as an undrafted free agent with the [[Las Vegas Locomotives]] of the [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="espn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs1"/&gt;

Banks was a standout high school football star at [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School|Polytechnic High School]] (Poly) in [[Long Beach, California]]. In 2002, his Junior year, Banks verbally committed to [[USC Trojans football|USC]].&lt;ref name="ap1"/&gt; After being falsely accused of [[rape]] by classmate Wanetta Gibson, he spent more than five years in prison and five years on strict custody parole, but had his conviction overturned in 2012 after his accuser admitted she had fabricated the entire story. Following his exoneration, Banks sought to resume his football career, playing for the now defunct United Football League (UFL), attending mini-camps for several NFL teams, and later signing with the Atlanta Falcons.

==High school career==
A native of [[Long Beach, California]], Banks attended [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]], where he was teammates with [[DeSean Jackson]], [[Darnell Bing]], [[Winston Justice]], and [[Marcedes Lewis]]. He was named one of [[Rivals.com]]'s "Juniors to Watch" of the class of 2003,&lt;ref name="rivals1"/&gt; before being expelled from school due to a rape accusation, later shown to be false.

==Professional career==
In the summer of 2012, Banks received tryouts with several NFL teams, including the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[San Diego Chargers]], and [[San Francisco 49ers]]. He attended minicamp with the [[Seattle Seahawks]], whose head coach, [[Pete Carroll]], was the one who had offered Banks a scholarship in 2002 when he was the head coach at USC.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc1"/&gt;

===Las Vegas Locomotives===
Banks signed with the [[Las Vegas Locomotives]] of the [[United Football League (2009)|UFL]] on September 20, 2012, appearing in two games and making one tackle before the UFL suspended its season in October.&lt;ref name="seahawks1"/&gt;

===Atlanta Falcons===
Banks signed with the [[Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]] on April 3, 2013, participating in Falcons offseason workouts, OTA's, and training camp. &lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; &lt;ref name="b"/&gt; Banks made his NFL debut in a preseason game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], where he picked up two tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exonerated Football Player Brian Banks Back on the Gridiron After Five Years in Prison|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/brian-banks-back-field-best-moments-life/storynew?id=19931048|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fan1"/&gt; He played four preseason games with the Falcons before being released on August 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patra|first=Kevin|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000236456/article/brian-banks-released-by-atlanta-falcons|title=Brian Banks released by Atlanta Falcons|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Football League (NFL)===
[[File:Brian Banks 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brian Banks after his exoneration]]
In 2014, Banks was asked by [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Roger Goodell]] to speak at the 2014 NFL draft Rookie Symposium. Banks accepted and his speech was well received. A few weeks later, he was hired to join the NFL Department of Operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exonerated of rape, Brian Banks now realizing NFL dream – in different capacity|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/exonerated-of-rape--brian-banks-realizing-nfl-dream-%E2%80%93-in-different-capacity-005927279-nfl.html|website=[[Yahoo!

==False accusation of sexual assault==
In the summer of 2002, Banks was arrested and charged after classmate Wanetta Gibson [[false accusation of rape|falsely accused him]] of dragging her into a stairway at Polytechnic High School (Poly) and raping her. Faced with a possible 41 years to life sentence, he accepted a [[plea bargain|plea deal]] that included five years in prison, five years of probation, and [[Sex offender registries in the United States|registering as a sex offender]]. Wanetta Gibson and her mother Wanda Rhodes sued the [[Long Beach Unified School District]], claiming the Poly campus was not a safe environment, and won a $1.5 million settlement.&lt;ref name="usa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;   Banks says that the lawyer said that by pleading guilty he would receive probation, but no jail time.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/wrongfully-imprisoned-banks-career-nfl-article-1.2090727|title=Brian Banks spent five years in prison after being falsely accused of rape, but now he finally has a career in NFL|last=Myers|first=Gary|publisher=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession of false accusation===
In March 2011, Gibson contacted Banks on [[Facebook]], met with him, and admitted in the presence of an attorney that she had fabricated the story. Banks secretly recorded Gibson's confession, but she later refused to tell prosecutors that she had lied so she wouldn't have to return the money she and her family had won in court.&lt;ref name="c" /&gt; 

===California Innocence Project===
Prior to the taped confession, Banks had asked for help from the [[California Innocence Project]] (CIP), a nonprofit law school clinic run by the San Diego-based law school [[California_Western_School_of_Law|California Western School of Law]] that investigates and litigates cases of [[Actual innocence|factual innocence]], but at that time there had not been sufficient evidence of Banks' innocence for them to take on the case. However, after the confession, CIP decided to make this the organization's first case involving a wrongfully convicted person who had already been released from prison.&lt;ref name="c" /&gt;  

The video evidence was not admissible in court, because the video had been made without Gibson's knowledge or consent and was not accompanied by a signed confession from the young woman. However, CIP was instrumental in putting together additional evidence supporting Banks’ story, which led the district attorney to dismiss all charges against him on May 24, 2012. He was also released from sex-offender status, allowing him to resume his aborted sports career.&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Banks|url=https://californiainnocenceproject.org/read-their-stories/brian-banks/|website=California Innocence Project|publisher=California Innocence Project|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koehler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koehler|first1=Francie|title=Exonerating the Innocent|url=https://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/74656/exonerating-the-innocent|website=PI’s Declassified|publisher=VoiceAmerica|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks supports CIP in its efforts on behalf of the wrongly-convicted, including participating in CIP's 2013 Innocence March.&lt;ref name="march"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cocca|first1=Christina|title=Brian Banks and His Mother Join "Innocence March" to Protest Wrongful Convictions|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Brian-Banks-and-mother-join-california-innocence-project-march-207055401.html|website=NBC-4 Los Angeles|publisher=NBC|date=11 May 2013|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often wears a shirt with the lettering "XONR8" ("exonerate").&lt;ref name="Daily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="march"/&gt; 

===School lawsuit===
On April 12, 2013, the Long Beach Unified School District announced it was suing Wanetta Gibson for $2 million in an effort to recoup the $1.5 million she received, along with attorney's fees and [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="nbc2"/&gt; On June 14, 2013, the school district won a $2.6 million judgment against Gibson, which includes the $750,000 settlement initially paid to her along with attorney's fees, interest, and $1 million in punitive damages.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.dailynews.com/2013/06/14/long-beach-unified-wins-judgment-against-accuser-in-false-rape-case-against-brian-banks/ |last=Mellen |first=Greg |title=Long Beach Unified wins judgment against accuser in false rape case against Brian Banks |publisher=Los Angeles Daily News |date=2018-06-14 |accessdate=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson has gone into hiding and failed to appear at all court dates.  She was due a second $750,000 payment under terms of the original 2007 deal, which was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/26/local/la-me-rape-dismissal-20120526 |title=Prosecution of false accuser in rape case seen as difficult |publisher=LA Times |date=2012-05-26 |accessdate=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film project==
A feature film project based on Banks' story, co-executive produced by Banks himself and [[Justin Brooks]] of CIP, is currently filming.&lt;ref name="Tiffany"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Ashley|title=Tiffany Dupont Joins Greg Kinnear in Brian Banks Drama|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiffany-dupont-joins-greg-kinnear-brian-banks-drama-exonerate-1043984|accessdate=6 January 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="memphis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Detling|first1=Dave|title=Brian Banks Movie Production Filming In Memphis, Seeks Football "Fans"|date=9 October 2017|url=http://www.localmemphis.com/news/local-news/brian-banks-movie-production-filming-in-memphis-seeks-football-fans/831562098|website=localmemphis.com (Channel 24)|publisher=Nexstar Media Group|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by Tom Shadyac, the creator of such films as ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' and ''[[Evan Almighty]]'', and features [[Aldis Hodge]] as Brian Banks, [[Greg Kinnear]] as Brooks and [[Tiffany Dupont]] as CIP attorney [[Alissa Bjerkhoel]].&lt;ref name="Tiffany"/&gt; The movie is to be released sometime in 2018.&lt;ref name="memphis"/&gt;

In January 2018 Banks joined the Oxygen channel's series "Final Appeal", cohosting with Loni Coombs.  The duo re-examine crimes in which the guilty verdict is in question; and attempt to discover and reevaluate evidence to help the convicted either achieve an appeal, or definitively determine guilt.  The show intends to help those wrongly convicted, as Banks was.

'''''Carlisle v. United States''''', 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 147 (1872), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that "[a]n [[Alien (law)|alien]], whilst domiciled in the country, owes a local and temporary allegiance, which continues during the period of his residence."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Carlisle v. United States|link=|volume=83|page=147|pin=154|year=1872|reporter=Wall.|reporter-volume=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The case has been cited in articles discussing the "culture defense" in [[criminal law]].&lt;ref&gt;See Nicole A. King, "The Role of Culture in Psychology: A Look at Mental Illness and the 'Cultural Defense'", 7 Tulsa J Comp &amp; Int'l L 199, 218 [1999].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Statement of the Case==
Prior to the [[American Civil War|United States Civil War]], the claimants were subjects of the Queen of [[Great Britain]], but had been residents within the United States prior and during the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Carlisle v. United States'', 83 U.S. at 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 1861, the claimants began to manufacture [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], an ingredient of gunpowder, in Santa Cave, a cave 7 miles (11.25km) southwest of [[Scottsboro, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleming|first= Walter Lynwood|date=1905|title= Civil war and reconstruction in Alabama|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gD0HAwAAQBAJ|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=153|isbn=9785518487277}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, the saltpeter was sold to the [[Confederate States of America]] military.
In 1864, the [[Union Army]] in a campaign through Alabama, seized sixty-five bales of [[cotton]], valued at $43,232, stored on the claimant’s [[plantation]].  On December 25, 1868, after the surrender of confederate government, President [[Andrew Johnson]] issued Proclamation 179 which unconditionally and without reservation [[pardon|pardoned]] and provided [[amnesty]] to all who had supported the Confederate government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=72360 |title= Proclamation 179—Granting Full Pardon and Amnesty for the Offense of Treason Against the United States During the Late Civil War|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= December 25, 1868 |website=The American Presidency Project|publisher= University of California, Santa Barbara|access-date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the pardon, the claimants attempted to recover from the US government the proceeds of the sixty-five bales of cotton.&lt;ref&gt;''Carlisle v. United States'', 83 U.S. at 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court Opinion==
When the claimants presented their claim after the pardons, the [[United States Court of Claims]] denied the request proclaiming that the United States government had the right to confiscate the bales of cotton because the claimants gave aid and comfort to the rebellion, and for that reason were not entitled to recover the proceeds of the cotton seized.  However, in a unanomous decision, the Supreme Court reversed and held:
* that British subjects, if otherwise entitled, may prosecute claims against the United States in the Court of Claims.
* that the claimants were allowed to make a claim and recover the proceeds because the pardon guaranteed that no offense connected with the rebellion could be imputed to the claimants.
* that "[a]n alien, whilst domiciled in the country, owes a local and temporary allegiance, which continues during the period of his residence."&lt;ref&gt;''Carlisle v. United States'', 83 U.S. at 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Down payment''' (or '''downpayment''', also called a '''deposit''' in British English), is a payment used in the context of the purchase of expensive items such as a [[car]] and a [[house]], whereby the payment is the initial upfront portion of the total amount due and it is usually given in cash at the time of finalizing the transaction. A [[loan]] or the amount in [[cash]] is then required to make the full payment.

The main purposes of a down payment are to ensure that the lending institution has enough capital to create money for a loan in [[fractional reserve banking]] systems and to recover some of the balance due on the loan in the event that the borrower [[default (finance)|defaults]]. In [[real estate]], the asset is used as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] in order to secure the loan against default. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender is legally entitled to sell the asset and retain a portion of the proceeds sufficient to cover the remaining balance on the loan, including fees and interest added. A down payment in this case reduces the lender's risk to less than the value of the collateral, making it more likely that the lender will recover the full amount in the event of default.

The size of the down payment thus determines the extent to which the lender is protected against the various factors that might reduce the value of the collateral, as well as lost profits between the time of the last payment and the eventual sale of the collateral.

Furthermore, making a down payment demonstrates that the borrower is able to raise a certain amount of money for long-term investment, which the lender may desire as evidence that the borrower's finances are sound, and that the borrower is not borrowing beyond his or her means.

If the borrower is unable to pay off the loan in its entirety, the down payment amount is forfeited.

==Amounts==
In the [[United States]], down payments for home purchases typically vary between 3.5% and 20% of the purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hud.gov/buying/loans.cfm "HUD"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Housing Administration has advocated lower down payments since its inception in 1934, and, currently, borrowers that qualify for an FHA loan pay only 3.5% for a down payment. With rising home prices in the years from 2000 to 2007, lenders were willing to accept smaller or no down payment (either through 100% financing, seller-assisted down payment assistance, government down payment providers or by providing a combination of an 80% first and 20% second [[mortgage loan|mortgages]]) so that more individuals could purchase homes as their primary residences. Currently, in the United States, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers complete financing for qualifying veterans. The USDA Home Loan program also offers complete mortgage loans with no down payment. These loans are available as direct or guaranteed loans and are offered to qualifying borrowers purchasing a home in a more rural area. Most state finance housing agencies offer down payment assistance. In 2013, the agencies offer a program that provides assistance to qualifying homebuyers of up to three percent of the loan amount. The money from the state housing agencies can be used for down payment or closing costs.

There is more risk for lenders when individuals purchase a home as an investment property. Therefore, the lender may charge a higher interest rate and expect a higher down payment.

{{For|Frederick Lugard's book on [[indirect rule]]|Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard#The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa}}
A '''dual mandate''' is the practice in which elected officials serve in more than one elected or other public position simultaneously. This practice is sometimes known as '''double jobbing''' in Britain and ''cumul des mandats'' in France; not to be confused with '''double dipping''' in the United States, i.e. being employed by and receiving a retirement pension from the same public authority at the same time.  Thus, if someone who is already [[mayor]] of a town or city councillor becomes elected as [[Member of parliament|MP]] or [[senator]] at the national or state legislature and retains both positions, this is a dual mandate.

Dual mandates are sometimes prohibited by law. For example, in [[federal state]]s, federal office holders are often not permitted to hold state office. In states with a [[presidential system]] of government, membership of the [[executive (government)|executive]], the [[legislature]], or the [[judiciary]] generally disqualifies a person from simultaneously holding office in either of the other two bodies. In states with [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures, one usually cannot simultaneously be a member of both houses. The holder of one office who wins election or appointment to another where a dual mandate is prohibited must either resign the former office or refuse the new one.

==European Parliament==
A member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) may not be a member of the legislature of a [[Member State of the European Union|member state]].&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Council Decision of 25 June 2002 and 23 September 2002 amending the Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, annexed to Decision 76/787/ECSC, EEC, Euratom|work=Official Journal of the European Communities |volume=L 283 |date=2002-10-21 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002D0772:EN:NOT |pages=1–4 |id=2002/772/EC,Euratom}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dates from a 2002 [[European Union decision]], which came into effect at the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European elections]] in most member states,&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt; at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 national election]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]],&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt; and at the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European elections]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt;

Originally, MEPs were nominated by national parliamentarians from among their own membership.&lt;ref name="manning74"&gt;{{cite news |title= The problems of dual parliamentary loyalty|first=Maurice|last=Manning|work=The Irish Times |date=February 27, 1975|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to [[European Parliament election, 1979|the first direct elections in 1979]], the dual mandate was discussed.&lt;ref name="manning74"/&gt; Some advocated banning it, arguing that MEPs who were national MPs were often absent from one assembly in order to attend the other&lt;ref name="manning74"/&gt; (indeed, the early death of [[Peter Michael Kirk]] was blamed by his [[election agent]] on overwork resulting from his dual mandate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Dual Mandate |work=The Irish Times |date=April 21, 1977|page=9|quote=Sir Peter's own election agent has stated categorically that he died from pressure and overwork caused by his dual mandate as an MP at Westminster and a member in Strasbourg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Others claimed that members with a dual mandate enhanced communication between national and European assemblies.&lt;ref name="manning74"/&gt; There was a particular interest in the dual mandate question in Denmark: [[Eurosceptic]] [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democrats]] supported a compulsory dual mandate, to ensure that the state's MEPs expressed the same views as the national legislature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/european_parliament/ep.htm|title=An analysis of the European Parliament’s electoral arrangement(s). A uniform procedure for the elections to the European Parliament? |last=Ziccardi |first=Christiaan |publisher=ethesis|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the government of Denmark supported a compulsory dual mandate when the other eight member states supported an optional dual mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Direct Elections to the European Assembly (European Assembly Elections)|date=1975–76|series=20th Century |journal=House of Commons Sessional Papers|issue=Cmnd. 6399|volume=XII.647|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a 1976 European Parliament law preparing for the 1979 elections expressly permitted a dual mandate.&lt;ref name="eu41976X1008_01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Act concerning the election of the representatives of the Assembly by direct universal suffrage|work=Official Journal of the European Communities |volume=L 278 |date=October 8, 1976 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:41976X1008(01):EN:NOT |pages=5–11 |id=76/787/ECSC, EEC, Euratom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the German politician [[Willy Brandt]] suggested that one third of MEPs should be national MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Problem of Euro elections|first=Walter |last=Ellis|work=The Irish Times |date=February 5, 1977|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Dual mandates are rare in [[Australia]]. It is illegal to be a member of any [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state parliament]] and the [[Australian parliament]] simultaneously. A member of a state parliament seeking federal office must resign before seeking election to the [[Government of Australia|Federal]] [[Parliament]]. It is possible but unusual to be a member of a [[local government]] and another [[parliament]].

In 2004 [[Clover Moore]] became the [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[member for Sydney]] in the [[NSW Parliament]] without resigning as [[Lord Mayor of Sydney]]. The issue of Moore holding both positions had brought the issue to the forefront in Australia and led the premier of [[New South Wales]] in 2012 to propose a new law, dubbed in the media as the "Get Clover bill", which banned this dual mandate. The proposed law was adopted and in September 2012 Moore resigned her NSW seat soon after she was reelected as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/northern-territory/8916-clover-sadly-farewells-nsw-parliament.html |title=The latest entertainment news for Australia’s LGBTIQ community |publisher=Gay News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922144157/http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/northern-territory/8916-clover-sadly-farewells-nsw-parliament.html |archivedate=2012-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
As in neighboring France, the culture of dual mandates is very strong in Belgium and that country currently has one of the highest percentage of dual mandate holders (MPs, aldermen, municipal councilors) in the world. During the 2003–2009 period, 87.3% of members of the Walloon (French-speaking) Parliament held dual mandates, followed by 86,5% in the Flemish (Dutch-speaking) Parliament, 82,0% in the Chamber of Representatives (the Federal lower house) and 68.9% in the Senate. During that same period, 76.5% of all European Parliament MPs from Belgium held dual mandates.

More than one fifth of all Belgian MPs were mayor at the same time with, by far, by the highest proportion (40%) to be found in the Walloon Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Gert-Jan Put and Ine Vanlangenakker, "The extent of multiple office-holding in Belgium (2003-2009). An exploration of the underlying reasons." PhD Thesis, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (2010), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada dual mandates are rare and are frequently barred by legislation at the federal, provincial, or territorial level. At the federal level, section 39 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] prevents a [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] from being elected as a [[House of Commons of Canada|Member of Parliament]]; similarly, s. 65(c) of the [[Canada Elections Act]] makes members of provincial or territorial legislatures ineligible to be candidates to the House of Commons. At the provincial level, the situation varies from one province to another.

In other circumstances, an elected official almost always resigns their first post when elected to another. Dual representation has occurred occasionally when the member was elected to a second office shortly before their other term of office was due to expire anyway and whereby the short time frame would not merit the cost of a special [[by-election]]. In 1996, for example, [[Jenny Kwan]] continued to be a [[Vancouver]] city councillor after being elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|provincial legislature]]. The British Columbia legislature had debated a "Dual Office Prohibition Act" which failed to pass [[second reading]].

In the first few years after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, however, double mandates were common. In the first [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], there were fifteen Members of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] from [[Quebec]] who simultaneously held seats in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], including the [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]]. There were also four members of Parliament from [[Ontario]] who also held seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], including the first two [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]]s, [[John Sandfield Macdonald]] and [[Edward Blake]].  Other prominent federal politicians with double mandates included [[George-Étienne Cartier]], [[Christopher Dunkin]], [[Hector Langevin]], the second [[Premier of British Columbia]] [[Amor de Cosmos]], and two members from [[Manitoba]], [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] and [[Pierre Delorme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ex Uno Plures: Federal-Provincial Relations in Canada, 1867-1896 |author=Garth Stevenson |page=330 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-7735-1633-6 |edition=paperback |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mbJIbrmfgUC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous example is that of the ''de facto'' leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], who ran for both federal and provincial seats in 1867.  Brown lost both elections, and soon thereafter began campaigning for the prohibition of double mandates.

The double mandate was prohibited from the start in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]; it was abolished in Ontario in 1872, in Manitoba in 1873, and in 1873 the federal parliament passed a law against it; Quebec passed its own law abolishing it in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The French-Canadian idea of Confederation, 1864-1900 |author=A.

The House of Commons and Its Members |isbn=2-89461-378-4 |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dual mandates within a province remained legal. From 1867 to 1985, 305 mayors were also members of the Quebec legislative assembly (MLA). The two best-known cases were those of S.N. Parent who was simultaneously mayor of Quebec City (1894-1906), MLA and Premier of Quebec (1900-1905). Longtime Montreal Mayor Camilien Houde (1928–32, 1938–40) was also simultaneously MLA for a total of 2 /1/2 years during his mandates as mayor. However that type of dual mandate had virtually ceased when laws adopted in 1978 and 1980 prohibited MLAs from holding any local mandate.

==Finland==
It is common for the MPs of the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]] to hold a mandate as a member of their local municipal council as well. 79 percent of MPs elected to parliament in 2011 were also municipal council members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunnat.net/fi/Kuntaliitto/media/tiedotteet/2011/04/Sivut/eduskunnassa-yha-enemman-kunnanvaltuutettuja.aspx |title=Eduskunnassa yhä enemmän kunnanvaltuutettuja |publisher=Kunnat.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' ''cumul des mandats'' ''' ({{IPA-fr|kymyl dɛ mɑ̃da|lang}}, {{literally}} ''accumulation of mandates'') is a common practice in the [[French Fifth Republic]] (1958–present).&lt;ref&gt;At the time Pierre Mauroy was prime minister (1981–84), he kept his job as [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Lille, one of France's largest cities, without anyone objecting. France has had legions of députés-maires, sénateurs-maires and ministres-maires.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of simultaneously holding two or more elective offices at different levels of government — local, regional, national and European — as mayors, MPs, senators, Members of the European Parliament, and [[President of the General Council]] in their home regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gidea |first=Robert |year=2002 |title=France since 1945 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-219246-9 |page=240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, officials hold as many as four positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadeau |first=Jean-Benoît |author2=Julie Barlow |title=Sixty million Frenchmen can't be wrong: why we love France but not the French |year= 2003|publisher=Sourcebooks |location=Naperville, Illinois |isbn=1-4022-0045-5 |page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials may not be elected to more than one office at the same level (such as being both an MP and a senator), they may hold offices in any combination at the municipal, departmental, regional, national and European levels. The ''cumul des mandats'' is controversial in France, being accused of fostering [[absenteeism]] and [[cronyism]].

Several laws to limit the practice have been introduced in recent decades. By far the most coveted local mandate is that of mayor, traditionally a highly prestigious function in France.

A hotly debated law to prohibit all dual mandates, to take effect in 2017, was adopted in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2013/07/05/cumul-des-mandats-l-assemblee-adopte-la-principale-mesure-du-projet-de-loi_3442825_823448.html|title=Non-cumul des mandats : le projet de loi adopté à l'Assemblée|date=5 July 2013|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the adoption of the law, former President Sarkozy and other members of the opposition UMP party have declared that if elected in 2017, their party would revise or even revoke that law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2014/01/19/01002-20140119ARTFIG00186-la-droite-table-sur-l-abrogation-du-texte-en-cas-de-retour-au-pouvoir-en-2017.php|title=Cumul des mandats : la droite reviendrait sur le texte en cas de retour au pouvoir|first=Jean-Baptiste|last=Garat|date=19 January 2014|publisher=|via=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfmtv.com/politique/sarkozy-pret-a-supprimer-la-loi-sur-le-non-cumul-des-mandats-940126.html|title=Sarkozy prêt à supprimer la loi sur le non-cumul des mandats?|first=|last=BFMTV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Socialist Party MPs and senators have also expressed their unease with the law imposed by President Hollande and might welcome a review of the law. In the meantime, the ubiquitous 'député-maire' (MP and mayor) and 'sénateur-maire' are still familiar figures of the French political scene.

===Conditions regarding multiple mandates in France===
*The [[President of France|President of the Republic]] cannot hold any other office during their tenure.

'''Multiple mandates at the legislative level'''

Parliamentary mandates are incompatible with each other:

*Member of the [[National Assembly of France]]
*Member of the [[Senate of France]]
*Member of the [[European Parliament]]

A member from one of the above assemblies can not combine its mandate with more than one of the following mandates :

*Member, vice-president or president of a [[General councils (France)|General Council]]
*Member, vice-president or president of a [[Regional councils of France|Regional Council]]
*Councillor, deputy-mayor, or [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of a commune of more than 3,500 inhabitants
*Councillor of Paris (The "[[Council of Paris]]" is at the same level a municipal council and a general council, because Paris has a special status, Municipality and [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] at the same level)
*Councillor in the [[Corsican Assembly]] (Corse has a regional special status)

Exceptions: They can hold a third office in a town of less than 3,500 inhabitants.

They may also hold a third office as a councillor, vice-president or president of an [[Urban communities in France|Urban community]], an [[Agglomeration communities in France|Agglomeration community]] or a ''[[Communauté de communes]]'', as these terms are elected by indirect universal suffrage, by municipal councils from among the councillors.

For example, a member of the National Assembly has the right to be general/regional councillor or [[President of the Regional Council (France)|President]] of a regional/general council. They cannot hold a third office unless they are the mayor, deputy mayor or municipal councillor of a city of less than 3,500 inhabitants.

In 2008, 85% of members of parliament held multiple posts &lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/world/europe/13france.html?_r=1&amp;th=&amp;emc=th&amp;pagewanted=all French Cabinet Position Not Enough? Then Try Mayor], [[The New York Times]], January 13, 2008. Accessed March 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the June 2012 legislative elections, it was still the case that 85% of all National Assembly members (438 deputies out of 577) held a double mandate (often as mayor of a mid- to large-size city) and 33 have four mandates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nom * |url=http://bigbrowser.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/07/11/pastiche-le-cumul-des-mandats-une-addiction-qui-se-soigne/ |title=PASTICHE – Le cumul des mandats, une addiction qui se soigne &amp;#124; Big Browser |publisher=Bigbrowser.blog.lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, out of 348 senators, 152 are also mayors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nom * |url=http://jeandumonteil.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/05/14/lengagement-de-la-fin-du-cumul-des-mandats-sera-t-il-tenu/ |title=L’engagement de la fin du cumul des mandats sera-t-il tenu ? &amp;#124; EXTRATERRITORIAL |publisher=Jeandumonteil.blog.lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The accumulation of local mandates'''

They cannot have more than two local mandates.

The following mandates are incompatible each other:

*[[Mayor (France)|Mayor]]
*[[President of the General Council]]
*[[President of the Regional Council (France)|President of the Regional Council]]

For example, an elected official cannot be mayor and President of the Regional Council. However, all other local mandates are cumulative. A mayor can also be a general councillor and a president of a Regional Council can also be deputy-mayor of a city.

Exceptions are the same as those for parliamentarians (Cities of less than 3,500 inhabitants and the intercommunalities)

'''The accumulation of mandates and governmental functions''' 
[[File:2014-11-22 16-21-42 commemoration.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Damien Meslot|MP-mayor]] of Belfort and the {{ill|Cédric Perrin|fr|Cédric Perrin (homme politique)}} senator-mayor of Beaucourt at a ceremony in 2014]]
A member of the French government cannot be a member of any assembly. However, he may retain any local mandate he or she holds. A cabinet minister can exercise a maximum of two local mandates in addition to his or her government function.

For example, the Prime Minister, a Minister or Secretary of State can be [[Mayor (France)|mayor]], or President of a general, regional or intercommunal council or sit in one of these assemblies.

Currently, over two-thirds of the members of the French government are engaged in one or two more local mandates.

===Purpose and frequency===
{{POV section|date=March 2015}}
The rationales for holding multiple offices are varied. Holding a seat in the Senate, National Assembly, or European Parliament gives local [[Mayor (France)|mayors]] a valuable method of tapping funds to develop their home cities and regions.&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"&gt;Gildea, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt; It also can give opportunities to curry favor with other important officials, with opportunities at each level.&lt;ref name="Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56"&gt;Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Salaries for positions can be combined (to a point) as well.&lt;ref name="Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56"/&gt;  For politicians with national ambitions, retaining a position in a local town can give them a down-to-earth aura that can appeal to voters. These advantages have made politicians very wary of reducing the practice of the ''cumul'' with legislation despite other moves to end perceptions of favoritism and corruption among politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gildea, pg. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been common practice in France since the [[French Third Republic]] (1870). But there are also many cases of "cumul" before this period, for example, the writer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was a member from 1839 to 1851. In 1849 he was appointed Foreign Affairs minister, and at the same time he was elected [[President of the General Council]] of [[Manche]] from 1849 to 1851 (councillor from 1842 to 1852).

There are several reasons for this phenomenon, and one of them is that France has a long tradition of centralization, compared to countries such as Germany, Italy, and Spain. Local governments have less power and skills than that the "Länder" of Germany, or "Autonomous Communities" of Spain. The local mandates in France are less important than in other countries, and therefore politicians have more time to devote to a parliamentary mandate.

The ''cumul'' is a widespread practice and has grown much more prevalent in modern France. In 1946, 36 percent of deputies in the National Assembly held an additional office.&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"/&gt;  By 1956, this number had already increased to 42 percent&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"/&gt; and by 1970, 70 percent of deputies held an additional elected office; in 1988, 96 percent did.&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"/&gt;

Many of the most prominent politicians in France make use or have made use of the ''cumul''. [[Jacques Chirac]] served as [[List of mayors of Paris|Mayor]] of [[Paris]] between 1977 and 1995.  During this same time, Chirac also served as a deputy in the National Assembly from [[Corrèze]], briefly as [[Member of the European Parliament]], and even as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] between 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name="Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56"/&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Pierre Bérégovoy]] served concurrently as mayor of [[Nevers]] and deputy of [[Nièvre]] in the mid-1980s.

====An example : the accumulation of four electoral mandates====
[[File:20110300 Emboîtement et cumul des mandats d'Yves Jégo.PNG|thumb|[[Yves Jégo]]'s four mandates, between March 2010 and July 2011.]]
According to French law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/elections/les_elections_en_france/cumul-mandats "French Interior Ministry"] "Le cumul des mandats électoraux" (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; against accumulation of electoral mandates, [[Yves Jégo]] should have resigned from one of the following mandates before the 21st of April 2010 (one month after the Regional elections) :
*Member of the [[National Assembly of France]] for [[Seine-et-Marne]]
*Regional councillor of [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]]
*[[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]]
But giving as a pretext a legal complaint from the [[Front National (France)|Front National]]'s candidates, he hold the three of them during more than one year, plus his local mandate of president of the « [[communauté de communes]] des deux fleuves » ([[Communauté de communes des Deux Fleuves|CC2F]]).

===Recent and current status of ''cumul'' in the French government===
[[Lionel Jospin]] (Prime Minister from 1997 to 2002) imposed on his government ministers an unwritten rule of having no local office. For example, [[Catherine Trautmann]] stepped down as [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Strasbourg]] (while remaining a member of the city council) to become [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]]; conversely, [[Martine Aubry]] stepped down from the [[Minister of Labour (France)|Ministry of Labour]] when elected Mayor of [[Lille]] in 2001. This rule was more or less upheld by [[Jacques Chirac]] during the governments of [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]] for the 2002-2007 term, with a few notable exceptions ([[Jean-François Copé]] was mayor of [[Meaux]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]  was [[President of the General Council|President]] of the [[Hauts-de-Seine]] General Council); for instance, [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]] had to step down from the [[Toulouse]] mayorship upon joining the government.

{{As of|2007}}, no such rule was stated for the [[François Fillon]] government: [[Alain Juppé]], former Minister for Development was mayor of [[Bordeaux]], and was defeated in his National Assembly constituency (a third cumulative mandate) by 50.9% to 49.1% of the votes by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] candidate. Additionally, [[Hervé Morin]], the [[Minister of Defense (France)|Minister of Defense]], is mayor of [[Épaignes]], and [[Éric Besson]], Minister of Immigration and National Identity, is the mayor of [[Donzère]].

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, dual mandate is common for members of the territory's [[Legislative Council]], who serve concurrently as members of one of the territory's eighteen district councils. Before the abolition of the two municipal councils in the territory in 1999, it was common for politicians to serve concurrently at all three levels.

==Ireland==
The instability caused by the close result of the [[Irish general election, 1981|1981 general election]] was exacerbated by the number of government [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s who also served as MEPs and for whom the opposition refused [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|pairing]] when they were abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connor|first1=Tom|last2=O'Halloran|first2=Anthony|last3=Pattison|first3=Seamus|title=Politics in a Changing Ireland 1960-2007: A Tribute to Seamus Pattison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujipx7kGF70C&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|isbn=9781904541691|page=49|chapter=A career politician}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to further elections [[Irish general election, February 1982|in February 1982]] and [[Irish general election, November 1982|again in November]].

In 1991, [[Government of Ireland|cabinet ministers]] and [[Minister of State (Ireland)|junior ministers]] were prohibited from serving as [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local councillors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1991/act/11/section/13/enacted/en/html#sec13|title=Local Government Act, 1991, Section 13|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prohibition was extended to other [[Oireachtas]] members by the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003, an amendment to the [[Local Government Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0017/print.html#sec2 |title=Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 |date=June 2, 2003 |series=[[Irish Statute Book]] |chapter=§2 Amendment of Principal Act — insertion of new section 13A |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to include it in the 2001 Act failed after a rebellion by [[Fianna Fáil]] [[backbencher]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/no-political-will-to-rock-the-cosy-boat-that-is-the-seanad-502066.html |title=No political will to rock the cosy boat that is the Seanad |last=Murphy |first=John A |date=14 July 2002|work=Sunday Independent |quote=The councillor lobby which stymied Noel Dempsey's plans to end the dual mandate |accessdate=16 April 2010|location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2003 Act passed after a compensation package was agreed for those losing out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/news-in-brief-215369.html |title=Local government needs independent 'fiscal autonomy' |last=Geaney |first=Louise |date=2 June 2003 |work=Irish Independent |quote=The Local Government Bill 2000 proposed to abolish the dual mandate but the Act dropped the idea, only for it to be re-introduced — with a handy €12,800 sweetener — in 2003. |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 Act prohibited being a member of multiple county or city councils, or multiple [[List of cities, boroughs and towns in the Republic of Ireland|town council]]s, or both a town and city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/sec0014.html |title=Local Government Act 2001 |year=2001 |series=Irish Statute Book |chapter=§14.

The 2003 Act provided that a candidate elected simultaneously to a forbidden combination of local councils has three days to choose which seat to take up, with the other or others then being considered vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0017/sec0006.html |title=Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 |date=June 2, 2003 |series=Irish Statute Book |chapter=§6 Amendment of Local Elections Regulations 1995 |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]] abolished town councils and instead subdivided most counties into [[municipal district (Ireland)|municipal district]]s; the county council's members are the district councillors for all districts within the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentReform/|title=Local Government Reform|year=2014|publisher=Department of the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/sec0019.html|title=Local Government Reform Act 2014, Section 19|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Irish republican party [[Sinn Féin]] held the office as a [[Member of The Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] within the respective houses. [[Martin McGuinness]], former [[Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]] held the office as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and simultaneously was a MP in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. However, in 2012 Sinn Féin committed to end dual jobbing; this resulted in McGuinness' resignation from the House of Commons in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20871049|title=Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness resigns as Mid-Ulster MP|date=2012-12-30|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/martin-mcguinness-hands-in-his-resignation-for-mp-position-735995-Dec2012/|title=Martin McGuinness resigns as MP|last=Croffey|first=Amy|newspaper=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Per the [[Spanish Constitution]], legislators in the [[List of Spanish regional legislatures|regional assemblies]] of the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]] are barred from being elected to a seat in the [[Congress of Deputies]], the lower house of the [[Cortes Generales]]. More precisely, regional legislators can run for the seat, but if elected they must choose between the regional and national parliaments. Nevertheless, members of lower tiers of the Spanish decentralized structure, such as provincial councillors or members of local councils, including mayors, can and have held seats in the Congress of Deputies. The rule barring regional legislators does not apply to the upper house of the Cortes, the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]]: in fact, regional legislatures are entitled to appoint a varying number of members from their ranks to the Senate, according to the population of the region. Currently, the Autonomous Communities appoint 56 Senators, the other 208 being directly elected in [[Elections in Spain|general elections]].

==United Kingdom==
At the EU level, prior to the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament elections]], there were a small number of [[Member of the European Parliament|members of the European Parliament]] who were also members of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahl2004/downloads/decisionandact.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708163144/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahl2004/downloads/decisionandact.pdf |date=July 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now European law that a member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) may not be a member of the legislature of a [[Member State of the European Union|member state]].&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt; This, with regard to the United Kingdom, therefore applies to the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as the constituent bodies forming that member state's legislature. As it is impossible to disclaim a [[life peerage]], it has been ruled that peers (who sit as members of the House of Lords) must take a "leave of absence" from the Lords in order to be an MEP; this is also the procedure for when a peer is the UK's [[European Commissioner]], which has in recent times usually been the case.

There have been members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] also holding seats in the devolved bodies in [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]], [[National Assembly for Wales|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]]. The November 2009 report by the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] into [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|the controversy surrounding MPs' expenses]] noted that "double jobbing" was "unusually ingrained in the political culture" of Northern Ireland, where 16 of 18 MPs were MLAs, compared to one Scottish MP being an MSP ([[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]]), and no Welsh MPs being AMs.&lt;ref name="CSPL"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/Library/MP_expenses_main_report.pdf#page=97 |title=MPs' expenses and allowances; Supporting Parliament, safeguarding the taxpayer |date=November 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2010 |author=Committee on Standards in Public Life |series=House of Commons papers 2009 |volume=7724 |others=Chaired by Sir [[Christopher Kelly (civil servant)|Christopher Kelly]] |page=95 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214231245/http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/Library/MP_expenses_main_report.pdf#page=97 |archivedate=14 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee recommended that Westminster ban multiple mandates from the 2011 assembly elections.&lt;ref name="CSPL"/&gt; Parties in Northern Ireland agreed to a ban from the 2015 elections.&lt;ref name="CSPL"/&gt; The ability to dual mandate between the Assembly of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons (or the Irish [[Dáil Éireann]]) ended as from the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2016]] following the [[Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/13/section/3|title=Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wales Act 2014]] also applied a similar restriction on the National Assembly for Wales (in that its members cannot also be members of the House of Commons) as from the assembly election in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/wales.html|title=Wales Act 2014 — UK Parliament|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing in UK law prohibits a member of the House of Commons or the House of Lords from being simultaneously a mayor, council leader, or other locally elected official. Thus [[Ken Livingstone]] remained MP for [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] until the dissolution of Parliament despite his election as [[Mayor of London]] a year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2010/jan/05/boris-johnson-london-mayor-mp-simultaneously|title=Boris Johnson: simultaneous Mayor and MP?|first=Dave|last=Hill|date=5 January 2010|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris Johnson]] resigned his seat as MP for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] on being elected mayor in 2008, but became an MP again in 2015, a year prior to the end of his second term as mayor (he did not seek a third term). [[Sadiq Khan]], elected as the Labour mayor in the [[London mayoral election, 2016|2016 election]], resigned his seat as MP for [[Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Tooting]] soon after his election to the mayoralty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34218390|title=Sadiq Khan wins Labour London mayoral selection|date=11 September 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous members of the [[House of Lords]] however hold positions in local government.

At a lower level, it is common for people to hold seats on both [[administrative geography of the United Kingdom|a district council and a county council]]. Several MPs have also retained their council seats, most often until the expiration of their terms;&lt;!--John Hemming, for three years; Craig Whittaker, for one--&gt; [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] simultaneously held a council seat and a seat in Parliament between his election to Parliament in 1997 and his defeat in the local elections in 2014.

==United States==
''The term '''dual mandate''' is also applied to the twin objectives of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]: to control inflation and promote employment.''

The practice is banned by [[State constitution (United States)|the constitutions]] of many [[U.S. state]]s, but as of 1992 it was still legal in [[Connecticut]], [[Illinois]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].  The [[U.S. Constitution]] prohibits members of the Senate or House from holding positions within the Executive Branch (Art. I, Sec. 6, cl. 2), and limits the president to his salary as chief executive, saying he may not "receive... any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them" (Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 7).

===Florida===
In April 1984, [[Governor of Florida]] [[Bob Graham]] received legislation that passed unanimously in both houses of the [[Florida Legislature]] that would forbid public officials from receiving retirement pay and regular pay simultaneously for the same position.&lt;ref&gt;via ''[[Associated Press]]''. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fvEcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tmgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5554,4531744 "Governor Receives Legislation to Halt 'Double Dipping'"], ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]'', April 19, 1984. Accessed May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illinois===
In August 2008, [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Rod Blagojevich]] proposed legislation that would prohibit dual-office holding as part of changes to the state's ethics bill, stating that "dual government employment creates the potential for a conflict of interest because a legislator's duties to his or her constituents and his or her public employer are not always consistent." Critics, such as Representative [[Susana Mendoza]], called the actions "spite" on the part of the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Fusco, Chris.

===New Jersey===
Fulfilling a campaign pledge that he had made when first running for the [[New Jersey Legislature]], [[Jack Sinagra]] sponsored a bill passed by the [[New Jersey Senate]] in 1992 that would ban the practice. At the time that the legislation first passed, there were some twenty elected officials who served in the New Jersey Legislature and another elected office, including Assemblyman [[Bill Pascrell]], who was also mayor of [[Paterson, New Jersey]]; State Senator [[Ronald Rice]], who also served on the [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] City Council; and Assemblyman [[John E. Rooney (politician)|John E. Rooney]], who was also mayor of [[Northvale, New Jersey|Northvale]]. These officials protested the proposed ban as interfering with the will of voters to elect officials as they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;Strum, Charles. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/nyregion/new-jersey-politicians-serve-public-twice.html "New Jersey Politicians Serve Public, Twice"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 27, 1992. Accessed May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper called former State senator [[Wayne R. Bryant]] the "king of double dipping" because he was collecting salaries from as many as four public jobs he held simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/050406/commLittleHopeForChange.html Little hope for change with the foxes still in charge], ''[[New Jersey Jewish News]]'', May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Jon Corzine]] signed legislation in September 2007 that banned the practice statewide, but the 19 legislators holding multiple offices as of February 1, 2008, were grandfathered into the system and allowed to retain their positions.&lt;ref name="2008ban"&gt;[http://www.nj.com/south/index.ssf/2008/03/doubledipping_continues_increa.html "Double-dipping continues, increases after ban"], ''South Jersey Media Group'', March 24, 2008. Accessed Sep 7, 2012. "Since Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed a ban on dual-office holding in September, the number of lawmakers who hold more than one office has actually increased -- from 17 to 19 -- according to a report by The Star-Ledger of Newark. This is because a grandfather clause allows any lawmaker holding two offices as of Feb. 1 to keep both."&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2013, only four of the nineteen (listed in bold) continue to hold a dual mandate.&lt;ref name=update&gt;Arca, Matthew.

'''''El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency''''' is a non-fiction book of the [[Mexican Drug War]] written by Ioan Grillo.&lt;ref name=bostonglobe&gt;{{cite news |last=Singal |first=Jesse |title='El Narco by Ioan Grillo |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/910922218.html |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=15 December 2011  |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''El Narco'', Grillo takes a close look at the Mexican drug trade, starting with the term "El Narco", which has come to represent the vast, faceless criminal network of drug traffickers who cast a murderous shadow over Mexico.&lt;ref name=elnarconpr&gt;{{cite news|title='El Narco': The Trade Driving Mexico's Drug War|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/25/141650194/el-narco-the-trade-driving-mexicos-drug-war|accessdate=28 January 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book covers the frontline of the [[Mexican Drug War]].&lt;ref name=insightcrimeelnarco&gt;{{cite news|title=A War Fought by Assassins: Ioan Grillo on Mexico's Crime Scenes|url=http://insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/1877-a-war-fought-by-assassins-ioan-grillo-on-mexicos-crime-scenes|accessdate=28 January 2012|publisher=[[InSight Crime]]|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to trace the origins of the illegal drug trade in [[Mexico]], the recent escalation of violence, the human cost of the drug trade and organized crime in the country.&lt;ref name=wola/&gt; The book takes a critical stance on the unsuccessful efforts made by the [[Federal government of Mexico|Mexican government]] and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] to confront the violence and its causes.&lt;ref name=wola&gt;{{cite web|title=El Narco": A discussion with journalist and author Ioan Grillo|url=http://www.wola.org/event/el_narco_a_discussion_with_journalist_and_author_ioan_grillo|publisher=[[Washington Office on Latin America]]|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|title=El narcotráfico, según Ioan Grillo|url=http://www.yucatan.com.mx/2011/nota-13/171598-el-narcotrafico-segun-ioan-grillo.htm|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=Diario de Yucatan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grillo's book draws a portrait of the [[drug cartels#Mexico|Mexican drug cartels]] and how they have radically transformed in the past couple of decades.&lt;ref name=indiebound&gt;{{cite web|title=El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency, Description|url=http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781608192113|publisher=[[IndieBound]]|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the author, the criminal organizations in Mexico are not [[gangs]]; they are a "movement and an industry drawing in hundreds of thousands from bullet-ridden barrios to marijuana-growing mountains". The book explains how the cartels have created [[paramilitary]] death squads with tens of thousands of armed men from the country of [[Guatemala]] to the Texan border.&lt;ref name=indiebound/&gt; It contains testimonies from members inside of the cartels; and while ''El Narco'' shows that the "devastation" of the [[Mexican Drug War]] may be south of the U.S. border, Grillo pinpoints that the United States "is knee-deep in this conflict".&lt;ref name=indiebound/&gt;

In the British edition, published in September 2011, the book bore the subtitle, "The Bloody Rise of Mexican Drug Cartels". The US edition came out two months later, bearing a different subtitle. A Spanish-language version of the book titled "El narco: En el corazón de la insurgencia criminal mexicana" has also been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news |title=Insurgencia a la mexicana |url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=309694 |accessdate=6 September 2012 |newspaper=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]] |date=4 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910125531/http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=309694 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's background==
Ioan Grillo is an [[British people|English]] [[journalist]] and [[author]] of the book ''El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency''.&lt;ref name=bostonglobe /&gt; He has been reporting on the [[Mexican Drug War]] and the [[Latin America]]n [[Illegal drug trade in Latin America|illegal drug trade]] since 2001. He is currently a correspondent for ''[[TIME magazine]]'' as well as producing TV special reports and documentaries for stations including ''[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'' and ''[[Channel 4]]'' of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ioan Grillo at the 2011 Texas Book Festival|url=http://www.texasbookfestival.org/Author_Page.php?aid=4318|publisher=[[Texas Book Festival]]|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grillo has also worked as a reporter for ''[[CNN]]'', ''[[Houston Chronicle|The Houston Chronicle]]'', and ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'', where he has witnessed military operations, mafia killings, and drug seizures in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Lorenzo|title=El narco según Ioan Grillo|url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/658601.el-narco-segun-ioan-grillo.html|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon|date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has reported on [[Al Jazeera]], [[France 24]], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[Gatopardo (magazine)|Gatopardo]]'', and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grillo|first=Ioan|title=Author|url=http://www.ioangrillo.com/author.php|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Press]]|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ioan Grillo |url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/author/ioan-grillo|work=New York Journal of Books|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the biography section in his official webpage, Grillo grew up in the coastal city of [[Brighton]], [[England]]—famous for its pink candy, pebble beaches, colleges and bubbling night clubs.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; On the darker side, however, Brighton is notorious for being one of British's top places for [[Recreational drug use|drug consumption]]. And according to the author, few people there realize where the substances they are intaking come from or what they might give or takeaway from those countries.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Moreover, Grillo began working as a drug war journalist after being fascinated "by the riddle of these ghost-like figures" who make more than $30 billion a year and are idolized in popular songs known as [[narcocorridos]] and chased by the Mexican and U.S. authorities.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; For over a decade, Grillo has followed the end-less murder scenes in "bullet-ridden streets, mountains where drugs are born as pretty flowers, and scarred criminals from prison cells to luxury condos".&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Grillo has discussed the drug war with two Mexican presidents, three attorneys general and a U.S. ambassador, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ioan Grillo |title=El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1G4FlXMOgfkC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |year=2011 |isbn=9781608195046 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book's excerpts==
;Excerpt 1
The following excerpt from the book is set in [[Culiacán]], capital city of the [[Sinaloa]], the northwestern state that is home to the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and is known as the "cradle of Mexican drug smuggling":&lt;ref name=insightcrimeelnarco/&gt; 
{{cquote|Twenty seconds of shooting. Four hundred and thirty-two bullets. Five dead policemen.

Four of the corpses sprawl over a shiny-new Dodge Ram pickup truck that has been pierced by so many caps it resembles a cheese grater. The cadavers are twisted and contorted in the unnatural poses of the dead; arms arch backward over spines, legs spread out sideways; the pattern of bodies that fall like rag dolls when bullets strike.

After arriving at too many murder scenes, I often felt numb staring at the lead-filled flesh spread out on the concrete, dirt roads and car seats. The images all blur into one. But then little details come back: the twists of elbows over backs, heads over shoulders. It is these patterns that come into my mind when I think about the murder scenes; and these patterns then filter into bad dreams when I am sleeping in a bed a thousand miles away.

This particular crime scene is on a sweaty December evening in Culiacán, Sinaloa. The state policemen had hit a red stop light next to a shopping center when the triggermen attacked. BANG. BANG. BANG. The assassins shoot from the side and back unleashing bullets in split seconds. A customized Kalashnikov with a circular clip can unload 100 rounds in 10 seconds. This is lightning war. People tend to shudder at the fact that Mexican gangsters have rocket-propelled grenades. But the AK-47 is far more lethal."&lt;ref name=insightcrimeelnarco/&gt;}}

;Excerpt 2
Below is an excerpt from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published on 23 October 2011. It is the confession of a cartel member that is imprisoned:&lt;ref name=timesexcerpt&gt;{{cite news|last=Grillo|first=Ioan|title=The Narco-Killer's Tale: Confessions of a Justified Sinner|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2097594,00.html|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|It all seemed like a bad dream.

It may have been vivid and raw. But it felt somehow surreal, like Gonzalo was watching these terrible acts from above. Like it was someone else who had firefights with ski-masked federal police in broad daylight. Someone else who stormed into homes and dragged away men from crying wives and mothers. Someone else who duct-taped victims to chairs and starved and beat them for days. Someone else who clasped a machete and began to hack off their craniums while they were still living. But it was all real.

He was a different man when he did those things, Gonzalo tells me. He had smoked crack cocaine and drunk whisky every day, had enjoyed power in a country where the poor are so powerless, had a latest model truck and could pay for houses in cash, had four wives and children scattered all over ... had no God. "In those days, I had no fear. I felt nothing. I had no compassion for anybody," he says, speaking slowly, swallowing some words.&lt;ref name=timesexcerpt/&gt;}}

;Excerpt 3
The ''[[Global Post]]'' published a portion of the book where Grillo interviews an American agent who infiltrates a drug cartel:&lt;ref name=infiltrates&gt;{{cite news|title=El Narco: Dying for nothing|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/mexico/111020/el-narco-excerpt-part-two|accessdate=12 May 2012|publisher=[[GlobalPost]]|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Alongside other veterans, Daniel would buzz around the state in a helicopter carrying an M16 automatic rifle and raiding marijuana plantations. Most were run by Mexicans and located inside national parks and forests and included some huge farms with up to twelve thousand plants. During one bust, some thugs from Michoacán fired at them with Kalashnikovs. "I was getting close to the plantation and they fired. We hit the ground first, kneeling down and we fired back, and they were gone. These people have balls, they are crazy."

Daniel's next job was in the U.S. Customs Service busting runners as they came over the border. Because of the huge quantity of traffic at Tijuana-San Diego, agents can only toss a tiny percentage of vehicles. So the key for Daniel and other agents was to try to read people and smell who was dirty. Daniel found he had a special talent for spotting smugglers. "It is like a sense. I look at them and see if the person that is driving does not match the car or the car does not match the person. I get close up to their face and say, 'How are you doing?' And if you're carrying a bunch of money or drugs, I'm going to get all over your ass."&lt;ref name=infiltrates/&gt;}}

==Critical reception==
According to [[Blogcritics]], ''El Narco'' is a "tough, straightforward, kick-in-the-nuts reportage by a man who is determined to ignore all the ideological gibberish and see for himself what's really going on in Mexico".&lt;ref name=blogcritics&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Review: El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency by Ioan Grillo|url=http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-el-narco-inside-mexicos/|accessdate=11 May 2012|publisher=[[Blogcritics]]|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that ''El Narco'' is also a "really ugly book full of really ugly facts related by a terse, insightful writer who knows how to shape a powerful and compelling story into a powerful and compelling argument".&lt;ref name=blogcritics/&gt; Moreover, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said that Grillo is one of those authors that "does not forget" the newspaper headlines in Mexico's drug war that often "feel unreal" and go "beyond comprehension".&lt;ref name=bostonglobe/&gt; He is also an author who "takes the advantage" of his sources to provide insight for the drug war from "nearly every angle", from America's attempts to stifle drug trafficking to a nation's history and drug culture.&lt;ref name=bostonglobe/&gt; His book, ''El Narco'', is filled with "sort of unforgettable details" in which only a reporter who has been behind the [[Mexican Drug War]] for years "would be privy".&lt;ref name=bostonglobe/&gt; Dudley Althaus of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' stated that Grillo "traces the beast's footprints with meticulous research" and with "courageous reporting on some of [Mexico's] meanest streets".&lt;ref name=criticalreception&gt;{{cite web|title=Advance Praise for El Narco:|url=http://www.bloomsburypress.com/books/catalog/el_narco_hc_113|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, William Booth of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' said that Grillo "goes much, much deeper" in reporting the "crazy death spiral of drug violence" in Mexico's drug war. But most importantly, Booth mentioned that ''El Narco'' "tells us how we got here".&lt;ref name=criticalreception/&gt; The ''[[Powell's Books]]'' bookstore chains commented that the book is a "propulsive account of the blood-soaked machinery of 'El Narco,' the shadowy complex of drug cartels, street gangs, and paramilitary death squads that have littered Mexican streets with bodies and AK-47 shells".&lt;ref name=powell&gt;{{cite web|title=El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781608192113-1|publisher=[[Powell's Books]]|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grillo also explains how the violence is traced back to the vacuum left by the demise of the Institutional Revolutionary Party's (PRI) single-party rule "but delicately balanced system of corruption, painting a grim portrait of the corrupt police, soldiers, and officials who, figuring they can't beat the crime, make a tidy fortune by joining it".&lt;ref name=powell/&gt;

Tim Padgett of the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that Grillo "explores that world as deeply as few journalists have dared;" nonetheless, Padgett said that the historical context of the book not only indicts "Mexican and Latin American politicos but U.S. policymakers as well".&lt;ref name=criticalreception/&gt; The ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', while noting that the book was a "propulsive account of the blood-soaked machinery", concluded that Grillo pinpoints that "America's hard-line rhetoric has failed."&lt;ref name=criticalreception/&gt; The magazine stated that Grillo's book can be as "perceptive as his high-octane reportage". The ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' noted that the book emphasizes the "chilling account of the murderous growth of Mexican drug cartels", and concluded that ''El Narco'' is a "valuable contribution to the literature of the Drug War".&lt;ref name=criticalreception/&gt; The weekly television show known as ''[[Dan Rather Reports]]'', that airs on [[HDNet]], noted that ''El Narco'' is "riveting, authoritative reporting from the front lines of the Mexican drug wars". It argued that the book shows how the Mexican drug war has "explosive potential consequences for every American, and Ioan Grillo's book shows you why".&lt;ref name=ioangrillo&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews|url=http://www.ioangrillo.com/criticism.php|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Press]]|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The West Australian]]'' said that ''El Narco'' is an essential reading for those wishing to understand "how a violent criminal insurgency can take root in an advanced country with a trillion-dollar economy".&lt;ref name=westaustralian&gt;{{cite news|last=Sibree|first=Bron|title=Book Review: El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/entertainment/13506710/book-review-el-narco-inside-mexicos-criminal-insurgency/|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=[[The West Australian]]|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, it said that the book is not "for the faint hearted". According to the newspaper, the book engulfs an account of the "rivers of blood in which its citizens are drowning", since Mexico's drug war "is a case study in the way brutal mafia capitalism has morphed into a criminal insurgency, the like of which is spreading 'like bushfire' in the Americas".&lt;ref name=westaustralian/&gt;

''[[Reforma]]'', a Mexican newspaper, said that Grillo used the "closest information possible to his object of work", which means that he ran through serious "threats" to get his work done.&lt;ref name=reforma&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web|last=Grillo|first=Ioan|title=El Narco book in Reforma|url=http://ioangrillo.com/el_narco_blog/2011/09/el-narco-book-in-reforma-2/|publisher=El Narco Book by Ioan Grillo|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Grillo's experience and professionalism, Reforma argues that ''El Narco'' is both "horrifying and useful".&lt;ref name=reforma/&gt; The ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' claims that the book "delivers the first authoritative and comprehensive examination" of the mafia killings in Mexico.&lt;ref name=sanantonio&gt;{{cite news|last=MacCormack|first=John|title=Inside the Mexican drug war|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/books/article/Inside-the-Mexican-drug-war-2262911.php|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper explains that Grillo's book can help readers "understand the homicidal madness just across the [[Rio Grande|river]]".&lt;ref name=sanantonio/&gt; It concluded by comparing the book with a "big canvas" that traces the rise of the Mexican drug trafficking organizations from the quaint 19th-century origins.&lt;ref name=sanantonio/&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote a review for ''El Narco'' and noted that the reading was "terrific—full of vivid front-line reporting; diverse interviews; a sense of history; a touch of social science; clarifying statistics; and realistic reviews of what might be done to improve things, none of it easy".&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news|last=Coll|first=Steve|title=Comment: Whose Drug War?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2011/11/mexico-drug-war.html|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine said it is an "essential reading". It argued that it is America's "weak control of automatic weapons" and its "supply [of] guns and money" that fuel the bloodshed in Mexico.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; The [[Globe Corner Bookstore]] said that ''El Narco'' "draws the first definitive portrait of Mexico's drug cartels and how they have radically transformed in the last decade".&lt;ref name=globecorner&gt;{{cite web|title=El Narco: Inside Mexico'S Criminal Insurgency|url=http://www.globecorner.com/t/t53/26505.php|publisher=[[Globe Corner Bookstore]]|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it mentioned that "the devastation may be south of the Rio Grande, but America is knee-deep in this conflict."&lt;ref name=globecorner/&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' noted that Grillo and his book have "achieved extraordinary access to gangsters and police (often the same people)".&lt;ref name=hugh&gt;{{cite news|last=Thumson|first=Hugh|title=El Narco, By Ioan Grillo|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/el-narco-by-ioan-grillo-7447150.html|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, the author shows how the Mexican drug cartels originated in the western state of Sinaloa, where the conditions for growing opium poppy were ideal, in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=hugh/&gt; The New York-based magazine known as the ''[[Bookforum]]'' said that several books have been written in Spanish about Mexico's drug war, but Grillos book is perhaps the "first attempt in English for a popular audience".&lt;ref name=bookforum&gt;{{cite news|last=Quinones|first=Sam|title=Touch of Evil|url=http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/1804/8608|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=[[Bookforum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine noted that Grillo has spent years traveling to Mexico's drug war hotspots: "Sinaloa, Michoacán, Ciudad Juárez—recording interviews with cops and narcos, visiting grave sites and murder scenes".&lt;ref name=bookforum/&gt; ''Bookforum'' concludes that Grillo's book was an attempt to dig more and beyond the "reigning mythology of the Mexican drug war".&lt;ref name=bookforum/&gt;

The ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine mentioned that the book's "graphic and fast-paced history covers south-of-the-border trafficking from '60s-era shipments of Acapulco Gold to the decapitation-filled headlines wrought by the likes of kingpin (and alleged billionaire) Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán and his rivals, the Zetas—special ops soldiers turned criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Ian|title=Book Review: El Narco|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2011/10/book-review-el-narco-mexican-drug-violence|accessdate=11 May 2012|newspaper=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progressive online magazine known as the ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' reported that the drug war violence in Mexico "seldom makes the front page in the U.S" newspapers.&lt;ref name=salonreview&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=El Narco": The drug war next door|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/11/13/el_narco_the_drug_war_next_door/|accessdate=11 May 2012|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, they stated that many American officials are "worried that the cartels are taking on aspects of an 'insurgency,' which could make them a threat to the Mexican government".&lt;ref name=salonreview/&gt; The ''Salon'' noted that Grillo's book "lays out the history of drug smuggling in the region over the past 100 years or so, and then homes in on the rise of the Northern Mexican cartels during the 2000s".&lt;ref name=salonreview/&gt; Sylvia Longmire, a drug war analyst and author of the book ''Cartel: The Coming Invasion of Mexico's Drug Wars'', said that one rarely comes across a writer like Grillo "who really ''gets'' it".&lt;ref name=longmire&gt;{{cite web|last=Longmire|first=Sylvia|title=BOOK REVIEW: "El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency", by Ioan Grillo|url=http://borderviolenceanalysis.typepad.com/mexicos_drug_war/2011/06/book-review-el-narco-by-ioan-grillo.html|publisher=Mexico's Drug War|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that Grillo also did an incredible job navigating Mexican politics and explaining the role of how the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) "[negotiated] and [played] along with the cartels, and how the transition to real democracy in 2000 dramatically altered that delicate balance".&lt;ref name=longmire/&gt; She also mentioned that Grillo proposes that the start of the Mexican Drug War did not start in 2006—a convenient historical marker because that's when Calderón took office, but rather in 2004 in Nuevo Laredo, where the Sinaloa cartel made [[2012 Nuevo Laredo massacres|incursions]] to fight off Los Zetas.&lt;ref name=longmire/&gt; Malcolm Beith, author of ''The Last Narco: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo, the World's Most Wanted Drug Lord'', said that Grillo is the "most intrepid and knowledgeable foreign journalist covering the [[Mexican Drug War|drug war]] in Mexico today", and in ''El Narco'', the author provides us with more than just a glimpse of Mexico's criminal underworld and its history.&lt;ref name=ioangrillo/&gt; According to Beith, Grillo grants the readers "access to the soul and mind of El Narco, as well as deftly explaining and providing new insight into this hemispheric [[war on drugs]]".&lt;ref name=ioangrillo/&gt; Howard Campbell, professor in Anthropology at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] and author of the book ''Drug War Zone: Frontline Dispatches from the Streets of El Paso and Juarez'', said that Grillo "puts a human face on the violent tragedy caused by U.S. drug demand and Mexican cartel criminality", and strongly recommends ''El Narco'', a "timely and troubling book".&lt;ref name=ioangrillo/&gt;

''[[CNN en Español|CNNMéxico]]'' stated that Grillo has been in "more crime scenes than he can remember", and that his book includes "interviews with hitmen, members of the cartels, politicians and police officers, and people trapped in the crossfire".&lt;ref name=cnnmexico&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news|last=Fantz|first=Ashley|title=Saldo por el combate al narcotráfico: muerte por un negocio millonario|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2012/01/22/saldo-por-el-combate-al-narcotrafico-muerte-por-un-negocio-millonario|accessdate=12 May 2012|publisher=[[CNN en Español|CNNMéxico]]|date=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Spanish-speaking newspaper, Grillo repeatedly comes back to an idea: "Wars start because people cannot feed their families. They start because people feel inferior, without rights, angry and frustrated. They want something bigger in their lives. And you only need a group people with moral depression to convince them that killing and dying spectacularly means glory. Islamic terrorist, kamikaze squads, street gangs, the cartels. They were all children at one time."&lt;ref name=cnnmexico/&gt; [[Goodreads]] said that Grillo did an "incredible job" for his book, where he "synthesized traditional interviews, academic research, pop culture and WikiLeaks to create a powerful and alarming picture of the cartels of Mexico".&lt;ref name=goodreads&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward's Reviews, El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency|url=http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/311642017|publisher=[[Goodreads]]|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also complimented for explaining the "root causes" that threaten Mexican society and "probably have potential to be a disruptive force across the American continent and perhaps globally".&lt;ref name=goodreads/&gt; [[Borderland Beat]] noted that Grillo seems to be "tune with the realities on the ground in Mexico".&lt;ref name=borderlandchivis&gt;{{cite news|title=Chronicle Review: Mexico's Drug War Three Perspectives|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2012/03/chronicle-review-mexicos-drug-war-three.html|accessdate=12 May 2012|publisher=[[Borderland Beat]]|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it mentioned that the author takes the reader into the world of the "[[narcocorridos]]", the drug ballads celebrating the exploits of the drug traffickers; Grillo also explores the "[[Santa Muerte]], the peculiarly Mexican church (or cult, depending on whom you ask), favored by the poor, the delinquent, and the dopers".&lt;ref name=borderlandchivis/&gt; The writer of the article in [[Borderland Beat]] mentioned that although Grillo believes that the Mexican drug cartels are closer to a "criminal insurgency", he cannot buy the appellegation because the cartels do not have an ideology behind what they do, since their goal is making money.&lt;ref name=borderlandchivis/&gt;

===Awards and nominations===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8145">'''Electronic message journaling''' is the process of retaining information relating to electronic messages.  In this context, electronic messages are defined as any type of electronic communication data structure.  Historically this was an [[electronic mail]], but it may also include [[instant messages]], audio messages (such as those in [[VoIP]]), [[text messages]], [[fax|facsimile messages]], or other [[Computer-supported collaboration|user collaboration protocol data structures]]. Beginning about 2005 electronic messages began to include [[social media]] that included [[user-generated content]] such as blogs, discussion forums, posts, chats, tweets, podcasting, pins, digital images, video and audio files. Several implementation variations exist, altering when, what, and how information is retained.&lt;ref name="ibm01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246889.html |title=Upgrading to Lotus Notes and Domino 6 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |author=Tulisalo |date=2002-12-01|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=d357e733-0e22-477c-b884-0c38fbb51533&amp;displaylang=en |title=Journaling with Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-07 |author=Exchange Server Documentation Team |date=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Email archiving|Archival of electronic messages]] has become a concern in modern society as regulations and compliance requirements for businesses have become more prevalent with notable Congressional acts, such as [[Sarbanes Oxley]]. Other compliance areas of concern are those dealing with [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) 17a-4, [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|NASD]] 3010, [[HIPAA]], the [[Privacy laws of the United States|Data Protection Act]], and the [[Patriot Act]].&lt;ref name="microsoft01"/&gt;  Several large corporations lost significant amounts of money because of their failure to meet these compliance requirements.  [[Morgan Stanley]] had a $1.45 billion judgment against them and [[Merrill Lynch]] was issued a $2.5 million fine because of their inability to reproduce e-mail transmissions.  Because of growing concerns of similar repercussions, major corporations are implementing electronic message journaling to meet compliance requirements.&lt;ref name="compliance01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financetech.com/featured/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193004323 |title=Financial Firms Are Struggling to Manage, Archive and Monitor the Exponentially Growing Volume of Corporate E-mail |accessdate=2008-10-08 |author=McDougall |date=2006-09-21|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A [[telecommunication|communication system]] recognizes and identifies any new outgoing or incoming message.  It then creates a journal message containing information extracted from the new outgoing or incoming message.  The journal message is then processed for storage while the new outgoing or incoming message is processed normally.  Then, at a time of [[audit]], reviewers may search and analyze stored journal messages.  E-mail journaling is typically done at the [[mail server]].&lt;ref name="ibm01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft01"/&gt;

==Journal message==
The journal message contains, at a minimum, the following information: a copy of the content of the actual message, any related [[metadata]] such as time, date, and individuals involved in the communication.  More information may be included, such as a physical location of the message originator/recipient(s), a computer identifier of the message originator/recipient(s), or a class/category of message. The journal message should maintain the same transport format as the actual message so that existing communication infrastructure can be utilized. For example, an e-mail journaling message will, itself, be an e-mail message containing the journaling information as either attachments or in the body of the journaling message and may be in the [[MIME]] format.&lt;ref name="ibm01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft01"/&gt;

==Design variations and considerations==
*For [[real-time data|real-time]] journaling, the journal message is sent for further processing at the same time the actual electronic message is being sent.  For periodic journaling, the journal message is stored in a secure, local storage area before being archived at the enterprise level on a periodic basis, typically after business hours.  The processing of journal messages after their creation also varies.  A journal message may be forwarded in real-time directly to an archival and storage system, where any storage system processing may then take over.  Alternatively, a journal message may be forwarded in real-time to a journaling mailbox, and then retrieved from the journaling mailbox with periodic extractions to the archival system, where any archival system processing would then take over.&lt;ref name="microsoft01"/&gt;
*Rule based selective journaling is also well known and in use.  With rule-based selective journaling, electronic messages are only journaled if they pass a specific set of rules created by an administrator, possibly relating to specific senders/recipients, keywords, or subjects of the message.&lt;ref name="ibm01"/&gt;
*When a journaling message uses the same transport format as normal communications, the same infrastructure can be used to transport the journaling message to a preferred destination.  In such cases, journaling messages should contain an identifier indicating they are a journaling message and not a normal communication.  This will prevent journaling loops from occurring when multiple mail servers are in use, as a second mail server might receive the journaling message before it reaches the journaling storage destination.&lt;ref name="microsoft02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=tZibAAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent Application Publication 2006/0075032 A1 |accessdate=2008-06-19 |author=Jain |date=2006-04-06|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between journaling and archiving==
Journaling refers to capturing information about an electronic message while it is in transit.  Which messages and the kind of information that is captured should be defined by a system administrator or compliance agent.  The journaled message should be encrypted and users should not have access to their own journaled message store.&lt;ref name="ibm01"/&gt;  Archiving, on the other hand, is primarily dedicated for backing up communications or removing them from their original location to an off-site location.  Archiving generally does not occur while the electronic message is in transit and users may have access to their own archived messages. The journaling system may, however, be used as a [[interconnection|communication interface]] to the archival system.&lt;ref name="microsoft01"/&gt;

==Implementations==

===Microsoft Exchange===
[[Microsoft]] released a journaling feature in service packs for [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]] 2000 and 2003, during 2004.  Microsoft's journaling feature uses real-time journaling to a journaling mailbox. Their journaling feature uses a rule-based selection to determine whether an e-mail should or should not be journaled.  If any of the sender or recipients, even recipients of an expanded distribution list, have their journaling setting enabled, then the e-mail is journaled.&lt;ref name="microsoft01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft02"/&gt;

===Lotus Domino===
[[IBM]] originally released a journaling feature in [[Lotus Domino]] 6, during 2002.  IBM's journaling feature allows for copying every email as it is processed by the mail server to either a local database at the mail server or a dedicated remote database.  Their journaling feature uses a rule-based selection to determine whether an e-mail should or should not be journaled.  If properties about the e-mail match pre-defined administrator rule settings the e-mail will be journaled.&lt;ref name="ibm01"/&gt;

{{Politics of France}}
A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in France on 24 September 2000.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p674 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals would result in the [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] of the [[President of the French Republic|President]] being reduced from seven years to five years in line with terms in office in other European countries. It was approved by 73.2% of voters, although turnout was just 30.2%.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p687&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the ''[[quinquennat]]'' (five-year term) was to have the legislative election immediately succeed the presidential election (as in 2007, the [[French presidential election, 2007|presidential election took place in April–May 2007]], while the [[French legislative election, 2007|legislative election took place in June]]), thus providing similar electoral results and reducing the risk of a [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]].

==Regulation==

===History===
Until the 1990s, Europe's regulation was less strict than in the United States, one turning point being cited as the export of the United States' first GM-containing soy harvest in 1996. The GM soy made up about 2% of the total harvest at the time, and [[Eurocommerce]] and European food retailers required that it be separated.&lt;ref name="cfr.org"&gt;Lynch D, Vogel D. (2001). [http://www.cfr.org/genetically-modified-organisms/regulation-gmos-europe-united-states-case-study-contemporary-european-regulatory-politics/p8688 ''The Regulation of Gmos in Europe and the United States: A Case-Study of Contemporary European Regulatory Politics.''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the use of [[MON810]], a Bt expressing [[maize]] conferring resistance to the [[European corn borer]], was approved for commercial cultivation in Europe.  Shortly thereafter, the EU enacted a ''[[de facto]]'' moratorium on new approvals of GMOs pending new regulatory laws passed in 2003.

Those new laws provided the [[European Union]] (EU) with possibly the most stringent GMO regulations in the world.&lt;ref name="Davison2010" /&gt; All GMOs, along with [[irradiated food]], are considered "new food" and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science based food evaluation by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA). The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: "safety", "freedom of choice", "labelling" and "traceability".&lt;ref name="gmo-compass.org"&gt;[http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/regulation/regulatory_process/156.european_regulatory_system_genetic_engineering.html GMO Compass: The European Regulatory System.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814025652/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/regulation/regulatory_process/156.european_regulatory_system_genetic_engineering.html |date=14 August 2012 }} Retrieved 28 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reports to the [[European Commission]] (EC), which then drafts a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health; if accepted, it will be adopted by the EC or passed on to the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Agricultural Ministers]]. Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal; if no majority is reached, the proposal is passed back to the EC, which will then adopt the proposal.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wessleler2011"&gt;[[Justus Wesseler|Wesseler]] J. and N.

Wageningen: Wageningen Academic Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are "justifiable reasons" that the variety might cause harm to humans or the environment.

The safeguard clause mentioned above has been applied by many member states in various circumstances, and in April 2011 there were 22 active bans in place across six member states: [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Greece]], and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;''Nature Biotechnology'' "Europe legitimizes GM crop exclusion zones."

And in  recent years, [[France]] and several other European countries banned cultivation of [[Monsanto]]'s MON-810 corn and similar genetically modified food crops.
* In January 2013, Poland's government placed a ban on Monsanto's GM corn, MON 810. It launched a communication campaign with farmers, announcing they will now be strictly monitoring farms for GM corn crops. Poland is the eighth EU member to ban the production of GMOs even though they have been approved by European Food Safety Authority. Europe is not officially against the use of GM crops when it comes to laboratory research, and they are working to regulate the field.&lt;ref name="GMO 2013"&gt;"GMO : POLAND PROMISES STRICT CONTROL ON GM CROPS."

In 2012, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) released a "Scientific opinion addressing the safety assessment of plants developed through cisgenesis and intragenesis" in a response to a request from the European Commission.&lt;ref name=EFSA-Cisgenic&gt;European Food Safety Authority, 2012. Scientific opinion addressing the safety assessment of plants developed through cisgenesis and intragenesis. EFSA Journal 2012;10(2):2561ff [https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2561]&lt;/ref&gt;  The opinion was, that while "the frequency of unintended changes may differ between breeding techniques and their occurrence cannot be predicted and needs to be assessed case by case," "similar hazards can be associated with cisgenic and conventionally bred plants, while novel hazards can be associated with intragenic and transgenic plants."  In other words, [[cisgenic]] approaches, which introduce genes from the same species, should be considered similar in risk to conventional breeding approaches, whilst [[transgenic]] plants can come with new hazards.

In 2014 a panel of experts set up by the UK [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] argued that "A regulatory system based on the characteristics of a novel crop, by whatever method it has been produced, would provide a more effective and robust regulation than current EU processes , which consider new crop varieties differently depending on the method used to produce them." They said that new forms of "genome editing" allow targeting specific sites and making precise changes in the DNA of crops. In the future it would become increasingly difficult if not impossible to tell which method has been used (conventional breeding or genetic engineering) to produce a novel crop. They proposed that existing EU regulatory system should be replaced with a more logical system like that used for new medicines.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;(27 October 2014) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/agriculture/11190795/Europe-must-lift-GM-food-limits-to-help-feed-planet-say-experts.html Europe must lift GM food limits to help feed planet, say experts] The Daily Telegraph, Retrieved 28 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Germany, Poland, France, Scotland and several other member states opted out of cultivating GMO crops in their territory.&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/317136-germany-eu-gmo-ban/|title=GMO-free zone: Germany tells EU it bans genetically modified crops cultivation|year=2015|publisher=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling and traceability===
The regulations concerning the import and sale of GMOs for human and animal consumption grown outside the EU involve providing freedom of choice to the farmers and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
title = Economic impact of unapproved gmos on eu feed imports and livestock production|author1=Directorate-general for agriculture  |author2=rural development |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher =European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/envir/gmo/economic_impactGMOs_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; All food (including [[processed food]]) or [[Compound feed|feed]] which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled. Twice GMOs unapproved by the EC have arrived in the EU and been forced to return to their port of origin.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"/&gt; The first was in 2006 when a shipment of rice from America containing an experimental GMO variety (LLRice601) not meant for commercialisation arrived at [[Rotterdam]]. The second in 2009 when trace amounts of a GMO maize approved in the US were found in a "non-GM" soy flour cargo.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"/&gt;

The [[co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence]] has raised significant concern in many European countries and so EU law also requires that all GM food be traceable to its origin, and that all food with GM content greater than 0.9% be labelled.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;''Europa'' summaries of EU legislation: Traceability and labelling of GMOs. [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/nature_and_biodiversity/l21170_en.htm Link.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to high demand from European consumers for freedom of choice between GM and non-GM foods. EU regulations require measures to avoid mixing of foods and feed produced from GM crops and conventional or organic crops, which can be done via [[Isolation distance for genetically modified plants|isolation distances]] or [[biological containment]] strategies.&lt;ref name = "GMO coexist"&gt;{{cite web|title=New coexistence - Guidelines in the EU: Cultivation bans are now permitted|url=http://www.gmo-safety.eu/news/1205.coexistence-guidelines-cultivation-bans-permitted.html|author=GMO Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coextra.eu|title=Co-Extra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coextra.eu|title=Co-Extra - co-existence and traceabilitiy of GM and non-GM supply chains|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Unlike the US, European countries require labeling of GM food.)  European research programs such as [[Co-Extra]], Transcontainer, and SIGMEA are investigating appropriate tools and rules for [[Traceability of genetically modified organisms|traceability]]. The [[OECD]] has introduced a "unique identifier" which is given to any GMO when it is approved, which must be forwarded at every stage of processing.&lt;ref name="www2.oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.oecd.org/biotech/|title=BioTrack Product Database - Home page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such measures are generally not used in North America because they are very costly and the industry admits of no safety-related reasons to employ them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n2/full/nbt0210-133.html|title=Going to ridiculous lengths—European coexistence regulations for GM crops|first1=Koreen|last1=Ramessar|first2=Teresa|last2=Capell|first3=Richard M.|last3=Twyman|first4=Paul|last4=Christou|date=1 February 2010|publisher=|journal=Nat Biotechnol|volume=28|issue=2|pages=133–136|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/nbt0210-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EC has issued guidelines to allow the [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|co-existence of GM and non-GM crops]] through buffer zones (where no GM crops are grown).&lt;ref name="GMO coexist"/&gt; These are regulated by individual countries and vary from 15 meters in Sweden to 800 meters in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"/&gt; All food (including [[processed food]]) or [[Compound feed|feed]] which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.

===Scope===
In its regulations the [[European Union]] considers [[genetically modified organisms]] only to be food and feed for all intents and practical purposes,&lt;ref name=fact&gt;European Commission [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4778_en.htm Fact Sheet: Questions and Answers on EU's policies on GMOs] Press release Database, 22 April 2015, retrieved 25 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in difference to the definition of [[genetically modified organisms]] which encompasses animals.

===Approach===
The EU uses the [[precautionary principle]] demanding a pre-market authorisation for any GMO to enter the market and a post-market environmental monitoring. Both the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the member states author a [[risk assessment]]. This assessment must show that the food or feed is safe for human and animal health and the environment "under its intended conditions of use".&lt;ref name=fact/&gt;

As of 2010, the EU treats all [[genetically modified crops]] (GMO crops), along with [[irradiated food]] as "new food". They are subject to extensive, case-by-case, science-based food evaluation by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA). This agency reports to the [[European Commission]], which then drafts proposals for granting or refusing authorisation. Each proposal is submitted to the "Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health". If accepted, it is either adopted by the EC or passed on to the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Agricultural Ministers]]. The Council has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal. If no majority is reached, the proposal is passed back to the EC, which then adopts the proposal.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"/&gt;

The EFSA uses independent scientific research to advise the European Commission on how to regulate different foods in order to protect consumers and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/|title=European Food Safety Authority|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For GMOs, the EFSA's risk assessment includes molecular characterization, potential toxicity and potential environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/gmo|title=GMO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each GMO must be reassessed every 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/applications/gmo/faq|title=GMO FAQ|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, applicants who wish to cultivate or process GMOs must provide a detailed surveillance plan for after authorization. This ensures that the EFSA will know if risk to consumers or the environment heightens and that they can then act to lowed the risk or deauthorize the GMO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/gmo/post_authorisation/plans_reports_opinions_en|title=Post Authorization Plans|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Review of authorisation===
[[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] may invoke a safeguard clause to temporarily restrict or prohibit use and/or sale of a GMO crop within their territory if they have justifiable reasons to consider that an approved GMO crop may be a risk to human health or the environment. The EC is obliged to investigate and either overturn the original registrations or ask the country to withdraw its temporary restriction. By 2012, seven countries had submitted safeguard clauses. The EC investigated and rejected those from six countries ("...the scientific evidence currently available did not invalidate the original risk assessments for the products in question...") and one, the UK, withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Safety: From the farm to the fork (What are the National safeguard measures) |author=European Commission |publisher=EUROPA |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/qanda/d1_en.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515092117/http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/qanda/d1_en.htm |archivedate=15 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovenia and the Netherlands wrote a joint paper requesting that individual countries should have the right to decide whether to cultivate GM crops. By the year 2010, the only GMO food crop with approval for cultivation in Europe was [[MON 810]], a Bt expressing maize conferring resistance to the [[European corn borer]] that gained approval in 1998.

In March 2010 a second GMO, a potato called [[Amflora]], was approved for cultivation for industrial applications in the EU by the European Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.basf.com/group/pressrelease/P-10-179 |title=European Commission approves Amflora starch potato |publisher=BASF – BASF – The Chemical Company |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121206040337/http://www.basf.com/group/pressrelease/P-10-179 |archivedate=6 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was grown in Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic that year.&lt;ref name="agripressworld.com"/&gt; Amflora was withdrawn from the EU market in 2012, and in 2013 its approval was annulled by an EU court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-gmo-potato/eu-court-annuls-approval-of-basfs-amflora-gmo-potato-idUSL6N0JS1TH20131213|title=EU court annuls approval of BASF's Amflora GMO potato|date=13 December 2013|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Fearing that [[gene flow]] could occur between related crops, the EC issued new guidelines in 2010 regarding the [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|co-existence of GM and non-GM crops]].&lt;ref name="GMO coexist" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2015}}

Co-existence is regulated by the use of buffer zones and isolation distances between the GM and non-GM crops. The guidelines are not binding and each Member State can implement its own regulations, which has resulted in buffer zones ranging from 15 metres (Sweden) to 800 metres (Luxembourg).&lt;ref name="Davison2010"/&gt; Member States may also designate GM-free zones, effectively allowing them to ban cultivation of GM crops in their territory without invoking a safeguard clause.&lt;ref name = "GMO coexist"/&gt;

==Implementation in the member states==

===Bulgaria===
In October 2015, [[Bulgaria]] announced it has opted out of growing genetically modified crops, effectively banning the cultivation of different types of GMO corn and soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bulgaria opts out of growing genetically modified crops|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/01/bulgaria-gmo-eu-idUSA8N10F01Q20151001|author=Reuters|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
France adopted the EU laws on growing GMOs in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=France adopts disputed EU laws on GMO crop growing|author=Sybille de La Hamaide|date=20 March 2007|newspaper=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL202805920070320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was fined €10 million by the [[European Court of Justice]] for the six-year delay in implementing the laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=France fined over GM law|author=Zoë Casey| date=1 September 2008| url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2008/12/france-fined-over-gm-law-/63338.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In February 2008, the French government used the safeguard clause to ban the cultivation of [[MON 810]] after Senator [[Jean-François Le Grand]], chairman of a committee to evaluate biotechnology, said there were "serious doubts" about the safety of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|agency=AFP |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hyDkekOSZZGL5lcgjIfbHcjp8GLw |title=AFP: French GM ban infuriates farmers, delights environmentalists |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213190207/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hyDkekOSZZGL5lcgjIfbHcjp8GLw |archivedate=13 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve scientists and two economists on the committee accused Le Grand of misrepresenting the report and said they did not have "serious doubts", although questions remained concerning the impact of Bt-maize on health and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maize MON 810: France triggers safeguard clause|author=GMO Compass|url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/319.maize_mon_810_france_triggers_safeguard_clause.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reviewed studies the French government had submitted to back up its claim, and concluded that there was no new evidence to undermine its prior safety findings and considered the decision "scientifically unfounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EFSA: ban on cultivating MON 810 maize in France is unfounded|author=GMO Compass|url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/390.efsa_ban_cultivating_mon810_maize_france_is_unfounded.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Council for Biotechnology]] subcommittee dealing with economic, ethical and social aspects recommended an additional "GMO-free" label for anything containing less than 0.1% GMO which is due to come in late 2010.&lt;ref name="Davison2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=France defines GMO-free labelling threshold|author=Caroline Scott-Thomas|date=30 November 2009|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/France-defines-GMO-free-labelling-threshold}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[European Court of Justice]] and the French [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]] ruled that the French farm ministry ban of MON 810 was illegal, as it failed "to give proof of the existence of a particularly high level of risk for the health and the environment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agrimoney.com/news/french-ban-on-biotech-monsanto-corn-ruled-illegal--3901.html French ban on biotech Monsanto corn ruled illegal] Agrimony UK, 28 November 2011, Retrieved 30 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2015 the French government announced it would effectively continue to ban GMO crops by enacting an "opt-out" provision, previously agreed to for the 28 EU member states in March 2015, by asking the European Commission for France to extend the GMO ban on nine additional strains of maize. The policy announcement was made simultaneously by the French farm and environment ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=France bolsters ban on genetically modified crops|author=Sybille de La Hamaide, Gus Trompiz and Valerie Parent|date=17 September 2015|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/17/us-france-gmo-idUSKCN0RH1BV20150917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In April 2009, German Federal Minister [[Ilse Aigner]] announced an immediate halt to cultivation and marketing of [[MON 810]] maize under the safeguard clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLE16356920090414 |title=Germany to ban cultivation of GMO maize-Minister |author=Thorsten Severin and Michael Hogan|publisher=Reuters |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was based on "expert opinion" that suggested there was reasonable grounds to believe that MON 810 maize presents a danger to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German ban on MON 810 maize: will the courts now decide?|author=GMO compass|url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/stories/433.german_ban_mon810_maize_will_courts_now_decide.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Three French scientists reviewing the scientific evidence used to justify the ban concluding that it did not use a case-by-case approach, confused potential hazards with proven risks and ignored the [[meta-knowledge]] on Bt expressing maize, instead focusing on selected individual studies{{clarify|date=June 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 19 | issue = 1| first = J.

In August 2015 Germany announced to ban genetically modified crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany starts move to ban GMO crops: ministry letter |author=Reuters|date=24 August 2015|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/24/us-grain-germany-gmo-idUSKCN0QT1ID20150824|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===
In September 2015, [[Northern Ireland]] announced a ban on genetically modified crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GM crop-growing banned in Northern Ireland|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34316778|author=BBC|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In 1992, [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland voted]] in favour of the introduction of an article about [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[genetic engineering]] in the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]].&lt;ref name=Perrez2000&gt;Franz Xaver Perrez, "[http://www.ecolomics-international.org/biosa_perrez_taking_consumers_seriously_nyuelj_2000.pdf.pdf Taking consumers seriously: the Swiss regulatory approach to genetically modified food]", ''[[New York University Environmental Law Journal]]'', vol. VIII-3, 2000 (page visited on 1 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franz Xaver Perrez, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9388.2005.00436.x/abstract "GMOs and International Law: The Swiss Example"], ''Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law'', vol. 14-2, pp. 161–172, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, [[Switzerland]] introduced regulations requiring labelling of food containing [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref name="Perrez2000" /&gt; It was one of the first countries to introduce labelling requirements for GMOs.&lt;ref name="Perrez2000" /&gt; In 2003, the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]] adopted the "Federal Act on Non-Human Gene Technology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19996136/index.html Federal Act on Non-Human Gene Technology], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 14 November 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[federal popular initiative]] introducing a moratorium on genetically modified organisms in the [[Economy of Switzerland#Agriculture|Swiss agriculture]] was introduced from 2005 to 2010.&lt;ref name="NRP59"&gt;[http://www.nfp59.ch/e_index.cfm Benefits and risks of the Deliberate Release of Genetically Modified Plants - National Research Program NRP59], [[Swiss National Science Foundation]], 28 August 2012 (page visited on 1 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Swiss parliament]] extended this moratorium to 2013.&lt;ref name="Swissinfo"&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/science_technology/GM_plants_represent_low_risk,_say_scientists.html?cid=33402092 GM plants represent low risk, say scientists], [[Swissinfo]], 28 August 2012 (page visited on 1 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2007 and 2011, the [[Federal Council (Switzerland)|Swiss Government]] funded thirty projects to investigate the risks and benefits of GMOs. These projects concluded that there were no clear health or environmental dangers associated with planting GMOs. However, they also concluded that there was little economic incentive for farmers to adopt GMOs in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Swissinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NRP59" /&gt; The Swiss parliament then extended the moratorium to 2017, and then to 2021.&lt;ref&gt;Magalie Goumaz, [https://www.letemps.ch/sciences/2016/12/06/suisse-restera-ogm-jusquen-2021 "La Suisse restera sans OGM jusqu'en 2021"], ''[[Le temps]]'', published on-line on 6 December 2016 (page visited on 6 December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, six [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] ([[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Canton of Ticino|Ticino]] and [[Canton of Vaud|Vaud]]) have introduced laws against genetically modified organisms in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Goumaz" /&gt; More than one hundred [[Communes of Switzerland|communes]] have declared themselves free of genetically modified organisms.&lt;ref name="Goumaz"&gt;{{fr}} Magalie Goumaz, [http://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/07/22/menace-cantons-ogm "Menace sur les cantons sans OGM"], ''[[Le Temps]]'', Friday 22 July 2016 (page visited on 22 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cantons of Switzerland]] perform tests to [[Detection of genetically modified organisms|assess the presence of genetically modified organisms]] in foodstuffs. In 2008, 3% of the tested samples contained detectable amounts of GMOs.&lt;ref name="Fivaz"&gt;{{fr}} Fabien Fivaz, "OGM en augmentation dans nos assiettes malgré le moratoire", ''Stop OGM infos'', number 53, November 2013 (publication of the Swiss Alliance for Agriculture Without Genetic Engineering, ''Alliance suisse pour une agriculture sans génie génétique'').&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 12.1% of the samples analysed contained detectable amounts of GMOs (including 2.4% of GMOs forbidden in Switzerland).&lt;ref name="Fivaz" /&gt; Except one, all the samples tested contained less than 0.9% of GMOs; which is the threshold that impose labeling indicating the presence of GMOs in food.&lt;ref name="Fivaz" /&gt;

===Scotland===
In August 2015, the Scottish government announced that it would "shortly submit a request that Scotland is excluded from any European consents for the cultivation of GM crops, including the variety of genetically modified maize already approved and six other GM crops that are awaiting authorisation."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150809173847/http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/GM-crop-ban-1bd2.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150809174303/https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/09/us-scotland-gmo-idUSKCN0QE0GQ20150809&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}

The "'''Jewish question'''", also referred to as the "'''Jewish problem'''", was a wide-ranging debate in 19th- and 20th-century [[Europe]]an society pertaining to the appropriate status and treatment of [[Jews]] in society. The debate was similar to other so-called "[[national question]]s" and dealt with the civil, legal, national and political [[Status (law)|status]] of Jews as a minority within society, particularly in Europe in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

The debate started within societies, politicians and writers in [[western Europe|western]] and [[central Europe]] influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the ideals of the [[French Revolution]]. The issues included the legal and economic [[disabilities (Jewish)|Jewish disabilities]] (e.g. [[Jewish quota]]s and [[Jewish ghetto|segregation]]), [[Jewish assimilation]], [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[Jewish Enlightenment]].

The expression has been used by [[antisemitic]] movements from the 1880s onwards, culminating in the [[Nazi terminology|Nazi phrase]] "the [[Final Solution]] to the Jewish Question". Similarly, the expression was used by proponents for and opponents of the establishment of an autonomous [[Jewish homeland]] or a sovereign [[Jewish state]].

==History of "The Jewish question"==
{{Jews}}
{{further|History of the Jews in Europe}}
The term "Jewish question" was first used in Great Britain around 1750 when the expression "Jewish question" appeared during the [[Jew Bill of 1753]] debates in England.&lt;ref name=odk&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Holocaust studies|Holocaust scholar]] [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], the term "Jewish Question," as introduced in [[western Europe]], was a neutral expression for the negative attitude toward the apparent and persistent singularity of the Jews as a people against the background of the rising political nationalisms and new [[nation-state]]s. Dawidowicz writes that "the histories of Jewish emancipation and of European antisemitism are replete with proffered 'solutions to the Jewish question.'"&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Dawidowicz, ''The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945'' (New York, 1975), pp. xxi-xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question was next discussed in France (''la question juive'') after the French Revolution in 1789. It has arrived in Germany in 1843 via Bruno Bauer's treatise ''Die Judenfrage'' ("The Jewish Question"). He argued that Jews can achieve political emancipation only if they let go their religious consciousness as he proposed that political emancipation required a [[secular state]]. In 1898, [[Theodore Herzl]]'s treatise, ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'', advocates [[Zionism]] as a "modern solution for the Jewish question" by creating an independent Jewish state, preferably in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Herzl |first1= Theodor |authorlink1= Theodor Herzl |others= transl.

According to Otto Dov Kulka&lt;ref&gt;As of 2008 Otto Dov Kulka's works are out of print, but the following may be useful and is available on microfilm: ''Reminiscences of Otto Dov Kulka'' (Glen Rock, New Jersey: Microfilming Corp. of America, 1975), {{ISBN|0-88455-598-4}} and 9780884555988, OCLC 5326379.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Hebrew University]], the term became widespread in the nineteenth century when it was used in discussions about [[Jewish emancipation]] in Germany (''Judenfrage'').&lt;ref name=odk /&gt; In the 19th century hundreds of tractates, pamphlets, newspaper articles and books were written on the subject, with many offering solutions including resettlement, deportation and assimilation of the Jewish population. Similarly, hundreds of pieces of literature were written opposing these solutions and have offered solutions such as re-integration and education. This debate however, could not decide whether the problem of the Jewish Question had more to do with the problems posed by the German Jews' opponents or vice versa: the problem posed by the existence of the German Jews to their opponents.

From around 1860 the notion took on an increasingly antisemitic tendency: Jews were described under this title as a stumbling block to the identity and cohesion of the German nation and as enemies within the Germans' own country. Antisemites such as [[Wilhelm Marr]], [[Karl Eugen Dühring]], [[Theodor Fritsch]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Paul de Lagarde]] and others declared it a racial problem unsolvable through integration, in order to make their demands for the "de-jewifying" of the press, education, culture, state and economy, plausible, along with their demands for the condemnation of inter-marriage between Jews and non-Jews. They also used this definition to oust the Jews out of their supposedly socially dominant positions.

By far the most infamous use of this expression was by the [[Nazi]]s in the early- and mid- twentieth century, culminating in the implementation of their "[[Final Solution]] to the Jewish question" during [[World War II]].&lt;!-- The following ref is used here to establish the meaning of Judenfrage, but is reused later. --&gt;&lt;ref name=ah&gt;{{Cite web

==Bruno Bauer – ''The Jewish Question''==
In his book ''[[The Jewish Question]]'', published in 1843, [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] argued that Jews can achieve political emancipation only if they relinquish their particular religious consciousness, since political emancipation requires a [[secular state]], which he assumes does not leave any "space" for social identities such as [[religion]]. According to Bauer, such religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the "[[Rights of Man]]." True political emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion.

==Karl Marx – ''On the Jewish Question''==
[[Karl Marx]] replied to Bauer in his 1844 essay ''[[On the Jewish Question]]''. Marx contradicted Bauer's view that the nature of the Jewish religion prevented Judaism's assimilation. Instead he focused on the specific social and economic role of the Jewish group in Europe which, according to him, was lost when capitalism, the material basis for Judaism, assimilated the European societies as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/index.htm |title=On the Jewish Question |accessdate=2008-03-25 |author=Karl Marx |authorlink=Karl Marx |date=February 1844 |work=Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx uses Bauer's essay as an occasion for his own analysis of liberal rights. Marx argues that Bauer is mistaken in his assumption that in a "[[secular state]]", religion will no longer play a prominent role in social life, and, as an example refers to the pervasiveness of religion in the [[United States]], which, unlike Prussia, had no [[state religion]]. In Marx's analysis, the "secular state" is not opposed to religion, but rather actually requires it. The removal of religious or property qualifications for citizens does not mean the abolition of religion or property, but only introduces a way of regarding individuals in abstraction from them.&lt;ref name="Marx"&gt;Marx 1844:{{Block quote|[T]he political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it. The state abolishes, in its own way, distinctions of birth, social rank, education, occupation, when it declares that birth, social rank, education, occupation, are non-political distinctions, when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of the nation is an equal participant in national sovereignty, when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. Nevertheless, the state allows private property, education, occupation, to act in their way – i.e., as private property, as education, as occupation, and to exert the influence of their special nature. Far from abolishing these real distinctions, the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence; it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On this note Marx moves beyond the question of religious freedom to his real concern with Bauer's analysis of "political emancipation." Marx concludes that while individuals can be 'spiritually' and 'politically' free in a secular state, they can still be bound to material constraints on freedom by economic inequality, an assumption that would later form the basis of his critiques of [[capitalism]].

Between 1880 and 1920, millions of other Jews sought their own solution for the [[pogroms]] of eastern Europe by emigration to other places, such as the [[United States]] and western Europe.

==The Final Solution==
In [[Nazi Germany]], the term ''Jewish Question'' (in {{lang-de|Judenfrage}}) referred to the sense that the existence of Jews in Germany posed a problem for the state. In 1933 two Nazi theorists, [[Johann von Leers]] and [[Achim Gercke]], both proposed that the Jewish Question could be solved by [[Madagascar plan|resettling Jews in Madagascar]] or elsewhere in Africa or South America. Both intellectuals discussed the pros and cons of supporting the German Zionists as well, but von Leers asserted that establishing a Jewish homeland in British Palestine would create humanitarian and political problems for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Propaganda ===
[[Nazi propaganda]] was produced to manipulate the public, most notably based on writings from people such as [[Eugen Fischer]], [[Fritz Lenz]] and [[Erwin Baur]] in ''Foundations of Human Heredity Teaching and Racial Hygiene''. The work {{lang|de|Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens}} (''Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Living'') by [[Karl Binding]] and [[Alfred Hoche]] and the pseudo-scholarship created by [[Gerhard Kittel]] also played a role. In occupied France, the collaborationist regime established its own [[Institut d'étude des questions juives|Institute for studying the Jewish Questions]].

== Contemporary use ==

Based on this conspiracy theory certain groups and activists discuss the "Jewish Question" and propose to "address" it.

'''John Austin''' (3 March 1790 – 1 December 1859) was a noted English legal theorist who strongly influenced British and American law with his analytical approach to jurisprudence and his theory of [[legal positivism]]. In opposing traditional "[[natural law]]" approaches, Austin argued against any necessary connections between law and morality. Human legal systems, he claimed, can and should be studied in an empirical, value-free way.

==Life and work==
Austin was born on 3 March 1790 at [[Creeting St Mary]], the eldest son of a well-to-do [[Suffolk]] miller.

After spending five years in the army during the Napoleonic Wars, Austin turned to law and spent seven unhappy years practising at the Chancery bar. In 1819, Austin married Sarah Taylor and became neighbours and close friends with [[Jeremy Bentham]] and James and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Mainly through Bentham's influence, Austin was appointed professor of jurisprudence at the newly founded [[University of London]] in 1826. Austin's lectures were not well-attended, and he resigned his university post in 1834.

Thereafter, aside from two stints on government commissions, Austin lived largely on his wife's earnings as a writer and translator. Plagued by ill health, depression and self-doubt, Austin wrote little after the publication of his major work, ''[[The Province of Jurisprudence Determined]]'' (1832). This work was largely ignored during Austin's lifetime. It became influential only after his death when his wife, [[Sarah Austin (translator)|Sarah Austin]], published a second edition in 1861. A second book, ''Lectures on Jurisprudence'', was put together by Sarah from Austin's notes and published in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, H. L. A., "Introduction," in John Austin, ''The Province of Jurisprudence Determined'', H. L. A. Hart (ed.), New York: The Noonday Press, 1954, pp. vii-ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Austin died on 1 December 1859 in [[Weybridge]]. His only daughter, [[Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon|Lucie]], later became Lady Duff-Gordon.

==Legal positivism==
Austin’s goal was to transform law into a true science. To do this, he believed it was necessary to purge human law of all moralistic notions and to define key legal concepts in strictly empirical terms. Law, according to Austin, is a social fact and reflects relations of power and obedience. This twofold view, that (1) law and morality are separate and (2) that all human-made ("positive") laws can be traced back to human lawmakers, is known as legal positivism. Drawing heavily on the thought of Jeremy Bentham, Austin was the first legal thinker to work out a fully developed positivistic theory of law.

Austin argues that laws are rules, which he defines as a type of command. More precisely, laws are general commands issued by a sovereign to members of an independent political society, and backed up by credible threats of punishment or other adverse consequences ("sanctions") in the event of non-compliance. The sovereign in any legal system is that person, or group of persons, habitually obeyed by the bulk of the population, which does not habitually obey anyone else. A command is a declared wish that something should be done, issued by a superior, and accompanied by threats in the event of non-compliance. Such commands give rise to legal duties to obey. Note that all the key concepts in this account (law, sovereign, command, sanction, duty) are defined in terms of empirically verifiable social facts. No moral judgment, according to Austin, is ever necessary to determine what the law is — though of course morality must be consulted in determining what the law should be. As a utilitarian, Austin believed that laws should promote the greatest happiness of society.

==Criticism==
Though Austin's brand of legal positivism was greatly influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Morison, W. L., ''John Austin''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1982, pp. 148–77.&lt;/ref&gt; it is widely seen as overly simplistic today.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Andrew, ''Arguing about Law: An Introduction to Legal Philosophy'', 2nd ed., Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2001, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as [[H. L. A. Hart]] have charged that Austin's account fails to recognize that:
(1) In many modern societies,  lawmaking power is dispersed and it is very difficult to identify a "sovereign" in Austin’s sense.
(2) Most legal systems include rules that don’t  impose sanctions, but empower officials or citizens to do certain things (e.g., to make wills), or specify ways that legal rules may be identified or changed.
(3)  Those threats do not give rise to obligations. If they did, there would be no essential difference between a gunman's threat ("Your money or your life") and an ordinary piece of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, H. L. A., "Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morality." ''Harvard Law Review'', 71: 593–629 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

This is prohibited under several sections of the [[United States Code]]. Mayo filed ''[[in forma pauperis]]''—that is, he asserted that he would not be able to afford the costs associated with his lawsuit and that they therefore should be waived.

{{Family law}}
A '''legal guardian'''  is a person who has the legal authority (and the corresponding [[duty]]) to care for the personal and [[property]] interests of another person, called a [[ward (law)|ward]].&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Guardianship|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/guardianship.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guardians are typically used in three situations:  guardianship for an incapacitated senior (due to old age or infirmity), guardianship for a minor, and guardianship for developmentally disabled adults.

== Guardianship for incapacitated seniors ==
A guardianship for an incapacitated senior will typically arise where someone determines that a senior has become unable to care for their own person and/or property. In some cases, there may be a belief that the senior is being financially exploited or about to be exploited.  In other cases, the person may be unable to care for him or herself and is not able to properly engage in the activities of daily living without assistance. There will typically be a precipitating incident that causes a professional, family member, health care worker or clergyman to initiate guardianship proceedings.

In most states, the process will start with a determination whether the alleged incapacitated person is actually incapacitated. There will often be an evidentiary hearing.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt; Only if a finding of incapacity is made will the next step take place: whether a guardian is necessary and to what extent (e.g. a guardian may be needed for the person's finances but not for the person) and, if so, who the guardian should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardianship—Acting for Adults Who Become Disabled|url=https://www.michbar.org/public_resources/probate_guardianship|website=State Bar of Michigan|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The determination of whether a guardianship is necessary may consider a number of factors, including whether there is a lesser restrictive alternative, such as the use of an already existing [[power of attorney]] and [[health care proxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternatives to Guardianship  and Conservatorship  for Adults   in Iowa|url=http://supporteddecisionmaking.org/sites/default/files/iowa_alternatives_guardianship_conservatorship_0.pdf|website=National Resource Center for Supported Decision-Making|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a guardianship dispute can become quite contentious, and can result in litigation between a parent and adult children or between different siblings against each other in what is essentially a pre-probate dispute over a parent's wealth.  Stopping the guardianship is often pursued in such cases as well.

=== Abuses ===
A report published in 2010 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office looked at 20 selected closed cases in which guardians stole or otherwise improperly obtained assets from clients.  In 6 of these 20 cases, the courts failed to adequately screen guardians ahead of time and appointed individuals with criminal convictions or significant financial problems, and in 12 of 20 cases, the courts failed to oversee guardians once they had been appointed.&lt;ref name="Guardianships: Cases of Financial Exploitation, Neglect, and Abuse of Seniors, Highlights, U.S. GAO, 2010"&gt;[https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-1046 Guardianships: Cases of Financial Exploitation, Neglect, and Abuse of Seniors], Highlights, U.S. Government Accountability Office, Published: Sep 30, 2010. Publicly Released: Oct 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters column, Oct. 20, 2017"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-seniors/column-with-u-s-elder-abuse-in-spotlight-a-look-at-guardians-idUSKBN1CP154 Column: With U.S. elder abuse in spotlight, a look at guardians], ''Reuters'', Mark Miller, Oct. 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In October 2017, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published an article looking at the situation in [[Nevada]] in which professional guardians sometimes have a number of clients, and argued toward the conclusion that in a number of cases the courts did not properly oversee these arrangements.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker, How the Elderly Lose Their Rights, Oct. 9, 2017"&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/09/how-the-elderly-lose-their-rights HOW THE ELDERLY LOSE THEIR RIGHTS, Guardians can sell the assets and control the lives of senior citizens without their consent—and reap a profit from it], ''The New Yorker'', Rachel Aviv, Oct. 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the investigative [[Documentary film|documentary]] "The Guardians" was published, alleging "legal kidnapping of elderly people" in Nevada by private guardianship businesses with no familiar relations, seeking to economically profit from seniors' savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardiansdocumentary.com/|title=The Guardians|last=|first=|date=|website=guardiansdocumentary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guardianship for minors ==
===Natural guardian===
A minor child's parent is the child's natural guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardianship of children|url=http://communitylaw.org.nz/community-law-manual/chapter-26-parents-guardians-and-caregivers/guardianship-of-children-chapter-26/|website=Community Law|publisher=Community Law Centres o Aotearoa|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal guardian===
Most countries and states have laws that provide that the [[parent]]s of a [[minor (law)|minor]] child are the legal guardians of that child, and that the parents may designate who shall become the child's legal guardian in the event of death, typically subject to the approval of the court. Where a minor child's parents are disabled or deceased, it may be necessary for a court to appoint a guardian.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

== Guardianship for developmentally disabled adults ==
Legal guardians may be appointed in guardianship cases for [[adult]]s (see also [[conservatorship]]). For example, parents may start a guardianship action to become the guardians of a developmentally-disabled child when the child reaches the [[age of majority]].

== Rules applicable to all guardians ==
[[Court]]s generally have the power to appoint a guardian for an individual in need of special protection. A guardian with responsibility for both the personal well-being and the financial interests of the ward is a ''general guardian''. A person may also be appointed as a ''special guardian'', having limited powers over the interests of the ward. A special guardian may, for example, be given the legal right to determine the disposition of the ward's property without being given any authority over the ward's person.
 
Depending on the jurisdiction, a legal guardian may be called a "[[conservator (law)|conservator]]", "custodian", or curator.  Many jurisdictions and the [[Uniform Probate Code]] distinguish between a "guardian" or "guardian of the person" who is an individual with authority over and fiduciary responsibilities for the physical person of the ward, and a "conservator" or "guardian of the property" of a ward who has authority over and fiduciary responsibilities for significant property (often an inheritance or personal injury settlement) belonging to the ward. Some jurisdictions provide for public guardianship programs serving incapacitated adults or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txcourts.gov/gcb/pdf/localguardianshipprograms.pdf |title=Local Guardianship Programs |publisher=txcourts.gov |accessdate=2014-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193826/http://www.txcourts.gov/gcb/pdf/localguardianshipprograms.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A guardian is a [[fiduciary]] and is held to a very high standard of care in exercising his or her powers. If the ward owns substantial property the guardian may be required to give a [[surety bond]] to protect the ward in the event that dishonesty or incompetence on his or her part causes financial loss to the ward.

===United States===

===Family law and dependency courts===
Guardians ''[[ad litem]]'' (GALs) are not the same as "legal guardians" and are often appointed in under-age-children cases, many times to represent the interests of the [[Minor (law)|minor children]]. Guardians ''ad litem'' may be called, in some U.S. states, [[Court Appointed Special Advocates]] (CASA). In New York State, they are known as Attorneys for the Child (AFCs). They are the voice of the child and may represent the child in court, with many judges adhering to any recommendation given by a GAL. GALs may assist where a child is removed from a hostile environment and custody given to the relevant state or county family services agency, and in those cases assists in the protection of the minor child.

Qualifications vary by [[United States|state]], ranging from no experience or qualification, [[Volunteering|volunteers]] to [[social worker]]s to [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to others. The GAL's only job is to represent the minor children's best interest and advise the court. A guardian ''ad litem'' is an officer of the court, does not represent the parties in the suit, and often enjoys quasi-judicial immunity from any action from the parties involved in a particular case.  Training, qualifications and supervision vary from state-to-state, which means that their quality is similarly variable.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In, for instance, North Carolina, an applicant (volunteer) must go through a background check and complete 30 hours of training.

Although a guardian ''ad litem'' working through a CASA program volunteers their services, some guardians ''ad litem'' are paid for their services.  They must submit detailed time and expense reports to the court for approval.  Their fees are taxed as costs in the case.  Courts may order all parties to share in the cost, or the court may order a particular party to pay the fees.

Guardians ''ad litem'' are also appointed in cases where there has been an allegation of [[child abuse]], [[child neglect]], [[Person In Need of Supervision|PINS]], [[juvenile delinquency]], or dependency. In these situations, the guardian ''ad litem'' is charged to represent the best interests of the minor child, which can differ from the position of the state or government agency as well as the interest of the parent or guardian. These guardians ''ad litem'' vary by [[jurisdiction]] and can be volunteer [[advocate]]s or attorneys. For example, in North Carolina, trained GAL volunteers are paired with attorney advocates to advocate for the best interest of abused and neglected children. The program defines a child's best interest as a safe, permanent home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAL Volunteers|url=http://www.nccourts.org/Citizens/GAL/Volunteers.asp|website=North Carolina Court System|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health and probate courts===
Guardians ''ad litem'' can be appointed by the court to represent the interests of mentally ill or disabled persons. For example, the [[Code of Virginia]] requires that the court appoint a "discreet and competent attorney-at-law" or "some other discreet and proper person" to serve as guardian ''ad litem'' to protect the interests of a person under a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEO: Conflict; Appearance of Impropriety, LE Op. 1725 (1999)|url=http://www.vsb.org/profguides/FAQ_leos/LEO1725.html|website=Virginia State Bar|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=20 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estates and financial decision making==
Guardians ''ad litem'' are sometimes appointed in probate matters to represent the interests of unknown or unlocated heirs to an estate.

==Settlement guardians ''ad litem''==
When a settlement is reached in personal injury or medical malpractice case involving claims brought on behalf of a minor or incapacitated plaintiff, courts normally appoint a guardian ''ad litem'' to review the terms of the settlement and ensure it is fair and in the best interests of the claimant. The settlement guardian ''ad litem'' thoroughly investigates the case, to determine whether the settlement amount is fair and reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidson|first1=Mark|title=Role of the Ad Litem in Personal Injury Litigation|url=http://jwclientservices.jw.com/sites/scac/Document%20Library2/1/Role%20of%20the%20Ad%20Litem%20in%20Personal%20Injury%20Litigation%20by%20The%20Honorable%20Mark%20Davidson,%20Judge%2011th%20District%20Court.pdf|website=Jackson Walker|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=6 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Situation in other countries ==

=== England and Wales ===
Guardians ''ad litem'' are employed by [[Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service| Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS)]], a [[non-departmental public body]], to represent the interests of children in cases where the child's wishes differ from those of either parent, known as a Section 9.5 case. The posts are filled by senior social workers with experience in family law proceedings.

In 2006, a legal status of "special guardianship" was introduced (using powers delegated by the [[Adoption and Children Act 2002]]) to allow for a child to be cared for by a person with rights similar to a traditional legal guardian, but without absolute legal separation from the child's birth parents.&lt;ref name="StandleyDavies2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kate Standley|author2=Paula Davies|title=Family Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwytCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA445|date=28 June 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1-137-03770-1|page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not to be confused with court-appointed special guardians in other jurisdictions.

=== Germany ===
The German guardianship law with regard to adults was completely changed in 1990. Guardianship (''Vormundschaft'') of an adult was renamed 'curatorship' (''Betreuung''), although it remains ''Vormundschaft'' for minors. When a person of full age who, as a result of [[Mental disorder|mental disease]] or physical, mental or psychological handicap is incapable of managing his own affairs, a guardian (Betreuer) can be appointed (section 1896, [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]]). An adult guardian is responsible for personal and estate matters, as well as for medical treatment. However, the ward has not normally full capacity with all human rights such as those to marry, vote or make a will. The ward's legal capacity can be lost as a result of a court judgment or order (section 1903, German Civ. C.; ''Einwilligungsvorbehalt''). Every guardian has to report annually to the guardianship court (''Betreuungsgericht''). Professional guardians (Berufsbetreuer) normally hold university degrees in law or social work.

=== Republic of Ireland ===
The court-appointed guardian system in the Republic of Ireland was brought into law on the proposal of the noted gay activist and member of [[Seanad Éireann]] (the Irish Senate),  [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]]. The Children Acts Advisory Board which was set up to advise the ministers of the government on policy development under the Child Care Act 1991 was then abolished in September 2011. Judges are responsible for appointing child guardians and can choose guardians from Barnardo's a children's charitable service or from among the self-employed guardians, who are mostly former social workers who have gone into private business since the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children Acts Advisory Board|url=http://www.caab.ie/|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnardos|url=https://www.barnardos.ie/|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
{{main|Women's rights in Saudi Arabia#Male guardians}}

All women in Saudi Arabia are required to have a male guardian ([[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Wali]]) to give permission for various government and economic transactions, as well as some personal life and health decisions.

=== Sweden ===
The [[Sweden|Swedish]] parental law (''Föräldrabalken'') regulates legal guardianship for both children and disabled adults. Legal guardianship for [[unaccompanied minor]]s is regulated by a law of its own. Except for normal partenhood, the guardianship is assigned by the [[Tingsrätt|district court]] and supervised by the [[Överförmyndare]], a municipal authority that is mandatory in every Swedish municipality. What is included in the field of guardianship is decided by the district court. The responsibility for [[health care]] and [[nursing]] is never included in the guardianship for adults, but is always so for minors. The guardianship for adults can take two legal forms, "god man" or "förvaltare". The main difference between these two is that a "förvaltare" has the sole permission to take legal actions within the field of the guardinship. A guardianship can have different legal forms for different parts of the guardianship. Such things as [[European Convention on Human Rights|basic human rights]] is never denied the ward by this law, but some of them can be denied by other laws. A "god man" is normally assigned with the approval of the ward. But if the physical conditions of the ward does not permit him to give such approval, a god man can be assigned anyhow. Everything a god man does for his ward have to be approved by him, or can be assumed to be approved by him. For more complex situations, like taking loans or selling of a house, he or she needs approval from the local authorities. Once a year a legally assigned guardian have to send his [[accounting]] to the Överförmyndare for review. 

Since the year 2017, the ward can, while she still have her mental abilities, write a special [[letter of attorney|future letter of attorney]] (''Framtidsfullmakt'') which later can be used when she loses her abilities. How such a letter should be written is described in detail in the paternal law, and normally follows the principles of a [[Will and testament|will]]. This law was created since it in Sweden is unclear if a normal letter of attorney is valid after the ward has lost her abilities.&lt;ref name="Wallgren"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wallgren|first= Jan|date= 2017|title= Gode mannens abc: handbok för gode män och förvaltare|url= |location= |publisher= Wolters Kluwer|page= |isbn= 978-91-39-11593-9|author-link= |language= sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Marquette Law Review''''' is a quarterly [[law review]] edited by students at [[Marquette University Law School]]. The review is ranked 56th among general US student-edited journals for citations by courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ Washington &amp; Lee Law Library Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt; Articles, essays, and student-written notes and comments from the review are accessible in PDF format on its web site, as well as online through [[LexisNexis]], [[Westlaw]], and [[HeinOnline]].

==Mission==
The review was established in 1916 as a way for the law school to "make known its ideals and communicate its spirit."&lt;ref&gt;W.A. Hayes, ''Foreword,'' 1 Marq. L. Rev. 5, 5 (1916)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the eighth-oldest law review in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://epublications.marquette.edu/mulr/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, the review has been dedicated to "the publication of not only theoretical articles of the law, but articles of real practical aid to the practitioner."&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''History of the Marquette Law School,'' 8 Marq. L. Rev. 298, 302 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; It has placed particular emphasis on legal issues in Wisconsin, which led former [[Wisconsin Supreme Court|Wisconsin Chief Justice]] [[George R. Currie]] to "express on behalf of the members of our court appreciation to a Law Review from which we have so greatly benefited in performing our judicial labors."&lt;ref&gt;George R. Currie, ''The Marquette Law Review-A Tribute,'' 50 Marq. L. Rev. 569, 570 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
The review is produced by a staff of 50 student editors and members. Membership invitations are extended to students in the top ten percent of the 1L class. Alternatively, students may join the review by selection in a write-on competition held each summer. The [[editor-in-chief]] of Volume 100 is Sara C. McNamara.

== Technical details ==

{{Multiple issues|section=yes|{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}}}
Pirate Pay works with [[Hash function|info-hashes]] of content in worldwide [[Peer-to-peer]] network. It does not remove links and deals without interaction with torrent sites, link aggregators and [[search engines]]. Protection of content from illegal distribution can be started with only the title. Thousands of code strings operate without human intervention to detect the required title name in [[file sharing]] swarms. It is directly placed on protection and executes all necessary actions to prevent content downloading by leeches and uploading by seeders. Pirate Pay operates with the technology of first uploader search in the swarm, finding the first infringer for offline legal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/piratepay/pirate-pay-presentation |title=Pirate Pay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''Primate experiments at Columbia University''' came to public attention in October 2003, when [[CNN]] reported that a university [[veterinarian]] had approached its [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] about experiments being carried out there on baboons.&lt;ref name=CNNOct12&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/10/12/columbia.animals.ap Columbia in animal cruelty dispute"], CNN, October 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The veterinarian complained about experiments being conducted by an assistant professor of neurology and neurosurgery, E. Sander Connolly, who was causing strokes in baboons by carefully removing their left [[eyeball]]s and using the empty [[eye socket]]s to reach a critical [[blood vessel]] to their brains, known as the internal carotid artery. A clamp temporarily was placed on this blood vessel until the stroke was induced, after which Connolly would test  a potential neuroprotective drug.&lt;ref name=Huang00&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Huang J, Mocco J, Choudhri TF, etal |title=A modified transorbital baboon model of reperfused stroke |journal=Stroke |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=3054–63 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11108772 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11108772 |doi=10.1161/01.str.31.12.3054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connolly developed this methodology to make more consistent stroke infarcts in primates, which would improve the detection of differences in stroke treatment groups, and  "provide important information not obtainable in rodent models.".&lt;ref name=Huang00/&gt; Of note, a more extensive version of this operation, known as an orbitozygomatic osteotomy, is also performed in humans for treatment of certain brain tumors and vascular malformations. It does not result in blindness or permanent removal of the eye. It is done because it is deemed safer way to access the bottom portions of the brain rather than going through the brain.

In a letter to the National Institutes of Health, [[PETA]] described one experiment: "On September 19, 2001, baboon B777's left eye was removed, and a stroke was induced. The next morning, it was noted that the animal could not sit up, that he was leaning over, and that he could not eat. That evening, the baboon was still slouched over and was offered food but couldn't chew. On September 21, 2001, the record shows that the baboon was 'awake, but no movement, can't eat (chew), vomited in the a.m.' With no further notation about consulting with a veterinarian, the record reads, 'At 1:30 p.m. the animal died in the cage.'" {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
__TOC__

==Reaction==
In a letter to [[PETA]], [[Neurology|neurologist]] Robert S. Hoffman stated that he regards such experiments to be a "blind alley," and that the baboons are "kept alive for either three or ten days after experiencing a major stroke and in a condition of profound disability. This is obviously as terrifying for animals as it is for humans unless one believes that animals are incapable of terror or other emotional distress" {{cite web|url= |title=[http://www.columbiacruelty.com/letters/hoffman.pdf] }}[https://web.archive.org/web/20061107011142/http://www.columbiacruelty.com/letters/hoffman.pdf]&amp;nbsp;{{small|(10.5&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}. According to the published stroke model by Connolly, animals are given a stroke and maintained on anesthesia and analgesia for 12–18 hours. Then, when anesthesia is removed, animals that are not self-caring are euthanized. All other animals may be kept alive for three days, in accordance with established ethical guidelines. Then, if animals are not self-caring, they are euthanized. Animals that are self-caring at 72 hours may be kept alive for up to 10 days.&lt;ref name=Huang00/&gt;

A USDA investigation of the Columbia baboons found "no indication that the experiments...violated federal guidelines." Further, the Dean of Research at Columbia's School of Medicine noted that Connolly stopped the experiments because of threats from animal rights activists, despite the fact that Connolly "remained convinced that his experiments were humane and potentially valuable."&lt;ref name=CNNOct12/&gt;

{{Politics of Haiti}}
The '''Provisional Electoral Council''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Conseil Electoral Provisoire'', {{IPA-fr|kɔ̃sɛj əlɛktɔʁal pʁɔvizwaʁ}}, '''CEP'''; [[Haitian Creole]]: ''Konsey Elektoral Pwovizwa'') is the [[Election management body|electoral commission]] of Haiti.  The body is the sole agency responsible for [[Elections in Haiti|presidential elections]] and [[Elections in Haiti|parliamentary elections]]. As of 2015, CEP remains Haiti's main and only legal election agency. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cephaiti.ht/Mission.html |title=Mission |language=French |publisher=CEP Haiti |accessdate=2015-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandate==
As the sole legal electoral body in Haiti, CEP's responsibilities includes the following: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cephaiti.ht/Constitution.html |title=Constitution |language=French |trans-title=Constitution |publisher=CEP Haiti |accessdate=2015-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ensuring confidence building among key actors involved in the electoral process;
* Establish the balance between the various political players in the race, hence the role of arbiter.   
* Organize and supervise elections.
* Enforce the election legislation throughout the national territory.
* Ensure elections are held freely, credibly and transparently. 
* Intervening in the mobilization and coordination of activities related to electoral information.
* Provide input in developing the legal framework for the electoral process.

==Criticism==
More than 30 presidential candidates reproached CEP for its obscure scrutiny policies and censured CEP for its lack of transparency. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sentinel.ht/2015/12/02/calls-transparency-joined-30-presidential-candidates/ |title=Calls for transparency joined by 30 more presidential candidates |work=Haitian Sentinel |date=2015-12-01 |accessdate=2015-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Haitian Sentinel, CEP rejected transparency request by some presidential candidates including [[Jude Célestin]], runoff candidate for the 2015 election. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maxime |first=Samuel |url=http://sentinel.ht/2015/11/17/electoral-council-denies-transparency-request/ |title=Electoral Council rejects transparency request |work=Haitian Sentinel |location=Miami |date=2015-11-17 |accessdate=2015-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public Counsel''' is the largest ''pro bono'' public interest law firm in the world. Founded in 1970 by the Beverly Hills Bar Association, Public Counsel delivers free legal and social services to abused and abandoned children, homeless families and veterans, senior citizens, victims of consumer fraud, and nonprofit organizations serving low-income communities. Initially called the Beverly Hills Bar Association Law Foundation, it was the first bar-sponsored public interest law firm in the country.

The substantive areas in which Public Counsel works includes: [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/center_for_veterans_advancement Veterans Advocacy], [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/appellate_law Appellate Law &amp; Federal Pro Se], [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/community_development Community Development], [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/early_childhood_care_and_education Early Care and Education Law], [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/homelessness_prevention Homelessness Prevention Law], [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/childrens_rights Children's Rights] (including Adoptions and [http://www.publiccounsel.org/pages/?id=0075 Guardianships]), [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/consumer_law Consumer Law] (including [http://www.publiccounsel.org/publications?id=0159 Bankruptcy]), [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/immigrant_rights Immigrants' Rights], and [http://www.publiccounsel.org/practice_areas/opportunity_under_law Opportunity Under Law].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publiccounsel.org/about_us?id=0005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the Los Angeles County Bar Association joined the Beverly Hills Bar Association as a sponsor of the Law Foundation. This joint endeavor resulted not only in a name change to Public Counsel, but also in an expansion of the organization's purposes and goals. Direct involvement in public interest litigation was coupled with a mandate to mobilize and coordinate pro bono efforts of the Los Angeles legal community to serve the poor.

It is the public interest law office of the Los Angeles County and Beverly Hills Bar Associations and the Southern California affiliate of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Its full-time staff of 110 (including 62 staff attorneys in four offices), along with over 5,000 volunteer lawyers, law students, and legal professionals, assists over 30,000 children, youth, families, and community organizations every year.

Recovery for '''pure economic loss in English law''', arising from [[negligence]], has traditionally been limited. Notably, recovery for losses that are "purely economic" arise under the [[Fatal Accidents Act 1976]]; and for negligent misstatements, as stated in ''[[Hedley Byrne v. Heller]]''. Economic loss generally refers to financial detriment that can be seen on a balance sheet but not physically. Economic loss is then divided into "consequential economic loss" - that which arises directly from some physical damage or injury (e.g. loss of earnings from having your arm cut off) and "pure economic loss", which is everything else.

The fear behind allowing claims for "pure economic loss" is that potentially [[floodgates principle|unlimited claims could flood in]]. The risks may be unknowable, and parties would find it impossible to [[insurance|insure]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canadian National Railway Co. v. Norsk Pacific Steamship Co.]]'' [1992] 1 SCR 1021 (Canada), ''per'' McLachlan J&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishop (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[judge]] [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] famously described it as, "liability in an indeterminate amount, for an indeterminate time, to an indeterminate class".&lt;ref&gt;''Ultramares v. Touche'' 174 N.E 441, 444 (N.Y. 1931) (USA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of '''pure economic loss''' include:
*Loss of income suffered by a family whose principal earner dies in an accident. The physical injury is caused to the deceased, not the family.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1808/J92.html Baker v. Bolton]'' (1808) 1 Camp 493 (England and Wales)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loss of market value of a property owing to the inadequate specifications of foundations by an [[architect]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/2.html Murphy v. Brentwood District Council]'' [1991] 1 AC 398 (England and Wales)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sutherland Shire Council v. Heyman'' (1985) 60 ALR 1, at 60-61 (Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No.36 v. Bird Construction Co.'' [1995] 1 SCR 85 (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loss of production suffered by an enterprise whose electricity supply is interrupted by a contractor excavating a public utility.

The latter case is exemplified by the case of ''[[Spartan Steel and Alloys Ltd v. Martin &amp; Co. Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1973] QB 27&lt;/ref&gt; Similar losses are also restricted in [[German law]]&lt;ref&gt;van Gerven (2001) ''pp''187-188&lt;/ref&gt; though not in [[French law]].&lt;ref&gt;van Gerven (2001) ''pp''198-199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex structure theory==
{{main|Complex structure theory in English law}}
The Complex structure theory is an argument which has been put forward in pure economic loss cases which suggests that a large chattel may be considered to consist of several parts and so damage to other "property" for the purpose of applying Donoghue v Stevenson principles.  This theory as a normative doctrine has been rejected by Lord Bridge in Murphy v Brentwood.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy Respondent v Brentwood District Council Appellants [1990] 3 W.L.R. 414 p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Beale, W. D. Bishop, Michael Philip Furmston, Contract, p34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">A '''quasi-legislative capacity''' is that in which a public administrative agency or body acts when it makes rules and regulations. When an administrative agency exercises its rule-making authority, it is said to act in a quasi-legislative manner. Administrative agencies acquire this authority to make rules and regulations that affect legal rights through statutes. This authority is an exception to the general principle that laws affecting rights should be passed only by elected lawmakers.

Administrative agency rules are made only with the permission of elected lawmakers, and elected lawmakers may strike down an administrative rule or even eliminate an agency. In this sense quasi-legislative activity occurs at the discretion of elected officials. Nevertheless, administrative agencies create and enforce many legal rules on their own, often without the advice of lawmakers, and the rules have the force of law. This means they have a binding effect on the general public.

Examples of quasi-legislative actions abound. Dozens of administrative agencies exist on the federal level, and dozens more exist on the state and local levels, and most of them have the authority to make rules that affect substantive rights. Agencies with authority over environmental matters may pass rules that restrict the rights of property owners to alter or build on their land; departments of revenue may pass rules that affect how much tax a person pays; and local housing agencies may set and enforce standards on health and safety in housing. These are just a few of the myriad rules passed by administrative agencies.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] has been described as a quasi-legislative body &lt;ref&gt;Volgy, Thomas (1973). "The Role of the "Outsider" in Quasi-Legislative Systems: The Potential Utility of a Legislative Model". ''International Organization'' '''27(1)''', 85–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Except where prohibited by statute or judicial precedent, quasi-legislative activity may be challenged in a court of law. Generally, a person challenging quasi-legislative activity must wait until the rule-making process is complete and the rule or regulation is set before challenging it. Moreover, a challenge to an agency's rule or regulation usually must be made first to the agency itself. If no satisfaction is received from the agency, the complainant can then challenge the rule or regulation in a court of law.

Another distinctive feature of quasi-legislative activity is the provision of notice and a hearing. When an administrative agency intends to pass or change a rule that affects substantive legal rights, it usually must provide notice of this intent and hold a public hearing. This gives members of the public a voice in the quasi-legislative activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8190">'''Regulatory affairs''' ('''RA'''), also called '''government affairs''', is a profession within regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices, agrochemicals (plant protection products and fertilizers), energy, banking, telecom etc.  Regulatory affairs also has a very specific meaning within the healthcare industries ([[pharmaceuticals]], [[medical devices]], [[biologic medical product|biologics]] and [[functional foods]]).

Regulatory affairs (medical affairs) professionals (aka regulatory professionals) usually have responsibility for the following general areas:

* Ensuring that their companies comply with all of the regulations and laws pertaining to their business.
* Working with federal, state, and local regulatory agencies and personnel on specific issues affecting their business, i.e., working with such agencies as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] or [[European Medicines Agency]] (pharmaceuticals and medical devices); The Department of Energy; or the Securities and Exchange Commission (banking).
* Advising their companies on the regulatory aspects and climate that would affect proposed activities. i.e. describing the "regulatory climate" around issues such as the promotion of prescription drugs and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.topra.org/TOPRA/TOPRA_Member/What_is_regulatory_affairs.aspx |title=What is regulatory affairs?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Healthcare RA ==

The regulatory function in healthcare industries is vital in making safe and effective healthcare products available worldwide. Individuals who ensure regulatory compliance and prepare submissions, as well as those whose main job function is clinical affairs or quality assurance are all considered regulatory professionals.

Regulatory professionals are employed in industry, government and academia and are involved with a wide range of products, including:

* pharmaceuticals
* medical devices
* in vitro diagnostics
* biologics and biotechnology
* nutritional products
* cosmetics
* veterinary products&lt;ref name=Regulatory-profession&gt;{{cite website |url=http://www.raps.org/about/regulatory-profession/ |title=About the Regulatory Profession}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The regulatory professional's roles and responsibilities often begin in the research and development phases, moving into clinical trials and extending through premarket approvals, manufacturing, labeling and advertising and [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarket surveillance]].&lt;ref name=Regulatory-profession /&gt;

=== Core competencies ===
Regulatory professionals come from diverse backgrounds. Most regulatory professionals have earned a bachelor's degree, and more than half have an advanced degree, most often in a scientific or technical field. In addition, regulatory professionals usually have experience in other careers before transitioning into regulatory affairs.

Although there are some university degree and graduate certificate programs in regulatory affairs and related areas, experience is a key asset for regulatory professionals. Valuable skills include project management and organization, negotiation and communication, and the ability to learn from the experience of others, both inside and outside the organization.

Continuing education and professional development are critical to the regulatory professional. Regulatory professionals must keep up to date with regulatory policies and procedures for one or more countries, as well as maintain an understanding of the scientific and technical background of healthcare products. Global aspects of regulatory affairs are taken up by organisations such as the [[Drug Information Association]] (DIA) and the [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH).

=== Origins ===
The healthcare industries were the first to be significantly regulated in the modern era. Much of this regulation has stemmed from avoiding the repetition of disasters, and has tended to be led by the USA due to size of the market and its technological lead:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov United States Food and Drug Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Diphtheria Epidemic led to 1902 [[Biologics Control Act]]
* Publication of [[The Jungle]] by [[Upton Sinclair]] led to 1906 [[Pure Food and Drugs Act]]
* [[Elixir sulfanilamide|Elixir of Sulfanilamide]] led to the 1938 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food Drug and Cosmetic Act]]
* [[Thalidomide]] led to the 1962 [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]]s
* [[Dalkon shield|Dalkon Shield]] led to the 1976 [[Medical Device Regulation Act|Medical Device Amendments]]
* [[Bjork–Shiley valve|Bjork-Shiley Heart Valves]] led to the 1990 [[Safe Medical Device Amendments of 1990|Safe Medical Devices Act]]

In the USA, this regulation is largely written directly into law and codified in [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent developments ===
Starting in 1980 the [[European Union]] started to harmonize the regulation of healthcare products in the member states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meddiquest.eu MeddiQuest Consultants Information Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of regulating medicines was well established in most member countries along similar lines to the US model, but many countries did not have any significant [[medical device]] regulation. Concurrently the EU had been developing the concept of New Approach Directives where only broad concepts were written into the law and the bulk of the technological detail delegated to compliance with recognized standards (which are more readily update-able).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhra.gov.uk Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/medical_devices/index_en.htm Europa Medical Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216115358/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/medical_devices/index_en.htm |date=2008-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newapproach.org/ New Approach Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Europeans took the radical approach of applying the New Approach Directive to Medical Devices and by doing so made the first significant conceptual advance in healthcare regulation for nearly 100 years.

The European Model for medical device has largely been adopted by the [[Global Harmonization Task Force]] as the international template.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghtf.org Global Harmonization Task Force]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future developments ===
Many in the Regulatory Affairs Profession believe the New Approach to regulation will eventually be adopted for all healthcare products as it represents the best model for delivering new healthcare advances to market in a reasonable time with acceptable safety.

Regulatory Affairs departments are growing within companies. Due to the changing resources necessary to fulfill the regulatory requirements, some companies also choose to outsource or outtask regulatory affairs to external service providers.
Regulatory Affairs department is constantly evolving and growing and is the one which is least impacted during the Acquisition and Merger, and also during recession. Global harmonization in standards has led to consistent approach in regulatory submissions and hence its review.

=== Regulatory affairs profession ===
The (healthcare) regulatory affairs profession is still an emergent profession but has four major international professional membership organizations:
* [[Drug Information Association]], DIA, http://www.diahome.org
* The Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society, RAPS, http://www.raps.org
* The Organisation for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs, TOPRA, http://www.topra.org
* �Vietnam Regulatory Affairs: https://vnras.com/
*Association of medical Affairs Professionals: [http://www.arap.co.in/ ARAP]

which offer education and training, professional development, competence certification and codes of ethics.

The regulatory [[professional]] typically has a background relevant o the business in which they work, i.e., science, medicine, or engineering.

'''Reloaded''' (stylised as '''RELOADED''' and '''RLD''') is a [[warez group]] founded in June 2004 from the ex-members of DEViANCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/reloaded |title=History of RELOADED |publisher=Defacto2.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000712/http://www.defacto2.net/organisation/reloaded |archivedate=2011-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They released and cracked [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] 4 days before its release date &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gameviper.com/pc/spore-cracked-by-reloaded-group |title=Spore cracked before its street date |date=2008-11-03 |author=Daniel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123174159/http://gameviper.com/pc/spore-cracked-by-reloaded-group |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[beta version]] of [[The Sims 3]] 15 days before its release date. On February 29, 2008, Reloaded released a cracked version of [[Assassin's Creed]], a month before its release on March 28. However, this release was later [[Nuke (warez)|nuked]] for not being the final retail version as well as having crashing issues. The retail version was released by them more than a month later.

==Timeline==
On May 26, 2006, Reloaded released the StarForce protected game [[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory]]. This cracked release became available 424 days after its official release date.&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2010, Reloaded released [[Battlefield: Bad Company 2]] three days before release date, but players reported problems with the game controls.&lt;ref&gt;

Many [[Keygen|keygens]] made by Reloaded generate keys ending in RLD.

Reloaded decided to release an old internal tool to the public when the Macrovision turned into [[Rovi Corporation]] and discontinued the development of [[SafeDisc]] and SafeCast [[Digital rights management|DRMs]]. It can be used to bypass checks like CD/DVD validation, trial, online-activation (for beta games), execution-count and of silent CD/DVD checks.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County''''', [[Case citation|827]] [[F.2d]] 684 (11th Cir. 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County |vol=827 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=684 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1987 |url=https://openjurist.org/827/f2d/684 |accessdate=2017-09-05 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a lawsuit in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] held that the [[Mobile County Public School System]] could use [[textbook]]s which purportedly promoted "[[secular humanism]]", characterized by the complainants as a [[religion]].

Parents and other citizens brought a lawsuit against the school board, alleging that the school system was teaching the tenets of secular humanism, an anti-theistic religion.  The complainants asked that forty-four different elementary through high school level textbooks be removed from the curriculum. After an initial ruling&lt;ref name="District"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14126325546019793048 Smith v. Board of School Com'rs of Mobile County, 655 F. Supp. 939 (S.D. Ala. 1987)], via Google Scholar&lt;/ref&gt; in a federal district court in favor of the plaintiffs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County |vol=827 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=684 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1987 |url=https://openjurist.org/827/f2d/684 |accessdate=2017-09-05 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that as long as the school was motivated by a secular purpose, it didn't matter whether the curriculum and texts shared ideas held by one or more religious groups. The Court found that the texts in question promoted important secular values (tolerance, self-respect, logical decision making) and thus the use of the textbooks neither unconstitutionally advanced a nontheistic religion nor inhibited theistic religions.

This case is occasionally and incorrectly cited as proving that 'secular humanism' is a religion. The text below shows the Circuit Court, in overturning the District Court decision, made no such finding. They both set aside the question as moot and offered that even if it were (and they weren't saying it is), the teaching of science is not invalidated purely because of its association with secular humanism. Excerpt below from the Circuit Court decision (cited earlier):

{{quotation | The Supreme Court has never established a comprehensive test for determining the "delicate question" of what constitutes a religious belief for purposes of the first amendment, and we need not attempt to do so in this case, for we find that, even assuming that secular humanism is a religion for purposes of the establishment clause, Appellees have failed to prove a violation of the establishment clause through the use in the Alabama public schools of the textbooks at issue in this case.}}

'''''Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.''''', 487 U.S. 22 (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.|volume=487|page=22|pin=|year=1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court further refined the test for determining whether federal courts sitting in diversity must apply state law as opposed to federal law under the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]]. The question in Stewart was whether the federal venue transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|28|1404|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; occupied the field or whether Alabama law's unfavorable stance towards forum-selection clauses should instead be applied. The Court held that the federal statute governed the District Court's decision whether to give effect to the forum-selection clause.

== Background ==
Stewart Organization, Inc. brought a suit against Ricoh Corp. arising out of a dealership agreement which obligated Stewart to market Ricoh's copiers. The agreement included a forum-selection clause specifying that suits were to be brought in Manhattan. When Stewart filed suit in Alabama, Ricoh moved to transfer the case to Manhattan pursuant to the forum-selection clause. However, the Alabama District Court denied the motion because Alabama law "looks unfavorably upon contractual forum selection clauses." However, the court certified an interlocutory appeal, which the Eleventh Circuit accepted. The Eleventh Circuit narrowly reversed the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.'', 779 [[F.2d]] [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/779/643/106515/ 643] (11th Cir. 1985); vacated on rehearing ''[[en banc]]'', 810 [[F.2d]] [https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/810/1066/355851/ 1066] (11th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
The Supreme Court remanded the case, holding that the federal venue transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), governed the District Court's interpretation of forum-selection clauses. In particular, the considerations of convenience to the parties and the fairness of the transfer in light of the parties relative bargaining power (when drafting the forum-selection clause) mandated by federal law collided with the Alabama policy categorically disfavoring forum-selection clauses, and that in the "single field of operation... the instructions of Congress are supreme."

=== Scalia's dissent ===
Justice Scalia dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that there was no direct collision between § 1404(a) and Alabama's law, and that therefore the appropriate inquiry is whether the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1652,&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|28|1652}}.&lt;/ref&gt; mandated the use of state law. Applying the RDA analysis from ''[[Hanna v. Plumer]]'' (1965), Scalia argued that state law governed the question because venue selection would encourage forum shopping, and that the choice of venue was highly outcome determinative because "[i]t is difficult to imagine an issue of more importance, other than one that goes to the very merits of the lawsuit, than the validity of a contractual forum-selection provision."

'''Tail biting in pigs''' is an abnormal behavior whereby a pig uses its teeth to bite, chew or orally manipulate another pigs's tail.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrøder-Petersen|first1=D.L|last2=Simonsen|first2=H.B|title=Tail biting in pigs|journal=Veterinary Journal|date=November 2001|volume=162|issue=3|pages=196–210|doi=10.1053/tvjl.2001.0605|pmid=11681870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tail biting is used to describe a range in severity from light manipulation of the tail to physically harming the tail, causing infection, [[amputation]] or even harming areas surrounding the tail. Tail biting typically occurs under the following conditions: indoor facility with a high density of pigs housed in a confined area (like a pen); lack of a [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] material; poor [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] system, or poor feed quality and accessibility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Nina R.|last2=Main|first2=David C.J.|last3=Mendl|first3=Mike|last4=Edwards|first4=Sandra A.|title=Tail-biting: A new perspective|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2009.08.028|volume=186|journal=Veterinary Journal|pages=137–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of tail biting: two-stage, sudden forceful, and obsessive. The type of tail biting is based on the behaviors of each the biter and victim, physical consequences of the bite, and conditions under which the biting happens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A common cause of tail biting is due to pigs feeling stressed or discomfort and are looking for something to divert their attention.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van den Berg|first1=J|title=[Tail-biting in pigs. Causes, effects and prevention]|journal=Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde|date=1 October 1982|volume=107|issue=19|pages=735-43|pmid=7147219|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other causes of tail biting involve possible breed predilections, gender, feed source, substrate materials, [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] discomfort, and general health of the pig(s).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It usually starts out as the pig being curious to investigate its surroundings and begins with harmless nibbling. The nibbling then turns into biting- if blood is drawn from the bite this can cause the pig to bite even more due to their natural appetite for blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassert|first1=Joanna M.|last2=McCurnin|first2=Dennis M.|title=McCurnin's Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians|date=2010|publisher=Penny Rudolph|isbn=978-1-4160-5700-0|page=756|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tail biting causes major financial and animal [[welfare]] issues within the commercial swine industries due to reduced weight gain, treatments, [[culling]], and [[wikt:carcass|carcass]] condemnation. Studies have been done for farmers to identify the risk factors causing tail biting and to implement and experiment ways to reduce and prevent it. The studies ultimately yielded variable results due to the many factors of tail biting and the fact general recommendations are not appropriate for all farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=NR|last2=Parker|first2=RM|last3=Mendl|first3=M|last4=Edwards|first4=SA|last5=Main|first5=DC|title=Prevalence of risk factors for tail biting on commercial farms and intervention strategies.|journal=Veterinary Journal|date=October 2012|volume=194|issue=1|pages=77-83|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.03.004|pmid=22503206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term "tail biting" can be used to describe a range of tail manipulation behaviors from light nibbling to [[cannibalism]]. However, the term "tail biting" mainly refers to the formation of [[lesion]]s on the victim. There has not been a clear definition for "tail biting" therefore it is common for researchers to refer to different things when using the term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tail biting tends to happen when swine are housed in indoor facilities and in pens where multiple pigs are housed together. With multiple pigs housed in one area, they can become crowded which has the potential to induce stress. Other factors in this circumstance that can cause stress in pigs are a lack of substrate material in the housing environment, a lack of ventilation, or lack of quality feed (low salt or low iron diets&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/behavior/normal_social_behavior_and_behavioral_problems_of_domestic_animals/behavioral_problems_of_swine.html?qt=tail%20biting&amp;alt=sh|title=Behavioral Problems of Swine|date=2014|website=The Merck Veterinary Manual|publisher=Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp.|access-date=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or access to the feed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tail biting even happens out of pure boredom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Stressful situations, boredom and frustration motivate the actions of tail biting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Types ==
The certain behaviors and conditions that tail biting happens under can be split up into three types: two-stage, sudden forceful, and obsessive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# Two-stage consists of two stages: pre-damage and damaging. 
## Pre-damage: This is light manipulation of the tail using the mouth of one pig on another. This tends to happen when both pigs are laying. With this type, the victim of the act tends to have little to no reaction to its tail being manipulated. Because pigs have an instinctive [[Rooting instinct|rooting]] behavior, the most likely cause of this type of tail biting is due to lack of a substrate/ground material for the pig to use its rooting behavior on, therefore it uses another pig's tail to fulfill that behavior. Ways to prevent this would be to remove the pig that's "biting" or remove the pigs that are being bitten, and/or provide some substrate or ground material to redirect the biting pig's rooting behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
## Damaging: The oral manipulation causes the tail to bleed. This type tends to be more forceful where the pig actually bites the tail of the other pig. The victim pig will most likely respond with avoidance behavior, sometimes making sounds to indicate discomfort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Sudden forceful: One pig actually grips onto the tail with its mouth and yanks. It usually happens when both pigs are standing up. The victim will usually display avoidance behavior and/or vocalize discomfort. This can cause wounds, sometimes even amputation. Some things to prevent this again would be to separate the biting pigs from the victim pigs and to provide substrate material or objects for the pigs to root.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Obsessive: The biting and yanking is repeated. Again, the response is avoidance behavior. The wounds are more severe and include partial or full amputation. To prevent, separate the bitten and victim pigs and treat the injured pigs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Pigs go through teeth changes at ages 3–4 weeks and 7–8 months. Like humans and many other species, they go through teething phases which can prompt them to start tail biting. Pigs also have a natural tendency to chew and an attraction to blood, therefore if they start chewing on a tail and draw blood, it makes it harder for them to stop and can lead to infection.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/tail-biting.aspx|title=Pig Health- Tail Biting|website=NADIS: National Animal Disease Information Service|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pigs feel uncomfortable in their housing environment, they turn to biting and harming the tails of the pigs surrounding them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Factors that can trigger tail biting include environmental, husbandry, and diet factors like temperature, competition for food and water, vitamin E deficiency, and high fat diets.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Industry effects ==
Tail biting is considered one of the major animal welfare problems affecting the fattening of pigs in the swine industry. This is because of the costs to treat and costs due to slower fattening to slaughter weight. There are factors to be taken into account  when evaluating how tail biting affects production since they have to do with growth, feed intake, leanness and other production traits. Some of those factors are genetics, breed, gender. 

== Prevention and management ==
The victim pigs of tail biting should be isolated from the others in order to prevent further damage. The tail can be dressed with a bandage and/or sprayed with an antiseptic. Broad spectrum antibiotics can be prescribed by a veterinarian to prevent and treat any infections. Meat withholding periods should be taken into account if antibiotics are prescribed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

To minimize tail biting, toys like chains, alcathene piping, and rubber boots can be provided to redirect pigs chewing tendencies. A substrate material for the flooring of the pen like feed or straw can provide additional enrichment in preventing tail biting as well. Tail docking is another way to prevent tail biting. This is done when piglets are 3–7 days old and should be done cleanly and efficiently by someone who is competent. Dietary supplements can be given to increase salt levels which has been shown to be effective. Salt levels should be monitored as to prevent excessive intake and salt poisoning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Other things that can be monitored and adjusted are  potential stressors like stocking density, temperature and ventilation regulation. In regards to stocking density, there are minimum space requirements for pigs based on weight per The Welfare of Farmed Animals Regulations. Temperature and ventilation should be monitored and regulated as to prevent chilling, overheating, too much dust, gas, and ammonia buildup in turn decreasing stress induced tail biting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5151">The '''third-party doctrine''' is a [[United States]] [[legal theory]] that holds that people who voluntarily give information to third parties—such as banks, phone companies, [[internet service provider]]s (ISPs), and e-mail servers—have "no reasonable expectation of privacy." A lack of privacy protection allows the United States government&lt;!-- or other third parties? --&gt; to obtain information from third parties without a legal warrant and without otherwise complying with the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibition against [[search and seizure]] without [[probable cause]] and a judicial [[search warrant]]. Libertarians typically call this government activity unjustified spying and a violation of individual and privacy rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson II|first1=Richard M.|title=The Fourth Amendment Third-Party Doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
Followed by the states in 1791, the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was enacted in 1792, holding:

{{quote|The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html Official Bill of Rights in the National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] established its [[reasonable expectation of privacy]] test. In 1976 (''[[United States v. Miller (1976)|United States v. Miller]]'') and 1979 (''[[Smith v. Maryland]]''), the Court affirmed that "a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties."&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967) and ''[[Berger v. New York]]'' (1967), the [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]], of which Title III is known as the "Wiretap Act." Title III was Congress' attempt to extend Fourth Amendment-like protections to telephonic and other wired forms of communication.

In 1986, the [[United States Congress]] updated the [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]] by enacting the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] which included an updated "Wiretap Act" and also extended Fourth Amendment-like protections to electronic communications in Title II of the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]], known as the [[Stored Communications Act]].

A 2012 [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland|Maryland District Court]] court case (''[[United States v. Graham]]'') held that historical cell site location data is not protected by the Fourth Amendment.

In the same year, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Sonia Sotomayor]], writing a concurrence in a case (''[[United States v. Jones]]'') involving the police placing a [[GPS]] tracker on a suspect without a warrant, noted that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;More fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.&lt;ref name="atlantic" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1616">The '''Thirteenth [[Council of Toledo]]''' opened on 4 November 683.  It was called by [[Erwig]] and consisted of 77 [[bishop]]s, 5 [[abbot]]s, 3 church dignitaries, and 27 [[Palatinus (Roman Catholic Church)|palatine]] functionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA75&amp;dq=thirteenth+council+of+toledo&amp;id=O_5PAAAAYAAJ&amp;output=text "The Power of the Pope During the Middle Ages"] ''Google Books'' Retrieved 12 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

The king asked for the pardon and rehabilitation of the rebels against [[King Wamba]] in 673.  The bishops consented to return to the rebels and their descendants their possessions and positions.  The pardon extended to all those who had been disgraced for the same reason since the reign of [[Chintila]] (636-640).  Erwig desired that no vendettas should hamper his reign. 

The council also condemned forced confessions, necessitating justice without torture.  They also imposed a maximum prison sentence. 

Finally, the council repeated the oft-rendered prohibition on harming the royal family after the death of the monarch.

[[File:Bou embolat a Godella - 1.jpg|thumb|''Toro embolado'', [[Godella]] 2010.]]
A '''{{lang|es|toro embolado}}''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), '''{{lang|ca|bou embolat}}''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), roughly meaning 'bull with balls', is a festive activity, typical of many towns in [[Spain]] (mainly in the [[Valencian community]] and Southern [[Catalonia]]), in which a bull that has balls of flammable material attached to its horns, which are set on fire, is set free in the streets at night, and participants dodge the bull when it comes close. It can be considered a variant of an {{lang|es|[[Running of the bulls|encierro]]}} ({{lang|ca|correbous}} in Catalan). This activity is held in a number of [[Spain|Spanish]] towns during their [[Fiesta patronal|local festivals]]. In recent years, animal welfare activists have attempted to stop this practice due to the cruelty to the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=League Against Cruel Sports |title=We've come a long way, baby ... |url=http://www.league.org.uk/blogs_entry.aspx?id=117 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109054022/http://www.league.org.uk/blogs_entry.aspx?id=117 |archivedate=9 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The animal is usually tied to a post and then teams of people prevent it from moving while a wooden frame with two spikes with balls of flammable material is attached to its horns. These are then set alight and the rope is cut. Sometimes [[fireworks]] are attached too, which then go off shortly afterwards. There is usually a barricade separating the bull from the spectators. 

A somewhat similar activity is the {{lang|es|[[toro de fuego]]}}, in which the live bull is replaced by a bull-shaped metal frame (held by a runner) which is set alight.

The '''Treaty of Torrellas''' (called a ''sentencia arbitral'', "sentence by arbitration," in [[Castilian language|Castilian]]), signed in [[Zaragoza]] in 1304, settled the question of conquest of the [[Kingdom of Murcia]], thitherto a dependency of the [[Crown of Castile]], by [[James II of Aragon]].

Between 1296 and 1300, James led a series of military operations in Murcia with the intention of conquering a large zone between [[Elda]] in the north and [[Huércal-Overa]] in the south.

James got together with [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] in 1304 to fix new borders between their two states in [[Andalusia]]. Peace was effected between the two powers and the major part of Murcia was assigned to Castile. The cities of [[Orihuela]], [[Elche]], [[Caudete]], [[Elda]], and [[Alicante]] passed to the [[Kingdom of Valencia]]. The treaty, however, did not last, being replaced the next year by the [[Treaty of Elche]].

'''''United States v. Correll''''', 389 U.S. 299 (1967), is a case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled 5-3 that in order for the taxpayer to be allowed to deduct the cost of his meals incurred while on a business trip, the trip must have required him to stop for sleep or rest.

==Facts==
The respondent, a traveling salesman from [[Tennessee]], routinely took same-day business trips throughout 1960 and 1961. He would leave on business early in the morning and come back by dinner. Because he would eat breakfast and lunch on the road, he deducted the cost of those meals from his 1960 and 1961 income tax return pursuant to [[Internal Revenue Code section 162(a)|§ 162(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code]]. § 162(a)(2) allows the taxpayer to deduct "traveling expenses [incurred] while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]] ("Commissioner") disallowed the deductions on the ground that the respondent did not meet the definition of "away from home" under § 162(a)(2) because his trip did not require him to sleep or rest.&lt;ref name=Correll300&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Correll|link=|volume=389|page=299|pin=300|year=1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Commissioner ruled that the cost of the meals was not a § 162(a)(2) business expense, but rather a "’personal, living’ expense under § 262."&lt;ref name=Correll300/&gt; The respondent paid the tax and sued for a refund in the [[United States district court|District Court]]. He received a favorable verdict in the District Court, which was affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]. The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] “in order to resolve a conflict among the circuits on this recurring question of [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]] administration.”&lt;ref&gt;''Correll'', 389 U.S. at 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
If the cost of the meals did not qualify for a § 162(a)(2) business expense deduction, then they would be classified as a § 262 personal expense, and would be non-deductible. Whether the cost of the meals falls under § 162(a)(2) depends on how the phrase "traveling ... away from home" is interpreted. The Commissioner has interpreted the phrase as requiring the taxpayer to sleep or rest during his trip.&lt;ref&gt;''Correll'', 389 U.S. at 299.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found two advantages to the Commissioner’s interpretation. First, the Court noted that a business traveler who is allowed a § 162(a)(2) business deduction receives a windfall, because part of what is spent on meals represents a personal living expense that other taxpayers are not entitled to deduct at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Correll'', 389 U.S. at 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, fairness demands that § 162(a)(2) should not extend to all situations involving business travel.&lt;ref name=Correll300/&gt; Allowing a taxpayer who has to travel two blocks from his home on a business trip to take a § 162(a)(2) deduction, but not the taxpayer whose business requires no travel at all, illustrates the inequitable result of a contrary approach. Second, the requirement that the taxpayer must sleep away from home in order to qualify for a § 162(a)(2) deduction is a bright-line, easy to administer rule that avoids unnecessary litigation.

The Court uses statutory interpretation to affirm the Commissioner’s approach. First, the Court notes that “traveling” implies being “away from home.” Therefore, a broad interpretation of “away from home” would make the phrase redundant.&lt;ref&gt;''Correll'', 389 U.S. at 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Court observes that the statute groups “meals and lodging” together, suggesting Congress’ intent to allow a deduction for the cost of meals only where the business traveler has to pay for lodging as well.&lt;ref name=Correll300/&gt;

Finally, the Court notes that even if alternatives to this bright-line rule are available, it is not the Court’s role to fashion a new rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Correll'', 389 U.S. at 307.&lt;/ref&gt; “In this area of limitless factual variations, ‘it is the province of Congress and the Commissioner, not the courts, to make the appropriate adjustments.’”&lt;ref name=Correll300/&gt;

Justices Douglas, Black and Fortas dissented on the ground that the phrase “while away from home” goes to geography and not time.&lt;ref name=Correll300/&gt; The dissent argued that the majority’s approach of interpreting the phrase as “overnight” incorrectly switches the focus to a time element.&lt;ref name=Correll300/&gt;

==Significance of the decision==

The Court affirmed the Commissioner’s interpretation of the “away from home” requirement of § 162(a)(2). By doing so, the Court chose to retain a bright-line rule instead of a case-by-case approach — thereby avoiding uncertainty and excessive litigation.

Furthermore, the decision puts all one-day travelers forced to pay for their meals on an equal footing when it comes to allowing a § 162(a)(2) business expense deduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Correll'', 389 U.S. at 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Washington v. United States''''', 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case regarding Native American fishing rights in the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In the case, the court deadlocked 4-4, with Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] recusing himself due to his prior involvement in the case as a judge on the [[United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-269/39869/20180323153617321_Recusal%20Letter%20in%20No.%2017-269.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The deadlock left standing a lower court ruling that the State of Washington must redesign and rebuild road culverts to allow salmon to swim upstream, to uphold Native American treaty rights to fish. The issue decided by the federal courts was whether, under the 1855–1856 [[Stevens Treaties (disambiguation)|Stevens Treaties]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, "the right to fish is the right to put a net in the water or the right for there to be fish to catch";&lt;ref name=OPB/&gt; however, with the 4-4 Supreme Court decision, it may not be binding on future court decisions.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The case was argued on April 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/washington-v-united-states/ | title=Washington v. United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-269_o75q.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of [[stream restoration]] demanded by the court decision was estimated to be $3.7 billion,&lt;ref name=Kunkler2018/&gt; making culvert replacement of the top [[List of Seattle megaprojects|megaprojects in the Seattle area]].

The decision was ''[[per curiam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-269_3eb4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Woolwich Equitable Building Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners''''' [1993] AC 70 is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning to what extent enrichment of the defendant must be at the expense of the claimant.

It related to the payment of tax which was subsequent held not to have been due as a result of the invalidity of the law under which the tax had been assessed.  [[HM Revenue and Customs|The Inland Revenue]] repaid the tax, but disputed their liability to pay interest on the money during the time which they had held it.

==Facts==
The [[Woolwich Building Society]] was charged £57 million in [[tax]] that it objected to as being assessed under a tax law which is alleged was ''[[ultra vires]]''. It paid the sums on a "[[without prejudice]]" basis, and then sought judicial review with a view to reclaiming the tax. The House of Lords agreed with Woolwich. The revenue repaid the tax, but refused to pay any interest, which was agreed to be in the amount of £6.73 million. Under section 35A of the [[Supreme Court Act 1981]] interest would only be given at the court’s discretion if an entitlement to restitution of the principal could be made out. So because there was a dispute of the interest, the question was whether Woolwich was entitled as of right to restitution of the principal. The problem was a claim based on mistake could not succeed, because Woolwich argued it was ''ultra vires'' from the start. It was not duress, because the only threat by the Revenue would be to sue for non payment, and threatening to sue is legitimate pressure. Nor was it duress ''colore officii'' because the Revenue was not impliedly threatening to withhold performance of a duty owed to Woolwich.

==Judgment==
Lord Goff, Browne-Wilkinson and Slynn said that a demand for payment by a public authority ''[[ultra vires]]'' was a good ground for restitution itself, in essence a public law ground for restitution based on a constitutional principle of no taxation without Parliament. The [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] article 4 says there should be no taxation without legislation.

Lord Slynn said the mistake of law bar was ‘open to review by your Lordships’ House’.

Lord Keith dissented.

Lord Jauncey also dissented.

The '''Worshipful Company of Scriveners''' is one of the 110 [[Livery Company|livery companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The Scriveners Company was originally known as the ''Mysterie of the Writers of the Court Letter'' and, since its incorporation, as ''Master Wardens and Assistants of the Company of Scrivenors of the Cittie of London [sic]''. It is one of the few livery companies that from its foundation to the present day has been influential in setting the standards for a living profession, namely that of scrivener notary. The company's first ordinances were granted in 1373. Its [[Royal Charter]] was granted by [[James I of England|King James I]] on 28th January 1617.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/london-record-soc/vol4/pp80-91|title=D51: Letters Patent of incorporation, 1616/17', in Scriveners' Company Common Paper 1357-1628 With A Continuation To 1678, ed. Francis W Steer (London, 1968), pp. 80-91|last=Rawlinson|first=MS|date=1968|website=British History Online|access-date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, scrivener notaries were the only [[notary public|notaries public]] permitted to practise in the [[City of London]], the [[Liberty (division)|Liberties]] of [[Liberty of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Borough, London|The Borough]] ([[Southwark]]), and other places within three miles from the City. In 1801, [[United Kingdom Parliament|Parliament]] passed the Public Notaries Act that confirmed this status. 

Scrivener notaries are only appointed after a two-year apprenticeship to a practising scrivener notary and sitting the examinations set by the Company. They must be fluent in one or two foreign languages and be familiar with the principles and practice of foreign laws. The ancient privilege of scrivener notaries was extinguished by the [[Access to Justice Act 1999|Access to Justice Act (1999)]], since when any [[notary public]] qualified to practise in England and Wales may practise within the company's former exclusive jurisdiction. Nonetheless, they remain a discrete branch of the profession and their unique status is recognised in civil-law countries by their membership in the [[International Union of Notaries]] (UINL). Current qualification rules were adopted by the Court of the Company in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooke's Notary'', 14th edition, ed. Nigel Ready (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Thomson Reuters, 2013), A2-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the scrivener notaries, the membership of the Company comprises those with qualifications and interests in the fields of [[calligraphy]], [[heraldry]], [[genealogy]], wider aspects of the law, authorship, accountancy, and business.

Admission to the Freedom and Livery is, as with other livery companies, via one of three possible routes: redemption, patrimony or servitude. Each applicant has to be proposed by two liverymen, one of whom must be a member of the Court, or by authority of the Selection Committee. Women were first admitted to the Company in 1665.

Also, as with many other livery companies, its principal activities divide into four areas: professional, charitable, civic, and social. Its charitable activities are governed by its Sexcentenary Charity Fund.

In the [[order of precedence]] of the [[City of London|City]] Livery Companies, the Scriveners Company ranks forty-fourth. Its [[motto]] is ''Scribite Scientes'', [[Latin]] for ''Write, Ye Learned Ones''. The Master is head of the Company and its membership comprises [[Livery Company#Governance|Warden]]s, [[Court of Assistants|Assistants]], [[Liveryman|Liverymen]], [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]] and [[Apprentice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://81.130.213.163:8002/cgi-bin/lcl.exe?a=d&amp;k=FKTDSMFZN ''The Livery Companies' Database'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scriveners Company has produced two Lord Mayors of the City of London: [[Robert Clayton (Lord Mayor)|Sir Robert Clayton]] in 1680 and [[Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet|Sir James Shaw]] in 1805. The Scriveners' Hall was burned down in the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666), and rebuilt thereafter. However, for financial reasons the Company had to sell the Hall to the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers in 1703. It was demolished again in [[the Blitz]]. The site of the Hall is in Noble Street, just off Gresham Street, near Guildhall.

== Modern status of scrivener notaries ==
There are six firms of scrivener notaries active in the City of London: [[Cheeswrights]], [[De Pinna (notary firm)|De Pinna]], [[John Newton &amp; Sons]], [[John Venn &amp; Sons]], Saville &amp; Co. and Imison &amp; Co. The Worshipful Company of Scriveners is the only body from a common-law jurisdiction to have been accepted to the [[International Union of Notaries]].

'''Xnet''' (former '''eXgae)''' is a non-profit activist platform that develops and promotes alternative models for cultural dissemination and [[Royalties|royalty]] management and work in different fields related to digital rights, networked democracy and freedom of expression. Its activities revolve around five core themes: [[free culture movement|free culture]], [[net neutrality|Internet neutrality]], [[technopolitics]], network democracy, new models of sustainability for the digital era and the defence of [[citizen journalism]] and the legal fight against corruption. Xnet also engages in political lobbying at the national and international levels, by preparing and submitting legislative proposals and viral campaigns.
Xnet is a member of [[European Digital Rights]] (EDRi), a not-for-profit association  to promote, protect and uphold civil rights in the field of information and communication technolog

== Initiatives ==

=== Digital rights ===
Xnet is responsible for a significant amount of activity in the defence, dissemination and expansion of digital rights in Spain and Europe digital rights in Spain and Europe &lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/xnet-work-defending-digital-rights-2017/&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of EDRI ([[European Digital Rights]]), an international group of organisations defending civil rights in the digital domain.

In addition to organising the [[Free Culture Forum|FCForum]], Xnet frequently publishes legislative recommendations&lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/en/deficit-barcelona-public-policies-internet/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/en/deficit-barcelona-public-policies-internet&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/en/deficit-barcelona-public-policies-internet/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/recomendaciones-segundo-protocolo-convencion-cibercrimen/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/xnet-abre-peticion-en-comision-peticiones-parlamento-europeo-sobre-violacion-pautas-neutralidad-red-en-espana&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that local, regional, Spanish and European regulations are respectful of civil rights and freedom in the digital domain, and actively promotes and participates in advocacy campaigns&lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/cierre-webs-sin-orden-judicial-ley-consumidores-ue/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/espana-lidera-consejo-ue-amenaza-libertades-internet-censorshipmachine/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; https://xnet-x.net/en/draft-whistleblower-protection-law-stasi-is-back/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; https://xnet-x.net/en/informe-new-privacy-revela-falta-supervision-redes-secretas-vigilancia/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/carta-abierta-xnet-reclama-obligar-instituciones-publicas-utilizar-software-codigo-abierto/&lt;/ref&gt; for or against laws, directives or public policies that have an impact in this field.

Following Snowden's revelations about mass surveillance, Xnet began work on disseminating and advocating among the general public for communication privacy and the security of information tools aimed at Internet users in order to help them guarantee their fundamental rights on their own, whatever their legislative environments&lt;ref&gt;https://xnet-x.net/en/how-to-guide-for-preserving-fundamental-rights-internet/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since its inception, Xnet has been intensely active in the defence of [[Net Neutrality]] as a major issue affecting our Internet freedom, as well as other major issues such as the protection of whistleblowers, copyright abuses against the free circulation of information and the so-called ''gag laws'' and their impact on freedom of expression on the Internet in the Spanish state.

=== Xnet Leaks ===
Because of the leaking of the 'Blesa's Emails' (received by the X Party in 2013) that lead to the investigation and court case against [[Miguel Blesa]] (former president of the national savings bank [[Caja Madrid]] now [[Bankia]]),  Xnet decided to improve create an anonymous mailbox at the disposal of those who hold relevant information about corruption. This mailbox allows citizens to send information secure and anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xnet's Mailbox: Leaks against corruption|url=http://xnet-x.net/en/xnetleaks|website=Xnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation reports that the information received by XnetLeaks is treated first by journalists and secondly by a legal team. XnetLeaks received the first reports on the case of Caja Madrid's 'opaque Cards' through the leaks of Blesa's emails, which also uncovered the corrupt management plot concerning the high speed train AVE or the irregular financing through ghost foundations of politicians and big trade unions on Caja Madrid's 
management board. XnetLeaks has a blog published on five different media through which it has facilitated open access to Caja Madrid's emails, known as Blesa's Emails.

=== 15MpaRato ===
15MpaRato is a citizen platform launched by Xnet iwith the aim of collecting and spreading for naming those responsible for the crisis in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dossier: Historia de lucha contra la corrupción de 15MpaRato, Xnet y la Comisión Anticorrupción del Partido X.|url=https://15mparato.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/dossier-anticorrupcion.pdf|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created on May 16, 2012 by launching a public campaign and citizen lawsuit against [[Rodrigo Rato]] and other management positions at [[Bankia]] (the Spanish bailed-out bank).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Amy|title=Spain's 99% occupy Madrid against Rato's banking and Rajoy's austerity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/spain-99percent-occupy-madrid|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their main objective wasfile a lawsuit against Rodrigo Rato and  [[Bankia]]'s board. They presented a  lawsuit that was accepted by the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|National Court]] in Spain and Rodrigo Rato and Bankia were officially accused of fraud in what the media called "The Bankia Case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=González|first1=Andrés|last2=Rodríguez Piedra|first2=Blanca|title=Spain opens fraud case on ex-Bankia chief Rato|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/us-bankia-idUSBRE8630RT20120704|accessdate=16 March 2015|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial is currently ongoing, as of December 2015.

=== Catalonia’s Working Group Against Corruption ===
This working group was created in January 2015 to coordinate the efforts of groups and individuals in an active network against corruption. Xnet coordinates and represents the working group. Also in the group: David Fernandez, president of the Parliamentary Commission on the 'Pujol Case' and member of the CUP; the 15MpaRato platform; Hervé Falciani; the collective against corruption Cafè amb Llet; the [[X Party]]'s Anti-Corruption Commission and the Federation of Neighbourhood Associations of Barcelona, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Entidades, activistas y partidos crean una plataforma contra la corrupción|url = http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2015/01/22/catalunya/1421932817_239052.html|website = EL PAÍS|publisher = |date = 2015-01-22|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = es|first = Ediciones El|last = País}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siete entidades y Falciani trabajarán juntos contra la corrupción en Cataluña|url = http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/01/22/54c0e72de2704ecc718b457f.html|website = ELMUNDO|publisher = |accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has managed to procure the approval of the appearance of the Catalan government as private prosecutor against Iñaki Urdangarín and [[Infanta Cristina of Spain|Princess Cristina]] in the case of 'Palma Arena'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = El Parlament pide que la Generalitat se persone en el ‘caso Palma Arena’|url = http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2015/03/05/catalunya/1425590234_599230.html|website = EL PAÍS|publisher = |date = 2015-03-06|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = es|first = Ediciones El|last = País}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2015, the City Council of Barcelona creates the 'Office for Transparency and Good Practices' of the [[City Council of Barcelona]], for whose management it receives advice from the Citizen Working Group against Corruption in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barcelona crea una Oficina para la Transparencia|url = http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-barcelona-crea-oficina-transparencia-20151126112855.html|website = europapress.es|publisher = |accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = es-ES|first = Europa|last = Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barcelona impulsa la oficina de Transparencia para que los ciudadanos denuncien prácticas corruptas|url = http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/barcelona/Barcelona-Transparencia-ciudadanos-practicas-corruptas_0_456354753.html|website = eldiario.es|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This collaboration will consist on the City Council periodically making available the work developed by the Office to the Catalonia's Citizen Working Group against Corruption. Moreover, the Group agrees to monitor the proper functioning of the Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colau crea una oficina de asuntos internos y un buzón anticorrupción|url = http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2015/11/26/catalunya/1448535113_612745.html|website = EL PAÍS|publisher = |date = 2015-11-26|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = es|first = Ediciones El|last = País}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Spanish state's Working Group against Corruption ===
This working group is officially presented in Barcelona on October 31, 2015, as part of the seventh edition of [[Free Culture Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Xnet presenta el Grupo Ciudadano contra la Corrupción|url = http://www.infolibre.es/noticias/politica/2015/10/31/xnet_presenta_barcelona_grupo_ciudadano_contra_corrupcion_40149_1012.html|website = infoLibre.es|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nace el Grupo Ciudadano contra la Corrupción en el Estado español|url = http://www.publico.es/politica/nace-grupo-ciudadano-corrupcion-espanol.html|website = www.publico.es|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a state platform of citizen groups actively working against corruption, formed by [[Simona Levi]] and Sergio Salgado, from Xnet Leaks and 15MpaRato; Audita Sanidad, a collective working on a citizen debt audit of the health care sector; Ana Garrido, one of the first plaintiffs if the  corruption case Gürtel; Kontuz, a citizen association of users,  consumers and taxpayers that has uncovered major corruption cases in  Navarra; Acción Cívica;  Encarnacion Cortes, councilor who denounced  corrupción in the town of Benalmádena; David Fernandez, former  president of the Parliamentary Commission on the Pujol case as deputy of  the CUP-Parliament; Fernando Urruticoechea, who has reported several cases of corruption from the public administration and Patricia Ramirez  Suarez, activist in defense of  banking abuses and founder and president  of ASUFIN.

Other participants as advisors are the Citizen Debt Audit Platform - PACD;  Pau A. Monserrat, economist author of "La banca culpable" (The Guilty Banks) and Raul Burillo, tax inspector who led the team of inspectors which investigated cases such as 'Palma Arena', 'Son Oms' or 'Maquillaje'.

The Citizen Group against Corruption has presented a Decalogue for [[Whistleblowers]] as a proposal towards the elaboration of specific legislation for the protection of complainants or alert triggers of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = #FCForum15: Herramientas para salvar el mundo|url = http://www.eldiario.es/cultura/tecnologia/FCForum15-Decalogo-proteccion-denunciantes_0_447255434.html|website = eldiario.es|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== D'Evolution Summit ===
The D’Evolution Summit was created as a civil society response to the European Forum for Cultural Industries, organised by the Spanish Ministry of Culture in collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce of Barcelona, which was held in Barcelona on March 29 and 30, 2010. Authorities, experts and lobby groups participated in the Forum, which focused on five core themes: financing and the cultural industries, intellectual property and royalties management, strategies for the internationalisation of culture, culture and territorial development, and the profiles and skills for culture industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcu.es/MC/PresidenciaUE2010/Conferencias/ForoEuroIndCultu.html |title=Foro Europeo de Industrias Culturales |accessdate=March 7, 2011|publisher=Ministerio de Cultura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum for Cultural Industries lent continuity to the International Conference on Economy and Culture held in May 2009, and took place just before the informal meeting of the 27 Ministers of Culture of the European Union on March 31 within the framework of the Spanish Presidency of the EU.

The D’Evolution Summit was a counter-summit organised at the same time, to demand amendments to Spain’s Law of Sustainable Economy (known as the anti-downloads law) and an end to the monopoly of copyright collecting societies.

During three days, the D’Evolution summit organised Internet broadcasts of the proceedings of the Forum for Cultural Industries and the Informal Meeting of Ministers, staged concerts with groups who use free licences, and carried out actions such as the handing out music with free licences to hairdressing salons and the action “We won’t carry the bucket for an industry that refuses to adapt to reality” in which the comedian Leo Bassi dressed up as a clown and tried to give a giant inflatable duck to the European ministers of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europapress.es/portaltic/internet/noticia-leo-bassi-intenta-entregar-patito-goma-ministros-europeos-cultura-20100330150516.html |title=Leo Bassi intenta entregar un pato de goma gigante a los ministros europeos de Cultura|accessdate=March 7, 2011|publisher=Europa Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; D’Evolution also organised viral campaigns and provided information on the topics being discussed at the Forum through social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/tecnologia/Internautas/espanoles/preparan/cumbre/alternativa/ministros/Cultura/elpeputec/20100322elpeputec_4/Tes |title=Internautas españoles preparan una cumbre alternativa a la de ministros de Cultura|accessdate=March 7, 2011|date=March 22, 2010|publisher=Europa Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;
