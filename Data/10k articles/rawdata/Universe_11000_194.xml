      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''2007 [[Haradh]], Saudi Arabia, gas pipeline explosion''' occurred just after midnight on 18 November 2007 at a [[natural gas pipeline]] near [[Haradh gas plant]] and at a distance of thirty kilometers (eighteen miles) off the [[Hawiya gas plant]] in eastern [[Saudi Arabia]]. The plant and the pipeline are operated by [[Saudi Aramco]], the country's national oil company, and contract workers were linking a new pipe to the line at the time of the explosion.

According to first reports, twenty-eight workers, including five [[Aramco]] employees, died in the explosion. Their nationalities were not specified by the company, nor the number of the injured. According to diplomatic sources, most of the dead were [[Asia]]n workers along with at least one [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] national. According to [[Arab News]], King Fahd Hospital in [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Al-Ahsa]] had received 10 non-Saudi workers who were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=103744&amp;d=19&amp;m=11&amp;y=2007 |title=Saudi Arabia Gas Explosion Kills 28 |date=2008-11-18|author=Arab News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next day, as a special technical panel set up by Saudi Aramco continued its probe yesterday to determine the reason for the blast and the subsequent fire, it was announced that the death toll had risen to 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=103754&amp;d=20&amp;m=11&amp;y=2007 |title=Death Toll From Aramco Pipeline Blast Jumps to 38 |date=2007-11-20|publisher=Arab News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death toll was later determined as 34, three of whom were identifiable, while a special [[fatwa]] from the Senior [[Ulema]] Council of Saudi Arabia had to be obtained to allow the bodies charred beyond recognition, some of whom were [[Islam|Muslims]] and some of whom non-Muslims, to be buried together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009060640090 |title=Al-Hawiya fire fatwa permits burial of non-Muslims |date=|publisher=[[Saudi Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no immediate suggestion of a [[terrorism|terrorist]] link to the incident and the incident was affirmed as being purely maintenance-related by Aramco.

Haradh and Hawiya plants, opened 2002-2003, are among Saudi Arabia’s major gas-processing plants, in the desert near the [[Ghawar Field]], the world’s largest, south of [[Dhahran]].

Examples of active matter are schools of fish, flocks of birds, bacteria, artificial [[self-propelled particles]], and self-organising bio-polymers such as [[microtubule]]s and [[actin]], both of which are part of the [[cytoskeleton]] of living cells. Most examples of active matter are biological in origin; however, a great deal of current experimental work is devoted to synthetic systems. Active matter is a relatively new material classification in [[soft matter physics|soft matter]]:  the most extensively studied model, the [[Vicsek model]], dates from 1995.&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vicsek | first1=T. |authorlink1=Tamás Vicsek| last2=Czirok | first2=A. | last3=Ben-Jacob | first3=E. | last4=Cohen | first4=I. | last5=Shochet | first5=O. | year=1995 | title=Novel type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles | journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] | volume=75 | pages=1226–1229 | arxiv=cond-mat/0611743| doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226 | issue=6 | bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V | pmid=10060237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Bejan was born in [[Galaţi]], a port town located on the [[Danube]] in [[Romania]].
His mother, Marioara Bejan (1914–1998), was a pharmacist.&lt;ref name="Ephrat"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt; His father, Dr. Anghel Bejan (1910–1976), was a veterinarian.&lt;ref name="Bejan_60" /&gt; Bejan showed an early talent in drawing, and his parents enrolled him in art school. He also excelled in basketball, which earned him a position on the [[Romanian national basketball team]].&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Basket&gt;{{cite web|last1=Federatia Romana de Baschet|first1=-|title=Adrian Bejan a realizat performanta in stiinta cu ajutorul baschetului!|url=http://www.frbaschet.ro/stiri/2014-02-22/adrian-bejan-a-realizat-performanta-in-stiinta-cu-ajutorul-baschetului|publisher=Federatia Romana de Baschet|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 19 Bejan won a scholarship to the United States and entered [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt; In 1972 he was awarded BS and MS degrees as a member of the Honors Course in Mechanical Engineering.&lt;ref name="Duke webpage"&gt;{{cite web |title=Adrian Bejan - Duke Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science |url=http://mems.duke.edu/faculty/adrian-bejan |publisher=Duke University |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bejan_60"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lage |first1=José L. |last2=Anderson |first2=Ren |last3=Costa |first3=Vitor |last4=Errera|first4=Marcelo R.|last5=Fowler|first5=Alex J.|last6=Gosselin|first6=Louis|last7=Kimura|first7=Shigeo|last8=Ledezma|first8=Gustavo A.|last9=Lim|first9=Jong S.|last10=Lorente|first10=Sylvie|last11=Miguel|first11=Antonio|last12=Minkowycz|first12=W.J.|last13=Morega|first13=Alexandru M.|last14=Bello-Ochende|first14=Tunde|last15=Ordóñez|first15=Juan C.|last16=Poulikakos|first16=Dimos|last17=Reis|first17=Heitor|last18=Rocha|first18=Luiz A.O.|last19=da Silva|first19=Alexandre K.|last20=Trevisan|first20=Osvair V.|last21=Vargas|first21=José V.|last22=Wechsatol|first22=Wishsanuruk|last23=Zhang|first23=Zongqin |title=Professor Adrian Bejan on his 60th birthday |journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer |displayauthors=3 |volume=51 |issue=25-26 |year=2008 |pages=5759–5761 |issn=0017-9310 |doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2008.06.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated in 1975 with a PhD from MIT with a thesis titled "Improved thermal design of the cryogenic cooling system for a superconducting synchronous generator".

The book is aimed at practical applications of the [[second law of thermodynamics]], and presented his ideas on [[irreversibility]], availability and [[exergy]] analysis in a form for engineers.&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt; In 1984 he published ''Convection Heat Transfer'''. In an era when researchers did heat transfer calculations using  numerical methods on supercomputers, the book emphasized new research methods such as intersection of asymptotes, heatlines, and scale analysis to solve problems.&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt;

Bejan was appointed [[Professor (highest academic rank)|full professor]] at Duke University in 1984.&lt;ref name=ASMEhonorary /&gt; In 1988 he published the first edition of his textbook ''Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics''. The book combined thermodynamics theory with engineering heat transfer and [[fluid mechanics]], and introduced entropy generation minimization as a method of optimization.&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt; In 1996 the ASME awarded him the Worcester Reed Warner Medal for "originality, challenges to orthodoxy, and impact on thermodynamics and heat transfer, which were made through his first three books".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Worcester Reed Warner Medal. American Society of Mechanical Engineers |url=https://scholars.duke.edu/display/awdrec22794 |work=Scholars@Duke |publisher=Duke University |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Bejan was appointed the J. A. Jones Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering. In 1988 and 1989, his peers named two dimensionless groups ''Bejan number (Be),'' in two different fields: for the pressure difference group, in heat transfer by forced convection, and for the dimensionless ratio of fluid friction irreversibility divided by heat transfer irreversibility, in thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="Duke webpage" /&gt; From 1992 to 1996 he published four more books, ''Convection in Porous Media'', ''Heat Transfer'', ''Thermal Design and Optimization'' and ''Entropy Generation Minimization''.&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt;

==Constructal law==
In 1995&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt; while reviewing entropy generation minimization for a symposium paper and writing another paper on the cooling of electronic components, Bejan formulated his self-described '''constructal law'''.&lt;ref name="Bejan1997" /&gt;{{primary inline|date=January 2018}} Where electronic components are too small for convective cooling, they must be designed for efficient conduction. The paper provides a method for efficiently designing conductive paths, from smaller paths leading to larger ones. The similarity of the solution to the branching structures seen in multiple inanimate and living things led to his statement of what he calls a new law of nature: "For a finite-size system to persist in time (to live), it must evolve in such a way that it provides easier access to the imposed (global) currents that flow through it."&lt;ref name="Bejan1997" /&gt; To emphasize the coming together of paths he called the theory ''constructal'' from the Latin "to build", in contrast with approaches using ''fractal'' geometry, from the Latin "to break".&lt;ref name="Bejan1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bejan |first1=Adrian |title=Constructal-theory network of conducting paths for cooling a heat generating volume |journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer |volume=40 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=799–816 |issn=0017-9310 |doi=10.1016/0017-9310(96)00175-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bejan incorporated his constructal law into the second edition of his textbook, ''Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics'' (1997).&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt;{{primary inline|date=January 2018}} Since then he has concentrated on constructal law and its applications.&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt;{{primary inline|date=January 2018}} In 2004 he published ''Porous and Complex Flow Structures in Modern Technologies''.&lt;ref name=Bejan_60 /&gt; The same year he and Sylvie Lorente were awarded the Edward F. Obert Award by the ASME for their paper "Thermodynamic Formulation of the Constructal Law"&lt;ref name="Duke webpage" /&gt; In 2008 he published ''Design with Constructal Theory'', a textbook for the course he developed with Lorente at Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bejan |first1=Adrian |author2=Sylvie Lorente |title=Design with Constructal Theory |date=2008 |publisher=Wiley |page=xv|isbn=978-0-471-99816-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=January 2018}} In 2011 the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] presented him with an honorary membership. He was cited for "an extraordinary record of creative work, including the unification of thermodynamics and heat transfer; the conceptual development of design as a science that unites all fields; legendary contributions to engineering education; and, since 1996, the discovery and continued development of the constructal law."&lt;ref name=ASMEhonorary /&gt;{{primary inline|date=January 2018}}

Bejan has also written books for the general audience. In 2012 he published ''Design in Nature: How the Constructal Law Governs Evolution in Biology, Technology, and Social Organization'' and 2016 ''The Physics of Life: The Evolution of Everything''.&lt;ref name="Ephrat"/&gt; He credits these books for his award of the Ralph Coats Roe Medal from the ASME in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Bejan Wins 2017 Ralph Coats Roe Medal |url=http://pratt.duke.edu/news/bejan-wins-2017-ralph-coats-roe-medal |publisher=Duke University |date=20 September 2017 |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cited for "permanent contributions to the public appreciation of the pivotal role of engineering in an advanced society through outstanding accomplishments as an engineering scientist and educator, renowned communicator and prolific writer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ralph Coats Roe Medal. American Society of Mechanical Engineers |url=https://scholars.duke.edu/display/awdrec22783 |work=Scholars@Duke |publisher=Duke University |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 the [[Franklin Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]] announced that Bejan would be awarded the 2018 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Mechanical Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Bejan Named 2018 Franklin Institute Award Laureate |url=https://pratt.duke.edu/news/bejan-franklin-institute-award |publisher=Duke University |date=7 November 2017 |accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cited for "his pioneering interdisciplinary contributions in thermodynamics and convection heat transfer that have improved the performance of engineering systems, and for constructal theory, which predicts natural design and its evolution in engineering, scientific, and social systems." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adrian Bejan - The Franklin Institute |url=https://www.fi.edu/laureates/adrian-bejan |publisher=The Franklin Institute |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brighton Energy Co-operative''' is a [[cooperative]] based in [[Brighton &amp; Hove]], [[United Kingdom]] that operates [[renewable energy]] plants. It is incorporated as a [[Industrial and Provident Society|Community Benefit Society]] under the [[Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 1965|Industrial and Provident Societies Act]]. Live operations include 132 [[kilowatt-peak|kWp]] of [[photovoltaic]] [[solar panel]]s, installed in 2012, located across three sites in the city: [[St George's Church, Brighton|St George's Church]] in [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]], City Coast Church in [[Portslade]] and the Hove Enterprise Centre at [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham Port]].

In 2013, it launched a second community share offer to raise up to £616,000 to purchase and install up to 565 [[kilowatt-peak|kWp]] of [[photovoltaic]] capacity, mainly on huge sheds at [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Malcolm|title=Solar project a shining example says Green MP|url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2014-02-02/solar-project-a-shining-example-says-green-mp|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=ITV News|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then more than 400 people have joined BEC and the coop has raised more than £1.5m of community investment. BEC has installed on many buildings in and around Brighton and Hove ([https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1zUfIJ7al8qks0VEag6IM-oH3hag&amp;ll=51.01822954484859%2C-0.03465955000001486&amp;z=10 see a map here]), including:

'''Caesium cadmium bromide''' ([[Caesium|Cs]][[Cadmium|Cd]][[Bromine|Br]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a synthetic crystalline material. It belongs to the AMX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group (where A = alkali metal, M = bivalent metal, X = halogen ion). As a [[single crystal]] structure doped with [[rare-earth]] ions, it can be used as [[active laser medium]]. However, its [[hygroscopic]] behaviour limits its use as a laser crystal.

'''Cerium hexaboride''' ('''[[Cerium|Ce]][[Boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;''', also called '''cerium boride''', '''CeBix''', '''CEBIX''', and (incorrectly) '''CeB''') is an inorganic chemical, a [[boride]] of [[cerium]]. It is a [[refractory]] [[ceramic]] material. It has low [[work function]] and one of the highest [[electron]] emissivity known, and is stable in [[vacuum]]. The principal use of cerium hexaboride is a coating of [[hot cathode]]s, or hot cathodes made of cerium hexaboride crystals. It usually operates at temperature of 1450&amp;nbsp;°C.
[[Image:Cebixtophat.JPG|thumb|left|A cerium hexaboride top hat cathode. Image courtesy of [http://www.a-p-tech.com/ Applied Physics Technologies]]]

[[Lanthanum hexaboride]] (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and cerium hexaboride (CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are used as coating of some high-current [[hot cathode]]s. Hexaborides show low [[work function]], around 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]]. They are also somewhat resistant to cathode poisoning. Cerium boride cathodes show lower evaporation rate at 1700 K than lanthanum boride, but it becomes equal at 1850 K and higher above that. Cerium boride cathodes have one and half the lifetime of lanthanum boride, due to its higher resistance to carbon contamination. Boride cathodes are about ten times as "bright" than the [[tungsten]] ones and have 10–15 times longer lifetime. In some laboratory tests, CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has proven to be more resistant to the negative impact of carbon contamination than LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. They are used e.g. in [[electron microscope]]s, [[microwave tube]]s, [[electron lithography]], [[electron beam welding]], [[X-Ray tube]]s, and [[free electron laser]]s.

Cerium hexaboride, like lanthanum hexaboride, slowly evaporates during the cathode operation. In conditions where CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes are operated under 1850 K, CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; should maintain its optimum shape longer and therefore last longer. While the process is about 30% slower than with lanthanum boride, the cerium boride deposits are reported to be more difficult to remove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Comparing Lanthanum Hexaboride (LaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and Cerium Hexaboride (CeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) Cathodes | url = http://www.emsdiasum.com/microscopy/technical/datasheet/80920.aspx| accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''circulating water plant''' or '''circulating water system''' is an arrangement of flow of water in [[fossil-fuel power station]], [[chemical plant]]s and in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]. The system is required because various [[List of industrial processes|industrial process plants]] uses [[heat exchanger]], and also for [[active fire protection]] measures. In chemical plants, for example in [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] production, water is needed in bulk quantity for preparation of [[brine]]. The circulating water system in any plant consists of a [[circulator pump]], which develops an appropriate [[hydraulic head]], and [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipelines]] to circulate the water in the entire plant.

==System description==

===Circulating water pumps===
{{See also|Circulator pump}}
Circulating water systems are normally of the wet pit type, but for sea water circulation, both the wet pit type and the concrete volute type are employed.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Design Criteria/Guidelines for Balance of Plant for Thermal Power Project 2 X (500MW or above) Section- 6 (Circulating Water System)&lt;/ref&gt; In some industries, one or two stand-by pumps are also connected parallel to CW pumps. It is recommended that these pumps must be constantly driven by constant speed squirrel cage induction motors. CW pumps are designed as per IS:9137,&lt;ref&gt;IS 9137 (1978): Code for acceptance test for centrifugal,mixed flow and axial pumps - Class C [MED 20: Mechanical Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://law.resource.org/pub/in/bis/S08/is.9137.1978.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; standards of the Hydraulic Institute, USA or equivalent.

===Cooling tower===
{{See also|Cooling tower}}
In the present era, mechanical induced draft–type cooling towers are employed in cooling of water. Performance testing of cooling towers (both IDCT and NDCT) shall be carried
out as per ATC-105&lt;ref&gt;Standard Design Criteria/Guidelines for Balance of Plant for Thermal Power
Project 2 X (500MW or above) Section- 6 (Circulating Water System) Pg 6-6 Section 6.4.3&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the atmospheric conditions are within the permissible limits of deviation from the design conditions. As guidelines of [[Central Electricity Authority]], two mechanical draft cooling towers Or one natural draft cooling tower must be established for each 500 MW unit in power plants. The cooling towers are designed as per Cooling Tower Institute codes.

===CW treatment system===
Some coastal power stations or chemical plants intake water from sea for condenser cooling. They either use closed cycle cooling by using cooling towers or once through cooling. Selection of type of system is based on the thermal pollution effect on sea water and techno-economics based on the distance of power station from the coast and cost of pumping sea water. Due to high salt concentration, it is necessary for circulating water make up.

==Mechanical description of CW plants ==
Source:&lt;ref&gt;Standard Design Criteria/Guidelines for Balance of Plant for Thermal Power Project 2 X (500MW or above) Section- 6 (Circulating Water System) ANNEXURE 6A pG 6-17&lt;/ref&gt;

* Five (5) numbers (4 working + 1 standby) circulating water pumps of vertical wet pit type, mixed flow design and self water lubricated complete along with motors and associated accessories.
* Electro-hydraulically operated butterfly valve (with actuators), isolating butterfly valve and rubber expansion joints at discharge of each pump. Electrically operated butterfly valves for interconnection of standby pumps to operate as common standby for both the units.
* One number CW re-circulation line for each unit, suitable for handling a flow of 50% of one CW pump flow with electrically operated butterfly valve (with actuators).
* Complete piping including discharge piping/header of CW pumps, CW duct from CW pump house to condensers and from condensers to the cooling towers, blow down piping (up to ash handling plant and central monitoring basin of ETP), fittings &amp; valves and other accessories as required.
* EOT crane for handling &amp; maintenance of CW pumps and monorail and electrically operated pendant control hoist arrangement for maintenance of stoplog gates and trash racks.
* One number trash rack for CW pump house bay and two numbers of stop logs for CW pump house.
* Air release valves, with isolation valves, in CW piping as per the system requirement.
* Hydraulic transient analysis of CW system.
* CW pump model study and CW pump house/ sump model studies as required.

In [[physics]] and [[materials science]], the '''Curie temperature''' (''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;), or '''Curie point''', is the temperature above which certain materials lose their [[magnet|permanent magnetic]] properties, to be replaced by [[magnetization|induced magnetism]]. The Curie temperature is named after [[Pierre Curie]], who showed that magnetism was lost at a critical temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pierre Curie – Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force of magnetism is determined by the [[magnetic moment]], a [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic dipoles|dipole moment]] within an atom which originates from the [[angular momentum]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] of electrons. Materials have different structures of intrinsic magnetic moments that depend on temperature; the Curie temperature is the critical point at which a material's intrinsic magnetic moments change direction.

Permanent magnetism is caused by the alignment of magnetic moments and induced magnetism is created when disordered magnetic moments are forced to align in an applied magnetic field. For example, the ordered magnetic moments ([[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], Figure 1) change and become disordered ([[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], Figure 2) at the Curie temperature. Higher temperatures make magnets weaker, as spontaneous magnetism only occurs below the Curie temperature. [[Magnetic susceptibility]] above the Curie temperature can be calculated from the [[Curie–Weiss law]], which is derived from [[Curie's law]].

In analogy to ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials, the Curie temperature can also be used to describe the phase transition between [[ferroelectricity]] and [[Dielectric#Paraelectricity|paraelectricity]]. In this context, the [[Phase transition#Order parameters|order parameter]] is the ''electric'' [[Dielectric#Dipolar polarization|polarisation]] that goes from a finite value to zero when the temperature is increased above the Curie temperature.

== Magnetic moments ==

Magnetic moments are permanent [[Magnetic dipole moment|dipole moments]] within an atom that comprise electron angular momentum and spin&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the relation μ&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = el/2m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, where m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of an electron, μ&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnetic moment, and l is the angular momentum; this ratio is called the '''gyromagnetic ratio'''.

The electrons in an atom contribute magnetic moments from their own [[angular momentum]] and from their orbital momentum around the nucleus. Magnetic moments from the nucleus are insignificant in contrast to the magnetic moments from the electrons.&lt;ref name=Jullien136&gt;{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=136–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal contributions result in higher energy electrons disrupting the order and the destruction of the alignment between dipoles. 

[[ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetic]], [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], [[ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] and [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] materials have different intrinsic magnetic moment structures. At a material's specific Curie temperature, these properties change. The transition from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic (or vice versa) occurs at the [[Néel temperature]], which is analogous to Curie temperature.

== Materials with magnetic moments that change properties at the Curie temperature ==

Ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures are made up of intrinsic magnetic moments. If all the electrons within the structure are paired, these moments cancel out due to their opposite spins and angular momenta. Thus, even with an applied magnetic field, these material have different properties and no Curie temperature.&lt;ref name=Ibach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|1968|pp=236–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paramagnetic ===
{{main|Paramagnetism}}

A material is paramagnetic only above its Curie temperature. Paramagnetic materials are non-magnetic when a [[magnetic field]] is absent and magnetic when a magnetic field is applied. When a magnetic field is absent, the material has disordered magnetic moments; that is, the atoms are asymmetrical and not aligned. When a magnetic field is present, the magnetic moments are temporarily realigned parallel to the applied field;&lt;ref name=Dekker1&gt;{{harvnb|Dekker|1958|pp=217–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levy4&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|1968|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the atoms are symmetrical and aligned.&lt;ref name=Fan&gt;{{harvnb|Fan|1987|pp=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic moments being aligned in the same direction are what causes an induced magnetic field.&lt;ref name=Fan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dekker&gt;{{harvnb|Dekker|1958|pp=454–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For paramagnetism, this response to an applied magnetic field is positive and is known as [[magnetic susceptibility]].&lt;ref name=Ibach&gt;{{harvnb|Ibach|Lüth|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic susceptibility only applies above the Curie temperature for disordered states.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn3&gt;{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|1977|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources of paramagnetism (materials which have Curie temperatures) include:&lt;ref name=Levy1&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|1968|pp=198–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All atoms that have unpaired electrons;
* Atoms that have inner shells that are incomplete in electrons;
* [[Free radicals]];
* Metals.

Above the Curie temperature, the atoms are excited, and the spin orientations become randomized&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; but can be realigned by an applied field, i.e., the material becomes paramagnetic. Below the Curie temperature, the intrinsic structure has undergone a [[phase transition]],&lt;ref name=Cusack&gt;{{harvnb|Cusack|1958|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; the atoms are ordered and the material is ferromagnetic.&lt;ref name=Fan/&gt; The paramagnetic materials' induced magnetic fields are very weak compared with ferromagnetic materials' magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Cusack/&gt;

=== Ferromagnetic ===
{{main|Ferromagnetism}}

Materials are only ferromagnetic below their corresponding Curie temperatures. Ferromagnetic materials are magnetic in the absence of an applied magnetic field.

When a magnetic field is absent the material has [[spontaneous magnetization]] which is a result of the ordered magnetic moments; that is, for ferromagnetism, the atoms are symmetrical and aligned in the same direction creating a permanent magnetic field.

The magnetic interactions are held together by [[exchange interactions]]; otherwise thermal disorder would overcome the weak interactions of magnetic moments. The exchange interaction has a zero probability of parallel electrons occupying the same point in time, implying a preferred parallel alignment in the material.&lt;ref name=Hall1&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|pp=220–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boltzmann factor contributes heavily as it prefers interacting particles to be aligned in the same direction.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|2007|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes [[ferromagnets]] to have strong magnetic fields and high Curie temperatures of around 1000&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=Hall3&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the Curie temperature, the atoms are aligned and parallel, causing spontaneous magnetism; the material is ferromagnetic. Above the Curie temperature the material is paramagnetic, as the atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments when the material undergoes a phase transition.&lt;ref name=Cusack/&gt;

=== Ferrimagnetic ===
{{main|Ferrimagnetism}}

Materials are only ferrimagnetic below their corresponding Curie temperature. Ferrimagnetic materials are magnetic in the absence of an applied magnetic field and are made up of two different [[ions]].&lt;ref name=Jullien158/&gt;

When a magnetic field is absent the material has a spontaneous magnetism which is the result of ordered magnetic moments; that is, for ferrimagnetism one ion's magnetic moments are aligned facing in one direction with certain magnitude and the other ion's magnetic moments are aligned facing in the opposite direction with a different magnitude. As the magnetic moments are of different magnitudes in opposite directions there is still a spontaneous magnetism and a magnetic field is present.&lt;ref name=Jullien158&gt;{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=158–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to ferromagnetic materials the magnetic interactions are held together by exchange interactions. The orientations of moments however are anti-parallel which results in a net momentum by subtracting their momentum from one another.&lt;ref name=Jullien158/&gt;

Below the Curie temperature the atoms of each ion are aligned anti-parallel with different momentums causing a spontaneous magnetism; the material is ferrimagnetic. Above the Curie temperature the material is paramagnetic as the atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments as the material undergoes a phase transition.&lt;ref name=Jullien158/&gt;

=== Antiferromagnetic and the Néel temperature ===
{{main|Antiferromagnetism}}

Materials are only antiferromagetic below their corresponding [[Néel temperature]]. This is similar to the Curie temperature as above the Néel Temperature the material undergoes a [[phase transition]] and becomes paramagnetic.

The material has equal magnetic moments aligned in opposite directions resulting in a zero magnetic moment and a net magnetism of zero at all temperatures below the Néel temperature. Antiferromagnetic materials are weakly magnetic in the absence or presence of an applied magnetic field.

Similar to ferromagnetic materials the magnetic interactions are held together by exchange interactions preventing thermal disorder from overcoming the weak interactions of magnetic moments.&lt;ref name=Hall1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jullien10/&gt; When disorder occurs it is at the Néel temperature.&lt;ref name=Jullien10&gt;{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curie–Weiss law ==
{{main|Curie–Weiss law}}
The Curie–Weiss law is an adapted version of [[Curie's law]].

The Curie–Weiss law is a simple model derived from a [[mean field theory|mean-field]] approximation, this means it works well for the materials temperature, {{mvar|T}}, much greater than their corresponding Curie temperature, {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. {{math|''T'' ≫ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}; however fails to describe the [[magnetic susceptibility]], {{mvar|χ}}, in the immediate vicinity of the Curie point because of local fluctuations between atoms.&lt;ref name=Jullien153&gt;{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Curie's law nor the Curie–Weiss law holds for {{math|''T'' &lt; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Curie's law for a paramagnetic material:&lt;ref name=Hall205&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curie–Weiss law is then derived from Curie's law to be:

where:

:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{C} = \frac{C \lambda }{\mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;

{{mvar|λ}} is the Weiss molecular field constant.&lt;ref name=Levy201/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|1997|pp=334–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics ==

=== Approaching Curie temperature from above ===

As the Curie–Weiss law is an approximation, a more accurate model is needed when the temperature, {{mvar|T}}, approaches the material's Curie temperature, {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Magnetic susceptibility occurs above the Curie temperature.

An accurate model of critical behaviour for magnetic susceptibility with [[critical exponent]] {{mvar|γ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi \sim \frac{1}{(T - T_\mathrm{C})^\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

The critical exponent differs between materials and for the [[mean field theory|mean-field]] model is taken as {{mvar|γ}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=Hall227&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|pp=227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As temperature is inversely proportional to magnetic susceptibility, when {{mvar|T}} approaches {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}} the denominator tends to zero and the magnetic susceptibility approaches [[infinity]] allowing magnetism to occur. This is a spontaneous magnetism which is a property of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials.&lt;ref name=Kittel&gt;{{harvnb|Kittel|1986|pp=424–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spaldin|2010|pp=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaching Curie temperature from below ===

Magnetism depends on temperature and spontaneous magnetism occurs below the Curie temperature. An accurate model of critical behaviour for spontaneous magnetism with critical exponent {{mvar|β}}:

:&lt;math&gt;M \sim (T - T_\mathrm{C})^\beta&lt;/math&gt;

The critical exponent differs between materials and for the mean-field model as taken as {{mvar|β}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} where {{math|''T'' ≪  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Hall227/&gt;

The spontaneous magnetism approaches zero as the temperature increases towards the materials Curie temperature.

=== Approaching absolute zero (0 kelvins) ===

The spontaneous magnetism, occurring in ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials, approaches zero as the temperature increases towards the material's Curie temperature. Spontaneous magnetism is at its maximum as the temperature approaches 0&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=Hall4&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the magnetic moments are completely aligned and at their strongest magnitude of magnetism due to no thermal disturbance.

In paramagnetic materials temperature is sufficient to overcome the ordered alignments. As the temperature approaches 0&amp;nbsp;K, the [[entropy]] decreases to zero, that is, the disorder decreases and becomes ordered. This occurs without the presence of an applied magnetic field and obeys the [[third law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=Hall1/&gt;

Both Curie's law and the Curie–Weiss law fail as the temperature approaches 0&amp;nbsp;K. This is because they depend on the magnetic susceptibility which only applies when the state is disordered.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn1&gt;{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|1977|pp=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gadolinium sulphate]] continues to satisfy Curie's law at 1&amp;nbsp;K. Between 0 and 1&amp;nbsp;K the law fails to hold and a sudden change in the intrinsic structure occurs at the Curie temperature.&lt;ref name=Mendelssohn2&gt;{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|1977|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ising model of phase transitions ===

The [[Ising model]] is mathematically based and can analyse the critical points of [[phase transitions]] in ferromagnetic order due to spins of electrons having magnitudes of ±{{sfrac|1|2}}. The spins interact with their neighbouring [[dipole]] electrons in the structure and here the Ising model can predict their behaviour with each other.&lt;ref name=Bertoldi&gt;{{harvnb|Bertoldi|Bringa|Miranda|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brout&gt;{{harvnb|Brout|1965|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model is important for solving and understanding the concepts of phase transitions and hence solving the Curie temperature. As a result, many different dependencies that affect the Curie temperature can be analysed.

For example, the surface and bulk properties depend on the alignment and magnitude of spins and the Ising model can determine the effects of magnetism in this system.

=== Weiss domains and surface and bulk Curie temperatures ===

[[File:Weiss domains in a ferromagnetic material.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 3.''' The Weiss domains in a ferromagnetic material; the magnetic moments are aligned in domains.]]

Materials structures consist of intrinsic magnetic moments which are separated into domains called [[Weiss domains]].&lt;ref name=Jullien160&gt;{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in ferromagnetic materials having no spontaneous magnetism as domains could potentially balance each other out.&lt;ref name=Jullien160/&gt; The position of particles can therefore have different orientations around the surface than the main part (bulk) of the material. This property directly affects the Curie temperature as there can be a bulk Curie temperature {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} and a different surface Curie temperature {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}} for a material.&lt;ref name=Rau&gt;{{harvnb|Rau|Jin|Robert|1988|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allows for the surface Curie temperature to be ferromagnetic above the bulk Curie temperature when the main state is disordered, i.e. Ordered and disordered states occur simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Bertoldi/&gt;

The surface and bulk properties can be predicted by the Ising model and electron capture spectroscopy can be used to detect the electron spins and hence the [[magnetic moments]] on the surface of the material. An average total magnetism is taken from the bulk and surface temperatures to calculate the Curie temperature from the material, noting the bulk contributes more.&lt;ref name=Bertoldi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skomski&gt;{{harvnb|Skomski|Sellmyer|2000|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[angular momentum]] of an electron is either +{{sfrac|{{mvar|ħ}}|2}} or −{{sfrac|{{mvar|ħ}}|2}} due to it having a spin of {{sfrac|1|2}}, which gives a specific size of magnetic moment to the electron; the [[Bohr magneton]].&lt;ref name=Jullien138&gt;{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons orbiting around the nucleus in a current loop create a magnetic field which depends on the Bohr Magneton and [[magnetic quantum number]].&lt;ref name=Jullien138/&gt; Therefore, the magnetic moments are related between angular and orbital momentum and affect each other. Angular momentum contributes twice as much to magnetic moments than orbital.&lt;ref name=Hall1994&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[terbium]] which is a [[rare-earth metal]] and has a high orbital angular momentum the magnetic moment is strong enough to affect the order above its bulk temperatures. It is said to have a high [[anisotropy]] on the surface, that is it is highly directed in one orientation. It remains ferromagnetic on its surface above its Curie temperature while its bulk becomes ferrimagnetic and then at higher temperatures its surface remains ferrimagnetic above its bulk Néel Temperature before becoming completely disordered and paramagnetic with increasing temperature. The anisotropy in the bulk is different from its surface anisotropy just above these phase changes as the magnetic moments will be ordered differently or ordered in paramagnetic materials.&lt;ref name=Rau/&gt;

=== Changing a material's Curie temperature ===

==== Composite materials ====

[[Composite materials]], that is, materials composed from other materials with different properties, can change the Curie temperature. For example, a composite which has [[silver]] in it can create spaces for oxygen molecules in bonding which decreases the Curie temperature&lt;ref name=Hwang&gt;{{harvnb|Hwang et al.|1998|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the crystal lattice will not be as compact.

The alignment of magnetic moments in the composite material affects the Curie temperature. If the materials moments are parallel with each other the Curie temperature will increase and if perpendicular the Curie temperature will decrease&lt;ref name=Hwang/&gt; as either more or less thermal energy will be needed to destroy the alignments.

Preparing composite materials through different temperatures can result in different final compositions which will have different Curie temperatures.&lt;ref name=Paulsen&gt;{{harvnb|Paulsen et al.|2003|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doping (semiconductor)|Doping]] a material can also affect its Curie temperature.&lt;ref name=Paulsen/&gt;

The density of nanocomposite materials changes the Curie temperature. [[Nanocomposites]] are compact structures on a nano-scale. The structure is built up of high and low bulk Curie temperatures, however will only have one mean-field Curie temperature. A higher density of lower bulk temperatures results in a lower mean-field Curie temperature and a higher density of higher bulk temperature significantly increases the mean-field Curie temperature. In more than one dimension the Curie temperature begins to increase as the magnetic moments will need more thermal energy to overcome the ordered structure.&lt;ref name=Skomski/&gt;

==== Particle size ====

The size of particles in a material's crystal lattice changes the Curie temperature. Due to the small size of particles (nanoparticles) the fluctuations of electron spins become more prominent, this results in the Curie temperature drastically decreasing when the size of particles decrease as the fluctuations cause disorder. The size of a particle also affects the [[anisotropy]] causing alignment to become less stable and thus lead to disorder in magnetic moments.&lt;ref name=Bertoldi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lopez-Dominguez&gt;{{harvnb|López Domínguez et al.|2013|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme of this is [[superparamagnetism]] which only occurs in small ferromagnetic particles and is where fluctuations are very influential causing magnetic moments to change direction randomly and thus create disorder.

The Curie temperature of nanoparticles are also affected by the [[crystal lattice]] structure, [[body-centred cubic]] (bcc), [[face-centred cubic]] (fcc) and a [[hexagonal]] structure (hcp) all have different Curie temperatures due to magnetic moments reacting to their neighbouring electron spins. fcc and hcp have tighter structures and as a results have higher Curie temperatures than bcc as the magnetic moments have stronger effects when closer together.&lt;ref name=Bertoldi/&gt; This is known as the [[coordination number]] which is the number of nearest neighbouring particles in a structure. This indicates a lower coordination number at the surface of a material than the bulk which leads to the surface becoming less significant when the temperature is approaching the Curie temperature. In smaller systems the coordination number for the surface is more significant and the magnetic moments have a stronger affect on the system.&lt;ref name=Bertoldi/&gt;

Although fluctuations in particles can be minuscule, they are heavily dependent on the structure of crystal lattices as they react with their nearest neighbouring particles. Fluctuations are also affected by the exchange interaction&lt;ref name=Lopez-Dominguez/&gt; as parallel facing magnetic moments are favoured and therefore have less disturbance and disorder, therefore a tighter structure influences a stronger magnetism and therefore a higher Curie temperature.

==== Pressure ====

Pressure changes a material's Curie temperature. Increasing [[pressure]] on the [[crystal lattice]] decreases the volume of the system. Pressure directly affects the [[kinetic energy]] in particles as movement increases causing the vibrations to disrupt the order of magnetic moments. This is similar to temperature as it also increases the kinetic energy of particles and destroys the order of magnetic moments and magnetism.&lt;ref name=Bose&gt;{{harvnb|Bose et al.|2011|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure also affects the [[density of states]] (DOS).&lt;ref name=Bose/&gt; Here the DOS decreases causing the number of electrons available to the system to decrease. This leads to the number of magnetic moments decreasing as they depend on electron spins. It would be expected because of this that the Curie temperature would decrease however it increases. This is the result of the [[exchange interaction]]. The exchange interaction favours the aligned parallel magnetic moments due to electrons being unable to occupy the same space in time&lt;ref name=Hall1/&gt; and as this is increased due to the volume decreasing the Curie temperature increases with pressure. The Curie temperature is made up of a combination of dependencies on kinetic energy and the DOS.&lt;ref name=Bose/&gt;

The concentration of particles also affects the Curie temperature when pressure is being applied and can result in a decrease in Curie temperature when the concentration is above a certain percent.&lt;ref name=Bose/&gt;

==== Orbital ordering ====

[[Atomic orbital|Orbital ordering]] changes the Curie temperature of a material. Orbital ordering can be controlled through applied [[Deformation (mechanics)|strains]].&lt;ref name=Sadoc&gt;{{harvnb|Sadoc et al.|2010|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a function that determines the wave of a single electron or paired electrons inside the material. Having control over the [[probability]] of where the electron will be allows the Curie temperature to be altered. For example, the [[delocalised]] electrons can be moved onto the same [[lattice plane|plane]] by applied strains within the crystal lattice.&lt;ref name=Sadoc/&gt;

The Curie temperature is seen to increase greatly due to electrons being packed together in the same plane, they are forced to align due to the [[exchange interaction]] and thus increases the strength of the magnetic moments which prevents thermal disorder at lower temperatures.

== Curie temperature in ferroelectric materials ==

In analogy to ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials, the term Curie temperature ({{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is also applied to the temperature at which a [[ferroelectric]] material transitions to being [[paraelectric]]. Hence, {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the temperature where ferroelectric materials lose their spontaneous polarisation as a first or second order phase change occurs. In case of a second order transition the Curie Weiss temperature {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} which defines the maximum of the dielectric constant is equal to the Curie temperature. However, the Curie temperature can be 10 K higher than {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in case of a first order transition.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{harvnb|Webster|1999|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ferroelectric and dielectric ===

Materials are only ferroelectric below their corresponding transition temperature {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Myers404&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|1997|pp=404–05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferroelectric materials are all [[pyroelectric]] and therefore have a spontaneous electric polarisation as the structures are unsymmetrical.

Ferroelectric materials' polarization is subject to [[hysteresis]] (Figure 4); that is they are dependent on their past state as well as their current state. As an electric field is applied the dipoles are forced to align and polarisation is created, when the electric field is removed polarisation remains. The hysteresis loop depends on temperature and as a result as the temperature is increased and reaches {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} the two curves become one curve as shown in the dielectric polarisation (Figure 5).&lt;ref name=Pascoe1&gt;{{harvnb|Pascoe|1973|pp=190–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relative permittivity ===

A modified version of the Curie–Weiss law applies to the dielectric constant, also known as the [[relative permittivity]]:&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webster|1999|pp=6.55–6.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \epsilon_0 + \frac{C}{T-T_\mathrm{0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
A heat-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition is used in [[magneto-optical]] storage media, for erasing and writing of new data. Famous examples include the [[Sony]] [[Minidisc]] format, as well as the now-obsolete [[CD-RW#CD-MO|CD-MO]] format. Curie point electro-magnets have been proposed and tested for actuation mechanisms in passive safety systems of [[Breeder_reactor|fast breeder reactors]], where [[Control_rod|control rods]] are dropped into the reactor core if the actuation mechanism heats up beyond the material's curie point.&lt;ref name="Takamatsu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Takamatsu |title=Demonstration of Control Rod Holding Stability of the Self Actuated Shutdown System in Joyo for Enhancement of Fast Reactor Inherent Safety |journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology |volume=44 |issue=3 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/18811248.2007.9711316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses include temperature control in [[soldering iron]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|TMT-9000S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stabilizing the magnetic field of [[tachometer]] generators against temperature variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pallàs-Areny|Webster|2001|pp=262–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6348">[[Image:Desert varnish.jpg|thumb|250px|Desert varnish on [[Desert Pavement|gibber]], Central Australia ]]
'''Desert varnish''' or '''rock varnish''' is an orange-yellow to black coating found on exposed [[Rock (geology)|rock]] surfaces in [[arid]] environments. Desert varnish is approximately one [[micrometre|micrometer]] thick and exhibits [[nanometer]]-scale layering.&lt;ref&gt;David Krinsley, Ronald Dorn, N. K. Tovey 1995. Nanometer-Scale Layering in Rock Varnish: Implications for Genesis and Paleoenvironmental Interpretation, The Journal of Geology, 103(1): 106–113&lt;/ref&gt; '''Rock rust''' and '''desert patina''' are other terms which are also used for the condition, but less often.

==Formation ==
Desert varnish forms only on physically stable rock surfaces that are no longer subject to frequent [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], fracturing or [[ventifact|wind abrasion]]. The varnish is primarily composed of particles of [[clay]] along with [[iron]] and [[manganese]] [[oxidation|oxides]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, R.S. and Adams, J.B. 1978. Desert varnish: evidence for cyclic deposition of manganese. Nature 276(5687):489–491.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a host of trace elements and almost always some [[organic matter]]. The color of the varnish varies from shades of brown to black.&lt;ref name=Chernicoff&gt;Chernicoff, Stanley and Whitney, Donna 2007. Geology: An Introduction to Physical Geology 4th ed. Pearson Education p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that desert varnish should be investigated as a potential candidate for a "[[shadow biosphere]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, C.E. (2007) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053938 Epistemological issues in the study of microbial life: alternative biospheres]. Studies in the History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38:847–861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/14/shadow-biosphere-alien-life-on-earth "Life on Earth… but not as we know it"], Robin McKie, 14 April 2013, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
[[Image:Desert Varnish on Bishop Tuff-750px.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Desert varnish on [[Bishop Tuff]].]]
Originally scientists thought that the varnish was made from substances drawn out of the rocks it coats.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, W.P. 1905. Superficial blackening and discoloration of rocks especially in desert regions. Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers 35:371–375.&lt;/ref&gt;  Microscopic and microchemical observations, however, show that a major part of varnish is clay, which could only arrive by wind.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, R.M. and Rossman, G.R. 1977. Desert varnish: the importance of clay minerals. Science 196(4297):1446–1448.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay, then, acts as a [[Wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] to catch additional substances that chemically react together when the rock reaches high temperatures in the [[desert]] sun.  Wetting by [[dew]] is also important in the process.&lt;ref name=Chernicoff/&gt;

An important characteristic of black desert varnish is that it has an unusually high concentration of [[manganese]]. Manganese is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, making up only 0.12% of its weight. In black desert varnish, however, manganese is 50 to 60 times more abundant. One proposal&lt;ref&gt;The Photocatalytic Reactions of Desert Varnish, Lacie Johnson (Carrick Eggleston), 2013,  [http://repository.uwyo.edu/ugrd/2013_UGRD/Presentations/58/]&lt;/ref&gt; for a mechanism of desert varnish formation is that it is caused by manganese-oxidizing [[microbe]]s ([[mixotroph]]s) which are common in environments poor in [[Organic matter|organic nutrients]]. A micro-environment [[pH]] above 7.5 is inhospitable for manganese-concentrating microbes. In such conditions, orange varnishes develop, poor in manganese (Mn) but rich in iron (Fe).&lt;ref&gt;Dorn, R.I. and Oberlander, T.M. 1981. Microbial origin of desert varnish. Science 213:1245–1247.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative hypothesis for Mn/Fe fluctuation has been proposed that considers Mn-rich and Fe-rich varnishes to be related to humid and [[arid climate]]s, respectively &lt;ref&gt;Tanzhuo Liu and Ronald I. Dorn 1996. Understanding the Spatial Variability of Environmental Change in Drylands with Rock Varnish Microlaminations. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 86(2): 187–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valley of Fire petroglyphs.jpg|thumb|250px|Petroglyphs carved in desert varnish at the [[Valley of Fire]] near [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Area shown is about one metre across.]]

Even though it contains high concentrations of iron and manganese, there are no significant modern uses of desert varnish. However, some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples created [[petroglyph]]s by scraping or chipping away the dark varnish to expose the lighter rock beneath.

Desert varnish often obscures the identity of the underlying rock, and different rocks have varying abilities to accept and retain varnish. [[Limestone]]s, for example,  typically do not have varnish because they are too water-soluble and therefore do not provide a stable surface for varnish to form. Shiny, dense and black varnishes form on [[basalt]], fine [[quartzite]]s and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] [[shale]]s due to these rocks' relatively high resistance to weathering.

Due to the additional complexity of studying plasmas with charged dust particles, dusty plasmas are also known as '''complex plasmas'''.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;!-- This reference and page covers the entire paragraph. --&gt;

Dusty plasmas are encountered in:

* Industrial processing plasmas
* [[Astrophysical plasma|Space plasmas]]
* The [[mesosphere]] of the Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mps.mpg.de/de/projekte/sousy/sousy_result.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512191150/http://www.mps.mpg.de/de/projekte/sousy/sousy_result.html |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dusty plasmas are interesting because the presence of particles significantly alters the [[charged particle equilibrium]] leading to different phenomena. It is a field of current research. Electrostatic coupling between the grains can vary over a wide range so that the states of the dusty plasma can change from weakly coupled (gaseous) to crystalline. Such plasmas are of interest as a non-[[Hamiltonian system]] of interacting particles and as a means to study generic fundamental physics of [[self-organization]], pattern formation, [[phase transition]]s, and [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]].

==Characteristics==

The '''temperature''' of dust in a plasma may be quite different from its environment. For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"
|-
! Dust plasma component
! Temperature
|-
| Dust temperature
| align=right | 10 K
|-
| Molecular temperature
| align=right | 100 K
|-
| Ion temperature
| align=right | 1,000 K
|-
| Electron temperature
| align=right | 10,000 K
|}

The '''[[electric potential]]''' of dust particles is typically 1–10 V (positive or negative). The potential is usually negative because the electrons are more [[electron mobility|mobile]] than the ions. The physics is essentially that of a [[Langmuir probe]] that draws no net current, including formation of a [[Debye sheath]] with a thickness of a few times the [[Debye length]]. If the electrons charging the dust grains are relativistic, then the dust may charge to several kilovolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1979Ap&amp;SS..65....5M | title=Dust in cosmic plasma environments | journal=Astrophysics and Space Science | volume=65 | issue=1 | pages=5–12 | year=1979 | authors=Mendis, D. A. | doi=10.1007/bf00643484}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field electron emission]], which tends to reduce the negative potential, can be important due to the small size of the particles. The [[photoelectric effect]] and the impact of positive ions may actually result in a positive potential of the dust particles.

==Dynamics==
Interest in the dynamics of charged dust in plasmas was amplified by the detection of [[Rings of Saturn#Spokes|spokes]] in the rings of Saturn.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt; {{rp|85}} The motion of solid particles in a plasma follows the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d v}{dt} = \mathbf{F_{L}} + \mathbf{F_G} + \mathbf{F_P}  + \mathbf{F_D} + \mathbf{F_T}&lt;/math&gt;
where terms are for the Lorentz force, the gravitational forces, forces due to radiation pressure, the drag forces and the thermophoretic force respectively.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|70}}

The [[Lorentz force]], the contributions from the electric and magnetic force, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{L} = q \left ( \mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
where '''E''' is the electric field, '''v''' is the velocity and '''B''' is the magnetic field.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt; {{rp|71}}

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_g}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of all [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational forces]] acting on the dust particle, whether it be from planets, satellites or other particles&lt;ref name=IntroShukla&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=P. K.|last2=Mamun|first2=A. A.|title=Introduction to Dusty Plasma Physics|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7503-0653-9|pages=70–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WR5pAYrdQ9cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75,76}} and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_P}&lt;/math&gt; is the force contribution from radiation pressure. This is given as:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{P}= \frac{\pi r_d^2 }{c} I \mathbf{\hat{e_i}}&lt;/math&gt;
The direction of the force vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e_i}}&lt;/math&gt; is that of the incident radiation of photon flux &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. The radius of the dust particle is &lt;math&gt;r_d&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|83}}

For the drag force there are two major components of interest, those from positive ions-dust particle interactions, and neutral-dust particle interactions.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|76}} Ion-dust interactions are further divided into three different interactions, through regular collisions, through Debye sheath modifications, and through [[coulomb collision]]s.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|77}}

The [[Thermophoresis#Thermophoretic force|thermophoretic force]] is the force that arises from the net temperature gradient that may be present in a plasma, and the subsequent pressure imbalance; causing more net momentum to be imparted from collisions from a specific direction.&lt;ref name=IntroShukla /&gt;{{rp|80}}

Then depending in the size of the particle, there are four categories:
#'''Very small particles''', where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_L}&lt;/math&gt; dominates over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_G}&lt;/math&gt; .
#'''Small grains''', where q/m ≈ {{radic|G}}, and plasma still plays a major role in the dynamics.
#'''Large grains''', where the electromagnetic term is negligible, and the particles are referred to as grains. Their motion is determined by gravity and viscosity.
#'''Large solid bodies'''. In centimeter and meter-sized bodies, viscosity may cause significant perturbations that can change an orbit. In kilometer-sized (or more) bodies, gravity and inertia dominate the motion.

==Laboratory Dusty plasmas==

Dusty plasmas are often studied in laboratory setups. The dust particles can be grown inside the plasma, or [[microparticles]] can be inserted. Usually, a [[low temperature plasma]] with a low degree of ionization is used. The microparticles then become the dominant component regarding the energy and momentum transport, and they can essentially be regarded as single-species system. This system can exist in all three classical [[phase (matter)|phases]], solid, liquid and gaseous, and can be used to study effects such as crystallization, wave and shock propagation, defect propagation, etc.

When particles of micrometer-size are used, it is possible to observe the individual particles. Their movement is slow enough to be able to be observed with ordinary cameras, and the kinetics of the system can be studied. However, for micrometer-sized particles, gravity is a dominant force that disturbs the system. Thus, experiments are sometimes performed under [[microgravity]] conditions during [[parabolic flight]]s or on board a [[space station]].

The '''Experimental Beryllium Oxide Reactor''' ('''EBOR''') was a 10MWt [[helium]] cooled [[beryllium]] [[neutron moderator|moderated]] [[nuclear reactor]] at [[Idaho National Laboratory]]. It never achieved criticality. The project started on February 17, 1958 as the Maritime Gas-Cooled Reactor. The project started with a contract between the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and General Dynamics. The Goal of the project was to create a small nuclear reactor for use in merchant shipping or in a medium sized power plant. The main goals for the reactor were a simple design, low maintenance costs and maximum efficiency over a wide range of power settings. In December 1960 the project was authorized to construct a 10-Mw test reactor to determine the characteristics of the Beryllium Oxide gas cooled system. The EBOR was designed to test the basic fuel element and moderator designs for the final reactor. The EBOR used a Helium cooling system and was an intermediate step towards a prototype power plant. The plan was to use a closed cycle turbine or a steam cycle with the reactor to make a small land based or maritime power plant. This plan was abandoned as the reactor never achieved criticality.

'''''Freddy Fox''''' ({{ISBN|0-9754701-0-8}}) is a [[hardcover]] [[picture book]] written and illustrated by [[Ronald J. Meyer]]. It tells the story of a young fox and his family, following the daily activities of the fox kit, Freddy.  Freddy Fox teaches the reader about [[red fox]]es, including that they are born shades of gray, how their den is built, what they eat, and family size. Then through a simple segue, Freddy's red fox mother teaches the young fox about other animals and traits attributed to them.  By learning his lessons, Freddy will grow up to be a wise fox.  All of the lessons, such as the [[bear]] eats a balanced diet or the [[raccoon]] washes his hands before eating, can easily be translated into lessons for young children.

The book was first published in 2004. It won the Silver [[Mom's Choice Award]] in the "Animal Kingdom" category in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php Mom's Choice Awards 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225071706/http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author is a [[wildlife photography|wildlife photographer]], and he used his wildlife photographs to illustrate the book.

[[File:Secret Garden, Cliveden (7958662690).jpg|thumb| Secret Garden, [[Cliveden]] August 2012.]]

'''Garden Sanctuary''' is a concept that follows on from the popular understanding of a therapeutic "Secret Garden" first imagined by [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]].

== Outlines ==
* Since reading The Secret Garden as a child, tucked away botanical places have held a special meaning.
* The thought that one might be self-contained; hidden from the rest of the world; close to others and yet so deliciously alone.

== A Secret Garden, or a Garden Sanctuary ==
A Secret Garden, or a Garden Sanctuary, may be:
* the power of a private garden to heal therapeutically, first popularized by [[The Secret Garden]], the 1911 novel by [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]
*Overlying these healing uses is the use of the term [[My Secret Garden|My Secret Garden by Nancy Friday]] in 1973 to open up women's sexual fantasies.

'''Gaspar Makale''' (1960 circa. to December 2007, [[Tanzania]]) was one of the pioneers of solar electrification in the [[African Great Lakes]]. During the 1990s, he was the Chief Solar Technician at the KARADEA Solar Training Facility (KSTF)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.karadea.org/kstf/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Karagwe]] district, [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] region in Northern Tanzania, situated between [[Lake Victoria]] and Rwanda.

KSTF, the first dedicated training centre for [[solar energy]] technology in the African Great Lakes, was founded by Oswald Kasazi in 1993. During the following decade KSTF gave regular three-week-long training courses which were attended by people from all over the African Great Lakes region (Tanzania, [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]]), as well as from further afield. The courses were held in partnership with Alternative Energy Africa (EAA), run by Mark Hankins&lt;ref&gt;''Solar Electric Systems for Africa'' by Mark Hankins, Kenya, {{ISBN|0-85092-453-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-85092-453-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Daniel Kithokoi,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''From Space to Earth – The Story of Solar Electricity'' by John Perlin, published by Aatec Publications, USA, {{ISBN|0-937948-14-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-937948-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were based in Nairobi, Kenya. Gaspar Makale managed the practical sessions as well as arranging for the field-trips during which course participants installed solar electric domestic systems in the Karagwe district.

KSTF also ran a solar apprentice scheme for which Gaspar Makale was responsible. He was also involved in other solar training courses in Tanzania, such as the one held at Wasso Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;''Solar Electricity in a Maasai Hospital'' by Mark Hankins, published in Home Power Magazine, USA, Issue 64, April/May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; situated in Maasailand, Tanzania. Course participants, many of whom later went on to set up solar businesses and work in the growing African Great Lakes solar industry, got their first hands-on experience of installing solar electric systems under Gaspar Makale's experienced and expert guidance. He installed an Ampair Hawk 100 [[wind turbine]] at KSTF for charging batteries, the first wind turbine installed in that part of Tanzania. He also ran his own solar business.

While working with KSTF, Gaspar Makale installed numerous solar systems in local schools, hospitals, clinic refrigeration systems, two-way radio systems, domestic lighting systems. He also installed systems in the refugee camps that sprung up in Karagwe after the [[Rwanda genocide]] in 1994. He made one trip to the USA where he attended solar and wind energy courses at Solar Energy International&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarenergy.org/ SEI: Welcome to Solar Energy International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]]. He also ran a solar-powered disco in his own village where he lived with his family on a small farm.

Gaspar Makale also worked closely with Harold Burris of Solar Shamba,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; one of the very first people to see the potential of solar electricity in the African Great Lakes, and with Frank Jackson&lt;ref&gt;''Photovoltaics for Professionals'', English language adaptation by Frank Jackson, published by Solarpraxis AG, Germany, {{ISBN|3-934595-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; from APSO (the Irish state overseas development agency), who worked at KSTF during the 1990s.

'''Tristan da Cunha''' is an [[archipelago]] of five islands in the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]], the largest of which is the island of [[Tristan da Cunha]] itself and the second-largest the remote bird haven [[Gough Island]]. It forms part of a wider territory called [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]] which includes [[Saint Helena]] and [[Ascension Island]].

==Location and description==
[[File:Tristan da Cunha ASTER.jpg|thumb|right|Tristan da Cunha island]]
This archipelago, 1500 miles (2500&amp;nbsp;km) from the continents of Africa and South America, is one of the most remote inhabited places on earth. It consists of the following islands:
* the main island Tristan da Cunha and its surrounding islands
** [[Tristan da Cunha]], the main island and largest ({{coord|37|6|44|S|12|16|56|W|type:isle|name=Tristan da Cunha}}) area: {{convert|113|km2|sqmi}}{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
** [[Inaccessible Island]] area: {{convert|14|km2|sqmi}}
** [[Nightingale Islands]] area: {{convert|3.4|km2|sqmi}}
*** [[Nightingale Island]] area: {{convert|3.2|km2|sqmi}}
*** [[Middle Island, Tristan da Cunha|Middle Island]] area: {{convert|0.1|km2|acre}}
*** [[Stoltenhoff Island]] area: {{convert|0.1|km2|acre}}
* [[Gough Island]] (''Diego Alvarez'') area: {{convert|68|km2|sqmi}} important as the largest undisturbed cool-temperate island habitat in the South Atlantic Ocean.

The main island is quite mountainous; the only flat area is the location of the capital, [[Edinburgh of the Seven Seas]], on the northwest coast. The highest point is a volcano called [[Queen Mary's Peak]] {{convert|2062|m|ft}}; it is covered by [[snow]] in winter and is listed as an [[ultra prominent peak]]. Tristan da Cunha is thought to have been formed by a long-lived centre of upwelling [[magma]] called the [[Tristan hotspot]].

The climate is marine cool-temperate with small temperature differences between summer and winter (11.3° - 14.5°) and between day and night. [[Sandy Point, Tristan da Cunha|Sandy Point]] on the east coast is reputed to be the warmest and driest place on the island, being in the lee of the [[prevailing wind]]s.

==Flora==
[[File:Gough island top view.png|thumb|[[Gough Island]], Tristan da Cunha]]
Even the smaller islands have some plant cover, with the larger ones dominated by [[fern]]s and [[moss]]. Flora on the archiplego includes many [[endemic species]] and many that have a broad circumpolar distribution in the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans. Thus many of the species that occur in Tristan da Cunha occur as far away as [[New Zealand]]. For example, the species ''[[Nertera depressa]]'' was first collected in Tristan da Cunha,&lt;ref&gt;Linnean Society of London. 1906. ''The journal of the Linnean Society of London'', Published by Academic Press for the Linnean Society of London., v. 37
&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been recorded in occurrence as far distant as New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=95431 ''Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213134120/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=95431 |date=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Tristan da Cunha is home to ocean-going species including [[subantarctic fur seal]], the [[southern elephant seal]] and birds such as [[northern rockhopper penguin]]s and [[macaroni penguin]]s. The islands are important for their bird life both those established on the islands and breeding seabirds, of which twenty species nest on Gough Island alone. Important species include [[Tristan albatross]], [[Tristan thrush]], [[Tristan bunting]], [[Gough bunting]], [[Gough moorhen]], [[Atlantic petrel]], and the [[Inaccessible Island rail]]. There are no native reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fish, or land mammals.

==Human settlement==
Apart from Tristan da Cunha, which was settled as a base for [[whaling]] and [[seal hunting|sealing]] in the 18th century, the islands of the group are uninhabited except for a weather station on Gough Island belonging to [[South Africa]]. Fishing is still an important economic activity especially for [[crayfish]] and [[octopus]] but also the [[Tristan rock lobster]] ''(Jasus tristani)''. Gough Island has also been used as base for whaling and sealing but only ever temporarily. The islands do receive a small number of tourists.

==Threats and preservation==
Sheep and cattle have been introduced on Tristan da Cunha and their grazing, along with other human activity has caused damage to the island's ecosystems. Night fishing has caused the deaths of many seabirds as they crash into ships' lights.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, P. G. 1991.

A '''halonium ion''' in [[organic chemistry]] is any [[onium compounds|onium compound]] (ion) containing a [[halogen]] atom carrying a positive charge. This [[cation]] has the general structure R–{{overset|+|X}}–R where X is any halogen and R any organic residue and this structure can be cyclic or an open chain molecular structure. Halonium ions formed from [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]] are called [[fluoronium]], chloronium, bromonium, and iodonium, respectively.  The cyclic variety commonly proposed as intermediates in electrophilic halogenation may be called haliranium ions, using the [[Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature|Hantzch-Widman nomenclature]] system. 

==Structure==
The simplest halonium ions are of the structure H–{{overset|+|X}}–H (X = F, Cl, Br, I). Halonium ions often have a three-atom cyclic structure, similar to that of an [[epoxide]], resulting from the formal addition of a halogenium ion X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to a C=C [[double bond]], as when a halogen is added to an [[alkene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/H02728.html IUPAC Gold Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The propensity to form bridging halonium ions is in the order I &gt; Br &gt; Cl &gt; F.  Whereas iodine and bromine readily form bridged iodonium and bromonium ions, fluoronium ions have only recently been characterized in designed systems that force close encounter of the fluorine lone pair and a carbocationic center.  In practice, structurally, there is a continuum between a symmetrically bridged halonium, to an unsymmetrical halonium with a long weak bond to one of the carbon centers, to a true β-halocarbocation with no halonium character.  The equilibrium structure depends on the ability of the carbon atoms and the halogen to accommodate positive charge.  Thus, a bromonium ion that bridges a primary and tertiary carbon will often exhibit a skewed structure, with a weak bond to the tertiary center (with significant carbocation character) and stronger bond to the primary carbon.   This is due to the increased stability of tertiary carbons to stabilize positive charge.  In the more extreme case, if the tertiary center is doubly benzylic for instance, then the open form may be favored.  Similarly, switching from bromine to chlorine also weakens bridging character, due to the higher electronegativity of chlorine and lower propensity to share electron density compared to bromine. 

==Reactivity==
These ions are usually only short-lived reaction intermediates; they are very reactive, owing to high [[ring strain]] in the three-membered ring and the positive charge on the halogen; this positive charge makes them great [[electrophile|electrophiles]]. In almost all cases, the halonium ion is attacked by a [[nucleophile]] within a very short time. Even a weak nucleophile, such as [[H2O|water]] will attack the halonium ion; this is how [[halohydrin]]s can be made.

On occasion, a halonium atom will rearrange to a [[carbocation]]. This usually occurs only when that carbocation is an allylic or a benzylic carbocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bruice | first1=Paula Yurkanis | title=Organic Chemistry | edition=7th | publisher=Pearson Education | year=2014 | isbn=0-321-80322-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Halonium ions were first postulated in 1937 by Roberts and Kimball&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Halogenation of Ethylenes |first1=Irving |last1=Roberts |first2=George E. |last2=Kimball | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | doi = 10.1021/ja01284a507 | year = 1937 | volume = 59 | pages = 947 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to account for observed ''anti'' [[diastereoselectivity]] in [[halogen addition reaction]]s to [[alkene]]s. They correctly argued that if the initial reaction intermediate in bromination is the open-chain X–C–C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, rotation around the C–C [[single bond]] would be possible leading to a mixture of equal amounts of dihalogen [[Syn and anti addition|''syn'' isomer]] and ''anti'' isomer, which is not the case. They also asserted that a positively charged halogen atom is [[isoelectronic]] with oxygen and that carbon and bromine have comparable [[ionization potential]]s.  For certain aryl substituted alkenes, the ''anti'' stereospecificity is diminished or lost, as a result of weakened or absent halonium character in the cationic intermediate.

The '''Hertzsprung Gap''' is a feature of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] for a star cluster. It is named after [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]], who first noticed the absence of stars in the region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram between A5 and G0 [[spectral type]] and between +1 and −3 [[absolute magnitude]]s (i.e. between the top of the [[main sequence]] and the [[red giant]]s for stars above roughly 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[solar mass]]. When a star during its [[Stellar evolution|evolution]] crosses the Hertzsprung gap, it means that it has finished [[Proton-proton chain reaction|core hydrogen burning]], but has yet to start hydrogen shell burning.

Stars do exist in the Hertzsprung gap region, but because they move through this section of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram very quickly in comparison to the lifetime of the star (thousands of years, compared to tens of billions of years for the lifetime of the star&lt;ref&gt;Binney, J. and Merrifield, M., "Galactic Astronomy," Table 5.2, Figure 5.2, pp. 266–271.&lt;/ref&gt;), that portion of the diagram is less densely populated. Full Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams of the 11,000 [[Hipparcos]] mission targets show a handful of stars in that region.&lt;ref&gt;Binney, J. and Merrifield, M., "Galactic Astronomy," Figure 3.5, pp. 102–103, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=June 2016}}

[[Image:Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross 1 - WW Denslow - Project Gutenberg etext 18546.jpg|thumb|[[William Wallace Denslow]]'s illustrations for a variant of ''Ride a cock horse'', from a 1901 edition of [[Mother Goose]].]]

A '''hobby horse''' (or '''hobby-horse''') is a child's [[toy]] [[horse]], particularly popular during the days before cars. Children played at riding a wooden hobby horse made of a straight stick with a small horse's head (of wood or stuffed fabric), and perhaps reins, attached to one end. The bottom end of the stick sometimes had a small wheel or wheels attached. This toy was also sometimes known as a '''cock horse''' (as in the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross]]'') or '''stick horse'''.

Hobby horses feature in the worship of [[Rajasthan]]i folk deity [[Baba Ramdevji]], a reference to a [[Baba Ramdevji#Folklore about Baba Ramdevji|story about his childhood]]; wooden toy horses are popular offerings at his temple at [[Ramdevra]]. They also figured in the public rites of the [[Romania]]n [[Călușari]].&lt;ref&gt;O. Buhociu, ''Le folklore roumain de printemps'', 1957, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other meanings ==
A hobby horse is not always a riding-stick like the child's toy; larger [[hobby horse]]s feature in some traditional seasonal customs (such as [[Mummers Play]]s and the [[Morris dance]] in [[England]]). They vary in size from a costume for one person to large frameworks carried by nine people.

[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate V. My Uncle Toby on his Hobby-horse.jpg|thumb|right|In ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'', the characters' hobby-horses, or particular obsessions, are discussed in detail. Here, Uncle Toby's obsession with the military leads him and Trim - who gets caught up in Toby's enthusiasm - to begin acting out military actions. Illustration by [[George Cruikshank]].]]
From "hobby horse" (see [[Hobby horse (toy)#Etymology|Etymology]], below) came the expression "to ride one's hobby-horse", meaning "to follow a favourite pastime", and in turn, the modern sense of the term ''[[hobby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"hobby," The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2010-06-26. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50106771]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also connected to the ''[[draisine]]'', a forerunner of the [[bicycle]], invented by Baron [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]].  In 1818, a London coach-maker named Denis Johnson began producing an improved version, which was popularly known as the "hobby-horse".&lt;ref&gt;David V. Herlihy, ''Bicycle'', Yale University Press, 2004; pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic movement, [[Dada]], is possibly named after a French child's word for hobby-horse.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dachy, Dada &amp; les dadaïsmes, Paris, Gallimard, "Folio Essais", n° 257, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''hobby'' is glossed by the [[OED]] as "a small or middle-sized horse; an ambling or pacing horse; a pony." The word is attested in English from the 14th century, as [[Middle English]] ''hobyn''. [[Old French]] had ''hobin'' or ''haubby'', whence Modern French ''aubin'' and Italian ''ubino''. But the Old French term is apparently adopted from English rather than vice versa. OED connects it to "the by-name ''Hobin'', ''Hobby''", a variant of ''Robin''" (compare the abbreviation ''Hob'' for ''Robert''). This appears to have been a name customarily given to a cart-horse, as attested by [[White Kennett]] in his ''Parochial Antiquities '' (1695), who stated that "Our ploughmen to some one of their cart-horses generally give the name of Hobin, the very word which [[Philippe de Commines|Phil. Comines]] uses, Hist. VI. vii." Another familiar form of the same Christian name, ''Dobbin'' has also become a generic name for a cart-horse.

[[Samuel Johnson]], ''Dictionary of the English Language'', 1755, glosses "A strong, active horse, of a middle size, said to have been originally from Ireland; an ambling nag."

== Further use ==
Hoblers or Hovellers were men who kept a light nag that they may give instant information of threatened invasion. (Old French, hober, to move up and down; our hobby, q.v.) In mediæval times their duties were to reconnoitre, to carry intelligence, to harass stragglers, to act as spies, to intercept convoys, and to pursue fugitives. [[Henry Spelman]] (d. 1641) derived the word from "hobby".

{{quote|Hobblers were another description of cavalry more lightly armed, and taken from the class of men rated at 15 pounds and upwards.|[[John Lingard]]|''The History of England'', (1819), vol. iv. chap. ii. p. 116.}}

The Border horses, called hobblers or [[Horses in the Middle Ages#Hobbies|hobbies]], were small and active, and trained to cross the most difficult and boggy country, "and to get over where our footmen could scarce dare to follow." - [[George MacDonald Fraser]], ''The Steel Bonnets, The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers''.

[[Hobby Horse Polo]] uses parts of the [[polo]] rules but has its own specialities, as e.g. 'punitive sherries' and is using hobby horses instead of ponies. The Hobby Horse variant started 1998 as a fun sport in south western Germany and lead 2002 to the foundation of the First Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club in [[Mannheim]]. In the meantime it gained further interest in other German cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/steckenpferdpolo-trendsportart-in-duesseldorf-im-rheinpark-a-994129.html|title=Steckenpferdpolo: Trendsportart in Dsseldorf im Rheinpark|author=((Spiegel online, Hamburg, Germany))|date=27 September 2014|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hobby horse activities ==
[[File:Hobby horse jumping.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Jumping with a hobby horse.]]
Nowadays hobby horses are not only ridden by children, but also teenagers and adults. Hobby horses have become a popular hobby in Northern Europe, especially in Finland. Horses used are not mass produced toy horses, but fine, realistic pieces of art usually done completely by hand. Hobbyists give each of their horses names, breeds, genders and personalities. They also compete with hobby horses in same disciplines as real horses, the most popular disciplines being dressage and show jumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/a-horse-is-a-horse-except-sometimes-its-a-hobbyhorse/75088|title=Why Are Teenage Girls Riding Stick-Horses — Competitively?|last=Zublin|first=Fiona|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Cartoons==

The hobby horse has been used numerous times in classic cartoons and in some new ones incorporating a Wild West theme.

*The [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon [[Buckaroo Bugs]] had [[Bugs Bunny]] riding a hobby horse while shooting a gun to escape from Red Hot Ryder as the Masked Marauder.
*There is another Looney Tunes cartoon called Wagon Heels, and it shows Injun Joe using the toy to head to a massacre.
*There is another Looney Tunes cartoon called Hobby Horse Laffs, but instead of a hobby horse in the title card, it shows a [[rocking horse]] instead.
*There is a Merrie Melodies cartoon called I've Got to Sing a Torch Song. In one short scene, a caricature of [[Ed Wynn]] rode a revamped version of a hobby horse towards a microphone to make an announcement.
*The [[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]] episode Peck Clowns Around had Peck dressed up as a [[rodeo clown]] riding a hobby horse instead of a real horse, like Sparky, that Sheriff Callie used in a rodeo. He thought it was humiliating, and he was laughed at by the entire audience, making Peck very angry.
*One of [[Spot the Dog]]'s toys is a hobby horse, usually stored under the stairs or in a closet in his house. It was used numerous times in Spot cartoons animated by [[King Rollo Films]]. In the Discover Spot episode Spot's Hobby Horse, Spot rides his hobby horse outdoors, then Steve takes a turn. When Helen strolls by the neighborhood to say hello to her friends, she is fascinated by Spot's hobby horse, so Steve hands it over to her. Steve then uses a stick as a hobby horse for the rest of this episode. Spot uses a [[broom]] and rides it like a hobby horse after failing to use a hose as one for the rest of this episode as well. The toy was also used in the Discover Spot episode Spot's Show, except it was used by Tom this time when he was pretending to be a cowboy in Spot's theatrical production. The Adventures of Spot episode Spot Goes to a Party has Spot dressed up as a cowboy going to a [[costume party]]. Sally gives him his hobby horse as an accessory to complete his look, explaining to him "Here's something else for your costume!" He then takes his hobby horse over to the party located at Helen's house but he left it over there. It is unknown if he ever picked up the toy from Helen's house to take back to his house. Instead of taking his hobby horse home, Spot rode home in a two person yellow polka dotted horse [[costume]], controlled by Steve and Tom, while acting like a cute little cowboy shouting "Howdy Mom! It was a great party!"

The '''IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation''' (CEC) is one of the largest and most important conferences within [[Evolutionary computation]] (EC), the other conferences of similar importance being [[Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference]] (GECCO), [[Parallel Problem Solving from Nature]] (PPSN) and [[European Conference on Genetic Programming]] (EuroGP).

CEC, which is organized by the [[IEEE Computational Intelligence Society]] in cooperation with the [[Evolutionary Programming Society]], covers most subtopics of EC, such as [[Evolutionary robotics]], [[Multiobjective optimization]], [[Evolvable hardware]], [[Theory of evolutionary computation]], [[Evolutionary design]] etc. Papers can also be found that deal with topics which are related to rather than part of EC, such [[Ant colony optimization]], [[Swarm intelligence]] and [[Quantum computing]].

The conference usually attracts several hundreds of attendees, as well as hundreds of papers.

'''John Francis Brady''' (born January 8, 1954) is the Chevron Professor of Chemical Engineering and Executive Officer of Chemical Engineering at the [[California Institute of Technology]].  He is a fluid mechanician and creator of the [[Stokesian dynamics]] method for simulating suspensions of spheres and ellipsoids in low Reynolds number flows.

==Education and career==
Brady was educated in chemical engineering at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (B.S. 1975), the [[University of Cambridge]], England (Certificate of Postgraduate Study, 1976), and [[Stanford University]] (M.S. 1977 and Ph.D. 1981). He completed his dissertation entitled Inertial effects in closed cavity flows and their influence in drop breakup advised by Professor [[Andreas Acrivos]].  Following his Ph.D, Brady was a NATO post-doctoral fellow at the Ecole Superiéure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France (1980–81).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.che.caltech.edu/faculty/brady_j/ John F. Brady] at [[California Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his research in France, Brady joined the faculty in chemical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] as an assistant professor in 1981.  He moved in 1985 to the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the [[California Institute of Technology]], which has been his academic home since. &lt;br /&gt;
 
Brady is an expert in fluid mechanics, rheology and transport phenomena, particularly for suspensions and complex fluids.  Among his many accomplishments is the creation of [[Stokesian dynamics]]&lt;ref&gt;

A '''leaf spring''' is a simple form of [[spring (device)|spring]] commonly used for the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] in [[wheel]]ed [[vehicle]]s.  Originally called a ''laminated'' or ''carriage spring'', and sometimes referred to as a '''semi-[[ellipse|elliptical]] spring''' or '''cart spring''', it is one of the oldest forms of springing, appearing on carriages in England after 1750 and from there migrating to France and Germany. &lt;ref name="Sheldon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Leaf Springs: Their Characteristics and Methods of Specification|date=1912|publisher=Sheldon Axle Company|location=Wilkesbarre, PA|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6T0uAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=leaf+spring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2zbie9dDXAhWi44MKHX95AX0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=leaf%20spring&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leaf spring takes the form of a slender [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]-shaped length of [[spring steel]] of [[rectangle|rectangular]] cross-section. In the most common configuration, the center of the arc provides location for the [[axle]], while loops formed at either end provide for attaching to the vehicle chassis. For very heavy vehicles, a leaf spring can be made from several leaves stacked on top of each other in several layers, often with progressively shorter leaves. Leaf springs can serve locating and to some extent damping as well as springing functions. While the interleaf friction provides a damping action, it is not well controlled and results in [[stiction]] in the motion of the suspension. For this reason, some manufacturers have used mono-leaf springs.

A leaf spring can either be attached directly to the [[Frame (vehicle)|frame]] at both ends or attached directly at one end, usually the front, with the other end attached through a shackle, a short swinging arm. The shackle takes up the tendency of the leaf spring to elongate when compressed and thus makes for softer springiness. Some springs terminated in a concave end, called a ''spoon end'' (seldom used now), to carry a swiveling member.

The leaf spring has seen a modern development in cars. The new Volvo XC90 (from 2016 year model and forward) has a transverse leaf spring in high tech composite materials, a solution that is similar to the latest Chevrolet Corvette. This means a straight leaf spring, that is tightly secured to the chassis, and the ends of the spring bolted to the wheel suspension, to allow the spring to work independently on each wheel. This means the suspension is smaller, flatter and lighter than a traditional setup.

==History==
There are a variety of leaf springs, usually employing the word "elliptical". "Elliptical" or "full elliptical" leaf springs referred to two circular arcs linked at their tips. This was joined to the frame at the top center of the upper arc, the bottom center was joined to the "live" suspension components, such as a solid front axle. Additional suspension components, such as [[trailing arm]]s, would usually be needed for this design, but not for "semi-elliptical" leaf springs as used in the [[Hotchkiss drive]]. That employed the lower arc, hence its name. "Quarter-elliptic" springs often had the thickest part of the stack of leaves stuck into the rear end of the side pieces of a short ladder frame, with the free end attached to the differential, as in the [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]] of the 1920s. As an example of non-elliptic leaf springs, the [[Ford Model T]] had multiple leaf springs over its differential that were curved in the shape of a [[yoke]]. As a substitute for dampers ([[shock absorber]]s), some manufacturers laid non-metallic sheets in between the metal leaves, such as wood.

Leaf springs were very common on [[automobiles]], right up to the 1970s in Europe and Japan and late 1970s in America when the move to [[front-wheel drive]], and more sophisticated [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] designs saw [[automobile manufacturer]]s use [[spring (device)|coil springs]] instead. Today leaf springs are still used in heavy commercial vehicles such as [[van]]s and [[truck]]s, [[SUV]]s, and [[railway carriage]]s. For heavy vehicles, they have the advantage of spreading the load more widely over the vehicle's chassis, whereas coil springs transfer it to a single point. Unlike coil springs, leaf springs also locate the rear axle, eliminating the need for [[trailing arm]]s and a [[Panhard rod]], thereby saving cost and weight in a simple [[live axle]] rear suspension. A further advantage of a leaf spring over a helical spring is that the end of the leaf spring may be guided along a definite path.

A more modern implementation is the parabolic leaf spring. This design is characterized by fewer leaves whose thickness varies from centre to ends following a [[parabola|parabolic curve]]. In this design, inter-leaf friction is unwanted, and therefore there is only contact between the springs at the ends and at the centre where the axle is connected. Spacers prevent contact at other points. Aside from a weight saving, the main advantage of parabolic springs is their greater flexibility, which translates into vehicle [[ride quality]] that approaches that of coil springs. There is a trade-off in the form of reduced load carrying capability, however. The characteristic of parabolic springs is better riding comfort and not as "stiff" as conventional "multi-leaf springs". It is widely used on [[buses]] for better comfort. A further development by the British GKN company and by Chevrolet with the Corvette among others, is the move to composite plastic leaf springs. Nevertheless, due to missing inter-leaf friction and internal dampening effects, this type of spring requires more powerful dampers or shock absorbers.

Typically when used in automobile suspension the leaf both supports an axle and locates/ partially locates the axle. This can lead to handling issues (such as 'axle tramp'), as the flexible nature of the spring makes precise control of the [[unsprung mass]] of the axle difficult. Some suspension designs use a [[Watts link]] (or a [[Panhard rod]]) and radius arms to locate the axle and do not have this drawback. Such designs can use softer springs, resulting in better ride. The various Austin-Healey 3000's and [[Fiat 128]]'s rear suspension are examples.

==Characteristics==
The leaf spring acts as a linkage for holding the axle in position and thus separate linkages are not necessary.
It makes the construction of the suspension simple and strong.

Because the positioning of the axle is carried out by the leaf springs, it is disadvantageous to use soft springs
i.e. springs with low spring constant.

Therefore, this type of suspension does not provide good riding comfort.
The inter-leaf friction between the leaf springs affects the riding comfort.

Acceleration and braking torque cause wind-up and vibration. Also wind-up causes rear-end squat and nose-diving.

The inter-leaf friction damps the spring's motion and reduces rebound, which until [[shock absorber]]s were widely adopted was a great advantage over helical springs.&lt;ref&gt;"Springs - A simple study of car suspension", ''The Automotor Journal'', August 10, 1912, pp936-937&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
===By blacksmiths===

Because leaf springs are made of relatively high quality steel, they are a favorite material for [[blacksmiths]]. In countries such as [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Pakistan]], where traditional blacksmiths still produce a large amount of the country's tools, leaf springs from scrapped cars are frequently used to make knives, [[kukris]], and other tools.&lt;ref name="kami"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himalayan-imports.com/kami.html |title=Kamis, Khukuri makers of Nepal |publisher=Himalayan-imports.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also commonly used by amateur and hobbyist blacksmiths.

===In trampolines===

Leaf springs have also replaced traditional [[coil springs]] in some [[trampoline]]s (known as soft-edge trampolines), which improves safety for users and reduces risk of concussion. &lt;ref name="Justin Burke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/executive-living/home-design/andons-leap-of-faith/story-fngmet9f-1226663385685 |title=Joe Andon's leap of faith |publisher=The Australian |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaf springs are spaced around the frame as 'legs' that branch from the base frame to suspend the jumping mat, providing flexibility and resilience. &lt;ref name="Google Patents"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/WO2012167300A1?cl=en&amp;dq=vuly+leaf+springs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DB3VUazhComJlQXD6oEY&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA |title=Trampolines WO 2012167300 A1 |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lely method''' or '''Lely process''' is a [[crystal growth]] technology used for producing [[silicon carbide]] crystals for the [[semi-conductor]] industry. The patent for this process was filed in the Netherlands in 1954 and in the United States in 1955 by Jan Anthony Lely of [[Philips Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| patent-number = US2854364 (A)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The patent was subsequently granted on 30 September 1958, and was refined by D.R. Hamilton et al. in 1960, and by V.P. Novikov and V.I. Ionov in 1968.{{r|Byrappa}}

==Overview==
The Lely method produces bulk silicon carbide crystals through the process of [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. Silicon carbide powder is loaded into a graphite [[crucible]], which is purged with Argon gas and heated to approximately {{cvt|2500|C|F}}. The silicon carbide near the outer walls of the crucible sublimes and is [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] on a graphite rod near the center of the crucible, which is at a lower temperature.&lt;ref name = "Byrappa"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Byrappa |first1=Kullaiah |last2=Ohachi|first2=Tadashi |title=Crystal Growth Technology |date=2003 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9783540003670 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=win7M66SjYIC |accessdate=10 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several modified versions of the Lely method exist, most commonly the silicon carbide is heated from the bottom end rather than the walls of the crucible, and deposited on the lid. Other modifications include varying the temperature, [[temperature gradient]], Argon pressure, and geometry of the system. Typically, an [[induction furnace]] is used to achieve the required temperatures of {{cvt|1800|-|2600|C|F}}.{{r|Byrappa|p=195}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7266">{{Redirect|MACHO||Macho (disambiguation)}}
A '''massive astrophysical compact halo object''' ('''MACHO''') is any kind of [[astronomy|astronomical]] body that might explain the apparent presence of [[dark matter]] in [[galaxy]] [[galactic halo|halos]]. A MACHO is a body composed of normal [[baryonic matter]] that emits little or no radiation and drifts through interstellar space unassociated with any [[planetary system]]. Since MACHOs are not luminous, they are hard to detect. MACHOs include [[black hole]]s or [[neutron star]]s as well as [[brown dwarf]]s and [[Rogue planet|unassociated planets]]. [[White dwarf]]s and very faint [[red dwarf]]s have also been proposed as candidate MACHOs.  The term was coined by astrophysicist Kim Griest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Croswell|first=Ken|title=The Universe at Midnight|year=2002|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
A MACHO may be detected when it passes in front of or nearly in front of a star and the MACHO's gravity bends the light, causing the star to appear brighter in an example of [[gravitational lensing]] known as [[gravitational microlensing]]. Several groups have searched for MACHOs by searching for the microlensing amplification of light. These groups have ruled out [[dark matter]] being explained by MACHOs with mass in the range {{val|1|e=-8}} [[solar mass]]es (0.3 lunar masses) to 100 solar masses. One group, the MACHO collaboration, claims to have found enough microlensing to predict the existence of many MACHOs with mass of about 0.5 [[solar mass]]es, enough to make up perhaps 20% of the dark matter in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;C. Alcock et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001272 The MACHO Project: Microlensing Results from 5.7 Years of LMC Observations]. Astrophys. J. 542 (2000) 281-307&lt;/ref&gt;
This suggests that MACHOs could be white dwarfs or red dwarfs which have similar masses. However, red and white dwarfs are not completely dark; they do emit some light, and so can be searched for with the [[Hubble Telescope]] and with [[proper motion]] surveys.  These searches have ruled out the possibility that these objects make up a significant fraction of dark matter in our galaxy. Another group, the EROS2 collaboration, does not confirm the signal claims by the MACHO group. They did not find enough microlensing effect with a sensitivity higher by a factor 2.&lt;ref&gt;P. Tisserand et al., [http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0607207 Limits on the Macho Content of the Galactic Halo from the EROS-2 Survey of the Magellanic Clouds], 2007, ''Astron. Astrophys.'' 469, 387-404&lt;/ref&gt; Observations using the Hubble Space Telescope's [[NICMOS]] instrument showed that less than one percent of the halo mass is composed of red dwarfs.&lt;ref&gt;David Graff and Katherine Freese,
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9507097],  Analysis of a hubble space telescope search for red dwarfs: limits on baryonic matter in the galactic halo, Astrophys. J. 456:L49,1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Najita, G. Tiede, and S. Carr, From Stars to Superplanets: The Low-Mass Initial Mass Function in the Young Cluster IC 348.  The Astrophysical Journal 541, 1 (2000), 977–1003&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to a negligible fraction of the dark matter halo mass.  Therefore, the missing mass problem is not solved by MACHOs.

==Types ==
MACHOs may sometimes be considered to include [[black hole]]s. Black holes are truly black in that they emit no light and any light shone upon them is absorbed and not reflected. It is thought possible that there is a halo of black holes surrounding the Milky Way.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
A black hole can sometimes be detected by the halo of bright gas and dust that forms around it as an [[accretion disc]] being pulled in by the black hole's gravity.  Such a disk can generate jets of gas that are shot out away from the black hole because it cannot be absorbed quickly enough.  An isolated black hole, however, would not have an accretion disk and would only be detectable by gravitational lensing.
Cosmologists doubt they make up a majority of dark matter because the black holes are at isolated points of the galaxy. The largest contributor to the missing mass must be spread throughout the galaxy to balance the gravity. A minority of physicists, including [[George Chapline|Chapline]] and [[Robert B. Laughlin|Laughlin]], believe that the widely accepted model of the black hole is wrong and needs to be replaced by a new model, the [[dark-energy star]]; in the general case for the suggested new model, the cosmological distribution of [[dark energy]] would be slightly lumpy and dark-energy stars of primordial type might be a possible candidate for MACHOs.

[[Neutron star]]s, differently from  black holes, are not heavy enough to collapse completely, and instead forms a material rather like that of an [[atomic nucleus]] (sometimes informally called [[neutronium]]). After sufficient time these stars could radiate away enough energy to become cold enough that they would be too faint to see. Likewise, old [[white dwarf]]s may also become cold and dead, eventually becoming [[black dwarf]]s, although the [[universe]] is not thought to be [[Age of the universe|old enough]] for any stars to have reached this stage.

The next candidate for MACHOs are the [[brown dwarf]]s mentioned above. Brown dwarfs are sometimes called "failed stars" as they do not have enough mass for nuclear fusion to begin and simply glow a dull brown.  Hence, their only source of energy is released through their own gravitational contraction, and may therefore be faintly visible in some circumstances. Brown dwarfs are about thirteen to seventy-five times the mass of Jupiter.

==Theoretical considerations==
Theoretical work simultaneously also showed that ancient MACHOs are not likely to account for the large amounts of dark matter now thought to be present in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Freese, Brian Fields, and David Graff,[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9904401] Limits on stellar objects as the dark matter of our halo: nonbaryonic dark matter seems to be required.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Big Bang]] as it is currently understood could not have produced enough [[baryons]] and still be consistent with the observed elemental abundances,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Fields, Katherine Freese, and David Graff,[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9904291]  Chemical abundance constraints on white dwarfs as halo dark matter, Astrophys. J. 534:265-276,2000.&lt;/ref&gt; including the abundance of [[deuterium]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnon Dar, [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9504082 Dark Matter and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]. Astrophys. J., 449 (1995) 550&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, separate observations of [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], both in the [[cosmic microwave background]] and  large-scale structure of galaxies, set limits on the ratio of baryons to the total amount of matter.  These observations show that a large fraction of non-baryonic matter is necessary regardless of the presence or absence of MACHOs.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4999">[[Image:Noisy Cricket.jpg|thumb|300px|A Noisy Cricket seen in the first film]]
The '''Noisy Cricket''' is a fictional weapon that appeared in the [[Men in Black (franchise)|Men in Black film series]]. It is the first alien weapon used by one of the protagonists, [[Agent J]], and is his [[signature weapon]] in the first installment of the [[Men in Black (franchise)|Men in Black series]].

==Depiction==
A Noisy Cricket is a small pistol-like weapon with a small grip and pointed barrel. It fires a powerful orb of energy, creating the sound of a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]. It produces a strong [[recoil]] that can upend an unsuspecting user. It can also be suppressed to reduce the recoil, but this reduces its power. The spin-off MIB Agent's Handbook explains that Noisy Crickets are deliberately given to rookies, and bets are taken on how far the rookie will fly as a result of the gun's recoil (a practice discouraged under MIB's '[[Hazing|No Hazing]]' policy). The weapon's concept may have been adapted from an identically-described tiny gun with immense recoil described on the first page of Neal Stephenson's novel [[Snow Crash]].

==In the films==
The Noisy Cricket was first introduced in the [[Men in Black (1997 film)|first film]]. While searching for an appropriate weapon for J, [[Agent K]] found and gave him a Noisy Cricket. J mockingly puts it in his pocket and says that he might break it. Yet, he later finds out that the Cricket is very dangerous. Upon firing it the first time, the recoil hurled J into a wall.  He tries to shoot it a second time with a proper stance, but it launched him back again, this time into the windshield of a passing taxi. 

It again appeared in the [[Men in Black II|sequel]]. It was given to a neuralyzed K, who was called Kevin Brown. J jokingly gave Brown a Noisy Cricket,. J described the cricket as Brown's favorite weapon. Even though he had no memory of being an MIB agent, K proves his experience with the cricket. He blew Jeeb's head off without being hurt or bothered by the recoil. However, he was lying on the floor at the time, so the recoil presumably had no effect.

There is no mention or use of the Noisy Cricket in ''[[Men in Black 3]]''{{citation needed|reason=unconfirmed|date=January 2016}}.

==In the series==
The Noisy Cricket is the signature weapon of Agent J in the series. It appears in almost every episode as Jay's weapon of choice. Despite his frequent usage of the weapon, the kick is still there and it continues to bother him. He eventually puts a suppressor on it so it no longer kicks, but this suppressor limits the weapon's power.

==MIB: Alien Crisis==
The noisy cricket appears in the video game [[MIB: Alien Crisis|MiB: Alien Crisis]] as a weapon in the player's disposal. Like in the films, the cricket fires orbs of energy at the enemy. Although in the gameplay, its power is somewhat reduced, as the main character can fire it off without the conventional recoil seen in the series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120518154441/http://www.meninblackgame.com/weapons.php Game's Weapons]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Noisy Cricket appeared in a special segment of Sci-Fi Saved My Life entitled ''Men in Black'', discussing the possibilities of it being a reality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrdSqontwfc&amp;feature=related Sci-Fi saved my life]&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly mistaken that the gun also appears in Will Smith's movie ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999) when on the train the outline of the gun rack their appears to be a noisy cricket outline but in fact this is what is called a palm gun.

It also has been listed on many websites as one of the greatest sci-fi weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelistcafe.com/top-10-sci-fi-movies-badass-weapons Top ten Badass Weapons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mymovietime.net/15-of-the-best-sci-fi-weapons-from-movies My Movie Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319124402/http://mymovietime.net/15-of-the-best-sci-fi-weapons-from-movies |date=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A weapon called the Tiny Pistol is featured in [[Saints Row IV]] which is found lying on a chair in the hidden secret basement under the Let's Pretend costume store which can accessed by shooting the door with an "Employees Only" sign inside the store, which is based on the Noisy Cricket and like the Noisy Cricket it is a powerful weapon that produces a powerful blast of energy, though it also possesses the Noisy Cricket's recoil, as well as a longer recharge time but it can be upgraded to recharge faster. It only weapon skin which is its default skin which is called "''Loud Locust''". Its in game description reads "''A miniature pistol of obscure origin and unknown capability''".

[[File:Athabasca Oil Sands map.png|thumb|The [[Athabasca oil sands]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, are a very large source of [[bitumen]], which can be [[upgrader|upgraded]] to [[synthetic crude]] oil.]]
[[File:Tar Sandstone California.jpg|thumb|Tar sandstone from [[California]], [[United States]]]]

'''Oil sands''', also known as '''tar sands''' or crude bitumen, or more technically '''bituminous sands''', are a type of [[unconventional oil|unconventional petroleum deposit]]. Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of [[sand]], [[clay]], and water, [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] with a dense and extremely [[viscosity|viscous]] form of [[petroleum]] technically referred to as [[bitumen]] (or colloquially as [[tar]] due to its superficially similar appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bitumina.co.uk/whatisbitumen.html |title= What Is Bitumen(Asphalt)? |publisher= Bitumena |access-date= 2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://civilblog.org/2015/07/15/15-differences-between-bitumen-and-tar-used-in-road-construction/ |title= 15+ differences between bitumen and tar used in road construction |last1= Suryakanta |publisher= CivilBlog.org |access-date= 2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=wec/&gt;&lt;ref name="AOS2008"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Other large reserves are located in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Venezuela]].

The crude bitumen contained in the Canadian oil sands is described by the [[National Energy Board]] of Canada as "a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than [[pentanes]] which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as [[light crude oil]] or [[natural-gas condensate]]. At room temperature, it is much like cold [[molasses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadasoilsands.ca/en/what-are-the-oil-sands |title=What Are The Oil Sands? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Canada’s Oil Sands |publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers |publication-place=Calgary, AL |access-date=28 Feb 2016 |quote=Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water, clay and bitumen.

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orinoco Belt]] in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of [[Heavy crude oil|heavy or extra-heavy oil]] due to their lower viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dusseault|first=M. B.|title=Comparing Venezuelan and Canadian heavy oil and tar sands|journal=Proceedings of Petroleum Society's Canadian International Conference|date=12–14 June 2001|volume=2001-061|pages=20p|url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OilSands/pdfs/RPT_Chops_app3.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by [[bacteria]]. According to the WEC, extra-heavy oil has "a gravity of less than 10° API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;centipoise".&lt;ref name=wec123/&gt;

Oil sands have only recently{{when|date=March 2014}} been considered to be part of the world's [[oil reserves]], as historically high oil prices and new technology enabled profitable extraction and processing. Together with other so-called [[unconventional oil]] extraction practices, oil sands are implicated in the [[Carbon Tracker Initiative|unburnable carbon]] debate but also contribute to [[energy security]] and counteract the international price cartel [[OPEC]]. According to a study ordered by the [[Government of Alberta]], Canada, conducted by [[Jacobs Engineering Group]], carbon emissions from [[oil-sand crude]] are 12% higher than from conventional oil.&lt;ref name=reuters100512&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Barbara |last1=Lewis|first2=David |last2=Ljunggren|first3=Jeffrey|last3=Jones |title= Canada's oil sand battle with Europe |agency=Reuters |date=10 May 2012 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/10/us-oil-sands-idUSBRE8490OL20120510| accessdate=2014-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also| History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)}}

The exploitation of bituminous deposits and [[Petroleum seep|seeps]] dates back to [[Paleolithic]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bilkadi | first = Zayn | title = Bitumen&amp;nbsp;– A History | newspaper = Saudi Aramco World | pages = 2–9 | date = November–December 1984 | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198406/bitumen.-.a.history.htm | accessdate =1 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known use of bitumen was by [[Neanderthal]]s, some 40,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. Bitumen has been found adhering to [[stone tool]]s used by [[Neanderthal]]s at sites in Syria. After the arrival of [[Homo sapiens]], humans used bitumen for construction of buildings and waterproofing of [[reed boat]]s, among other uses. In ancient Egypt, the use of bitumen was important in preparing Egyptian mummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Hirst | first=K. Kris | title=Bitumen&amp;nbsp;– A Smelly but Useful Material of Interest | work=Archaeology | publisher=About.com | year=2009 | url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/bcthroughbl/qt/bitumen.htm | accessdate=23 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times, bitumen was primarily a [[Mesopotamian]] commodity used by the [[Sumer]]ians and [[Babylonia]]ns, although it was also found in the [[Levant]] and [[Persia]]. The area along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates river]]s was littered with hundreds of pure bitumen seepages. The Mesopotamians used the bitumen for waterproofing boats and buildings.

The name ''tar sands'' was applied to bituminous sands in the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=tar+sands+name+for+bituminous+sands+in+late+19th+and+early+20th+century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw7feCjJLVAhXlsFQKHTuvDXAQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=tar%20sands%20name%20for%20bituminous%20sands%20in%20late%2019th%20and%20early%2020th%20century&amp;f=false|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|last=Marsh|first=James H.|date=1999|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|isbn=9780771020995|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who saw the bituminous sands during this period were familiar with the large amounts of tar residue produced in urban areas as a [[by-product]] of the manufacture of [[coal gas]] for urban heating and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Coal Tar | year=2007 | publisher=City of Kingston, Ontario |url=http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/environment/coaltar/index.asp | accessdate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[tar]]" to describe these natural bitumen deposits is really a misnomer, since, chemically speaking, tar is a [[synthetic oil|human-made]] substance produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[organic material]], usually [[coal]].&lt;ref name="Alberta's oil sands"&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Alberta's oil sands | year=2007 | publisher=Government of Alberta | url=http://oilsands.alberta.ca/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410204658/http://oilsands.alberta.ca/ |archivedate=10 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, coal gas has almost completely been replaced by [[natural gas]] as a fuel, and [[coal tar]] as a material for [[pavement (material)|paving roads]] has been replaced by the petroleum product [[asphalt]]. Naturally occurring bitumen is chemically more similar to asphalt than to coal tar, and the term ''oil sands'' (or oilsands) is more commonly used by industry in the producing areas than ''tar sands'' because [[synthetic oil]] is manufactured from the bitumen,&lt;ref name="Alberta's oil sands"/&gt; and due to the feeling that the terminology of ''tar sands'' is less politically acceptable to the public.&lt;ref name="Dembicki"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dembicki, Geoff |url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2011/04/25/TarVsOil/ |title= Tar Sands vs Oil Sands Political Flap Misguided? | accessdate=22 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil sands are now an alternative to conventional crude oil.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Evans, John | title=Sand banks: If unconventional sources of oil, such as oil sands, could be transformed into crude we could still have a 300-year supply left.

===Early explorers===
In Canada, the [[First Nation]] peoples had used bitumen from seeps along the [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and [[Clearwater River (Alberta)|Clearwater River]]s to waterproof their [[birch bark]] [[canoe]]s from early prehistoric times. The Canadian oil sands first became known to Europeans in 1719 when a [[Cree]] native named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample to [[Hudsons Bay Company]] fur trader [[Henry Kelsey]], who commented on it in his journals. Fur trader Peter Pond paddled down the Clearwater River to Athabasca in 1778, saw the deposits and wrote of "springs of bitumen that flow along the ground." In 1787, fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] on his way to the Arctic Ocean saw the Athabasca oil sands, and commented, "At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Mackenzie | first=Sir Alexander | year=1970 | title=The Journals and Letters of Alexander Mackenzie | editor=Lamb, W. Kaye | location=Cambridge | publisher=Hakluyt Society | page=129 | isbn=0-521-01034-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneers===
The commercial possibilities of Canada's vast oil sands were realized early by Canadian government researchers. In 1884, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]] of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] commented, "The banks of the Athabasca would furnish an inexhaustible supply of fuel... the material occurs in such enormous quantities that a profitable means of extracting oil...may be found". In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the material to pave {{convert|600|feet|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of road in Edmonton as well as in other places. In 1920, chemist [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Karl Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] began experimenting with methods to extract bitumen from the oil sands and in 1928 he patented the first commercial hot water separation process.&lt;ref name="OSDC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial development began in 1923 when businessman Robert Fitzsimmons began drilling oil wells at Bitumount, north of [[Fort McMurray]] but obtained disappointing results with conventional drilling. In 1927 he formed the International Bitumen Company and in 1930 built a small hot-water separation plant based on Clark's design. He produced about {{convert|300|oilbbl|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of bitumen in 1930 and shipped it by barge and rail to Edmonton. The bitumen from the mine had numerous uses but most of it was used to waterproof roofs. Costs were too high and Fitzsimmons went bankrupt. In 1941 the company was renamed Oil Sands Limited and attempted to iron out technical problems but was never very successful. It went through several changes of ownership and in 1958 closed down permanently. In 1974 Bitumount became an Alberta Provincial Historic Site.

In 1930 businessman Max Ball formed Canadian Oil Sand Product, Ltd, which later became Abasand Oils. He built a separation plant capable of handling 250 tons of oil sands per day which opened in 1936 and produced an average of {{convert|200|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of oil. The plant burned down in late 1941 but was rebuilt in 1942 with even larger capacity. In 1943 the Canadian government took control of the Abasand plant under the War Measures Act and planned to expand it further. However in 1945 the plant burned down again and in 1946 the Canadian government abandoned the project because the need for fuel had diminished with the end of the war. The Abasand site is also an Alberta Historic Site.&lt;ref name="OSDC" /&gt;

==Geology==
{{See also|Petroleum Geology|Oil reserves in Canada|Oil reserves in Venezuela}}
The world's largest deposits of oil sands are in Venezuela and Canada. The geology of the deposits in the two countries is generally rather similar. They are vast [[heavy crude oil|heavy oil]], extra-heavy oil, and/or bitumen deposits with oil heavier than 20°API, found largely in [[Compaction (geology)|unconsolidated]] [[sandstone]]s with similar properties. "Unconsolidated" in this context means that the sands have high porosity, no significant cohesion, and a tensile strength close to zero. The sands are saturated with oil which has prevented them from consolidating into hard sandstone.&lt;ref name="Dusseault 2001"/&gt;

===Size of resources===
{{See also|List of countries by proven oil reserves}}
The magnitude of the resources in the two countries is on the order of 3.5 to 4 trillion barrels (550 to 650 billion cubic metres) of original [[oil in place]] (OOIP). Oil in place is not necessarily [[oil reserves]], and the amount that can be produced depends on [[technological change|technological evolution]]. Rapid [[technological revolution|technological developments]] in Canada in the 1985–2000 period resulted in techniques such as [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) that can recover a much greater [[Extraction of petroleum|percentage of the OOIP]] than conventional methods. The Alberta government estimates that with current technology, 10% of its bitumen and heavy oil can be recovered, which would give it about 200 billion barrels (32 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of recoverable oil reserves. Venezuela estimates its recoverable oil at 267 billion barrels (42 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Dusseault 2001"/&gt; This places Canada and Venezuela in the same league as Saudi Arabia, having the three [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|largest oil reserves in the world]].

=== Major deposits ===
There are numerous deposits of oil sands in the world, but the biggest and most important are in [[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]], with lesser deposits in [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Russia]]. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined. Vast deposits of bitumen – over 350 billion cubic metres (2.2 trillion barrels) of [[oil in place]] – exist in the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. If only 30% of this oil could be extracted, it could supply the entire needs of [[North America]] for over 100 years at 2002 consumption levels. These deposits represent plentiful oil, but not cheap oil. They require advanced technology to [[Enhanced oil recovery|extract]] the oil and [[Pipeline transport|transport]] it to [[oil refineries]].&lt;ref name="Dusseault_2002_A1"&gt;

====Canada====
{{See also|Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin#Oil sands}}
The oil sands of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) are a result of the formation of the [[Canadian Rocky Mountains]] by the [[Pacific Plate]] overthrusting the [[North American Plate]] as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now [[Geology of British Columbia|comprise most of British Columbia]]. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and [[Geology of the Rocky Mountains#Raising the Rockies|raised the Rockies]] above the plains, forming [[Canadian Rockies|mountain ranges]]. This mountain building process buried the [[sedimentary rock]] layers which underlie most of Alberta [[structural basin|to a great  depth]], creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a [[sedimentary basin|giant pressure cooker]] effect that converted the [[kerogen]] in the deeply buried [[oil shale geology|organic-rich shales]] to light oil and natural gas.&lt;ref name="Dusseault 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein"&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.apega.ca/members/Presentations/2013/APEGA%20Geology%20of%20the%20Oil%20Sands.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[source rock]]s were similar to the American so-called [[oil shale]]s, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil.

This overthrusting also tilted the pre-[[Cretaceous]] sedimentary rock formations underlying most of the sub-surface of Alberta, [[Depression (geology)|depressing]] the rock formations in southwest Alberta up to {{convert|8|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep near the Rockies, but to zero depth in the northeast, where they pinched out against the [[igneous rock]]s of the [[Canadian Shield]], which outcrop on the surface. This tilting is not apparent on the surface because the resulting trench has been filled in by eroded material from the mountains. The light oil migrated up-dip through hydro-dynamic transport from the Rockies in the southwest toward the [[Canadian Shield]] in the northeast following a complex pre-Cretaceous [[unconformity]] that exists in the formations under Alberta. The total distance of oil migration southwest to northeast was about {{convert|500|to|700|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. At the shallow depths of sedimentary formations in the northeast, massive [[microbial biodegradation]] as the [[Petroleum seep|oil approached the surface]] caused the oil to become highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] and immobile. Almost all of the remaining oil is found in the far north of Alberta, in Middle Cretaceous (115 million-year old) [[Western Interior Seaway|sand-silt-shale deposits]] overlain by thick shales, although large amounts of heavy oil lighter than bitumen are found in the Heavy Oil Belt along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, extending into Saskatchewan and approaching the Montana border. Note that, although adjacent to Alberta, Saskatchewan has no massive deposits of bitumen, only large reservoirs of heavy oil &gt;10°API.&lt;ref name="Dusseault 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein"/&gt;

Most of the Canadian oil sands are in three major deposits in northern [[Alberta]]. They are the [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca-Wabiskaw oil sands]] of north northeastern Alberta, the [[Cold Lake, Alberta|Cold Lake]] deposits of east northeastern Alberta, and the [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] deposits of northwestern Alberta. Between them, they cover over {{convert|140000|km2}}—an area larger than [[England]]—and contain approximately {{convert|1.75|Toilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of crude [[bitumen]] in them. About 10% of the [[oil in place]], or {{convert|173|Goilbbl|e9m3|abbr=on}}, is estimated by the [[government of Alberta]] to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves.&lt;ref name="AOS2008"/&gt; Although the Athabasca deposit is the only one in the world which has areas shallow enough to mine from the surface, all three Alberta areas are suitable for production using ''[[in-situ]]'' methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD).

The largest Canadian oil sands deposit, the [[Athabasca oil sands]] is in the [[McMurray Formation]], centered on the city of [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]]. It outcrops on the surface (zero burial depth) about {{convert|50|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} north of Fort McMurray, where enormous oil sands mines have been established, but is {{convert|400| m| ft |abbr=on}} deep southeast of Fort McMurray. Only 3% of the oil sands area containing about 20% of the recoverable oil can be produced by [[surface mining]], so the remaining 80% will have to be produced using [[In situ#Petroleum production|in-situ]] wells. The other Canadian deposits are between {{convert|350|to|900|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep and will require in-situ production.&lt;ref name="Dusseault 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein"/&gt;

=====Athabasca=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
{{Main|Athabasca oil sands}}
{{See also|Wabasca oil sands}}
[[Image:Fort mcmurray aerial.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The City of Fort McMurray on the banks of the Athabasca River]]
The '''Athabasca oil sands''' lie along the [[Athabasca River]] and are the largest natural bitumen deposit in the world, containing about 80% of the Alberta total, and the only one suitable for [[surface mining]]. With modern unconventional oil production technology, at least 10% of these deposits, or about {{convert|170|Goilbbl|e9m3|abbr=on}} are considered to be economically recoverable, making Canada's total [[proven reserves]] the third largest in the world, after [[Saudi Arabia]]'s conventional oil and Venezuela's [[Orinoco oil sands]].

The Athabasca oil sands are more or less centered around the remote northern city of [[Fort McMurray]]. They are by far the largest deposit of bitumen in Canada, probably containing over 150 billion cubic metres (900 billion barrels) of [[oil in place]]. The bitumen is highly viscous and is often denser than water (10°[[API gravity|API]] or 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The oil saturated sands range from {{convert|15|to|65|m}} thick in places, and the oil saturation in the oil-rich zones is on the order of 90% bitumen by weight.&lt;ref name="Dusseault_2002_A1"/&gt;

The Athabasca River cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed as black stains on the river banks. Since portions of the Athabasca sands are shallow enough to be surface-mineable, they were the earliest ones to see development. [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada, part two|Historically]], the bitumen was used by the indigenous [[Cree]] and [[Dene]] [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] to waterproof their canoes. The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European [[fur trade]]rs in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post at [[York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]].

[[Image:Alberta tar sands.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Oil sands on the banks of the Athabasca River, c. 1900]]
In 1778, [[Peter Pond]], a fur trader for the rival [[North West Company]], was the first European to see the Athabasca deposits. In 1788, fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] from the Hudson Bay Company, who later discovered the [[Mackenzie River]] and routes to both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, described the oil sands in great detail. He said, "At about {{convert|24|mi}} from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of {{convert|20|ft}} long may be inserted without the least resistance. The bitumen is in a fluid state and when mixed with gum, the resinous substance collected from the [[spruce]] fir, it serves to gum the Indians' canoes."

In 1883, G.C. Hoffman of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] tried separating the bitumen from oil sand with the use of water and reported that it separated readily. In 1888, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]] of the Geological Survey of Canada reported to a Senate Committee that "The evidence ... points to the existence in the Athabasca and Mackenzie valleys of the most extensive petroleum field in America, if not the world." In 1926, [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Karl Clark]] of the University of Alberta patented a hot water separation process which was the forerunner of today's thermal extraction processes. However, it was 1967 before the first large scale commercial operation began with the opening of the Great Canadian Oil Sands mine by the [[Sun Oil Company]] of Ohio.

Today its successor company, [[Suncor Energy]] (no longer affiliated with Sun Oil), is the largest oil company in Canada. In addition, other companies such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[ExxonMobil]], and various national oil companies are developing the Athabasca oil sands. As a result, Canada is now by far the largest exporter of oil to the United States.

The smaller '''Wabasca''' (or Wabiskaw) '''oil sands''' lie above the western edge of the Athabasca oil sands and overlap them. They probably contain over 15 billion cubic metres (90 billion barrels) of oil in place. The deposit is buried from {{convert|100|to|700|m}} deep and ranges from {{convert|0|to|10|m}} thick. In many regions the oil-rich Wabasca formation overlies the similarly oil-rich McMurray formation, and as a result the two overlapping oil sands are often treated as one oil sands deposit. However, the two deposits are invariable separated by a minimum of {{convert|6|m}} of clay shale and silt. The bitumen in the Wabasca is as highly viscous as that in the Athabasca, but lies too deep to be surface-mined, so in-situ production methods must be used to produce the crude bitumen.&lt;ref name="Dusseault_2002_A1"/&gt;

=====Cold Lake=====
{{Main|Cold Lake oil sands}}
{{See also|CFB Cold Lake}}

[[File:Cold Lake from Meadow Lake Prov. Park, Saskatchewan.jpg|thumb|right|Cold Lake viewed from [[Meadow Lake Provincial Park]], Saskatchewan.]]
The Cold Lake oil sands are northeast of [[Alberta]]'s capital, [[Edmonton]], near the border with [[Saskatchewan]]. A small portion of the Cold Lake deposit lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca oil sands, the Cold Lake oil sands are important because some of the oil is [[fluid]] enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more [[alkane]]s and less [[asphaltene]]s than the other major Alberta oil sands and the oil is more fluid.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production.

The Cold Lake oil sands are of a roughly circular shape, centered around [[Bonnyville, Alberta]]. They probably contain over 60 billion cubic metres (370 billion barrels) of extra-heavy oil-in-place. The oil is highly viscous, but considerably less so than the Athabasca oil sands, and is somewhat less [[sulfurous]]. The depth of the deposits is {{convert|400|to|600|m}} and they are from {{convert|15|to|35|m}} thick.&lt;ref name="Dusseault_2002_A1"/&gt; They are too deep to [[surface mine]].

Much of the oil sands are on [[Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]]. CFB Cold Lake's [[CF-18 Hornet]] jet fighters defend the western half of Canadian air space and cover Canada's Arctic territory. Cold Lake Air Weapons Range (CLAWR) is one of the largest live-drop bombing ranges in the world, including testing of cruise missiles. As oil sands production continues to grow, various sectors vie for access to airspace, land, and resources, and this complicates oil well drilling and production significantly.

=====Peace River=====
{{Main|Peace River oil sands}}
[[File:Peace River aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Peace River]]
The Peace River oil sands located in northwest-central Alberta are the smallest of the three major oil sands deposits in Alberta. The Peace River oil sands lie generally in the watershed of the [[Peace River]], the largest river in Alberta. The Peace and Athabasca rivers, which are by far the largest rivers in Alberta, flow through their respective oil sands and merge at [[Lake Athabasca]] to form the [[Slave River]], which flows into the [[MacKenzie River]], one of the largest rivers in the world. All of the water from these rivers flow into the [[Arctic Ocean]].

The Peace River oil sands probably contain over 30 billion cubic metres (200 billion barrels) of oil-in-place. The thickness of the deposit ranges from {{convert|5|to|25|m}} and it is buried about {{convert|500|to|700|m}} deep.&lt;ref name="Dusseault_2002_A1"/&gt;

Whereas the Athabasca oil sands lie close enough to the surface that the bitumen can be excavated in [[open-pit]] mines, the smaller Peace River deposits are too deep, and must be exploited using [[in situ]] methods such as [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] and Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS).&lt;ref name=Monro2013&gt;{{cite report|title=Peace River proceeding no. 1769924 |date=25 November 2013|series=Phase II submissions |volume=4|url=http://www.aer.ca/documents/applications/hearings/1769924-SUBMISSIONSVOLIV-20131125.pdf|format=PDF|first=Munro |last=Shawn |location=Calgary, Alberta }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venezuela====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
The [[Orinoco#Eastern Venezuelan Basin|Eastern Venezuelan Basin]] has a structure similar to the WCSB, but on a shorter scale. The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Orientale mountain front to the [[Orinoco oil sands]] where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the [[Guyana Shield]] is only about {{convert|200|to|300|km |mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The hydrodynamic conditions of oil transport were similar, [[source rock]]s buried deep by the rise of the mountains of the Sierra Orientale produced light oil that moved up-dip toward the south until it was gradually immobilized by the viscosity increase caused by biodgradation near the surface. The Orinoco deposits are early [[Tertiary]] (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits.

In Venezuela, the [[Orinoco Belt]] oil sands range from {{convert|350|to|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep and no surface outcrops exist. The deposit is about {{convert|500|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long east-to-west and {{convert|50|to|60|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wide north-to-south, much less than the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits. In general, the Canadian deposits are found over a much wider area, have a broader range of properties, and have a broader range of reservoir types than the Venezuelan ones, but the geological structures and mechanisms involved are similar. The main differences is that the oil in the sands in Venezuela is less viscous than in Canada, allowing some of it to be produced by conventional drilling techniques, but none of it approaches the surface as in Canada, meaning none of it can be produced using surface mining. The Canadian deposits will almost all have to be produced by mining or using new non-conventional techniques.

=====Orinoco=====

[[Image:Deltaorinoco.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of the Orinoco River.]]
The Orinoco Belt is a territory in the southern strip of the eastern [[Orinoco River]] Basin in [[Venezuela]] which overlies one of the world's largest deposits of petroleum. The Orinoco Belt follows the line of the river. It is approximately {{convert|600|km|mi|-1}} from east to west, and {{convert|70|km}} from north to south, with an area about {{convert|55314|km2}}.

The oil sands consist of large deposits of extra [[heavy crude]]. Venezuela's heavy oil deposits of about {{convert|1200|Goilbbl|abbr=on}} of [[oil in place]] are estimated to approximately equal the world's reserves of lighter oil.&lt;ref name=wec&gt;

===Other deposits===

In addition to the three major Canadian oil sands in Alberta, there is a fourth major oil sands deposit in Canada, the [[Melville Island oil sands]] in the [[Canadian Arctic islands]], which are too remote to expect commercial production in the foreseeable future.

Russia holds oil sands in two main regions. Large resources are present in the Tunguska Basin, [[East Siberia]], with the largest deposits being Olenek and Siligir. Other deposits are located in the [[Timan-Pechora Basin|Timan-Pechora]] and Volga-Urals basins (in and around [[Tatarstan]]), which is an important but very mature province in terms of conventional oil, holds large amounts of oil sands in a shallow permian formation.&lt;ref name=wec/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russia&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|Petroleum production in Canada}}
{{See also|History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)}}
The Alberta oil sands have been in commercial production since the original Great Canadian Oil Sands (now [[Suncor Energy]]) mine began operation in 1967. Despite the increasing levels of production, the process of extraction and processing of oil sands can still be considered to be in its infancy; with new technologies and stakeholders oversight providing an ever-lower environmental footprint.{{citation needed|reason='ever lower environmental footprint' is a verifiable claim|date=November 2015}} A second mine, operated by the [[Syncrude]] consortium, began operation in 1978 and is the biggest mine of any type in the world. The third mine in the Athabasca Oil Sands, the [[Albian Sands]] consortium of [[Shell Canada]], [[Chevron Corporation]], and Western Oil Sands Inc. [purchased by [[Marathon Oil Corporation]] in 2007] began operation in 2003. [[Petro-Canada]] was also developing a $33 billion Fort Hills Project, in partnership with UTS Energy Corporation and [[Teck Cominco]], which lost momentum after the 2009 merger of Petro-Canada into Suncor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oilweek.com/news.asp?ID=9884 |title=Fort Hills Oilsands |publisher=Oilweek.com |accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013 there were nine oil sands mining projects in the Athabasca oil sands deposit: Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor), Syncrude Canada Limited (Syncrude)'s Mildred Lake and Aurora North, Shell Canada Limited (Shell)'s Muskeg River and Jackpine, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), Horizon, Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited (Imperial), Kearl Oil Sands Project (KOSP), Total E&amp;P Canada Ltd.

===Venezuela===
{{Main|History of the Venezuelan oil industry}}
{{See also|PDVSA}}
No significant development of Venezuela's extra-heavy oil deposits was undertaken before 2000, except for the BITOR operation which produced somewhat less than 100,000 barrels of oil per day (16,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/d) of 9°API oil by primary production. This was mostly shipped as an emulsion ([[Orimulsion]]) of 70% oil and 30% water with similar characteristics as [[heavy fuel oil]] for burning in thermal power plants.&lt;ref name="Dusseault 2001"&gt;{{cite web

As a result, the government has been trying to "Wind Down" the Orimulsion program.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Despite the fact that the Orinoco oil sands contain extra-heavy oil which is easier to produce than Canada's similarly-sized reserves of bitumen, Venezuela's oil production has been declining in recent years because of the country's political and economic problems, while Canada's has been increasing. As a result, Canadian heavy oil and bitumen exports have been backing Venezuelan heavy and extra-heavy oil out of the US market, and Canada's total exports of oil to the US have become several times as great as Venezuela's.

By 2016, with the [[economy of Venezuela]] in a tailspin and the country experiencing widespread shortages of food, rolling power blackouts, rioting, and anti-government protests, it was unclear how much new oil sands production would occur in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/2016/07/05/484756549/venezuela-is-in-crisis-its-economy-is-in-a-tailspin |title= Venezuela Is In Crisis.

==Methods of extraction==
Except for a fraction of the extra-heavy oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology, oil sands must be produced by [[strip mining]] or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated ''in-situ'' techniques. These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using [[open-pit mining]], approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |url=http://www.oilsandsdiscovery.com/oil_sands_story/insitu.html
 |title=The oil sands story: in situ
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary production===
Conventional crude oil is normally extracted from the ground by drilling [[oil well]]s into a [[petroleum reservoir]], allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although [[artificial lift]] and techniques such as [[horizontal drilling]], [[water injection (oil production)|water flooding]] and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production is used in the Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees [[Celsius]], the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered only a small fraction of the [[oil in place]], so it is not often used today.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Athabasca oil sands.jpg|thumb|Mining operations in the Athabasca oil sands. NASA [[Earth Observatory]] image, 2009.]]
The [[Athabasca oil sands]] are the only major oil sands deposits which are shallow enough to surface mine. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of [[bitumen]] covered by little [[overburden]], making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden [[muskeg]] (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically {{convert|40|to|60|m}} thick deposits of crude bitumen embedded in unconsolidated [[sandstone]], sitting on top of flat [[limestone]] rock. Since [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)#Great Canadian Oil Sands|Great Canadian Oil Sands]] (now [[Suncor Energy]]) started operation of the first large-scale oil sands mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale and the volume has grown at a steady rate ever since.

A large number of oil sands mines are currently in operation and more are in the stages of approval or development. The [[Syncrude Canada]] mine was the second to open in 1978, [[Shell Canada]] opened its [[Albian Sands|Muskeg River mine (Albian Sands)]] in 2003 and [[Canadian Natural Resources]] Ltd (CNRL) opened its [[Horizon Oil Sands]] project in 2009. Newer mines include Shell Canada's Jackpine mine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.westernoilsands.com/html/business/jackpine.html | title=Jackpine mine |publisher=Westernoilsands.com | accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperial Oil]]'s [[Kearl Oil Sands Project]], the Synenco Energy (now owned by [[Total S.A.]]) Northern Lights mine, and Suncor's Fort Hills mine.

===Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS)===
{{Main|Cold heavy oil production with sand}}
Some years ago Canadian oil companies discovered that if they removed the [[sand]] filters from heavy oil wells and produced as much sand as possible with the oil, production rates improved significantly. This technique became known as Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Further research disclosed that pumping out sand opened "wormholes" in the sand formation which allowed more oil to reach the [[wellbore]]. The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10% versus 5–6% with sand filters in place) and the disadvantage that [[waste management|disposing]] of the produced sand is a problem. A novel way to do this was spreading it on [[gravel road|rural roads]], which rural governments liked because the [[Asphalt concrete|oily sand]] reduced dust and the oil companies did their [[road maintenance]] for them. However, governments have become concerned about the large volume and composition of oil spread on roads.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in recent years disposing of oily sand in underground [[salt mine|salt caverns]] has become more common.

===Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS)===
{{See also|Steam injection (oil industry)}}
The use of [[steam]] injection to recover heavy oil has been in use in the oil fields of California since the 1950s. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) "huff-and-puff" method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10–40% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60–70% of OIP).&lt;ref name="Alvarez_2013"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSS has been in use by [[Imperial Oil]] at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by [[Canadian Natural Resources]] at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by [[Shell Canada]] at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees [[Celsius]] for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.&lt;ref name="butler104"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Roger|title=Thermal Recovery of Oil and Bitumen|year=1991|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)===
{{Main|Steam assisted gravity drainage}}
[[Steam assisted gravity drainage]] was developed in the 1980s by the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] and fortuitously coincided with improvements in [[directional drilling]] technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically [[drilling rig|drilled]] in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.&lt;ref name="butler104"/&gt;

SAGD has proved to be a [[disruptive technology|major breakthrough]] in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its [[economic feasibility]] and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American [[oil reserves]] and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta's oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include [[JACOS|Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS)]] project, Suncor's Firebag project, [[Nexen]]'s Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, [[Husky Energy]]'s Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, [[Cenovus Energy]]'s Foster Creek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oilsands/foster-creek.html |title=Operations&amp;nbsp;– Oil sands&amp;nbsp;– Foster Creek |publisher=Cenovus.com |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Christina Lake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oilsands/christina-lake.html |title=Operations&amp;nbsp;– Oil sands&amp;nbsp;– Christina Lake |publisher=Cenovus.com |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; developments, [[ConocoPhillips]]' Surmont project, [[Devon Energy|Devon Canada's]] Jackfish project, and Derek Oil &amp; Gas's LAK Ranch project. Alberta's OSUM Corp has combined proven underground mining technology with SAGD to enable higher recovery rates by running wells underground from within the oil sands deposit, thus also reducing energy requirements compared to traditional SAGD. This particular technology application is in its testing phase.

===Vapor Extraction (VAPEX)===
Several methods use solvents, instead of steam, to separate bitumen from sand. Some solvent extraction methods may work better in ''in situ'' production and other in mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/canmet-20120116.html |title=Natural Resources Canada team investigates solvent extraction process for oil sand bitumen; non-aqueous alternative to hot water processing with reduced environmental impacts |date=16 January 2012 |work=Green Car Congress |publisher=BioAge Group, LLC |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvent can be beneficial if it produces more oil while requiring less energy to produce steam.

Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an ''in situ'' technology, similar to SAGD. Instead of steam, hydrocarbon solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It has the advantage of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who are experimenting with it.

The above methods are not mutually exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VAPEX and Solvent Technology |url=http://www.oilsandsdevelopers.ca/index.php/oil-sands-technologies/in-situ/the-process-2/vapex-and-solvent-technology/ |publisher=Oil Sands Developers Group |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) ===
This is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the "toe" of the horizontal well toward the "heel", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and have the advantage of not requiring energy to create steam.&lt;ref&gt;

After several years of production in situ, it has become clear that current THAI methods do not work as planned. Amid steady drops in production from their THAI wells at Kerrobert, Petrobank has written down the value of their THAI patents and the reserves at the facility to zero. They have plans to experiment with a new configuration they call "multi-THAI," involving adding more air injection wells.&lt;ref&gt;

===Combustion Overhead Gravity Drainage (COGD)===
This is an experimental method that employs a number of vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located at the base of the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.&lt;ref&gt;

Approximately {{convert|1.0|–|1.25|GJ}} of energy is needed to extract a barrel of bitumen and upgrade it to synthetic crude. As of 2006, most of this is produced by burning natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;

That means this extracts about 5 or 6 times as much energy as is consumed. Energy efficiency is expected to improve to an average of {{convert|900|cuft}} of natural gas or {{convert|0.945|GJ}} of energy per barrel by 2015, giving an EROEI of about 6.5.&lt;ref&gt;

Alternatives to natural gas exist and are available in the oil sands area. Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30–35% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude. Nexen's Long Lake project will use a proprietary deasphalting technology to upgrade the bitumen, using asphaltene residue fed to a [[gasification|gasifier]] whose [[syngas]] will be used by a [[cogeneration]] turbine and a hydrogen producing unit, providing all the energy needs of the project: steam, hydrogen, and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |title=Technology
 |url=http://www.longlake.ca/project/technology.asp
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it will produce syncrude without consuming natural gas, but the capital cost is very high.

Shortages of natural gas for project fuel were forecast to be a problem for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US [[shale gas]] production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of [[hydraulic fracturing]] making [[Shale gas in the United States|US largely self-sufficient in natural gas]] and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the [[NAFTA]] and the [[Canadian Constitution]] to reduce shipments of natural gas to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has [[Shale gas in Canada|huge undeveloped shale gas deposits]] in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future oil sands production does not seem to be a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production.

==Upgrading and/or blending==
{{See also|Upgrader}}
The extra-heavy crude oil or crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is a very [[viscous]] semisolid form of oil that does not easily flow at normal temperatures, making it difficult to transport to market by pipeline. To flow through oil pipelines, it must either be [[upgrader|upgraded]] to lighter [[synthetic crude oil]] (SCO), blended with [[diluent]]s to form [[dilbit]], or heated to reduce its vicosity.

===Canada===
In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen produced by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery of oil to market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen produced by the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported to the site of upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude.

Upon reaching a [[oil refinery|refinery]], the synthetic crude is processed and a significant portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable.

When the first oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil refineries in their market area were designed to handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4–7% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high-quality synthetic crude oil (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil.

The first step in upgrading is [[vacuum distillation]] to separate the lighter fractions. After that, [[de-asphalter|de-asphalting]] is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. [[Cracking (chemistry)|Cracking]] is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, [[Hydrodesulfurization|desulfurization]] must be done to get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2012, Alberta produced about {{convert|1900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude bitumen from its three major oil sands deposits, of which about {{convert|1044000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} was upgraded to lighter products and the rest sold as raw bitumen.  The volume of both upgraded and non-upgraded bitumen is increasing yearly. Alberta has five oil sands upgraders producing a variety of products. These include:&lt;ref name="ST98-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* [[Suncor Energy]] can upgrade {{convert|440000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to light sweet and medium sour synthetic crude oil (SCO), plus produce diesel fuel for its oil sands operations at the upgrader.
* [[Syncrude]] can upgrade {{convert|407000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet light SCO.
* [[Canadian Natural Resources]] Limited (CNRL) can upgrade {{convert|141000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet light SCO.
* [[Nexen]], since 2013 wholly owned by [[China National Offshore Oil Corporation]] (CNOOC), can upgrade {{convert|72000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet light SCO.
* [[Shell Canada]] operates its [[Scotford Upgrader]] in combination with an oil refinery and chemical plant at [[Scotford, Alberta]], near Edmonton. The complex can upgrade {{convert|255000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet and heavy SCO as well as a range of refinery and chemical products.

Modernized and new large refineries such as are found in the [[Midwestern United States]] and on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], as well as many in [[China]], can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, [[pentanes]] and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.

Typically, blended bitumen contains about 30% [[natural gas condensate]] or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen can also be delivered to market by specially designed railway [[tank car]]s, [[tank truck]]s, [[liquid cargo barge]]s, or ocean-going [[oil tanker]]s. These do not necessarily require the bitumen be blended with diluent since the tanks can be heated to allow the oil to be pumped out.

The demand for condensate for oil sands diluent is expected to be more than {{convert|750000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about {{convert|150000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US [[tight oil]] production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport {{convert|95000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and [[Enbridge]] is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships {{convert|180000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Venezuela===
Although Venezuelan extra-heavy oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of the difference is due to temperature. Once the oil comes out of the ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of {{convert|630000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of [[naphtha]] to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much [[natural gas condensate]] from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US [[shale gas]] production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – as a result of the country's [[2013-17 Venezuelan crisis|economic crisis]] -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;

==Transportation==
{{See also|Oil pipeline}}
A network of gathering and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: [[Edmonton, Alberta]] and [[Hardisty, Alberta]]. Most of the feeder pipelines move blended bitumen or SCO southbound and diluent northbound, but a few move product laterally within the oil sands region. In 2012, the capacity of the southbound feeder lines was over 300,000 m³/d (2 million bbl/d) and more capacity was being added. The building of new oil sands feeder pipelines requires only the approval of the Alberta Energy Regulator, an agency that deals with matters entirely within Alberta and is likely to give little consideration to interference from political and environmental interest from outside Alberta.&lt;ref name="Cairns 2013"&gt;

===Existing pipelines===
From Edmonton and Hardisty, main transmission pipelines move blended bitumen and SCO, as well as conventional crude oil and various oil and natural productions to market destinations across North America. The main transmission systems include:&lt;ref name="Cairns 2013"/&gt;

* [[Enbridge]] has a complex existing system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty east to [[Montreal]] and south as far as the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], with a total capacity of {{convert|2.5|e6oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It also has a northbound pipeline that takes diluent from refineries in Illinois and other [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern states]] to Edmonton with a capacity of {{convert|160000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of light hydrocarbons.
* [[Kinder Morgan]] has the Trans Mountain Pipeline that takes crude oil from Edmonton over the Rocky Mountains to the west coasts of British Columbia and Washington State, with an existing capacity of {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It has plans to add an additional {{convert|450000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of capacity to this pipeline within the existing pipeline [[easement]].
* [[Spectra Energy]] has a system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Hardisty south to [[Casper, Wyoming]] and then east to [[Wood River, Illinois]]. The first segment has a capacity of {{convert|280000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} and the second segment {{convert|160000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.
* [[TransCanada Corporation]] has the [[Keystone Pipeline]] system. Phase 1 currently takes crude oil from Hardisty south to [[Steele City, Nebraska]] and then east to [[Wood River, Illinois]]. The existing Phase 2 moves crude oil from Steele City to the main US oil marketing hub at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]]. Phases 1 and 2 have a combined capacity of {{convert|590000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.

Overall, the total pipeline capacity for the movement of crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty to the rest of North America is about {{convert|3.5|e6oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. However, other substances such as conventional crude oil and refined petroleum products also share this pipeline network. The rapidly increasing [[tight oil]] production from the [[Bakken formation]] of [[North Dakota]] also competes for space on the Canadian export pipeline system. North Dakota oil producers are using the Canadian pipelines to deliver their oil to US refineries.

In 2012, the Canadian export pipeline system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented [[Rationing|pipeline apportionment]] on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space by reducing the monthly allocation of each shipper to a certain percentage of its requirements. The [[Chevron Corporation]] [[Burnaby Refinery]], the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate [[NAFTA]] equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota [[tight oil]] production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.&lt;ref name="ST98-2013"/&gt;

In addition, the US oil marketing hub at Cushing was flooded with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to take it from there to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of [[West Texas Intermediate]] delivered at Cushing, which is the main [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as [[Brent Crude]] and [[Dubai Crude]]. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as ''the price of oil'', this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast.

===New pipelines===
Lack of access to markets, limited export capacity, and oversupply in the US market have been a problem for oil sands producers in recent years. They have caused lower prices to Canadian oil sands producers and reduced royalty and tax revenues to Canadian governments. The pipeline companies have moved forward with a number of solutions to the transportation problems:&lt;ref name="ST98-2013"/&gt;
* Enbridge's line from [[Sarnia, Ontario]] to Westover, Ontario near the head of [[Lake Erie]] has been reversed. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in the Sarnia area. Now it takes Alberta SCO and blended bitumen to most refineries in Ontario.
* Enbridge has applied to reverse its line from Westover to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in southern Ontario. After reversal, it will take Alberta SCO and bitumen to Montreal. Since [[Suncor Energy]] owns a very large oil sands mine and upgrader in Alberta and also owns a large oil refinery in Montreal, it finds this project appealing. The alternative is closing the refinery since it is noncompetitive using offshore oil.
*TransCanada is evaluating converting part of its mainline natural gas transmission system from western Canada to eastern North America to transport oil. Eastern North America is well supplied with natural gas as a result of the recent increases in US [[shale gas]] production, but has problems with oil supply since most of their oil comes from offshore.
*Enbridge's [[Seaway Pipeline]] which used to take oil from the US Gulf Coast to the oil trading hub at Cushing was reversed in 2012 to take oil from Cushing to the Coast, helping to alleviate the bottleneck at Cushing. It has a capacity of {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} but Enbridge is twinning the pipeline to add an additional {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.
*Following the denial of a US regulatory permit for its [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL pipeline]], TransCanada went ahead with the southern leg of the Keystone project. This will deliver {{convert|830000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} from Cushing to the Coast. Since it is entirely within the states of Oklahoma and Texas, it does not require US federal government approval.

===Future pipelines===
With the main constraint on Canadian oil sands development becoming the availability of export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed a number of major new transmission pipelines. Many of these became stalled in government regulatory processes, both by the Canadian and American governments. Another factor is competition for pipeline space from rapidly increasing [[tight oil]] production from North Dakota, which under NAFTA trade rules has equal access to Canadian pipelines.&lt;ref name="ST98-2013"/&gt;
* Enbridge has announced its intention to expand its Alberta Clipper line from {{convert|450000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|570000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} and its Southern Access line from {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|560000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It is also proposing to build a Flanagan South line with an initial capacity of {{convert|585000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} expandable to {{convert|800000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.
* Enbridge is proposing to build the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway Pipeline]] from [[Bruderheim]], near [[Edmonton, Alberta]] to the port of [[Kitimat, BC]] for loading on [[supertanker]]s with an initial capacity of {{convert|525000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} with a reverse flow condensate pipeline to take diluent from tankers at Kitimat to Alberta. This was approved by the Canadian federal cabinet on June 17, 2014, subject to 209 conditions. After this point, the company has to satisfy most of the conditions to [[National Energy Board]] satisfaction before construction can start. Satisfying the conditions is expected to take a year or more. The leaders of both main opposition parties promised to reverse the decision if they form the government in the 2015 election.&lt;ref name=Payton&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irving Oil Refinery]] in New Brunswick, which is the largest oil refinery in Canada, is especially interested in it since its traditional sources such as [[North Sea oil]] are shrinking and international oil is more expensive than Alberta oil delivered to the Atlantic coast.
 
In addition, there are a large number of new pipelines proposed for Alberta. These will likely be approved rapidly by the Alberta Energy Regulator, so there are likely to be few capacity problems within Alberta.

===Rail===
The movement of crude oil by rail is far from new, but it is now a rapidly growing market for [[Railroad classes|North American railroads]]. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.&lt;ref name="Cairns 2013"/&gt;

A single-track rail line carrying 10 trains per day, each with 120 tank cars, can move {{convert|630000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|780000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, which is the capacity of a large transmission pipeline. This would require 300 locomotives and 18,000 tank cars, which is a small part of the fleet of a Class 1 railroad. By comparison, the two Canadian Class 1 railways, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP) and [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN), have 2,400 locomotives and 65,000 freight cars between them, and CP moves 30–35 trains per day on its main line to Vancouver. Two US Class 1 railways, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP) and [[BNSF Railway]] handle more than 100 trains per day on their western corridors.&lt;ref name="Cairns 2013"/&gt; CN Rail has said that it could move {{convert|1500000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen from Edmonton to the deepwater port of [[Prince Rupert, BC]] if the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Edmonton to the port of [[Kitimat, BC]] was not approved.

With many of their lines being underused, railroads find transporting crude oil an attractive source of revenue. With enough new tank cars they could carry all the new oil being produced in North America, albeit at higher prices than pipelines. In the short term, the use of rail will probably continue to grow as producers try to bypass short-term pipeline bottlenecks to take advantage of higher prices in areas with refineries capable of handling heavier crudes. In the long term the growth in rail transport will largely depend on the continued pipeline bottlenecks due to increased production in North America and regulatory delays for new pipelines. At present rail moves over {{convert|90000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude oil, and with continued growth in oil production and building of new terminals, rail movements will probably continue to grow into the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name="ST98-2013"/&gt;

By 2013, exports of oil from Canada to the US by rail had increased 9-fold in less than two years, from {{convert|16000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in early 2012 to {{convert|146000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in late 2013, mainly because new export pipelines had been held up by regulatory delays. As a result, Canadian farmers suffered an acute shortage of rail capacity to export their grains because so much of Canada's rail capacity was tied up by oil products. The safety of rail transport of oil was being called into question after several derailments, especially after a train with 74 tank cars of oil derailed and caught fire in [[Lac Megantic, Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;

The ensuing explosion and firestorm burned down 40 buildings in the town center and killed 47 people. The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings may need to be demolished. Ironically, the oil was not Canadian bitumen being exported to the United States but [[Bakken formation]] [[light crude oil]] being imported into Canada from [[North Dakota]] to the [[Irving Oil Refinery]] in [[New Brunswick]]. Although near [[Canaport|a huge oil import port]] on the Atlantic Ocean, the Irving refinery is importing US Bakken oil by rail because oil from outside North America is too expensive to be economic, and there are no pipelines to deliver heavier but cheaper Western Canadian oil to New Brunswick. It was subsequently pointed out that the Bakken light oil was much more flammable than Alberta bitumen, and the rail cars were mislabeled by the North Dakota producers as to their flammability.

By 2014, the movement of crude by rail had become very profitable to oil companies. [[Suncor Energy]], Canada's largest oil company declared record profits and attributed much of it to transporting oil to market by rail. It was moving about {{convert|70000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], and putting it into TransCanada's new Gulf Coast pipeline – which was originally going to be the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, before the northern leg across the border from Canada was stalled by US federal government delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suncor has also been moving {{convert|20000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of Alberta bitumen and North Dakota tight oil by rail to its [[Montreal Refinery]] with plans to increase it to {{convert|35000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. Suncor claimed this saved about $10/bbl off the price of buying offshore oil. However, it was also anticipating the reversal of [[Enbridge]]'s Line 9 from southwestern Ontario to Montreal to deliver {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} oil even cheaper. Suncor has been considering adding a coker to its Montreal refinery to upgrade heavy oil sands bitumen, which would be cheaper than adding another upgrader to its oil sands operation. It was also shipping marine cargoes on an "opportunistic basis" from Texas and Louisiana "at significant discounts to the international crudes we would typically run in Montreal", thereby taking advantage of the recent US [[tight oil]] glut in addition to increased supplies of cheap Canadian oil sands bitumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Refining==
{{See also|oil refinery}}
Heavy [[crude oil feedstock#crude feedstock]] needs pre-processing before it is fit for conventional refineries, although heavy oil and bitumen refineries can do the pre-processing themselves. This pre-processing is called 'upgrading', the key components of which are as follows:
# removal of water, sand, physical waste, and lighter products
# catalytic purification by [[hydrodemetallisation]] (HDM), [[hydrodesulfurization]] (HDS) and [[hydrodenitrogenation]] (HDN)
# hydrogenation through carbon rejection or [[catalytic hydrocracking]] (HCR)

As carbon rejection is very inefficient and wasteful in most cases, [[catalytic hydrocracking]] is preferred in most cases. All these processes take large amounts of energy and water, while emitting more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.

Catalytic purification and hydrocracking are together known as [[hydroprocessing]]. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is to deal with the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time. Many efforts have been made to deal with this to ensure high activity and long life of a catalyst. Catalyst materials and pore size distributions are key parameters that need to be optimized to deal with this challenge and varies from place to place, depending on the kind of feedstock present.&lt;ref&gt;

Some of the large oil sands upgraders also produced diesel fuel as part of their operations. Some of the oil sands bitumen and SCO went to refineries other provinces, but most of it was exported to the United States. The four major Alberta refineries are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Alberta government has guaranteed NWU's loans and signed a firm contract for feedstock deliveries because of some economic issues. Alberta levies [[royalties]] on bitumen at "before payout" (2%) and "after payout" (25%) rates, and accepts payments "in kind" rather than "in cash." (BRIK), Alberta will receive 300,000 bpd of bitumen under this BRIK program. With bitumen production expected to reach {{convert|5000000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2035, it means that after the projects pay out, the Alberta government will have {{convert|1250000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of bitumen to sell. Since Alberta has a chronic shortage of diesel fuel, the government would prefer to sell diesel fuel rather than bitumen to Alberta and international oil companies.&lt;ref name="Alberta_Venture_2013"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://albertaventure.com/2013/04/north-west-upgrading-cnrl-refinery/ | title = North West Upgrading and CNRL get set to break ground on new refinery | first= Geoffrey |last=Morgan | date = 16 April 2013 | publisher = Alberta Venture| accessdate = 16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest of Canada===
{{See also|List_of_oil_refineries#Canada}}
Canadian oil exports have increased tenfold since 1980, mostly as the result of new oil sands bitumen and heavy oil output, but at the same time Canadian oil consumption and refining capacity has hardly grown at all. Since the 1970s, the number of oil refineries in Canada has declined from 40 to 19. There hasn't been a new oil refinery (other than oil sands upgraders) built in Canada since 1984.

Most of the Canadian oil refining industry is foreign-owned, and except for Alberta, international companies preferred to build refining capacity elsewhere than in Canada. The result is a serious imbalance between Canadian oil production versus Canadian oil refining. Although Canada produces much more oil than it refines, and exports more oil and refined products than it consumes, most of the new production is heavier than traditional oil and concentrated in the [[landlocked]] provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Canadian refineries have pipeline access to and can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada. The remainder of Canadian oil production is exported, almost all of it to the US. At the same time Canada imports {{convert|700000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude oil from other countries and exports much of the oil products to other countries, most of it to the US.&lt;ref name="Mendelson"&gt;

Canadian refineries, outside of the major oil producing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built on the assumption that light and medium crude oil would continue to be cheap in the long term, and that imported oil would be cheaper than oil sands production. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of [[Quebec]], the [[Atlantic Provinces]], and [[British Columbia]] where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel.&lt;ref name="Mendelson"/&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|List of oil refineries#United States|North American energy independence|Western Canadian Select}}
Prior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was the largest oil importer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|title=China overtakes US as the biggest importer of oil|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475934|accessdate=2014-05-11|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 October 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, many of which have been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined. The main market for Canadian bitumen as well as Venezuelan extra-heavy oil was assumed to be the US. The United States has historically been Canada’s largest customer for crude oil and products, particularly in recent years. American imports of oil and products from Canada grew from {{convert | 450000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} in 1981 to {{convert | 3120000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} in 2013 as Canada's oil sands produced more and more oil, while in the US, domestic production and imports from other countries declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this relationship is becoming strained due to physical, economic and political influences. Export pipeline capacity is approaching its limits; Canadian oil is selling at a discount to world market prices; and US demand for crude oil and product imports has declined because of US economic problems.

For the benefit of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian producers created a new [[benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] called [[Western Canadian Select]], (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy crude oils. This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19–21 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as "conventional heavy oil" by governments. There are several hundred thousand barrels per day of this blend being imported into the US, in addition to larger amounts of crude bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO) from the oil sands.

The demand from US refineries is increasingly for non-upgraded bitumen rather than SCO. The Canadian [[National Energy Board]] (NEB) expects SCO volumes to double to around {{convert|1900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2035, but not keep pace with the total increase in bitumen production. It projects that the portion of oil sands production that is upgraded to SCO to decline from 49% in 2010 to 37% in 2035. This implies that over {{convert|3200000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen will have to be blended with diluent for delivery to market.

===Asia===
{{See also|Petroleum industry in China}}
Demand for oil in Asia has been growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China replaced the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production. The main impediment to Canadian exports to Asia is pipeline capacity – The only pipeline capable of delivering oil sands production to Canada's Pacific Coast is the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver, which is now operating at its capacity of {{convert | 300000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} supplying refineries in B.C. and Washington State. However, once complete, the Northern Gateway pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion currently undergoing government review are expected to deliver an additional {{convert | 500000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} to {{convert | 1100000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} to tankers on the Pacific coast, from where they could deliver it anywhere in the world. There is sufficient heavy oil refinery capacity in China and India to refine the additional Canadian volume, possibly with some modifications to the refineries.&lt;ref name="Hackett 2013"&gt;{{cite web

==Economics==
The world's largest deposits of [[bitumen]] are in Canada, although Venezuela's deposits of extra-[[heavy crude oil]] are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources of all types and its oil and natural gas resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant [[hydroelectric]] resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. In a scenario with oil prices above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs, with the excess oil production from its oil sands probably going to export. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.&lt;ref name="NEB2013"&gt;
{{cite web

Canada has abundant resources of bitumen and crude oil, with an estimated remaining ultimate resource potential of 54 billion cubic metres (340 billion barrels). Of this, oil sands bitumen accounts for 90 per cent. Alberta currently accounts for all of Canada’s bitumen resources. '''Resources''' become '''reserves''' only after it is proven that economic recovery can be achieved. At 2013 prices using current technology, Canada had remaining oil reserves of 27 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (170 billion bbls), with 98% of this attributed to oil sands bitumen. This put its reserves in third place in the world behind [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].  At the much lower prices of 2015, the reserves are much smaller.

===Costs===
The costs of production and transportation of saleable petroleum from oil sands is typically significantly higher than from conventional global sources.&lt;ref name=CERI2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=CERI-June2015/&gt; Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable to the price of oil. The price of [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]] above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production. Major Canadian oil companies had announced expansion plans and foreign companies were investing significant amounts of capital, in many cases forming partnerships with Canadian companies. Investment had been shifting towards [[in-situ]] [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) projects and away from mining and upgrading projects, as oil sands operators foresee better opportunities from selling bitumen and heavy oil directly to refineries than from upgrading it to [[synthetic crude oil]]. [[Cost estimates]] for Canada '''include''' the effects of the mining when the mines are returned to the environment in "as good as or better than original condition". Cleanup of the end products of consumption are the responsibility of the consuming jurisdictions, which are mostly in provinces or countries other than the producing one.

The Alberta government estimated that in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas the cost of new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel.&lt;ref name="ST98-2013"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; production from oil sands was then expected to be highly profitable assuming the product could be delivered to markets. The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil without upgrading.

The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) performed an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl.&lt;ref name=CERI2012&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were expected to be consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred to spend that extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil.

Then in late 2014 the dramatic rise in U.S. production from shale formations, combined with a global economic malaise that reduced demand, caused the price of WTI to drop below $50, where it remained as of late 2015.&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;{{cite news

In 2015, the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) re-estimated the average plant gate costs (again including 10% profit margin) of SAGD to be $58.65/bbl, and 70.18/bbl for mining without upgrading. Including costs of blending and transportation, the WTI equivalent supply costs for delivery to Cushing become US$80.06/bbl for SAGD projects, and US$89.71/bbl for a standalone mine.&lt;ref name=CERI2015&gt;{{cite web

===Production forecasts===
Oil sands production forecasts released by the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP), the [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] (AER), and the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) are comparable to [[National Energy Board]] (NEB) projections, in terms of total bitumen production. None of these forecasts take into account probable international constraints to be imposed on combustion of all hydrocarbons in order to limit global temperature rise, giving rise to a situation denoted by the term "[[carbon bubble]]".&lt;ref name=Demos&gt;{{cite report
|url=http://www.demos.org/news/beware-carbon-bubble

|date= 23 December 2013
|accessdate=6 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring such constraints, and also assuming that the price of oil recovers from its collapse in late 2014, the list of currently proposed projects, many of which are in the early planning stages, would suggest that by 2035 Canadian bitumen production could potentially reach as much as 1.3 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/d (8.3 million barrels per day) if most were to go ahead. Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth would likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods.

An additional assumption is that there would be sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this were a limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another assumption is that US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of [[tight oil]] production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on [[United States energy independence|imported crude]]. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] rejected the proposal to build the [[Keystone XL pipeline]] from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska.&lt;ref name=NoKeystone&gt;{{cite news

In the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river barge, tanker, and other transportation methods. Other than ocean tankers, these alternatives are all more expensive than pipelines.&lt;ref name=CERI-June2015&gt;{{cite report

A shortage of skilled workers in the Canadian oil sands developed during periods of rapid development of new projects. In the absence of other constraints on further development, the oil and gas industry would need to fill tens of thousands of job openings in the next few years as a result of industry activity levels as well as age-related attrition. In the longer term, under a scenario of higher oil and gas prices, the labor shortages would continue to get worse. A potential labor shortage can increase construction costs and slow the pace of oil sands development.&lt;ref name="NEB2013"/&gt;

The skilled worker shortage was much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company [[PDVSA]] fired most of its heavy oil experts after the [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03]], and wound down the production of [[Orimulsion]], which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry|re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry]] and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.

As of late 2015, development of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations.&lt;ref name=Penty/&gt; Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the [[European Community]] and China. Low-cost production by [[OPEC]] continued at maximum capacity, efficiency of production from U.S. shales continued to improve, and Russian exports were mandated even below cost of production, as their only source of hard currency.&lt;ref name=Shilling&gt;{{cite news

A detailed academic study of the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 that a third of global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2&amp;nbsp;°C. Hence continued exploration or development of reserves would be extraneous to needs. To meet the 2&amp;nbsp;°C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market. The impact on producers in Canada would be far larger than in the U.S. Open-pit mining of natural bitumen in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;{{cite web

===Air pollution management===

The Alberta government computes an [[Air Quality Health Index (Canada)|Air Quality Health Index]] (AQHI) from sensors in five communities in the oil sands region, operated by a "partner" called the [[Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo|Wood Buffalo]] Environmental Association (WBEA).  Each of their 17 continuously monitoring stations measure 3 to 10 air quality parameters among [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}), total reduced [[sulfur]] (TRS), [[Ammonia]] ({{chem|N|H|3}}), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[nitrogen dioxide]] ({{chem|N|O|2}}), [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;), [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}), [[particulate matter]] (PM2.5), [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|S|O|2}}), total [[hydrocarbons]] (THC), and [[methane]]/non-methane hydrocarbons ({{chem|C|H|4}}/NMHC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wbea.org/air-monitoring/continuous-monitoring |publisher=Wood Buffalo Environmental Association | title=Continuous Monitoring | accessdate=6 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These AQHI are said to indicate 'low risk"'air quality more than 95% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oilsands.alberta.ca/air.html |publisher=Government of Alberta Environment and Water | title=Alberta's Oil Sands: Air | accessdate=6 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2012, air monitoring showed significant increases in exceedances of hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|H|2|S}}) both in the Fort McMurray area and near the oil sands upgraders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01997.html |publisher=Government of Alberta Environment and Water | title=Air Quality and the Oil Sands | accessdate=16 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Alberta government issued an environmental protection order to Suncor in response to numerous occasions when ground level concentration for {{chem|H|2|S}}) exceeded standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=22769EEFBE725-9D96-985A-E4143B1351544456 |date=18 December 2007 |publisher=Government of Alberta | title=Province orders Suncor to address excessive {{chem|H|2|S}} emissions }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberta Ambient Air Data Management System (AAADMS) of the Clean Air Strategic Alliance&lt;ref&gt;http://casahome.org/AboutCASA.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; (aka CASA Data Warehouse) records that, during the year ending on 1 November 2015, there were 6 hourly reports of values exceeding the limit of 10 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] for {{chem|H|2|S}}, and 4 in 2013, down from 11 in 2014, and 73 in 2012.&lt;ref name=CASA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.casadata.org/Reports/SelectCategory.asp |publisher=[[Clean Air Strategic Alliance]] | title=Exceedance Reports | accessdate=6 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the [[Pembina Institute]] published a brief report about "a recent surge of odour and air quality concerns in northern Alberta associated with the expansion of oilsands development", contrasting the responses to these concerns in [[Peace River]] and [[Fort McKay]]. In Fort McKay, air quality is actively addressed by stakeholders represented in the WBEA, whereas the Peace River community must rely on the response of the [[Alberta Energy Regulator]].  In an effort to identify the sources of the noxious odours in the Fort McKay community, a Fort McKay Air Quality Index was established, extending the provincial Air Quality Health Index to include possible contributors to the problem: {{chem|S|O|2}}, TRS, and THC. Despite these advantages, more progress was made in remediating the odour problems in the Peace River community, although only after some families had already abandoned their homes.  The odour concerns in Fort McKay were reported to remain unresolved.&lt;ref name=odours&gt;{{cite report

===Water management===
Between 2 and 4.5 volume units of water are used to produce each volume unit of synthetic crude oil in an ''ex-situ'' mining operation. According to Greenpeace, the Canadian oil sands operations use {{convert|349|e6m3/a|abbr=on}} of water, twice the amount of water used by the city of [[Calgary]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, in SAGD operations, 90–95% of the water is recycled and only about 0.2 volume units of water is used per volume unit of bitumen produced.&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2010, the Oil Sands Advisory Panel, commissioned by former environment minister Jim Prentice, found that the system in place for monitoring water quality in the region, including work by the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program, the Alberta Water Research Institute, the Cumulative Environmental Management Association and others, was piecemeal and should become more comprehensive and coordinated.&lt;ref name="2010 OAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Foundation for the Future: Building an Environmental Monitoring System for the Oil Sands|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/pollution/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E9ABC93B-1#s2c|work=Monitoring Organizations in the Oil Sands Area|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
The production of bitumen and synthetic crude oil emits more greenhouse gases than the production of conventional crude oil. A 2009 study by the consulting firm [[IHS CERA]] estimated that production from Canada's oil sands emits "about 5% to 15% more carbon dioxide, over the
"well-to-wheels" (WTW) lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil."&lt;ref&gt;

A [[Stanford University]] study commissioned by the EU in 2011 found that oil sands crude was as much as 22% more carbon intensive than other fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Barbara |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/05/10/us-oil-sands-idUSBRE8490OL20120510 |title=Insight: Canada's oil sand battle with Europe &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= 10 May 2012|accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://circabc.europa.eu/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/db806977-6418-44db-a464-20267139b34d/Brandt_Oil_Sands_GHGs_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenpeace says the oil sands industry has been identified as the largest contributor to [[greenhouse gas emissions]] growth in Canada, as it accounts for 40&amp;nbsp;million tons of {{chem|CO|2}} emissions per year.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] and [[Environment Canada]] the industrial activity undertaken to produce oil sands make up about 5% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, or 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It predicts the oil sands will grow to make up 8% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 2015.&lt;ref name = "CAPP"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While the production industrial activity emissions per barrel of bitumen produced decreased 26% over the decade 1992–2002, total emissions from production activity were expected to increase due to higher production levels.&lt;ref&gt;

To offset greenhouse gas emissions from the oil sands and elsewhere in Alberta, sequestering carbon dioxide emissions inside depleted oil and gas reservoirs has been proposed. This technology is inherited from [[enhanced oil recovery]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/CCS_Implementation.pdf |title=Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage Implementation in Alberta, Final Report |format=PDF |publisher=Alberta Carbon Capture and Storage Development Council |date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2008, the Alberta government announced a C$2&amp;nbsp;billion fund to support sequestration projects in Alberta power plants and oil sands extraction and upgrading facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

In November 2014, [[Fatih Birol]], the [[chief economist]] of the [[International Energy Agency]], described additional greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's oil sands as "extremely low". The IEA forecasts that in the next 25 years oil sands production in Canada will increase by more than {{convert|3|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, but Dr. Birol said "the emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|emissions of China]] — not even one day." The IEA is charged with responsibility for battling climate change, but Dr. Birol said he spends little time worrying about carbon emissions from oil sands. "There is a lot of discussion on oil sands projects in Canada and the United States and other parts of the world, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming from the oil sands is extremely low." Dr. Birol acknowledged that there is tremendous difference of opinion on the course of action regarding climate change, but added, "I hope all these reactions are based on scientific facts and sound analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2014, the U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]] published a report in preparation for the decision about permitting construction of the [[Keystone XL pipeline]]. The report states in part: "Canadian oil sands crudes are generally more GHG emission-intensive than other crudes they may displace in U.S. refineries, and emit an estimated 17% more GHGs on a life-cycle basis than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the United States".&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite report

===Aquatic life deformities===
There is conflicting research on the effects of the oil sands development on aquatic life. In 2007, Environment Canada completed a study that shows high deformity rates in fish embryos exposed to the oil sands.  [[David W. Schindler]], a limnologist from the [[University of Alberta]], co-authored a study on Alberta's oil sands' contribution of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic polycyclic compounds]], some of which are known [[carcinogen]]s, to the Athabasca River and its tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Public health impacts===
In 2007, it was suggested that wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of [[arsenic]] in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (although below international thresholds for consumption).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2007/04/03/game-alberta.html?ref=rss | work=CBC News | title=Mixed reports on safety of eating northern Alberta game | date=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised concerning the negative impacts that the oil sands have on public health, including higher than normal rates of [[cancer]] among residents of [[Fort Chipewyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE51568020090206 | work=Reuters | title=High cancer rates confirmed near Canada's oil sands | date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, John O'Connor, the doctor who initially reported the higher cancer rates and linked them to the oil sands development, was subsequently investigated by the [[Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons]]. The College later reported that O'Connor's statements consisted of "mistruths, inaccuracies and unconfirmed information."&lt;ref name=foesignore/&gt;

In 2010, the [[Royal Society of Canada]] released a report stating that "there is currently no credible evidence of environmental contaminant exposures from oil sands reaching Fort Chipewyan at levels expected to cause elevated human cancer rates."&lt;ref name=foesignore/&gt;

In August 2011, the Alberta government initiated a provincial health study to examine whether a link exists between the higher rates of cancer and the oil sands emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/08/19/edm-cancer-oilsands-fort-chipewyan-study.html |work=CBC News |title=Cancer rates downstream from oil sands to be probed |date=19 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820032845/http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/08/19/edm-cancer-oilsands-fort-chipewyan-study.html |archivedate=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report released in 2014, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. James Talbot, stated that "There isn’t strong evidence for an association between any of these cancers and environmental exposure [to tar sands]." Rather, Talbot suggested that the cancer rates at [[Fort Chipewyan]], which were slightly higher compared with the provincial average, were likely due to a combination of factors such as high rates of smoking, obesity, diabetes, and alcoholism as well as poor levels of vaccination."&lt;ref name=foesignore&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/24/oil-sands-foes-ignore-the-facts-as-cancer-claims-dealt-a-blow-by-study/?__lsa=a8bb-df46 Oil sands foes ignore the facts as cancer claims dealt a blow by study] by Claudia Cattaneo, ''[[Financial Post]]'', March 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olympic Airways Flight 954''' was a [[Douglas DC-6|Douglas DC-6B]] aircraft that crashed into a mountain near [[Keratea]] (approx. coordinates 37°48' N, 23°57' E), [[Greece]]. All 85 passengers and 5 crew on board died in the crash.

==The crash==
The flight was a domestic scheduled passenger service from [[Chania]] on the island of [[Crete]] to [[Athens]]. While on approach to Athens and with its undercarriage retracted, the aircraft struck Mount Paneio at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. The weather at the time of the crash was characterized by rain and high winds.

The crash of Flight 954 was the deadliest aviation accident in Greek history at the time it took place, a record it maintained until the crash of [[Helios Airways Flight 522]] nearly thirty-six years later. It is still the deadliest aviation accident involving a Douglas DC-6.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19691208-0 Aircraft accident Douglas DC-6B SX-DAE Athens]&lt;/ref&gt; and deadliest crash in the history of Olympic Airways.

==Cause==
It was ruled that the flight crew had deviated from the proper track and descended below the [[Lowest safe altitude|minimum safe altitude]] while making an [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aviation Disasters Second Edition |last1=Gero |first1=David |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |year= 1996 |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government incentives==

In September 2011 the Swedish government approved a {{SEK|200 million}} program, effective starting in January 2012, to provide a subsidy of {{SEK|40,000}} per car for the purchase of 5,000 electric cars and other "super green cars" with ultra-low carbon emissions, defined as those with emissions below 50 grams of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) per km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Desk|first=Lifestyle|title=Sweden Follows Suit with Electric Car Subsidy|url=http://theglobalherald.com/sweden-follows-suit-with-electric-car-subsidy/24444/|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Global Herald|date=2011-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017103803/http://theglobalherald.com/sweden-follows-suit-with-electric-car-subsidy/24444/|archivedate=17 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is also an exemption from the annual circulation tax for the first five years from the date of their first registration that benefits owners of electric vehicles with an energy consumption of 37 [[kWh]] per 100&amp;nbsp;km or less, and hybrid vehicles with {{CO2}} emissions of 120 [[g/km]] or less. In addition, for both electric and hybrid vehicles, the taxable value of the car for the purposes of calculating the benefit in kind of a company car under personal income tax is reduced by 40% compared with the corresponding or comparable gasoline or diesel-powered car. 
The reduction of the taxable value has a cap of {{SEK|16,000}} per year.&lt;ref name=ACEA2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20110330_EV_tax_overview.pdf|title=Overview of Purchase and Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles in the EU|publisher=[[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]]|date=2011-03-14|accessdate=2011-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927060852/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20110330_EV_tax_overview.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 the [[Riksdagen]], the Swedish parliament, approved an appropriation of {{SEK|215 million}} to finance the super clean car subsidies in 2015. The appropriation for 2015, according to the parliamentary decision and subsequent government decision, was to also be used for the retroactive payment of the super green cars registered in 2014 that did not receive the subsidy.&lt;ref name=Sweden2014/&gt;

The Government raised the appropriation for the super green car rebate by {{SEK|132 million}} for 2015 and by {{SEK|94 million}} for 2016. 
Beginning in  2016, only [[Zero-emissions vehicle|zero emissions cars]] are entitled to receive the full {{SEK|40,000}} premium, while other super green cars, plug-in hybrids, receive half premium. 
The exemption for the first five years of ownership from the annual circulation tax is still in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bilsweden.se/fordon-i-samhallet/miljo/e10/stimulanser-for-miljobilar |title=Stimulanser för miljöbilar |language=Swedish |trans-title=Incentives for green cars |author=Bil Sweden |publisher=Bil Sweden |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Subisdies2015_2020/&gt; In 2016, in order to promote the introduction of electricity-powered buses in the market, the Government planned to allocate {{SEK|50 million}} for 2016 and {{SEK|100 million}} per year between 2017 and 2019 to introduce an electric bus premium.&lt;ref name=Subisdies2015_2020&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.government.se/government-policy/environment/fossil-free-transport-and-travel-the-governments-work-to-reduce-the-impact-of-transport-on-the-climate/ |title=Fossil-free transport and travel: The Government’s work to reduce the impact of transport on the climate |publisher=Government Offices of Sweden |date=2016-05-25 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two alternative proposals are being considered by the Swedish government regarding the introduction of a [[bonus-malus]] system. Both proposals entail changes to vehicle and car benefit taxation and the premium system for purchases of new cars. An official inquiry report was due by 29 April 2016. The goal is for the system to enter into force on 1 January 2017.&lt;ref name=Subisdies2015_2020/&gt;

The '''Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation''' (RTFO) in the [[United Kingdom]] is a requirement on transport fuel suppliers to ensure that 5 percent of all road vehicle fuel is supplied from sustainable renewable sources by 2010. The Government intends to set variable targets for the level of carbon and sustainability performance expected from all transport fuel suppliers claiming certificates for biofuels in the early years of the RTFO.&lt;ref name=UKRTFO&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/govrecrfa.pdf |format=PDF |title=Carbon and Sustainability Reporting Within the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation |author= |publisher=Department of Transport, United Kingdom |date=January 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325050654/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/govrecrfa.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UKfaq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/faq |title=Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation: frequently asked questions |publisher=UK Department of Transport (DfT) |author= |date= |accessdate=25 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907015825/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/faq |archivedate=7 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement to introduce the Obligation was made on 10 November 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=177217&amp;NewsAreaID=2&lt;/ref&gt; using powers included in the [[Energy Act 2004]]. It came into force on 15 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20073072_en_2#pt2&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2005, biofuel made up 0.25% of overall road fuel sales, around 50% of it imported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biodiesel.co.uk/biofuels_breakthrough.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will mostly be achieved by blending [[fossil fuel]]s with [[Ethanol fuel|bioethanol]], [[Methanol fuel|biomethanol]] or [[biodiesel]] - derived from sources such as [[palm oil]], [[Rapeseed|oilseed rape]], [[cereal]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[sugar beet]], and reprocessed vegetable oil - or [[biomethane]]. Almost all existing vehicles are able to run on a 5% blend in liquid fuels, {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} in some cases with fuel system adjustments. [[Natural gas vehicles]] can run on pure [[biomethane]]. Consideration should also be given to the effect of biofuel constituents on fuel system parts such as rubber hoses, particularly in older or classic vehicles. [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|Flexible Fuel Vehicles]], currently more common in the Americas than in Europe, are able to use blends of up to 85% ethanol in the U.S. and Canada, and up to 100% [[hydrous]] ethanol in [[Brazil]].

The requirement that the biofuel sources should be sustainable is also important. In [[South America]] and [[Asia]], the production of biofuels for export has in some cases resulted in significant ecological damage, including the clearing of [[rainforest]].

In the future, the [[Department for Transport]] estimate that up to 1/3 of the fuel in the UK transport sector could be produced from home-grown biofuels. In addition to contributing to cutting carbon emissions, the use of biofuels is seen as widening the country's fuel diversity and increasing fuel [[security]].

The RTFO will help bring the UK into line with [[Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport|European Union biofuels directive]], which sets targets for all EU countries for biofuel usage of 2% by the end of 2005 and 5.75% by the end of 2010.

==Implementation==
The RTFO will be implemented through a certification scheme administered by the Department for Transport. Companies certified as having sold more than the 5% obligation will be able to sell their certificates for the excess to those who sold less.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22794">The term '''six-stroke engine''' has been applied to a number of alternative [[internal combustion engine]] designs that attempt to improve on traditional [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] and [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] engines.  Claimed advantages may include increased [[fuel efficiency]], reduced mechanical complexity and/or reduced [[exhaust gas|emissions]].  These engines can be divided into two groups based on the number of pistons that contribute to the six strokes.

In the single-piston designs, the engine captures the heat lost from the four-stroke [[Otto cycle]] or [[Diesel cycle]] and uses it to drive an additional power and exhaust stroke of the piston in the same cylinder in an attempt to improve fuel-efficiency and/or assist with engine cooling.  The pistons in this type of six-stroke engine go up and down three times for each injection of fuel.  These designs use either steam or air as the working fluid for the additional power stroke.&lt;ref name=autoweek1 /&gt;

The designs in which the six strokes are determined by the interactions between two pistons are more diverse.  The pistons may be [[Opposed-piston engine|opposed in a single cylinder]] or may reside in separate cylinders.  Usually one cylinder makes two strokes while the other makes four strokes giving six piston movements per cycle.  The second piston may be used to replace the valve mechanism of a conventional engine, which may reduce mechanical complexity and enable an increased [[compression ratio]] by eliminating hotspots that would otherwise limit compression.  The second piston may also be used to increase the expansion ratio, decoupling it from the compression ratio.  Increasing the expansion ratio in this way can increase thermodynamic efficiency in a similar manner to the [[Miller cycle|Miller]] or [[Atkinson cycle|Atkinson]] cycle.

==Engine types==

===Single-piston designs===
These designs use a single piston per cylinder, like a conventional two- or four-stroke engine. A secondary, non-detonating fluid is injected into the chamber, and the leftover heat from combustion causes it to expand for a second power stroke followed by a second exhaust stroke.

====Griffin six-stroke engine====
[[File:Kerr Six-stroke Anson 6181.JPG|thumb|right|The Kerr engine at the [[Anson Engine Museum]]]]
In 1883, the [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]-based engineer Samuel Griffin was an established maker of steam and gas engines. He wished to produce an internal combustion engine, but without paying the licensing costs of the [[Otto cycle|Otto]] patents. His solution was to develop a "patent slide valve" and a single-acting six-stroke engine using it.
By 1886, Scottish steam locomotive maker [[Dick, Kerr &amp; Co.]] saw a future in large oil engines and licensed the Griffin patents. These were double-acting, tandem engines and sold under the name "Kilmarnock".&lt;ref name="Smokestak" &gt;{{cite web

}}, linked photos and period diagrams&lt;/ref&gt; A major market for the Griffin engine was in electricity generation, where they developed a reputation for happily running light for long periods, then suddenly being able to take up a large demand for power. Their large heavy construction didn't suit them to mobile use, but they were capable of burning heavier and cheaper grades of oil. 
The key principle of the "Griffin Simplex" was a heated exhaust-jacketed external vapouriser, into which the fuel was sprayed. The temperature was held around {{convert|550|F|C}}, sufficient to physically vapourise the oil but not to break it down chemically. This fractional distillation supported the use of heavy oil fuels, the unusable tars and asphalts separating out in the vapouriser.
[[Hot-bulb engine|Hot-bulb ignition]] was used, which Griffin termed the "catathermic igniter", a small isolated cavity connected to the combustion chamber. The spray injector had an adjustable inner nozzle for the air supply, surrounded by an annular casing for the oil, both oil and air entering at {{convert|20|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} pressure, and being regulated by a governor.&lt;ref name="Griffin engineering"&gt;{{cite web

Griffin went out of business in 1923.
Only two known examples of a Griffin six-stroke engine survive. One is in the [[Anson Engine Museum]]. The other was built in 1885 and for some years was in the [[Birmingham Museum of Science and Technology]], but in 2007 it returned to Bath and the [[Museum of Bath at Work]].&lt;ref name="Griffin return" &gt;{{cite web

====Dyer six-stroke engine====
[[Leonard Dyer]] invented a six-stroke internal combustion water-injection engine in 1915, very similar to Crower's design (see below). A dozen more similar patents have been issued since.

Dyer's six-stroke engine features:
* No cooling system required
* Improves a typical engine’s fuel consumption
* Requires a supply of pure water to act as the medium for the second power stroke.
* Extracts the additional power from the expansion of steam.

====Bajulaz six-stroke engine====
The Bajulaz six-stroke engine is similar to a regular combustion engine in design. There are, however, modifications to the cylinder head, with two supplementary fixed-capacity chambers: a [[combustion chamber]] and an air-preheating chamber above each cylinder. The combustion chamber receives a charge of heated air from the cylinder; the injection of fuel begins an [[isochoric process|isochoric]] (constant-volume) burn, which increases the [[thermal efficiency]] compared to a burn in the cylinder. The high pressure achieved is then released into the cylinder to work the power or expansion stroke. Meanwhile, a second chamber, which blankets the combustion chamber, has its air content heated to a high degree by heat passing through the cylinder wall.  This heated and pressurized air is then used to power an additional stroke of the piston.

The claimed advantages of the engine include reduction in fuel consumption by at least 40%, two expansion strokes in six strokes, multi-fuel usage capability, and a dramatic reduction in [[pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yuen | first=W. W. | authorlink= | title=The Bajulaz Cycle: a Two-Chamber Internal Combustion Engine with Increased Thermal Efficiency |journal=SAE Technical Paper Series | volume= | issue= Feb., 1986, | pages=1–10 | id=No. 860534 | url= |accessdate= | quote= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bajulaz six-stroke engine was invented in 1989 by Roger Bajulaz of the Bajulaz S.A. company, based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]; it has {{US patent|4809511 }} and {{US patent|4513568}}.

The Bajulaz six-stroke engine features claimed are:
*Reduction in fuel consumption by at least 40%
*Two expansion (work) strokes in six strokes
*Multifuel, including liquefied petroleum gas
*Dramatic reduction in air pollution
*Costs comparable to those of a four-stroke engine

====Velozeta six-stroke engine====
In a Velozeta engine, fresh air is injected into the cylinder during the exhaust stroke, which expands by heat and therefore forces the piston down for an additional stroke. The valve overlaps have been removed, and the two additional strokes using air injection provide for better [[scavenging (automotive)|gas scavenging]]. The engine seems to show 40% reduction in fuel consumption and dramatic reduction in air pollution.&lt;ref name=thestatesman1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180386:A%20brilliant%20six-stroke%20from%20techies&amp;catid=36:india&amp;from_page=search|title=A brilliant six-stroke from techies|date=14 February 2007|accessdate=8 May 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130222061004/http://www.thestatesman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180386:A%20brilliant%20six-stroke%20from%20techies&amp;catid=36:india&amp;from_page=search|archivedate=22 February 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Power-to-weight ratio]] is slightly less than that of a four-stroke gasoline engine.&lt;ref name=thestatesman1 /&gt; The engine can run on a variety of fuels, ranging from [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] to [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]. An altered engine shows a 65% reduction in carbon monoxide pollution when compared with the four-stroke engine from which it was developed.&lt;ref name=thestatesman1 /&gt; The engine was developed in 2005 by a team of mechanical engineering students, Mr. U Krishnaraj, Mr. Boby Sebastian, Mr. Arun Nair and Mr. Aaron Joseph George of the [[College of Engineering, Trivandrum]].

====NIYKADO six-stroke engine====
This engine was designed, developed and patented by Chanayil Cleetus Anil, of [[Kochi]], India, in 2012.&lt;ref name=thehindu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/article3601304.ece|publisher=Thehindu.com|title=Kochiite patents six-stroke engine|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds Indian patent number IN252642, granted by IPIndia on May 25, 2012.  The name of the engine is taken from the name of his company, NIYKADO Motors.  The engine underwent a preliminary round of full-throttle tests at the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Pune.&lt;ref name=thehindu /&gt;  The inventor claims this engine "is 23 per cent more fuel efficient compared to a standard four-stroke engine"&lt;ref name=thehindu /&gt; and that it is "very low on pollution".&lt;ref name=thehindu /&gt;

==== Crower six-stroke engine ====
In a six-stroke engine prototyped in the United States by Bruce Crower, water is injected into the cylinder after the exhaust stroke and is instantly turned to [[steam]], which expands and forces the piston down for an additional power stroke. Thus, waste heat that requires an air or water cooling system to discharge in most engines is captured and put to use driving the piston.&lt;ref name=autoweek1&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20060227/FREE/302270007

|date=2006-02-27
|publisher=Autoweek.com
|first=Pete|last=Lyons
|accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crower estimated that his design would reduce fuel consumption by 40% by generating the same power output at a lower rotational speed. The weight associated with a cooling system could be eliminated, but that would be balanced by a need for a water tank in addition to the normal fuel tank.

The Crower six-stroke engine was an experimental design that attracted media attention in 2006 because of an interview given by the 75-year-old [[United States|American]] [[inventor]], who has applied for a patent on his design.&lt;ref name=autoweek1 /&gt;  That patent application was subsequently abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=nNiYAAAAEBAJ |title=Application 11/494,090: Method and apparatus for operating an internal combustion engine |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposed-piston designs===
These designs use two pistons per cylinder operating at different rates, with combustion occurring between the pistons.

====Beare head====
This design was developed by Malcolm Beare of [[Australia]]. The technology combines a four-stroke engine bottom end with an opposed piston in the cylinder head working at half the cyclical rate of the bottom piston. Functionally, the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional engine.  Claimed benefits include a 9% increase in power, and improved thermodynamic efficiency through an increased compression ratio enabled by the elimination of the hot exhaust valve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Border Chronicle |title=After 16 years' work –- the six-stroke engine |date=November 10, 1994

====M4+2====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Image:m4+2anim.gif|thumb|300px|right|The M4+2 engine working cycle animation]]
The idea was developed at the Silesian University of Technology, Poland, under the leadership of dr Adam Ciesiołkiewicz. It was granted patent nr 195052 by the Polish Patent Office.

The M4+2 engines have much in common with the [[Beare-head engine]]s, combining two opposed pistons in the same cylinder. One piston works at half the cyclical rate of the other, but while the main function of the second piston in a Beare-head engine is to replace the valve mechanism of a conventional four-stroke engine, the M4+2 takes the principle one step further.  The double-piston combustion engine's work is based on the cooperation of both modules. The air load change takes place in the two-stroke section of the engine. The piston of the four-stroke section is an air load exchange aiding system, working as a system of valves. The cylinder is filled with air or with an air-fuel mixture. The filling process takes place at overpressure by the slide inlet system. The exhaust gases are removed as in the classical two-stroke engine, by exhaust windows in the cylinder. The fuel is supplied into the cylinder by a fuel-injection system. Ignition is realized by two spark plugs. The effective power output of the double-piston engine is transferred by two crankshafts. The characteristic feature of this engine is an opportunity of continuous change of cylinder capacity and compression rate during engine work by changing the piston's location. The mechanical and thermodynamical models were meant for double-piston engines, which enable to draw up new theoretical thermodynamic cycle for internal combustion double-pistons engine.&lt;ref name="Piotr Mężyk"&gt;[http://izoling.beep.pl/www.izoling.pl/badania/czytaj/engine.html Official site of the city of [[Myszków]], Poland]('''Polish''')&lt;/ref&gt;

The working principle of the engine is explained in the [[two- and four-stroke engines]] article.

===Other two-piston designs===

====Piston-charger engine====
{{self-published|section|date=January 2014}}
In this engine, similar in design to the Beare head, a "piston charger" replaces the valve system. The piston charger charges the main cylinder and simultaneously regulates the inlet and the outlet aperture, leading to no loss of air and fuel in the exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Berni K&amp;uuml;hne kuehne@tobe4u.de |url=http://www.sechstaktmotor.de/EN/infos.html |title=A new Engine generation is born Kottmann-Motor-Team Six-Stroke-Engine. Accessed January 2008 |publisher=Sechstaktmotor.de |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the main cylinder, combustion takes place every turn as in a [[two-stroke]] engine and lubrication as in a [[four-stroke]]. Fuel injection can take place in the piston charger, in the gas-transfer channel or in the combustion chamber. It is also possible to charge two working cylinders with one piston charger. The combination of compact design for the combustion chamber together with no loss of air and fuel is claimed to give the engine more torque, more power and better fuel consumption. The benefit of fewer moving parts and design is claimed to lead to lower manufacturing costs. Good for hybrid technology and stationary engines. The engine is claimed to be suited to alternative, fuels since there is no corrosion or deposits left on valves.
The six strokes are:
# Aspiration
# Precompression
# Gas transfer
# Compression
# Ignition
# Ejection.
This is an invention of Helmut Kottmann from Germany, while working 25 years at MAHLE GmbH piston and cylinder construction. Kottman's US patents 3921608 and 5755191 are listed below.

====Ilmor/Schmitz Five-Stroke====
This design was invented by Belgian engineer Gerhard Schmitz, and has been prototyped by Ilmor Engineering.&lt;ref name="Ilmor" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=5 Stroke Engine
  |url=http://www.ilmor.co.uk/capabilities/5-stroke-engine
  |publisher=Ilmor Engineering
  |accessdate=2016-02-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These designs use two (or 4, 6, 8) cylinders with a conventional Otto four-stroke cycle. An additional piston (in its own cylinder) is shared by the two Otto cycle cylinders.  The exhaust from the Otto cycle cylinder is directed into the shared cylinder, where it is expanded generating additional work.  This is in some respects similar to the operation of a compound steam engine, with the Otto cycle cylinders being the high-pressure stage and the shared cylinder the low pressure stage.  The operation of the engine is thus:

{| class="wikitable"

The designers consider this to be a five-stroke design, regarding the simultaneous HP exhaust stroke and LP expansion stroke as a single stroke.  This design provides higher fuel efficiency due to the higher overall expansion ratio of the combined cylinders.  Expansion ratios comparable to diesel engines can be achieved, while still using gasoline (petrol) fuel.   Five-stroke engines allegedly are lighter and have higher power density than diesel engines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Revetec engines====
The [[controlled combustion engine]]s, designed by Bradley Howell-Smith of Australian firm Revetec Holdings Pty Ltd, use opposed pairs of pistons to drive a pair of counter-rotating three-lobed cams through bearings.  These elements replace the conventional crankshaft and connecting-rods, which enables the motion of the pistons to be purely axial, so that most of the power otherwise wasted on lateral motion of the con-rods is effectively transferred to the output shaft.  This gives six power strokes per revolution of the shaft (spread across a pair of pistons).  An independent test measured the [[Brake specific fuel consumption|BSFC]] of Revetec's X4v2 prototype gasoline engine at 212g/kW-h&lt;ref name=revetec1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revetec.com/pdf/REVETEC%20X4V2%20Engine%20Evaluation%20Report_final.pdf |title=Revetec X4v2 Engine Testing report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927140348/http://www.revetec.com/pdf/REVETEC%20X4V2%20Engine%20Evaluation%20Report_final.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (corresponding to an energy efficiency of 38.6%).  Any even number of pistons can be used, in boxer or X configurations; the three lobes of the cams can be replaced by any other odd number greater than one; and the geometry of the cams can be changed to suit the needs of the target fuels and applications of the engines.  Such variants may have ten or more strokes per cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">A '''splice joint''' is a method of joining two members end to end in [[woodworking]]. The splice joint is used when the material being joined is not available in the length required. It is an alternative to other joints such as the [[butt joint]] and the [[scarf joint]]. Splice joints are stronger than unenforced butt joints and have the potential to be stronger than a scarf joint.

Splices are therefore most often used when structural elements are required in longer lengths than the available material. The most common form of the splice joint is the [[lap joint|half lap]] splice, which is common in building [[construction]], where it is used to join shorter lengths of timber into longer beams.

==Applications==
* Joining structural members end to end

==Types of splice joints==
[[File:Splice-joint.svg|thumb|300px|right|Half Lap Splice, Bevel Lap Splice and Tabled Splice Joint]]
There are four main types of splice joints: Half lap, Bevel lap, Tabled, and Tapered finger.

===Half lap splice joint===
The half lap splice joint is the simplest form of the splice joint and is commonly used to join structural members where either great strength is not required or reinforcement, such as mechanical [[fastener]]s, are to be used.

The joint is cut as for a half lap.

===Bevel lap splice joint===
The bevel lap is a variation of the half-lap in which the cheeks of the opposing members are cut at an angle of 5 to 10 degrees, sloping back away from the end of the member, so that some resistance to tension is introduced. This helps to prevent the members from being pulled apart.

===Tabled splice joint===
[[Image:Wedged tabled scarf joint.jpg|thumb|A wedged tabled splice joint]]The tabled splice joint is another variation of the half lap. The cheeks are cut with interlocking surfaces so that when brought together the joint resists being pulled apart.

===Tapered finger splice joint===
The tapered finger splice joint requires a series of matching 'fingers' or interlocking prominences to be cut on the ends of opposing members. The joint is brought together and glued, with the fingers providing substantial glue surface.

This joint is commonly used in the production of building materials from smaller offcuts of timber. It is commonly found in [[Baseboard|skirting]], [[architrave]], and [[Fascia (building)|fascia]].

The joint is usually made by machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10930">'''Stagnation point flow''' represents a fluid flow in the immediate neighborhood of solid surface at which fluid approaching the surface divides into different streams or a counterflowing fluid streams encountered in experiments. Although the fluid is stagnant everywhere on the solid surface due to [[no-slip condition]], the name [[stagnation point]] refers to the stagnation points of inviscid [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler]] solutions.

[[File:Stagnation2D.pdf|thumb|200px|Two-dimensional stagnation point flow]]
Hiemenz&lt;ref&gt;Hiemenz, Karl. Die Grenzschicht an einem in den gleichförmigen Flüssigkeitsstrom eingetauchten geraden Kreiszylinder... Diss. 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the problem and calculated the solution numerically in 1911 and subsequently by [[Leslie Howarth]](1934).&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Leslie. On the calculation of steady flow in the boundary layer near the surface of a cylinder in a stream. No. ARC-R/M-1632. AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL LONDON (UNITED KINGDOM), 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The flow in the neighborhood of the stagnation point can be modeled by a flow towards an infinite flat plate, even though the whole body is a curved one(locally curvature effects are negligible). Let the plate be in the &lt;math&gt;xz&lt;/math&gt; plane with &lt;math&gt;(x,y)=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; representing the stagnation point. The inviscid [[stream function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; from [[Potential flow]] theory are

:&lt;math&gt; \psi = kxy,\quad u = kx, \quad v = -ky&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary constant (represents strain rate in the counter flow setup). For real fluid(including viscous effects), there exists a self-similar solution if one defines

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \sqrt{\frac{k}{\nu}}y, \quad \psi = \sqrt{\nu k}x F(\eta)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kinematic viscosity]]  and &lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{\nu/k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[boundary layer thickness]] but it is constant(vorticity generated at the solid surface is prevented diffusing far away by an opposing convection, similar profiles are [[Blasius boundary layer]] with suction, [[Von Kármán swirling flow]] etc.,). Then the velocity components and subsequently pressure and the equation for &lt;math&gt;F(\eta)&lt;/math&gt; using [[Navier–Stokes equations]] are

:&lt;math&gt;u = kx F', \quad v = -\sqrt{\nu k} F, \quad \frac{p_o-p}{\rho} = \frac{1}{2} k^2x^2 + k\nu F' + \frac{1}{2} k\nu F^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F''' + FF'' -F'^2 + 1 =0&lt;/math&gt;

and the boundary condition due to no penetration and no-slip and the free stream condition for &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;(Note boundary conditions for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; far away from the plate is not specified, because it is part of the solution - a typical boundary layer problem) are

:&lt;math&gt;F(0)=0, \ F'(0)=0, F'(\infty)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

The asymptotic forms for large &lt;math&gt;\eta\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;F\sim\eta -0.6479, \quad u\sim kx, \quad v\sim-k(y-\delta^*), \quad \delta^* = 0.6479 \delta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement thickness]].

Stagnation point flow with moving plate with constant velocity &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as model for rotating solids near the stagnation points. The stream function is

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \sqrt{\nu k}x F(\eta) + U \delta \int_0^\eta G(\eta) d\eta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G(\eta)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation

:&lt;math&gt;G'' + FG' - F'G =0, \quad G(0)=1, \quad G(\infty)=0&lt;/math&gt;

and Rott(1956)&lt;ref&gt;Rott, Nicholas. "Unsteady viscous flow in the vicinity of a stagnation point." Quarterly of Applied Mathematics 13.4 (1956): 444–451.&lt;/ref&gt; gave the solution as &lt;math&gt;G(\eta) = \frac{F''(\eta)}{F''(0)}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Oblique stagnation point flow ===
The previous analyses assumes the flow impinges in normal direction. The inviscid stream function for oblique stagnation point flow is obtained by adding a constant [[vorticity]] &lt;math&gt;-\zeta_o&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = kxy + \frac{1}{2}\zeta_o y^2&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding analysis for viscous fluid is studied by Stuart(1959),&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, J. T. "The viscous flow near a stagnation point when the external flow has uniform vorticity." Journal of the Aerospace Sciences (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Tamada(1979)&lt;ref&gt;Tamada, Ko. "Two-dimensional stagnation-point flow impinging obliquely on a plane wall." Journal of the Physical Society of Japan 46 (1979): 310.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dorrepaal(1986).&lt;ref&gt;Dorrepaal, J. M. "An exact solution of the Navier–Stokes equation which describes non-orthogonal stagnation-point flow in two dimensions." Journal of Fluid Mechanics 163 (1986): 141–147.&lt;/ref&gt; The self-similar stream function is,

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \sqrt{\nu k}x F(\eta) + \zeta_o \delta^2 \int_0^\eta H(\eta) d\eta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H(\eta)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation

:&lt;math&gt;H'' + FH' - F'H =0, \quad H(0)=0, \quad H'(\infty)=1&lt;/math&gt;.

== {{anchor|Homann flow}} Homann flow ==
[[File:Stagnationaxi.pdf|thumb|200px|Homann flow with injection]]
[[File:Stagnationaxi2.pdf|thumb|200px|Homann flow with suction]]
The corresponding problem in axisymmetric coordinate is solved by Homann(1936)&lt;ref&gt;Homann, Fritz. "Der Einfluss grosser Zähigkeit bei der Strömung um den Zylinder und um die Kugel." ZAMM‐Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics/Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik 16.3 (1936): 153–164.&lt;/ref&gt; and this serves a model for flow around near the stagnation point of a sphere. [[Paul A. Libby]](1974)&lt;ref&gt;Libby, Paul A. "Wall shear at a three-dimensional stagnation point with a moving wall." AIAA Journal 12.3 (1974): 408–409.&lt;/ref&gt;(1976)&lt;ref&gt;Libby, Paul A. "Laminar flow at a three-dimensional stagnation point with large rates of injection." AIAA Journal 14.9 (1976): 1273–1279.&lt;/ref&gt; considered Homann flow with constantly moving plate with velocity &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and also allowed for suction/injection with velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; at the surface.

The self-similar solution is obtained by introducing following transformation for the velocity &lt;math&gt;(v_r,v_\theta,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; in cylindrical coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \sqrt{\frac{k}{\nu}} z, \quad \gamma = -\frac{V}{2\sqrt{k\nu}}, \quad v_r = kr F'(\eta) + U\cos\theta G(\eta), \quad v_\theta= - U\sin\theta G(\eta), \quad v_z = - 2\sqrt{k\nu} F(\eta)&lt;/math&gt;

and the pressure is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p-p_o}{\rho} = - \frac{1}{2} k^2 r^2 - 2k\nu (F^2+F')&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F'''+ 2FF'' - F'^2 + 1 &amp;=0,\\
G'' + 2 F G' - F' G &amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with boundary conditions,

:&lt;math&gt;F(0)=\gamma, \quad F'(0)=0, \quad F'(\infty)=1, \quad G(0)=1, \quad G(\infty) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;U=V=0&lt;/math&gt;, the classical Homann problem is recovered.

==Plane counterflow jets==
Jets emerging from a slot-jets creates stagnation point in between according to potential theory. The flow near the stagnation point can by studied using self-similar solution. This setup is widely used in [[combustion]] experiments. The initial study of impinging stagnation flows are due to C.Y. Wang.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. Y. "Stagnation flow on the surface of a quiescent fluid—an exact solution of the Navier–Stokes equations." Quarterly of applied mathematics 43.2 (1985): 215–223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. Y. "Impinging stagnation flows." The Physics of fluids 30.3 (1987): 915–917.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Let two fluids with constant properties denoted with suffix &lt;math&gt;1(\text{top}),\ 2(\text{bottom})&lt;/math&gt; flowing from opposite direction impinge and let's assume the two fluids are immiscible and the interface(located at &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;) is planar. The velocity is given by

:&lt;math&gt;u_1 = k_1 x, \quad v_1 = -k_1y, \quad u_2 = k_2 x, \quad v_2 =-k_2y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_1, \ k_2&lt;/math&gt; are strain rates of the fluids. At the interface, velocities, tangential stress and pressure must be continuous.
Introducing the self-similar transformation,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_1 = \sqrt{\frac{\nu_1}{k_1}} y, \quad u_1 = k_1x F_1', \quad v_1 = -\sqrt{\nu_1 k_1} F_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_2 = \sqrt{\frac{\nu_2}{k_2}} y, \quad u_2 = k_2x F_2', \quad v_2 = -\sqrt{\nu_2 k_2} F_2&lt;/math&gt;
 
results equations,

:&lt;math&gt;F_1''' + F_1F_1'' -F_1'^2 + 1 =0, \quad \frac{p_{o1}-p_1}{\rho_1} = \frac{1}{2} k_1^2x^2 + k_1\nu_1 F_1' + \frac{1}{2} k_1\nu_1 F_1^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_2''' + F_2F_2'' -F_2'^2 + 1 =0, \quad \frac{p_{o2}-p_2}{\rho_2} = \frac{1}{2} k_2^2x^2 + k_2\nu_2 F_2' + \frac{1}{2} k_2\nu_2 F_2^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The no-penetration condition at the interface and free stream condition far away from the stagnation plane become

:&lt;math&gt;F_1(0)=0, \quad F_1'(\infty)=1, \quad F_2(0)=0,  \quad F_2'(-\infty)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

But the equations require two more boundary conditions. At &lt;math&gt;\eta=0&lt;/math&gt;, the tangential velocities &lt;math&gt;u_1=u_2&lt;/math&gt;, the tangential stress &lt;math&gt;\rho_1\nu_1 \partial u_1/\partial y=\rho_2\nu_2 \partial u_2/\partial y&lt;/math&gt; and the pressure &lt;math&gt;p_1=p_2&lt;/math&gt; are continuous. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
k_1 F_1'(0)&amp;=k_2 F_2'(0),\\
\rho_1 \sqrt{\nu_1 k_1^3} F_1''(0)&amp;= \rho_2 \sqrt{\nu_2 k_2^3} F_2''(0),\\
p_{o1}-\rho_1\nu_1 k_1 F_1'(0)&amp;= p_{o2}-\rho_2\nu_2 k_2 F_2'(0).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_1 k_1^2 = \rho_2 k_2^2&lt;/math&gt;(from outer inviscid problem) is used. Both &lt;math&gt;F_i'(0), F_i''(0)&lt;/math&gt; are not known ''apriori'', but derived from matching conditions. The third equation is determine variation of outer pressure &lt;math&gt;p_{o1}-p_{o2}&lt;/math&gt; due to the effect of viscosity. So there are only two parameters, which governs the flow, which are

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = \frac{k_1}{k_2} = \left(\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}\right)^{1/2}, \quad \Gamma = \frac{\nu_2}{\nu_1}&lt;/math&gt;

then the boundary conditions become

:&lt;math&gt;F_1'(0)=\Lambda F_2'(0), \quad F_1''(0)= \sqrt{\frac{\Gamma}{\Lambda}}F_2''(0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Constant density and constant viscosity===
When densities and viscosities of the two impinging jets are same and constant, then the strain rate is also constant &lt;math&gt;k_1=k_2=k&lt;/math&gt; and the potential flow solution become the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;u = k x, \quad v = -ky&lt;/math&gt;

everywhere in the flow domain. Kerr and Dold found additional new solutions called as [[Kerr-Dold vortices]] of Navier-Stokes equations in 1994 in the form of periodic array of steady vortices superposed on the constant density and constant viscosity counterflowing jets.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, O. S., &amp; Dold, J. W. (1994). Periodic steady vortices in a stagnation-point flow. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 276, 307-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam reforming of [[natural gas]] is the most common method of producing commercial bulk hydrogen at about 95% of the world production&lt;ref name="Ogden 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ogden |first=J.M. |title=Prospects for building a hydrogen energy infrastructure |journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment |year=1999 |volume=24 |pages=227–279 |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming |title=Hydrogen Production: Natural Gas Reforming |publisher=Department of Energy|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 500 billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.topsoe.com/sites/default/files/topsoe_large_scale_hydrogen_produc.pdf |title=Large-scale Hydrogen Production |page=3 |last=Rostrup-Nielsen |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Haldor Topsøe (company)|Haldor Topsøe]] |access-date= |quote=The total hydrogen market was in 1998 390·10^9 Nm3/y + 110·10^9 Nm3/y co-production.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is used in the [[Ammonia production|industrial synthesis of ammonia]] and other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|url=http://www.me.ncu.edu.tw/energy/CleanEnergyTechnology/The%20Hydrogen%20Economy_Addition.pdf |date=2004 |first1=George W. |last1=Crabtree |first2=Mildred S. |last2=Dresselhaus |first3=Michelle V. |last3=Buchanan |title=The Hydrogen Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high temperatures (700 &amp;ndash; 1100&amp;nbsp;°C) and in the presence of a [[metal]]-based [[catalyst]] ([[nickel]]), steam reacts with methane to yield [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. 

:[[methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] ⇌ [[carbon monoxide|CO]] + 3 [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Catalysts with high [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] are preferred because of [[diffusion]] limitations due to high [[operating temperature]]. Examples of [[catalyst]] shapes used are spoked wheels, gear wheels, and rings with holes. Additionally, these shapes have a low [[pressure drop]] which is advantageous for this application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reimert|first1=Rainer|last2=Marschner|first2=Friedemann|last3=Renner|first3=Hans-Joachim|last4=Boll|first4=Walter|last5=Supp|first5=Emil|last6=Brejc|first6=Miron|last7=Liebner|first7=Waldemar|last8=Schaub|first8=Georg|title=Ullman's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=15 October 2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Gas Production, 2. Processes|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional hydrogen can be obtained by reacting the [[carbon monoxide|CO]] with water via the [[water-gas shift reaction]].
:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ⇌ [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The first reaction is strongly [[endothermic]] (consumes heat, ΔH&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;= 206 kJ/mol), the second reaction is mildly [[exothermic]] (produces heat, ΔH&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;= -41 kJ/mol).

The [[United States]] produces nine million tons of hydrogen per year, mostly with steam reforming of natural gas. The worldwide ammonia production, using hydrogen derived from steam reforming, was 144 million [[metric tonnes]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite report|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/nitrogen/mcs-2016-nitro.pdf |date=January 2016 |publisher=United States Geological Survey |title=Nitrogen (Fixed)—Ammonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This steam reforming process is quite different from and not to be confused with [[catalytic reforming]] of [[naphtha]], an [[oil refinery]] process that also produces significant amounts of hydrogen along with high [[octane rating|octane]] [[gasoline]].

Steam reforming of natural gas is approximately 65–75% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.getenergysmart.org/files/hydrogeneducation/6hydrogenproductionsteammethanereforming.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204211916/http://www.getenergysmart.org/Files/HydrogenEducation/6HydrogenProductionSteamMethaneReforming.pdf|archivedate=4 February 2006 |title=Hydrogen Production – Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) |work=Hydrogen Fact Sheet |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autothermal reforming ==
Autothermal reforming (ATR) uses oxygen and carbon dioxide or steam in a reaction with methane to form [[syngas]]. The reaction takes place in a single chamber where the methane is partially oxidized. The reaction is exothermic due to the oxidation. When the ATR uses carbon dioxide the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO ratio produced is 1:1; when the ATR uses steam the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO ratio produced is 2.5:1

The reactions can be described in the following equations, using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

: 2CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;#x2192; 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

And using steam:

: 4CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;#x2192; 10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4CO

The outlet temperature of the syngas is between 950-1100 C and outlet pressure can be as high as 100 [[Bar (unit)|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topsoe.com/business_areas/methanol/Processes/AutothermalReforming.aspx Topsoe ATR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between SMR and ATR is that SMR only uses oxygen via air for combustion as a heat source to create steam, while ATR directly combusts oxygen. The advantage of ATR is that the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO can be varied, this is particularly useful for producing certain second generation [[Biofuel|biofuels]], such as [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] which requires a 1:1 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:CO ratio.

== Partial oxidation ==
{{main|Partial oxidation}}Partial oxidation (POX) is a type of chemical reaction. It occurs when a substoichiometric fuel-air mixture is partially combusted in a reformer, creating a hydrogen-rich syngas which can then be put to further use.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The capital cost of steam reforming plants is prohibitive for small to medium size applications because the technology does not scale down well. Conventional steam reforming plants operate at pressures between 200 and 600 psi with outlet temperatures in the range of 815 to 925&amp;nbsp;°C. However, analyses have shown that even though it is more costly to construct, a well-designed SMR can produce hydrogen more cost-effectively than an ATR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblymag.com/CDA/Archives/edabe122ce5c9010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ AIA: Software Analyzes Cost of Hydrogen Production - Archives - ASSEMBLY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reforming for combustion engines ==
[[Gas flare|Flared gas]] and vented [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]]s are known problems in the offshore industry and in the on-shore oil and gas industry, since both emit unnecessary greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Emissions|url=http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/knowledgecentre/atmospheric_emissions.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926063455/http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/knowledgecentre/atmospheric_emissions.cfm|archivedate=2013-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforming for combustion engines utilizes steam reforming technology for converting waste gases into a source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wärtsilä Launches GasReformer Product For Turning Oil Production Gas Into Energy|url=http://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/wartsila-launches-gasreformer-product-for-turning-oil-production-gas-into-energy/|newspaper=Marine Insight|date=18 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511023948/https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/wartsila-launches-gasreformer-product-for-turning-oil-production-gas-into-energy/|archivedate=2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforming for combustion engines is based on steam reforming, where non-methane hydrocarbons ([[NMHC]]s) of low quality gases are converted to [[Syngas|synthesis gas]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO) and finally to [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) - thereby improving the fuel gas quality (methane number).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Method of operating a gas engine plant and fuel feeding system of a gas engine|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=EP&amp;NR=1861610B1&amp;KC=B1&amp;FT=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to conventional steam reforming, the process is operated at lower temperatures and with lower steam supply, allowing a high content of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in the produced fuel gas. The main reactions are:

Steam reforming: 
:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} (''n'' + {{frac|''m''|2}}) H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' CO

Methanation: 
:CO + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Water-gas shift: 
:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Reforming for fuel cells ==
=== Advantages of reforming for supplying fuel cells ===
Steam reforming of gaseous hydrocarbons is seen as a potential way to provide fuel for [[fuel cells]]. The basic idea for vehicle on-board reforming is that for example a [[methanol]] tank and a steam reforming unit would replace the bulky pressurized [[hydrogen tank]]s that would otherwise be necessary. This might mitigate the [[Hydrogen highway|distribution problems]] associated with [[hydrogen car|hydrogen vehicles]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howstuffworks.com/fuel-processor.htm Advantage of fossil fuel reforming]&lt;/ref&gt; however the major market players discarded the approach of on-board reforming as impractical.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} (At high temperatures see above).

===Disadvantages of reforming for supplying fuel cells===
The reformer&amp;ndash;fuel-cell system is still being researched but in the near term, systems would continue to run on existing fuels, such as natural gas or gasoline or diesel. However, there is an active debate about whether using these fuels to make hydrogen is beneficial while global warming is an issue. Fossil fuel reforming does not eliminate carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere but reduces the carbon dioxide emissions and nearly eliminates carbon monoxide emissions as compared to the burning of conventional fuels due to increased efficiency and fuel cell characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howstuffworks.com/hydrogen-economy4.htm Fossil fuel reforming not eliminating any carbon dioxides]&lt;/ref&gt; However, by turning the release of carbon dioxide into a [[point source]] rather than distributed release, [[carbon capture and storage]] becomes a possibility, which would prevent the carbon dioxide's release to the atmosphere, while adding to the cost of the process.

The cost of hydrogen production by reforming fossil fuels depends on the scale at which it is done, the capital cost of the reformer and the efficiency of the unit, so that whilst it may cost only a few dollars per kilogram of hydrogen at industrial scale, it could be more expensive at the smaller scale needed for fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110704031430/http://198.173.87.9/PDF/Doty_H2Price.pdf A realistic look at hydrogen price projections]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current challenges with reformers supplying fuel cells ===
However, there are several challenges associated with this technology:
* The reforming reaction takes place at high temperatures, making it slow to start up and requiring costly high temperature materials.
* [[Sulfur]] compounds in the fuel will poison certain catalysts, making it difficult to run this type of system from ordinary [[gasoline]]. Some new technologies have overcome this challenge with sulfur-tolerant catalysts.
* [[Coking]] would be another cause of catalyst deactivation during steam reforming. High reaction temperatures, low steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C), and the complex nature of sulfur-containing commercial hydrocarbon fuels make coking especially favorable. Olefins, typically ethylene, and aromatics are well known carbon-precursors, hence their formation must be reduced during the SR. Additionally, catalysts with lower acidity were reported to be less prone to coking by suppressing dehydrogenation reactions. H2S, the main product in the reforming of organic sulfur, can bind to all transition metal catalysts to form metal–sulfur bonds and subsequently reduce catalyst activity by inhibiting the chemisorption of reforming reactants. Meanwhile, the adsorbed sulfur species increases the catalyst acidity, and hence indirectly promotes coking. Precious metal catalysts such as Rh and Pt have lower tendencies to form bulk sulfides than other metal catalysts such as Ni. Rh and Pt are less prone to sulfur poisoning by only chemisorbing sulfur rather than forming metal sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zheng |first1=Qinghe |last2=Janke |first2=Christiane |last3=Farrauto |first3=Robert |title=Steam reforming of sulfur-containing dodecane on a Rh–Pt catalyst: Influence of process parameters on catalyst stability and coke structure |journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental |date=November 2014 |volume=160-161 |pages=525–533 |doi=10.1016/j.apcatb.2014.05.044}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low temperature [[polymer fuel cell]] membranes can be poisoned by the [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) produced by the reactor, making it necessary to include complex CO-removal systems. [[Solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFC) and [[molten carbonate fuel cell]]s (MCFC) do not have this problem, but operate at higher temperatures, slowing start-up time, and requiring costly materials and bulky insulation.
* The [[thermodynamic efficiency]] of the process is between 70% and 85% ([[Lower heating value|LHV basis]]) depending on the purity of the hydrogen product.

'''Targeted temperature management''' ('''TTM''') previously known as '''therapeutic hypothermia''' or '''protective hypothermia''' is an active treatment that tries to achieve and maintain a specific [[body temperature]] in a person for a specific duration of time in an effort to improve health outcomes during recovery after a period of stopped blood flow to the brain.&lt;ref name=Peb2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peberdy|first1=MA|last2=Callaway|first2=CW|last3=Neumar|first3=RW|last4=Geocadin|first4=RG|last5=Zimmerman|first5=JL|last6=Donnino|first6=M|last7=Gabrielli|first7=A|last8=Silvers|first8=SM|last9=Zaritsky|first9=AL|last10=Merchant|first10=R|last11=Vanden Hoek|first11=TL|last12=Kronick|first12=SL|last13=American Heart|first13=Association|title=Part 9: post-cardiac arrest care: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=2 November 2010|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S768–86|pmid=20956225|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in an attempt to reduce the risk of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] injury following [[Ischemic injury|lack of blood flow]].&lt;ref name=Bernard2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Stephen A.|author2=Gray, Timothy W. |author3=Buist, Michael D. |author4=Jones, Bruce M. |author5=Silvester, William |author6=Gutteridge, Geoff |author7= Smith, Karen |title=Treatment of Comatose Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest with Induced Hypothermia|journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]]|date=21 February 2002|volume=346|issue=8|pages=557–563|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa003289|pmid=11856794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periods of poor blood flow may be due to [[cardiac arrest]] or the blockage of an artery by a [[embolism|clot]] as in the case of a [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/therapeutic_hypothermia_after_cardiac_arrest_135,393 | title=Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins Medicine]] Health Library | accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted temperature management is thought to prevent brain injury by several methods including decreasing the brain's oxygen demand, reducing the production of [[neurotransmitter]]s like [[glutamate]], as well as reducing [[free radical]]s that might damage the brain. The lowering of body temperature may be accomplished by many means including the use of cooling blankets, cooling helmets, cooling catheters, ice packs and ice water [[lavage]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Medical uses==
Targeted temperature management may be used in the following conditions:

===Cardiac arrest===
The 2013 [[ILCOR]] and 2010 [[American Heart Association]] guidelines support the use of cooling following resuscitation from cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="Peb2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ILCOR2013/&gt; These recommendations were largely based on two trials from 2002 which showed improved survival and brain function when cooled to {{convert|32-34|C|F}} after cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=Bernard2002/&gt;&lt;ref name="HACA 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest Study Group|title=Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia to Improve the Neurologic Outcome after Cardiac Arrest|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=21 February 2002|volume=346|issue=8|pages=549–556|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa012689|pmid=11856793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However more recent research suggests that there is no benefit to cooling to {{convert|33|C|F}} when compared with less aggressive cooling only to a near-normal temperature of {{convert|36|C|F}}; it appears cooling is effective because it prevents fever, a common complication seen after cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargas|first1=M|last2=Servillo|first2=G|last3=Sutherasan|first3=Y|last4=Rodríguez-González|first4=R|last5=Brunetti|first5=I|last6=Pelosi|first6=P|title=Effects of in-hospital low targeted temperature after out of hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.|journal=Resuscitation|date=June 2015|volume=91|pages=8–18|pmid=25796995|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.02.038}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no difference in long term [[quality of life]] following mild compared to more severe cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=JK|last2=Parikh|first2=PB|title=Association between therapeutic hypothermia and long-term quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest: A systematic review.|journal=Resuscitation|date=7 April 2016|volume=103|pages=54–59|pmid=27060536|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.03.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In children, following cardiac arrest, cooling does not appear useful as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scholefield |first1=BR |last2=Silverstein |first2=FS |last3=Telford |first3=R |last4=Holubkov |first4=R |last5=Slomine |first5=BS |last6=Meert |first6=KL |last7=Christensen |first7=JR |last8=Nadkarni |first8=VM |last9=Dean |first9=JM |last10=Moler |first10=FW |title=Therapeutic hypothermia after paediatric cardiac arrest: Pooled randomized controlled trials. |journal=Resuscitation |date=3 October 2018 |volume=133 |pages=101-107 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2018.09.011 |pmid=30291883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neonatal encephalopathy===
[[Hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy]] has been proven to improve outcomes for newborn infants affected by perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, [[hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy]] or [[birth asphyxia]]. A 2013 Cochrane review found that it is useful in full term babies with encephalopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=SE|last2=Berg|first2=M|last3=Hunt|first3=R|last4=Tarnow-Mordi|first4=WO|last5=Inder|first5=TE|last6=Davis|first6=PG|title=Cooling for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=31 January 2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=CD003311|pmid=23440789|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003311.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole body or selective head cooling to {{convert|33|-|34|C|F}}, begun within six hours of birth and continued for 72 hours, reduces mortality and reduces cerebral palsy and neurological deficits in survivors.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Adverse effects==
Possible complications may include: infection, bleeding, [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s and [[high blood sugar]].&lt;ref name=PostCare2010/&gt; One review found an increased risk of [[pneumonia]] and [[sepsis]] but not the overall risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182a276e8 |title=Therapeutic Hypothermia and the Risk of Infection |year=2013 |last1=Geurts |first1=Marjolein |last2=MacLeod |first2=Malcolm R. |last3=Kollmar |first3=Rainer |last4=Kremer |first4=Philip H.

==Mechanism==
The earliest rationale for the effects of hypothermia as a neuroprotectant focused on the slowing of cellular [[metabolism]] resulting from a drop in body temperature. For every one degree Celsius drop in body temperature, cellular metabolism slows by 5–7%.&lt;ref name="Kam"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000019910.90280.F1 |title=Admission Body Temperature Predicts Long-Term Mortality After Acute Stroke: The Copenhagen Stroke Study |year=2002 |last1=Kammersgaard |first1=L.P. |last2=Jørgensen |first2=H.S. |last3=Rungby |first3=J.A. |last4=Reith |first4=J. |last5=Nakayama |first5=H. |last6=Weber |first6=U.J. |last7=Houth |first7=J. |last8=Olsen |first8=T.S. |journal=Stroke |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1759–62 |pmid=12105348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, most early hypotheses suggested that hypothermia reduces the harmful effects of ischemia by decreasing the body’s need for oxygen.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt; The initial emphasis on cellular metabolism explains why the early studies almost exclusively focused on the application of deep hypothermia, as these researchers believed that the therapeutic effects of hypothermia correlated directly with the extent of temperature decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60837-5 |title=Induced hypothermia and fever control for prevention and treatment of neurological injuries |year=2008 |last1=Polderman |first1=Kees H |journal=The Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9628 |pages=1955–1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the special case of infants suffering perinatal asphyxia it appears that [[apoptosis]] is a prominent cause of cell death and that [[hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy]] interrupts the apoptotic pathway. In general, cell death is not directly caused by oxygen deprivation, but occurs indirectly as a result of the cascade of subsequent events. Cells need oxygen to create [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], a molecule used by cells to store energy, and cells need ATP to regulate intracellular ion levels. ATP is used to fuel both the importation of ions necessary for cellular function and the removal of ions that are harmful to cellular function. Without oxygen, cells cannot manufacture the necessary ATP to regulate ion levels and thus cannot prevent the intracellular environment from approaching the ion concentration of the outside environment. It is not oxygen deprivation itself that precipitates cell death, but rather without oxygen the cell can not make the ATP it needs to regulate ion concentrations and maintain homeostasis.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;

Notably, even a small drop in temperature encourages [[cell membrane]] stability during periods of oxygen deprivation. For this reason, a drop in body temperature helps prevent an influx of unwanted ions during an ischemic insult. By making the cell membrane more impermeable, hypothermia helps prevent the cascade of reactions set off by oxygen deprivation. Even moderate dips in temperature strengthen the cellular membrane, helping to minimize any disruption to the cellular environment. It is by moderating the disruption of homeostasis caused by a blockage of blood flow that many now postulate, results in hypothermia’s ability to minimize the trauma resultant from ischemic injuries.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;

Targeted temperature management may also help to reduce [[reperfusion injury]], damage caused by [[oxidative stress]] when the blood supply is restored to a tissue after a period of ischemia. Various inflammatory immune responses occur during reperfusion. These inflammatory responses cause increased intracranial pressure, which leads to cell injury and in some situations, cell death. Hypothermia has been shown to help moderate intracranial pressure and therefore to minimize the harmful effects of a patient’s inflammatory immune responses during reperfusion. The [[oxidation]] that occurs during reperfusion also increases [[free radical]] production. Since hypothermia reduces both intracranial pressure and free radical production, this might be yet another mechanism of action for hypothermia's therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt; Overt activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors following brain injuries can lead to calcium entry which triggers neuronal death via the mechanisms of excitotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Anthony|last2=Tymianski|first2=Michael|date=2010-07-01|title=Glutamate receptors, neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration|url=|journal=Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology|volume=460|issue=2|pages=525–542|doi=10.1007/s00424-010-0809-1|pmid=20229265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
There are a number of methods through which hypothermia is induced.&lt;ref name=PostCare2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peberdy|first1=MA|last2=Callaway|first2=CW|last3=Neumar|first3=RW|last4=Geocadin|first4=RG|last5=Zimmerman|first5=JL|last6=Donnino|first6=M|last7=Gabrielli|first7=A|last8=Silvers|first8=SM|last9=Zaritsky|first9=AL|last10=Merchant|first10=R|last11=Vanden Hoek|first11=TL|last12=Kronick|first12=SL|last13=American Heart|first13=Association|title=Part 9: post-cardiac arrest care: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=2 November 2010|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S768–86|pmid=20956225|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include: cooling catheters, cooling blankets, and application of ice applied around the body among others.&lt;ref name=PostCare2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2013/&gt; As of 2013 it is unclear if one method is any better than the others.&lt;ref name=Fer2013/&gt; While cool intravenous fluid may be given to start the process, further methods are required to keep the person cold.&lt;ref name=PostCare2010/&gt;

Core body temperature must be measured (either via the esophagus, rectum, bladder in those who are producing urine, or within the pulmonary artery) to guide cooling.&lt;ref name=PostCare2010/&gt; A temperature below {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} should be avoided, as adverse events increase significantly.&lt;ref name=Fer2013/&gt; The person should be kept at the goal temperature plus or minus half a degree Celsius for 24 hours.&lt;ref name=Fer2013/&gt; Rewarming should be done slowly with suggested speeds of {{convert|0.1|to|0.5|C-change}} per hour.&lt;ref name=Fer2013/&gt;

Targeted temperature management should be started as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21878875 |year=2011 |last1=Taccone |first1=FS |last2=Donadello |first2=K |last3=Beumier |first3=M |last4=Scolletta |first4=S |title=When, where and how to initiate hypothermia after adult cardiac arrest |volume=77 |issue=9 |pages=927–33 |journal=Minerva anestesiologica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal temperature should be reached before 8 hours.&lt;ref name=Fer2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira Da Silva|first1=IR|last2=Frontera|first2=JA|title=Targeted temperature management in survivors of cardiac arrest.|journal=Cardiology clinics|date=November 2013|volume=31|issue=4|pages=637–55, ix|pmid=24188226|doi=10.1016/j.ccl.2013.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeted temperature management remains partially effective even when initiated as long as 6 hours after collapse.&lt;ref name="Chill"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15931934 |url=http://www.modernmedicine.com/modern-medicine/news/big-chill-improving-odds-after-cardiac-arrest |title=The big chill: Improving the odds after cardiac arrest |year=2005 |last1=Calver |first1=P |last2=Braungardt |first2=T |last3=Kupchik |first3=N |last4=Jensen |first4=A |last5=Cutler |first5=C |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=58–62; quiz 63 |journal=RN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the induction of targeted temperature management, pharmacological agents to control shivering must be administered. When body temperature drops below a certain threshold—typically around {{convert|36|C}}—people may begin to shiver.&lt;ref name=Sessler/&gt; It appears that regardless of the technique used to induce hypothermia, people begin to shiver when temperature drops below this threshold.&lt;ref name=Sessler/&gt; Drugs commonly used to prevent and treat shivering in targeted temperature management include [[Paracetamol|acetaminophen]], [[buspirone]], [[opioid]]s including [[pethidine]] (meperidine), [[dexmedetomidine]], fentanyl, and/or [[propofol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevention of Shivering During Therapeutic Temperature Modulation: The Columbia Anti-Shivering Protocol|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12028-010-9474-7|journal = Neurocritical Care|date = 2011-01-06|issn = 1541-6933|pages = 389–394|volume = 14|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s12028-010-9474-7|first = H.

People should be rewarmed slowly and steadily in order to avoid harmful spikes in intracranial pressure.&lt;ref name="Chill"/&gt;

===Cooling catheters===
Cooling catheters are inserted into a femoral vein. Cooled saline solution is circulated through either a metal coated tube or a balloon in the catheter. The saline cools the person’s whole body by lowering the temperature of a person’s blood. Catheters reduce temperature at rates ranging from {{convert|1.5|to|2|C-change}} per hour. Through the use of the control unit, catheters can bring body temperature to within {{convert|0.1|C-change}} of the target level. Furthermore, catheters can raise temperature at a steady rate, which helps to avoid harmful rises in intracranial pressure. A number of studies have demonstrated that targeted temperature management via catheter is safe and effective.&lt;ref name="DiringerMichael"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000108868.97433.3F |title=Treatment of fever in the neurologic intensive care unit with a catheter-based heat exchange system |year=2004 |last1=Diringer |first1=Michael N. |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=559–64 |pmid=14758179 |author2=Neurocritical Care Fever Reduction Trial Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HinzJose"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/ANA.0b013e318032a208 |title=Effectiveness of an Intravascular Cooling Method Compared with a Conventional Cooling Technique in Neurologic Patients |year=2007 |last1=Hinz |first1=Jos?? |last2=Rosmus |first2=Martin |last3=Popov |first3=Aron |last4=Moerer |first4=Onnen |last5=Frerichs |first5=Inez |last6=Quintel |first6=Michael |journal=Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=130–5 |pmid=17414000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KellerEmanuela"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12728304 |year=2003 |last1=Keller |first1=E |last2=Imhof |first2=HG |last3=Gasser |first3=S |last4=Terzic |first4=A |last5=Yonekawa |first5=Y |title=Endovascular cooling with heat exchange catheters: A new method to induce and maintain hypothermia |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=939–43 |doi=10.1007/s00134-003-1685-3 |journal=Intensive Care Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000227265.52763.16 |title=Efficacy and Safety of Endovascular Cooling After Cardiac Arrest: Cohort Study and Bayesian Approach |year=2006 |last1=Holzer |first1=M. |last2=Müllner |first2=M. |last3=Sterz |first3=F. |last4=Robak |first4=O. |last5=Kliegel |first5=A. |last6=Losert |first6=H. |last7=Sodeck |first7=G. |last8=Uray |first8=T. |last9=Zeiner |first9=A. |last10=Laggner |first10=A.

Adverse events associated with this invasive technique include bleeding, infection, vascular puncture, and [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT).&lt;ref name="ddt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/hs0901.095394 |title=Feasibility and Safety of Moderate Hypothermia After Massive Hemispheric Infarction |year=2001 |last1=Schwab |first1=S. |last2=Georgiadis |first2=D. |last3=Berrouschot |first3=J. |last4=Schellinger |first4=P.

The risk of deep vein thrombosis may be the most pressing medical complication.

Deep vein thrombosis can be characterized as a medical event whereby a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually the femoral vein. This condition may become potentially fatal if the clot travels to the [[lung]]s and causes a [[pulmonary embolism]]. Another potential problem with cooling catheters is the potential to block access to the femoral vein, which is a site normally used for a variety of other medical procedures, including [[angiography]] of the venous system and the right side of the heart.  However, most cooling catheters are triple lumen catheters, and the majority of people post-arrest will require central venous access. Unlike non-invasive methods which can be administered by nurses, the insertion of cooling catheters must be performed by a physician fully trained and familiar with the procedure. The time delay between identifying a person who might benefit from the procedure and the arrival of an [[interventional radiologist]] or other physician to perform the insertion may minimize some of the benefit of invasive methods' more rapid cooling.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Transnasal evaporative cooling===
Transnasal evaporative cooling is a method of inducing the hypothermia process and provides a means of continuous cooling of a person throughout the early stages of targeted temperature management and during movement throughout the hospital environment. This technique uses two cannulae, inserted into a persons nasal cavity, to deliver a spray of coolant mist that evaporates directly underneath the brain and base of the skull. As blood passes through the cooling area, it reduces the temperature throughout the rest of the body.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The method is compact enough to be used at the point of cardiac arrest, during ambulance transport, or within the hospital proper. It is intended to reduce rapidly the person's temperature to below {{Convert|34|C|F}} while targeting the brain as the first area of cooling. Research into the device has shown cooling rates of {{convert|2.6|C-change}} per hour in the brain (measured through infrared tympanic measurement) and {{convert|1.6|C-change}} per hour for core body temperature reduction.&lt;ref name="Missingor"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.931691 |title=Intra-Arrest Transnasal Evaporative Cooling: A Randomized, Prehospital, Multicenter Study (PRINCE: Pre-ROSC IntraNasal Cooling Effectiveness) |year=2010 |last1=Castren |first1=M. |last2=Nordberg |first2=P. |last3=Svensson |first3=L. |last4=Taccone |first4=F. |last5=Vincent |first5=J.-L. |last6=Desruelles |first6=D. |last7=Eichwede |first7=F. |last8=Mols |first8=P. |last9=Schwab |first9=T. |last10=Vergnion |first10=M. |last11=Storm |first11=C. |last12=Pesenti |first12=A. |last13=Pachl |first13=J. |last14=Guérisse |first14=F. |last15=Elste |first15=T. |last16=Roessler |first16=M. |last17=Fritz |first17=H. |last18=Durnez |first18=P. |last19=Busch |first19=H.-J. |last20=Inderbitzen |first20=B. |last21=Barbut |first21=D. |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=7 |pages=729–36 |pmid=20679548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.04.027 |title=Safety and feasibility of nasopharyngeal evaporative cooling in the emergency department setting in survivors of cardiac arrest |year=2010 |last1=Busch |first1=H.-J. |last2=Eichwede |first2=F. |last3=Födisch |first3=M. |last4=Taccone |first4=F.S. |last5=Wöbker |first5=G. |last6=Schwab |first6=T. |last7=Hopf |first7=H.-B. |last8=Tonner |first8=P. |last9=Hachimi-Idrissi |first9=S. |last10=Martens |first10=P. |last11=Fritz |first11=H. |last12=Bode |first12=Ch. |last13=Vincent |first13=J.-L. |last14=Inderbitzen |first14=B. |last15=Barbut |first15=D. |last16=Sterz |first16=F. |last17=Janata |first17=A. |journal=Resuscitation |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=943–9 |pmid=20627524|url=https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/140497/1/Elsevier_123684.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water blankets===
With these technologies, cold water circulates through a blanket, or torso wraparound vest and leg wraps. To lower temperature with optimal speed, 70% of a person’s surface area should be covered with water blankets. The treatment represents the most well studied means of controlling body temperature. Water blankets lower a person’s temperature exclusively by cooling a person’s skin and accordingly require no invasive procedures.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Water blankets possess several undesirable qualities. They are susceptible to leaking, which may represent an electrical hazard since they are operated in close proximity to electrically powered medical equipment.&lt;ref name="holden"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16767013 |year=2006 |last1=Holden |first1=M |last2=Makic |first2=MB |title=Clinically induced hypothermia: Why chill your patient? |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=125–32 |journal=AACN Advanced Critical Care |doi=10.1097/00044067-200604000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Food and Drug Administration also has reported several cases of external cooling blankets causing significant burns to the skin of person. Other problems with external cooling include overshoot of temperature (20% of people will have overshoot), slower induction time versus internal cooling, increased compensatory response, decreased patient access, and discontinuation of cooling for invasive procedures such as the cardiac catheterization.&lt;ref name="Clumpner"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18839889 |year=2008 |last1=Clumpner |first1=M |last2=Mobley |first2=J |title=Raising the dead. Prehospital hypothermia for cardiac arrest victims may improve neurological outcome and survival to discharge |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=52–60 |journal=EMS magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If therapy with water blankets is given along with two litres of cold intravenous saline, people can be cooled to {{convert|33|C}} in 65 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  Most machines now come with core temperature probes. When inserted into the [[rectum]], the core body temperature is monitored and feedback to the machine allows changes in the water blanket to achieve the desired set temperature. In the past some of the models of cooling machines have produced an overshoot in the target temperature and cooled people to levels below {{convert|32|C}}, resulting in increased adverse events. They have also rewarmed patients at too fast a rate, leading to spikes in intracranial pressure. Some of the new models have more software that attempt to prevent this overshoot by utilizing warmer water when the target temperature is close and preventing any overshoot. Some of the new machines now also have 3 rates of cooling and warming; a rewarming rate with one of these machines allows a patient to be rewarmed at a very slow rate of just {{convert|0.17|C-change}} an hour in the "automatic mode," allowing rewarming from {{convert|33|C}} to {{convert|37|C}} over 24 hours.

===Cool caps===
There are a number of non-invasive head cooling caps and helmets designed to target cooling at the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23171713 |year=2012 |last1=Harris |first1=B |last2=Andrews |first2=PJ |last3=Murray |first3=GD |last4=Forbes |first4=J |last5=Moseley |first5=O |title=Systematic review of head cooling in adults after traumatic brain injury and stroke |volume=16 |issue=45 |pages=1–175 |doi=10.3310/hta16450 |journal=Health technology assessment|url=http://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/hta/volume-16/issue-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothermia cap is typically made of a synthetic material such as neoprene, silicone, or polyurethane and filled with a cooling agent such as ice or gel which is either cooled to a very cold temperature, {{Convert|-25|to|-30|C|F}}, before application or continuously cooled by an auxiliary control unit.

Circulation is regulated by means of valves and temperature sensors in the cap. If the temperature deviates or if other errors are detected, an alarm system is activated. The frozen iteration involves continuous application of caps filled with Crylon gel cooled to {{convert|-30|C}} to the scalp before, during and after intravenous chemotherapy. As the caps warm on the head, multiple cooled caps must be kept on hand and applied every 20 to 30 minutes.

==History==

==Research==
TTM has been studied in several use scenarios where it has not been found to be helpful, or is still under investigation.

===Stroke===
There is currently no evidence supporting targeted temperature management use in humans and clinical trials have not been completed.&lt;ref name="emed"&gt;{{cite web | title= Therapeutic Hypothermia | publisher= eMedicine | url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/812407-overview | date= 29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the data concerning hypothermia’s effectiveness in treating stroke is limited to animal studies. These studies have focused primarily on [[ischemic stroke]] as opposed to [[hemorrhagic stroke]], as hypothermia is associated with a lower clotting threshold. In these animal studies, hypothermia was represented an effective [[neuroprotection|neuroprotectant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11486115 |year=2001 |last1=Krieger |first1=DW |last2=De Georgia |first2=MA |last3=Abou-Chebl |first3=A |last4=Andrefsky |first4=JC |last5=Sila |first5=CA |last6=Katzan |first6=IL |last7=Mayberg |first7=MR |last8=Furlan |first8=AJ |title=Cooling for acute ischemic brain damage (cool aid): An open pilot study of induced hypothermia in acute ischemic stroke |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=1847–54 |journal=Stroke |doi=10.1161/01.STR.32.8.1847}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of hypothermia to control [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) after an ischemic stroke was found to be both safe and practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{INIST|1604537}} |doi=10.1161/01.STR.29.12.2461 |title=Moderate Hypothermia in the Treatment of Patients with Severe Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction |year=1998 |last1=Schwab |first1=S. |last2=Schwarz |first2=S. |last3=Spranger |first3=M. |last4=Keller |first4=E. |last5=Bertram |first5=M. |last6=Hacke |first6=W. |journal=Stroke |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=2461–6 |pmid=9836751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traumatic brain or spinal cord injury===
Animal studies have shown the benefit of targeted temperature management in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Clinical trials have shown mixed results with regards to the optimal temperature and delay of cooling. Achieving therapeutic temperatures of {{convert|33|C|F|abbr=on}} is thought to prevent secondary neurological injuries after severe CNS trauma.&lt;ref name="Journal of Special Operations Medicine"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jess |last1=Arcure |first2=Eric E |last2=Harrison |title=Review Article of the Use of Early Hypothermia in the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injuries |journal=Journal of Special Operations Medicine |date=Summer 2009 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=22–5 |url=http://www.socom.mil/JSOMDocs/2009322Arcure.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A systematic review of randomised controlled trials in [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) suggests there is no evidence that hypothermia is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001048.pub4 |chapter=Hypothermia for traumatic head injury |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2009 |last1=Sydenham |first1=Emma |last2=Roberts |first2=Ian |last3=Alderson |first3=Phil |editor1-last=Sydenham |editor1-first=Emma |journal=Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurosurgery===
As of 2015 hypothermia had shown no improvements in neurological outcomes or in mortality in neurosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25626888 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006638.pub3 | volume=1 | title=Cooling for cerebral protection during brain surgery | year=2015 | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | pages=CD006638 | author=Galvin IM, Levy R, Boyd JG, Day AG, Wallace MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trashion''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "trash" and "fashion") is a term for art, jewellery, fashion and objects for the home created from used, thrown-out, found and repurposed elements.  The term was first coined in [[New Zealand]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://threadnz.com/fashion/fashion-shows/turn-your-trash-into-trashion "Turn your trash into 'trashion',"] Thread.co.nz, 2004. Retrieved 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and gained in usage through 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Scholtus, Petz. [http://www.treehugger.com/style/vaho-is-trashion.html "Vaho is Trashion,"] Treehugger.com, 6 June 2005. Retrieved 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Trashion is a subgenre of [[found object]] art, which is basically using objects that already have some other defined purpose, and turning it into art. In this case, trash is used.

Initially trashion was used to describe art-[[haute couture|couture]] costume usually linked to contests or fashion shows; however, as recycling and 'green' fashion become more prevalent, trashion has taken a turn for the more wearable.  The term is now widely used in creative circles to describe any wearable item or accessory that is constructed using all or part materials that have been recycled, including clothing that has been thrifted and reconditioned.

==Philosophy==
Trashion is a philosophy and an ethic encompassing [[environmentalism]] and [[innovation]]. Making traditional objects out of recycled materials can be trashion, as can making avant-garde fashion from cast-offs or junk.  It springs from a desire to make the best use of limited resources. Trashion is similar to [[upcycling]] and refashion, although it began with specific fashion aspirations.  Like upcycling, trashion generates items that are valued again, but these may be low-cost or high-cost, perhaps depending on the skill of the artist. The environmental aim of trashion is to call attention to the polluting outcome of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Trashion' designer Marina DeBris turns ocean rubbish into high-end outfits – in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/13/trashion-designer-marina-debris-turns-ocean-rubbish-into-high-end-outfits-in-pictures|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=The Guardian|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Indigenous people throughout the world have used salvaged materials to create new objects for an indeterminate number of years.  Africans have made bags from rice and juice packets, Haitians have made sculptural jewelry from old oil cans, and American settlers have made quilts and rugs from cast-off clothing and feed sacks.  People were making something from nothing long before the word "trashion" was coined; however, Trashion usually refers to "making something from nothing" for aesthetic purposes, not for practical use.

In the 1990s, American artist Ann Wizer began using [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] in her [[wearable art]].  Working in the Philippines, and titling her line the 'Virus Project,' Wizer created a set of costumes made entirely from post consumer plastic waste to celebrate [[Earth Day]]. The first plastic packaging tote bags were accessories to these costumes. There are now numerous small scale [[poverty reduction|poverty intervention]] projects throughout Southeast Asia in the process of creating similar trashion accessories and other fashion and homeware items. This includes the XSProject, a charity founded by Wizer and based in [[Jakarta]].

The Trashion movement took off in New York City in late 2004, early 2005 through underground parties on the lower east side of Manhattan at a club called Plan B. Trashion was part of the fashion of Urban Gypsy Circus, which is an interactive art party thrown by multi-media artist Miz Metro. These parties exhibited art made out of recycled materials and included monthly "TRASHION FACEOFFS" where 2 designers would compete to be the "TRASHION QUEEN". This led to Matthew Namer &amp; Miz Metro curating the TRASHION Art show at Gallery 151 on exhibit during the summer of 2009 on the lower east side of Manhattan.

Trashion has become a very popular style of art. For example, in 2006, Julia Genatossio launched Monsoon Vermont, a trashion design house.  The company designs items such as umbrellas, shower curtains and backpacks which are made from Jakarta's scavenged trash. Unlike the XSProject, Monsoon Vermont is a for-profit venture.&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Necee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24890">[[File:2017AtlanticHurricaneTrackingChart.png|thumb|Atlantic hurricane tracking chart]]
A '''tropical cyclone tracking chart''' is used by those within hurricane-threatened areas to track [[tropical cyclone]]s worldwide.  In the north Atlantic basin, they are known as '''hurricane tracking charts'''.  New tropical cyclone information is available at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere and at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere.  Charts include maps of the areas where tropical cyclones form and track within the various basins, include name lists for the year, basin-specific tropical cyclone definitions, rules of thumb for [[hurricane preparedness]], emergency contact information, and numbers for figuring out where [[tropical cyclone shelter]]s are open.

In paper form originally, computer programs were developed in the 1980s for personal home and use by professional [[weather forecasters]].  Those used by weather forecasters saved preparation times, allowing tropical cyclone advisories to be sent an hour earlier.  With the advent of the internet in the 1990s, digitally-prepared charts began to include other information along with storm position and past track, including forecast track, areas of wind impact, and related watches and warnings.

Tropical cyclone tracking charts were initially used for [[tropical cyclone forecasting]] and towards the end of the year for post season summaries of the season's activity.  Their use led to an north Atlantic-based term still in use today: [[Cape Verde hurricane]].  Prior to the early 1940s, the term Cape Verde hurricane referred to August and early September storms that formed to the east of the surface plotting charts in use at the time.&lt;ref name="Dunn1960"&gt;{{cite book|title=Atlantic Hurricanes|author1=Gordon E.

This was more popular along sections of the southern [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the United States than the coast of California due to their increased danger of a landfalling tropical cyclone.

Historically, tropical cyclone tracking charts were used to include the past track and prepare future forecasts at Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.  The need for a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent to operational weather forecasters by the mid-1980s. At that time the [[United States Department of Defense]] was using paper maps, acetate, grease pencils, and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="ATCF1"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Weather and Forecasting|pages=653–600|publisher=American Meteorological Society|date=December 1990|author1=Ronald J.

Symbols used within the charts vary by basin, by center, and by individual preference.  Simple dots or circles can be used for each position.  The [[National Hurricane Center]] uses a variety of symbols composed of overlapping 6's and 9's for tropical storms and hurricanes to emulate their circulation pattern, and a circle for tropical depressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov|author=National Hurricane Center|title=National Hurricane Center web site|date=2017|accessdate=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Northern Hemisphere centers used the overlapping 6 and 9 symbols for all tropical cyclones of tropical storm strength, with L's reserved for tropical depressions or general low pressure areas in the tropics.  Southern Hemisphere versions would use backward overlapping 6's and 9's.  The World Meteorological Organization uses an unfilled symbol to depict tropical storms, a filled symbol to depict systems of cyclone/hurricane/typhoon strength, and a circle to depict a tropical low or tropical convective cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u-0ZsJby4UC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=wmo+tropical+cyclone+symbols&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qBtYK_akMP&amp;sig=ZaeAgwl232EE_HS8gf75F1pqPqs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBu9ajv6XUAhUIziYKHcl3AzcQ6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=wmo%20tropical%20cyclone%20symbols&amp;f=false|page=103|title=Meteorology at the Millennium|editor=Robert P.

In order to use a hurricane tracking chart, one needs access to [[latitude]]/[[longitude]] pairs of the cyclone's center and [[maximum sustained wind]] information in order to know which symbol to depict.

==Use==
The maps either use a [[mercator projection]] if restricted to the tropics and subtropics, but can use a [[Lambert conformal conic projection]] if the maps reach towards the arctic for the North Atlantic basin where tropical cyclones move more poleward.  [[Meteorologist]]s use these maps to estimate a system's initial position based on aircraft, satellite, and surface data within [[surface weather analysis|surface weather analyses]].  The data is then analyzed to determine recent storm motion and create and convey forecast tracks, wind swaths, uncertainty, related watches, and related warnings to end users of tropical cyclone forecasts.

Hurricane tracking charts allow people to track ongoing systems to form their own opinions regarding where the storms are going and whether or not they need to prepare for the system being tracked, including possible evacuation.  This continues to be encouraged by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and National Hurricane Center.&lt;ref name="FTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/for_fun/FollowthatHurricane.pdf|title=Follow That Hurricane!|author=[[National Ocean Service]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2017-06-02|date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some agencies provide track storms in their immediate vicinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmgd.gov.vu/vmgd/index.php/forecast-division/tropical-cyclone/vanuatu-cyclone-tracking-map|title=Vanuatu Cyclone Tracking Map|date=2017|accessdate=2017-06-04|author=Vanuatu Meteorology &amp; Geo-Hazards Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others cover entire ocean basins.

{{Power engineering}}
A '''voltage converter''' is an [[electric power converter]] which changes the [[voltage]] of an electrical power source. It may be combined with other components to create a [[power supply]].

==AC and DC==
AC voltage conversion uses a [[transformer]]. Conversion from one DC voltage to another requires [[electronic circuit]]ry([[electromechanical]] equipment was required before the development of [[semiconductor device|semiconductor electronics]]), like a [[DC-to-DC converter|DC-DC converter]].  [[Mains power]] (called household current in the US) is universally AC.

== Practical voltage converters ==
===Mains converters===
A common use of the voltage converter is for a device that allows appliances made for the mains voltage of one geographical region to operate in an area with different voltage. Such a device may be called a ''voltage converter'', ''power converter'', ''travel adapter'', etc. Most [[single phase]] alternating-current electrical outlets in the world supply power at 210–240&amp;nbsp;V or at 100–120&amp;nbsp;V. A transformer or [[autotransformer]] can be used; (auto)transformers are inherently reversible, so the same transformer can be used to step the voltage up, or step it down by the same ratio. Lighter and smaller devices can be made using electronic circuitry; reducing the voltage electronically is simpler and cheaper than increasing it. Small, inexpensive, ''travel adapters'' suitable for low-power devices such as [[electric shaver]]s, but not, say, [[hairdrier]]s, are available; travel adapters usually include plug-end adapters for the different standards used in different countries. A transformer would be used for higher power.

Transformers do not change the [[frequency]] of electricity; in many regions with 100–120&amp;nbsp;V, electricity is supplied at 60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], and 210–240&amp;nbsp;V regions tend to use 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. This may affect operation of devices which depend on mains frequency (some audio turntables and mains-only electric clocks, etc., although modern equipment is less likely to depend upon mains frequency). Equipment with high-powered motors or internal transformers designed to operate at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz may overheat at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz even if the voltage supplied is correct.

Most mains-powered electrical equipment, though it may specify a single nominal voltage, actually has a range of tolerance above and below that point. Thus, devices usually can be used on either any voltage from approx. 100 to 120 V, or any voltage from approx. 210 to 240&amp;nbsp;V. In such cases, voltage converters need only be specified to convert any voltage within one range, to a voltage within the other, rather than separate converters being needed for all possible pairs of nominal voltages (110–220, 117–220, 110–230, etc.)

===Converters for devices===
====Mains converters====
Another requirement is to provide low-voltage electricity to a device from mains electricity; this would be done by what is usually called a ''power supply''. Most modern electronic devices require between 1.5 and 24 volts DC; lower-powered devices at these voltages can often work either from [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or mains. Some devices incorporate a power supply and are simply plugged into the mains. Others use an external power supply comprising either a transformer and rectifier, or electronic circuitry. [[Switched-mode power supply|Switched-mode power supplies]] have become widespread in the early twenty-first century; they are smaller and lighter than the once-universal transformer converters, and are often designed to work from AC mains at any voltage between 100 and 250 V. Additionally, because they are typically rectified to operate at a DC voltage, they are minimally affected by the frequency of the mains (50 vs 60 Hz). Details on operation are given in the article on [[power supplies]].

====Mobile converters====
Voltage converters can be used in vehicles with 12&amp;nbsp;V DC outlets. A simple voltage dropper can be used to reduce the voltage for low-power devices; if more than 12V is required, or for high-powered devices, a switched-mode power supply is used. The output will usually be DC in the range 1.5–24&amp;nbsp;V. Power supplies that output either 100–120&amp;nbsp;V AC or 210–240&amp;nbsp;V AC are available; they are called [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]], due to the conversion from DC to AC rather than the voltage change. The output frequency and waveform of an inverter may not accurately replicate that supplied by mains electricity, although this is not usually a problem.

==Choosing a converter==
A converter to drive equipment should be specified to supply at least the actual [[watt]]s or [[ampere]]s used by the equipment; this is usually stated on a label on the equipment. A converter of higher rating is safe to use. Some equipment uses more power or current at startup; a 20% margin is usually adequate, although it may be included in the rated figure.

A '''wax sculpture''' is a [[depiction]] made using a waxy substance. Often these are [[effigy|effigies]], usually of a notable individual, but there are also [[death mask]]s and scenes with many figures, mostly in [[relief]].

The properties of [[beeswax]] make it an excellent medium for preparing figures and models, either by modeling or by casting in [[Molding (process)|molds]]. It can easily be cut and shaped at room temperature, melts at a low temperature, mixes with any coloring matter, takes surface tints well, and its texture and consistency may be modified by the addition of earthy matters and oils or fats. When molten, it is highly responsive to impressions from a mold and, once it sets and hardens, its form is relatively resilient against ordinary temperature variations, even when it is cast in thin [[wikt:lamina|laminae]]. These properties have seen wax used for modelling since the Middle Ages and there is testimony for it having been used for making masks (particularly death masks) in ancient Rome.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;Originally appearing in Volume V28, Page 430 of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; The death masks of illustrious ancestors would be displayed by the elite holding the right of "ius imaginem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariamilani.com/ancient_rome/funerals_in_ancient_rome.htm |title=Funerals in Ancient Rome |publisher=Mariamilani.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of making a wax sculpture can be between USD150,000 and 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on_the_strip/tussauds.html |title=Madame Tussauds Interactive Wax Attraction - Madame Tussauds Interactive Wax Attraction Las Vegas - Vegas Attractions |publisher=VEGAS.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/19331/madame-tussauds-unveils-chuck-liddell-wax-figurine-at-ufc-fan-expo.mma |title=Cost of making a wax sculpture |publisher=Mmajunkie.com |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Effigies===
The display of temporary or permanent effigies in wax and other media of the deceased was a common part of the funeral ceremonies of very important people in European historical times. Most of the figures would wear the real clothes of the deceased so they could be made quickly.  The museum of [[Westminster Abbey]] has a collection of British royal wax effigies, as well as those of figures such as the naval hero [[Horatio Nelson]], and [[Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond]], who also had her parrot stuffed and displayed.  The effigy of [[Charles II of England]] (1680) was displayed over his tomb until the early 19th century, when all were removed from the abbey itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/6623 Photo at Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]; [http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/frances-teresa-stuart Westminster Abbey]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nelson's effigy was a pure tourist attraction, commissioned the year after his death in 1805, and his burial in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] after a government decision that major public figures should in future be buried there. Concerned for their revenue from visitors, the Abbey decided it needed a rival attraction for admirers of Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/horatio,-viscount-nelson Westminster Abbey, "Horatio, Viscount Nelson"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The practice of wax modelling can be traced through the [[Middle Ages]], when votive offerings of wax figures were made to [[church (building)|churches]]. The memory and lineaments of monarchs and great personages were preserved by means of wax masks.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

During this period, superstition found expression in the formation of wax images of hated persons, into which long pins were thrust, in the confident expectation that thereby deadly injury would be induced to the person represented. This practice was considered more effective when some portion of the victim's [[hair]] or [[nail (anatomy)|nails]] were added to the wax figure, thus strengthening the connection with its actual subject. This belief and practice continued until the 17th century, though the superstition survived into the 19th century. In the [[Scottish Highlands]], a [[clay]] model of an enemy was found in a stream in 1885, having been placed there in the belief that, as the clay was washed away, so would the health of the hated one decline.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

===Renaissance===
During the [[Italian Renaissance]], modeling in wax took a position of high importance, and it was practised by some of the greatest of the early masters. The bronze medallions of [[Pisanello]] and of the other famous medalists owe their value to the properties of wax: all early [[bronze]]s and metalwork were cast from wax models first.

There are a number of very high quality wax figures from the 16th and 17th centuries, mostly portrait figures and religious or mythological scenes, often with many figures. [[Antonio Abondio]] (1538–91) pioneered the coloured wax [[portrait miniature]] in [[relief]], working mainly for the [[Habsburg]] and other courts of Northern Europe, and his son Alessandro continued in his footsteps.

Towards the close of the 18th century, modeling of medallion portraits and of relief groups, the latter frequently [[polychrome|polychromatic]], was in considerable vogue throughout [[Europe]]. Many of the artists were women. [[John Flaxman]] executed in wax many [[portrait]]s and other relief figures which [[Josiah Wedgwood]] translated into [[pottery]] for his [[Jasperware]]. The [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] has 40 wax portraits, mostly from this period.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

The famous wax bust attributed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] acquired in 1909 by the Museum of Berlin is the work of an English [[forgery|forger]] who worked about 1840. The wax model of a head, at the Wicar Museum at [[Lille]], belongs probably to the school of [[Canova]], which robs it of none of its exquisite grace.&lt;ref&gt;Gillet, Louis. "Leonardo da Vinci." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 27 Jun. 2009 &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15440a.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===
[[Wax-works]], not intended as fine art, subsequently became popular attractions, consisting principally of images of historical or notorious personages, made up of waxen masks on lay figures in which sometimes mechanism is fitted to give motion to the figure. Such an exhibition of wax-works with mechanical motions was shown in Germany early in the eighteenth century.

The most famous modern [[Wax museum|waxwork exhibition]] is that of [[Madame Tussauds]], where the technology of [[animatronics]] brings the wax figures to life.

Waxworks are frequently made presented by contemporary artists who take advantage of its lifelike and uncanny qualities. While the artist often creates a wax self-portrait, there are examples too of imaginary personalities and historical personae. For example, [[Gavin Turk]] had his portrait made as [[Sid Vicious]] ("Pop", Waxwork in vitrine 279 x 115 x 115&amp;nbsp;cm, 1993), [[Jan Fabre]] as a notorious thief (homage to [[Jacques Mesrine]] (Bust) II, 2008. Lifesize. Private collection.ta.) Contemporary artists working with wax include [[Beth B]], [[Berlinde de Bruyckere]], [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Peta Coyne]], [[Eleanor Crook]], [[Robert Gober]], [[John Isaacs (artist)|John Isaacs]], [[Wendy Mayer]], [[Pascale Pollier]], [[Chantal Pollier]], [[Sigrid Sarda]], [[Gil Shachar]] and [[Kiki Smith]]. Techniques include body casting using alginate and silicone rubber moulds, and hand modelling which creates unique forms and distortions.

The museum of medieval torture instruments in Amsterdam also used wax figures in order to demonstrate the use of machines and tools of their display.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in moulage==
The modeling of the soft parts of [[dissection]]s, teaching illustrations of [[anatomy]], was first practised at Florence during the [[Renaissance]]. The practice of [[moulage]], or the depiction of human anatomy and different diseases taken from directly casting from the body using (in the early period) gelatine moulds, later alginate or silicone moulds, used wax as its primary material (later to be replaced by latex and rubber). Some moulages were directly cast from the bodies of diseased subjects, others from healthy subjects to which disease features( blisters, sores, growths, rashes) were skilfully applied with wax and pigments. During the 19th century, moulage evolved into three-dimensional, realistic representations of diseased parts of the human body. These can be seen in many European medical museums, notably the Spitzner collection currently in Brussels, the Charite Hospital museum in Berlin and the Gordon Museum of Pathology at Guy's Hospital in London UK. A comprehensive book monograph on moulages is "Diseases in Wax: the History of Medical Moulage" by Thomas Schnalke (Author) the director of the Charite Museum and Kathy Spatschek (Translator)

==Wax museums==
{{Main|Wax museum}}
A [[wax museum]] or waxworks consists of a collection of wax figures representing famous people from history and contemporary personalities exhibited in lifelike poses. Wax museums often have a special section dubbed the "chamber of horrors" in which the more grisly exhibits are displayed.

==Noise and annoyance==
A panel of experts commissioned by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection concluded in 2012 that "there is not an association between noise from wind turbines and measures of psychological distress or mental health problems." &lt;ref name='MA"/&gt;

A 2009 Canadian study found that "a small minority of those exposed report annoyance and stress associated with [[Psychoacoustics|noise perception]]..." [however] "Annoyance is not a disease."  The study group pointed out that similar irritations are produced by [[roadway noise|local and highway vehicles]], as well as from [[Industrial noise|industrial operations]] and [[Aircraft noise|aircraft]].&lt;ref name="CanWEA09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toronto Star-2009.12.15"&gt;{{cite news

A 2011 literature review found that although wind turbines are associated with some health effects, such as sleep disturbance, the health effects reported by those living near wind turbines were probably caused not by the turbines themselves but rather by "physical manifestation from an annoyed state." &lt;ref name="Knopper"/&gt; A 2013 report for the National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) elaborated: "There is consistent evidence that noise from wind turbines is associated with annoyance, and reasonable consistency that it is associated with sleep disturbance and poorer sleep quality and quality of life. However, it is unclear whether the observed associations are due to wind turbine noise or plausible confounders."&lt;ref name="Merlin"/&gt;

A [[meta study]] published in 2014 reported that among the cross-sectional studies of better quality, no clear or consistent association is seen between wind turbine noise and any reported disease or other indicator of harm to human health. Noise from turbines played a minor role in comparison with other factors in leading people to report annoyance in the context of wind turbines.&lt;ref name="McCunneyMundt2014"/&gt;

==Policy impact==
In [[Ontario]], Canada, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Ontario)|Ministry of the Environment]] created noise guidelines to limit wind turbine noise levels 30 metres away from a dwelling or campsite to 40&amp;nbsp;dB(A).&lt;ref name="Ontario1"&gt;Ministry of the Environment, Ontario (October 2008) [http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/publications/4709e.pdf "Noise Guidelines for Wind Farms"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations also set a minimum distance of {{convert|550|m|ft}} for a group of up to five relatively quiet [102&amp;nbsp;dB(A)] turbines within a {{convert|3|km|mi|adj=on}} radius, rising to {{convert|1500|m|ft}} for a group of 11 to 25 noisier (106-107&amp;nbsp;dB(A)) turbines. Larger facilities and noisier turbines would require a noise study.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star-2009.12.15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ontario2"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ministry of the Environment, Ontario|date=9 June 2009|url=http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/en/news/2009/060901mb2.php|title=Wind Turbines – Proposed Requirements and Setbacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 report about rural wind farms, a Standing Committee of the [[Parliament of New South Wales]], Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach.&lt;ref name="NSW1"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=General Purpose Standing Committee No. 5, Parliament of New South Wales|date=16 December 2009|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/ea247659081d31fdca25768e001a2e2a/$FILE/091216%20Report%20-%20Rural%20wind%20farms.pdf|title=Final Report, Rural Wind Farms}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the lack of scientific literature demonstrating any health effects from wind turbines, Australia's Turnbull government appointed a wind farm commissioner in October 2015 to address complaints.&lt;ref name="SMH WFC"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 October 2015|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/turnbull-government-appoints-australias-first-wind-farm-commissioner-20151009-gk560t.html|title=Turnbull government appoints Australia's first wind farm commissioner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 annual report of the Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines was tabled in the Australian Parliament on 8 August 2017.&lt;ref name="2017 ISCWT Report"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of the Environment and Energy|year=2017|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/publications/isc-wind-turbines-2016-annual-report|title=2016 Annual Report Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website is maintained for the [https://www.nwfc.gov.au/ National Wind Farm Commissioner], with information about the role's purpose and links to a variety of publications that address wind turbines and their management, from a range of national and international sources.

==Noise mitigation==
Modern wind turbines produce significantly less noise than older designs. Turbine designers work to minimise noise, as noise reflects lost energy and output. Noise levels at nearby residences may be managed through the siting of turbines, the approvals process for wind farms, and operational management of the wind farm.&lt;ref name="NSWG-2010.11.01"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New South Wales Government|date=1 November 2010|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/households/WindEnergyfactsheet.pdf|title=The wind energy fact sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Worker Applying a Wood Finish.jpg|thumb|A worker sprays a urethane finish onto a [[timber framing|timber]]]]
'''Wood finishing''' refers to the process of refining or protecting a [[wood]]en surface, especially in the production of [[furniture]] where typically it represents between 5 and 30% of manufacturing costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Furniture finishing textbook|last = Whaler|first = J.H.|publisher = Production Publishing Company|year = 1972|isbn = |location = Nashville|page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Building an industrial wood finish|last = Cox|first = Robert M.|publisher = Forest Products Society|year = 2003|isbn = 1-892529-30-0|location = Madison|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finishing is the final step of the manufacturing process that gives wood surfaces desirable characteristics, including enhanced appearance and increased resistance to moisture and other environmental agents. Finishing can also make wood easier to clean&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wood finishing and refinishing|last = Gibbia|first = S.W.|publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold|year = 1981|isbn = 0-442-24708-7|location = New York|page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and keep it sanitized, sealing pores that can be breeding grounds for bacteria.  Finishing can also influence other wood properties, for example tonal qualities of musical instruments and hardness of flooring.&lt;ref&gt;Jaić, Milan, and Tanja Palija. "The impact of the top coating on the mechanical properties of lacquered wood surfaces." ''Glasnik Sumarskog fakulteta''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surface coating influence on elastic properties of spruce wood by means of holographic vibration mode visualization|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.353047|date = 1999-01-01|pages = 103–110|volume = 3820|doi = 10.1117/12.353047|first = M.|last = Bongova|first2 = Stanislav|last2 = Urgela|chapter = Surface coating influence on elastic properties of spruce wood by means of holographic vibration mode visualization|series = 11th Slovak-Czech-Polish Optical Conference on Wave and Quantum Aspects of Contemporary Optics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, finishing provides a way of giving low-value woods the appearance of ones that are expensive and difficult to obtain.

== Planning the finish ==

Finishing of wood requires careful planning to ensure that the finished piece looks attractive, performs well in service and meets safety and environmental requirements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wood Finishing: Step-by-step techniques|last = Hatchard|first = Den|publisher = The Crowood Press|year = 1992|isbn = 978-1852235826|location = Ramsbury, Marlborough|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning for finishing begins with the design of furniture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Care should be taken to ensure that edges of furniture are rounded so they can be adequately coated and are able to resist wear and cracking. Careful attention should also be given to the design and strength of wooden joints to ensure they do not open-up in service and crack the overlying finish.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Wood Finishing: How to Select and Apply the Right Finish|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=r44o8Nb0mGoC|publisher = Reader's Digest|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9780762101917|first = Bob|last = Flexner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care should also be taken to eliminate recesses in furniture, which are difficult to finish with some systems, especially UV-cured finishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.radtech.org/images/pdf_upload/woodfinishmayjun06.pdf|title = Wood Finishing with UV-Curable Coatings|date = June 2006|access-date = |website = |publisher = RADTECH REPORT|last = Iseghem|first = Lawrence C.

Planning for wood finishing also involves thinking about the properties of the wood that you are going to finish, as these can greatly affect the appearance and performance of finishes, and also the type of finishing system that will give the wood the characteristics you are seeking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, woods that show great variation in colour between [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]] and [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]] or within heartwood may require a preliminary staining step to reduce colour variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Coloring, Finishing and Painting Wood|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7xYkAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Manual arts Press|date = 1940-01-01|first = Adnah Clifton|last = Newell|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171022163523/https://books.google.com/books?id=7xYkAAAAMAAJ|archivedate = 2017-10-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the wood can be bleached to remove the natural colour of the wood and then stained to the desired colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wood Finishing, Plain and Decorative: Methods, Materials, and Tools for Natural, Stained, Varnished, Waxed, Oiled, Enameled, and Painted Finishes.

The pores in ring-porous woods preferentially absorb pigmented stain, and advantage can be taken of this to highlight the wood's grain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some tropical woods,  such as [[rosewood]] (''Dalbergia nigra''), [[cocobolo]] (''Dalbergia retusa'') and [[Pterocarpus soyauxii|African padauk]] (''Pterocarpus soyauxii''),  contain extractives such as quinones, which retard the curing of unsaturated polyester and UV-cured acrylate coatings, and so other finishing systems should be used with these species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Über die Trocknungsinhibierung von Lackanstrichen auf Handelshölzern|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02615619|journal = Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff|date = 1960-02-01|issn = 0018-3768|pages = 63–75|volume = 18|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/BF02615619|language = de|first = Wilhelm|last = Sandermann|first2 = Hans-Hermann|last2 = Dietrichs|first3 = Martin|last3 = Puth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chemistry in the utilization of wood|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7y3xAAAAMAAJ|publisher = Pergamon Press|date = 1967-06-01|first = Robert Harvey|last = Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Influence of Wood Extracts on the Uv Curing of Acrylate Coatings|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1081/MA-120004510|journal = Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part A|date = 2002-06-26|issn = 1060-1325|pages = 657–666|volume = 39|issue = 7|doi = 10.1081/MA-120004510|first = R.

[[File:Wood-stains.jpg|thumb]]

Planning for wood finishing also involves being aware of how the finishing process influences the end result. Careful handling of the wood is needed to avoid dents, scratches and soiling with dirt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wood should be marked for cutting using pencil rather than ink; however, avoid hard or soft pencil. HB is recommend for face work and 2H for joint work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Care should be taken to avoid squeeze-out of glue from joints because the glue will reduce absorption of stain and finish. Any excess glue should be carefully removed to avoid further damage to the wood. 

Wood’s moisture content affects the staining of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Note on the Effect of Wood Moisture Content and Clear Coating on the Color of Veneer Panels Stained with Solvent-Borne Stain|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273095733_A_Note_on_the_Effect_of_Wood_Moisture_Content_and_Clear_Coating_on_the_Color_of_Veneer_Panels_Stained_with_Solvent-Borne_Stain|journal = Forest Products Journal|pages = 273–275|volume = 60|issue = 3|doi = 10.13073/0015-7473-60.3.273|first = Philip D.|last = Evans|first2 = Ian|last2 = Cullis|year = 2010|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161023050743/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273095733_A_Note_on_the_Effect_of_Wood_Moisture_Content_and_Clear_Coating_on_the_Color_of_Veneer_Panels_Stained_with_Solvent-Borne_Stain|archivedate = 2016-10-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in wood moisture content can result in swelling and shrinkage of wood which can stress and crack coatings. Both problems can be avoided by storing wood indoors in an environment where it can equilibriate to a recommended moisture content (6 to 8%) that is similar to that of the intended end use of the furniture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Finally, consideration needs to be given to whether the finished wood will come into contact with food, in which case a food-safe finish should be used,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Finishes &amp; Finishing Techniques: Professional Secrets for Simple and Beautiful Finishes from Fine Woodworking|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9FmsstohTzMC|publisher = Taunton Press|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9781561582983|first = Taunton|last = Press|first2 = Fine|last2 = Woodworking|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171022163523/https://books.google.com/books?id=9FmsstohTzMC|archivedate = 2017-10-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; local environmental regulations governing the use of finishes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Case study project: The use of low-VOC/HAP coatings at wood furniture manufacturing facilities.

== Sanding ==

Sanding is carried out before finishing to remove defects from the wood surface that will affect the appearance and performance of finishes that are subsequently applied to the wood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These defects include cutter marks and burns, scratches and indentations, small glue spots and raised grain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sanding should not be used to eliminate larger defects such as gouges, and various forms of discolouration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other techniques are used to remove these defects (see below).    
[[File:Large open ‘pores’ in a Eucalyptus sieberi.jpg|left|thumb|Large open ‘pores’ in ''Eucalyptus sieberi'']]
[[File:Pore distribution in beech.jpg|thumb|Pore distribution in southern beech]]
The key to preparing a defect free surface is to develop a sanding schedule that will quickly eliminate defects and leave the surface smooth enough so that tiny scratches produced by sanding cannot be seen when the wood is finished.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Wood Sanding Book: A Guide to Abrasives, Machines, and Methods|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dIl2HAAACAAJ|publisher = Taunton Press|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 9781561581757|first = Sandor|last = Nagyszalanczy|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171022163523/https://books.google.com/books?id=dIl2HAAACAAJ|archivedate = 2017-10-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sanding schedule usually begins with sandpaper that is coarse enough to remove larger defects (typically 80 or 100 grit, but sometimes higher if the surface is already quite smooth), and progresses through a series of sandpaper grades that gradually remove the sanding scratches created by the previous sanding steps.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A typical sanding schedule prior to wood finishing might involve sanding wood along the grain with the following grades of sandpaper, 80, 100, 120, 150 and finishing with 180 and sometimes 220 grit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The precise sanding schedule is a matter of trial and error because the appearance of a sanded surface depends on the wood you are sanding and the finish that will subsequently be applied to the wood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Nagyszalanczy,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; coarse grained woods with large pores such as oak hide sanding scratches better than fine grained wood and hence with such species it may be possible to use 180 or even 150 grit sandpaper as the final step in the sanding schedule.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Conversely, sanding scratches are more easily seen in finer grained, harder woods and also end-grain, and hence, they require finer sandpaper (220 grit) during the final sanding stage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The sandpaper selected for the final sanding stage affects the colour of stained wood, and therefore when staining is part of finishing avoid sanding the wood to a very smooth finish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the other hand, according to Nagyszalanczy if you are using an oil-based finish, it is desirable to sand the wood using higher grit sandpaper (400 grit) because oil tends to highlight sanding scratches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[File:SEM of 120 grit aluminum oxide paper.jpg|thumb|Scanning Electron Microscopy of 120 grit aluminum oxide paper]]
[[File:SEM of 180 grit aluminum oxide paper.jpg|thumb|Scanning Electron Microscopy of 180 grit aluminum oxide paper]][[File:Yellow birch after sanding.jpg|left|thumb|Profilometry image of Yellow birch after sanding]]
Sanding is very good at removing defects at wood surfaces, but it creates a surface that contains minute scratches in the form of microscopic valleys and ridges, and also slivers of wood cell wall material that are attached to the underlying wood.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, G-I, Takachio, H. 1961. An experiment on the roughness and stability of sanded surface. Mokuzai Gakkaishi 7:41–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marra, G.G. 1943. An analysis of the factors responsible for raised grain on the wood of oak following sanding and staining.

Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers 54:27–30.&lt;/ref&gt; These sanding ridges and slivers of wood swell and spring-up, respectively, when sanded wood is finished with water-based finishes, creating a rough fuzzy surface. This defect is known as grain raising. It can be eliminated by wetting the surface with water, leaving the wood to dry and then lightly sanding the wood to remove the ‘raised grain’.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[File:Yellow birch after sanding and wetting.jpg|left|thumb|Profilometry image of Yellow birch after sanding and wetting]]

=== Removing larger defects ===

Larger defects that interfere with wood finishing include dent, gouges, splits and glue spots and smears.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These defects should also be removed before finishing, otherwise they will affect the quality of the finished furniture or object. However, it is difficult to completely eliminate large defects from wood surfaces.

Removing dents from wood surfaces is quite straightforward as pointed out by Flexner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Add a few droplets of demineralized water to the dent and let it soak in. Then put a clean cloth over the dent and place the tip of a hot iron on the cloth that lies immediately above the dent, taking great care not to burn the wood. The transfer of heat from the iron to the wood will cause compressed fibres in the dent to recover their original dimensions. As a result the dent will diminish in size or even disappear completely, although removal of large dents may require a number of wetting and heating cycles. The wood in the recovered dent should then be dried and sanded smooth to match the surrounding wood.

Gouges and holes in wood are more difficult to repair than dents because wood fibres have been cut, torn and removed from the wood. Larger gouges and splits are best repaired by patching the void with a piece of wood that matches the colour and grain orientation of the wood under repair.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Patching wood requires skill, but when done properly it is possible to create a repair that is very difficult to see. An alternative to patching is filling (sometimes known as stopping).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Staining and Polishing|url = https://books.google.com/?id=PF-7PQAACAAJ|publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Incorporated|date = 1974-09-01|isbn = 9780877490074|language = en|first = Charles H.|last = Hayward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous coloured fillers ([[Wood putty|putties]] and waxes) are produced commercially and are coloured to match different wood species. Successful filling of voids in wood requires the filler to precisely match the colour and grain pattern of the wood around the void, which is difficult to achieve in practice. Furthermore, filled voids do not behave like wood during subsequent finishing steps, and they age differently to wood. Hence, repairs to wood using fillers may noticeable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore filling is best used with opaque finishes rather than semitransparent finishes, which allow the grain of the wood to be seen.

Glue smears and droplets are sometimes present around the joints of furniture. They can be removed using a combination of scraping, scrubbing and sanding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These approaches remove surface glue, but not the glue beneath the wood surface. Sub-surface glue will reduce the absorption of stain by wood, and may alter the scratch pattern created by sanding. Both these effects will influence the way in which the wood colours when stains are used to finish the wood. To overcome this problem it may be necessary to locally stain and touch-up areas previously covered by glue to ensure that the finish on such areas matches that of the surrounding wood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Bleaching and removal of stains ==
Wood surfaces are occasionally affected by various organic and inorganic stains.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Uzunovic, A., Byrne, T., Gignac, M, Yang, D-Q. (2008). Wood discolourations &amp; their prevention with an emphasis on bluestain. FPInnovations (Forintek)''.'' Special Publication SP-50, 51 pp. '''I'''SSN #1916–4238.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such stains enhance the colour and appearance of wood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, oak wood affected by the beef-steak fungus has a deep rich, attractive, brown colour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Three-dimensional structure of wood: An Ultrastructural Approach|url = https://books.google.com/?id=-StRBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Jane,+F.W.+(1970).+The+structure+of+wood.+A+%2526+C+Black,+London,+478+pp.#v=onepage&amp;q=Jane%252C%2520F.W.%2520(1970).%2520The%2520structure%2520of%2520wood.%2520A%2520%2526%2520C%2520Black%252C%2520London%252C%2520478%2520pp.&amp;f=false|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9789401181464|language = en|first = B.|last = Butterfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no reason to remove the stain from the wood prior to finishing. The same applies to spalted wood whose attractive appearance is again caused by [[Spalting|fungi]]. On the other hand some fungal stains and those caused by the reaction of iron with wood can disfigure wood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These stains can be removed from wood using [[bleach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bleaching treatments for blue-stained lodgepole pine affected by the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00107-007-0177-5|journal = Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff|date = 2007-03-22|issn = 0018-3768|pages = 485–486|volume = 65|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s00107-007-0177-5|language = de|first = Philip D.|last = Evans|first2 = Gareth|last2 = Palmer|first3 = Mohammed|last3 = Chowdhury}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Anon (1948). Bleaching wood. US Forest Products Laboratory Report FPL-0165, 9pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Bleaches are also occasionally used to reduce the difference in colour between lighter sapwood and heartwood and also colour variation within heartwood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such bleaching make it easier to achieve a uniformly coloured wood when the wood is subsequently coloured with pigmented stains and dyes&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (see below). Furthermore, the natural colours of wood fade when wood is exposed to sunlight, and more permanent colours can be created by bleaching wood to remove its natural colour and then re-colouring the wood using artificial, light-fast, stains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The bleaches used to remove unwanted fungal stains from wood include two-part peroxide bleach and solutions of sodium hypochlorite.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The former is particularly effective at removing the natural colour of wood before it is recoloured with pigmented stains or dyes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Oxalic acid]] is particularly effective at removing iron stains from wood.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Colouring wood ==
Wood can be stained to change its colour or left unstained before application of lacquer, or other types of top-coats. Staining should enhance the appearance of wood by reducing colour variation between and within sapwood and heartwood. It also provides a way of giving bland looking woods such as poplar, the appearance of prized furniture woods such as ebony, mahogany or walnut.  Wood can be stained using [[dye]]s or pigmented finishes. These finishes are available in a wide variety of colours, many of which are not part of the natural colour palette of wood, for example, blues and greens. Pigmented stains tend to highlight the grain (and also sanding scratches), whereas dyes do not have this effect and are more transparent. Wood can also be coloured by exposing it to chemicals that react with the wood to form coloured compounds. Chemical staining of wood is rarely carried out because it is easier to colour wood using dye or pigmented stain, however, [[ammonia fuming]] is a chemical staining method that is still occasionally used to darken woods such as oak that contain a lot of [[tannin]]s. Staining of wood is difficult to control because some parts of the wood absorb more stain than others, which leads to problems such as blotchiness and streaking. For this reason, as pointed out by Flexner, many people prefer to omit the staining step when finishing wood.

==Basic wood finishing procedure==
Wood finishing starts with [[sandpaper|sanding]] either by hand, typically using a [[sanding block]] or power [[sander]], [[card scraper|scraping]], or [[plane (tool)|planing]]. Imperfections or nail holes on the surface may be filled using [[wood putty]] or pores may be filled using [[wood filler]]. Often, the wood's color is changed by [[wood stain|staining]], [[bleach]]ing, or any of a number of other techniques.

Once the wood surface is prepared and stained, the finish is applied. It usually consists of several coats of [[wax]], [[shellac]], [[drying oil]], [[lacquer]], [[varnish]], or [[paint]], and each coat is typically followed by sanding.

Finally, the surface may be [[polishing|polished]] or buffed using [[steel wool]], [[pumice]], [[rotten stone]] or other materials, depending on the shine desired. Often, a final coat of wax is applied over the finish to add a degree of protection.

[[French polish]]ing is a finishing method of applying many thin coats of shellac using a rubbing pad, yielding a very fine glossy finish.

[[Ammonia fuming]] is a traditional process for darkening and enriching the color of [[white oak]]. Ammonia fumes react with the natural [[tannins]] in the wood and cause it to change colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Fuming_white_oak.html |title=Fuming white oak |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210162130/http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Fuming_white_oak.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting product is known as "fumed oak".

==Types of finishes==
There are three major types of finish:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukworkshop.co.uk/forums/difference-between-lacquer-and-varnish-t39510.html |title=Difference between lacquer and varnish? : Finishing Advice |publisher=UKworkshop.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-07-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810114547/http://www.ukworkshop.co.uk/forums/difference-between-lacquer-and-varnish-t39510.html |archivedate=2016-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evaporative
* Reactive
* Coalescing

Wax is an '''evaporative''' finish because it is dissolved in turpentine or petroleum distillates to form a soft paste. After these distillates evaporate, a wax residue is left over.

'''Reactive''' finishes may use solvents such as white spirits and naphtha as a base. [[Varnish]]es, [[linseed oil]] and [[tung oil]] are reactive finishes, meaning they change chemically when they cure, unlike evaporative finishes. This chemical change is typically a [[polymerisation]], and the resultant material is less readily dissolved  in solvents .

Tung oil and linseed oil are reactive finishes that cure by reacting with oxygen, but do not form a film.

Water based finishes generally fall into the '''coalescing''' category.

==Comparison of different clear finishes==
Clear finishes are intended to make wood look good and meet the demands to be placed on the finish. Choosing a clear finish for wood involves trade-offs between appearance, protection, durability, safety, requirements for cleaning, and ease of application. The following table compares the characteristics of different clear finishes. 'Rubbing qualities' indicates the ease with which a finish can be manipulated to deliver the finish desired.
Shellac should be considered in two different ways. It is used thinned with [[denatured alcohol]] as a finish and as a way to manipulate the wood's ability to absorb other finishes. The alcohol evaporates almost immediately to yield a finish that will attach to virtually any surface, even glass, and virtually any other finish can be used over it.

==Automated wood finishing methods==
Manufacturers who [[mass production|mass-produce]] products implement automated flatline finish systems.  These systems consist of a series of processing stations that may include sanding, dust removal, staining, sealer and topcoat applications. As the name suggests, the primary part shapes are flat. Liquid wood finishes are applied via automated spray guns in an enclosed environment or spray cabin. The material then can enter an oven or be sanded again depending on the manufacturer’s setup. The material can also be recycled through the line to apply another coat of finish or continue in a system that adds successive coats depending on the layout of the production line. The systems typically used one of two approaches to production.

[[File:Hangline Wood Finish.jpg|thumb|In this hangline approach, wood items being finished are moved through various finishing stages on a conveyor system]]

===Hangline approach===
In the hangline approach, wood items being finished are hung by carriers or hangers that are attached to a [[conveyor system]] that moves the items overhead or above the floor space. The conveyor itself can be ceiling mounted, wall mounted or supported by floor mounts. A simple overhead conveyor system can be designed to move wood products through several wood finishing processes in a continuous loop. The hangline approach to automated wood finishing also allows the option of moving items up to warmer air at the ceiling level to speed up drying process.

[[File:Tow-line Wood Finish.JPG|thumb|In this Towline method, mobile carts move large furniture through various finishing stages on a conveyor system.]]

===Towline approach===
The towline approach to automating wood finishing uses mobile carts that are propelled by conveyors mounted in or on the floor. This approach is useful for moving large, awkward shaped wood products that are difficult or impossible to lift or hang overhead, such as four-legged wood furniture.  The mobile carts used in the towline approach can be designed with top platens that rotate either manually or automatically. The rotating top platens allow the operator to have easy access to all sides of the wood item throughout the various wood finishing processes such as sanding, painting and sealing.

{{Crystallization}}
'''Zone melting''' (or '''zone refining''' or '''floating zone process''' or '''travelling melting zone''') is a group of similar methods of purifying crystals, in which a narrow region of a crystal is melted, and this molten zone is moved along the crystal. The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it as it moves through the ingot. The impurities concentrate in the melt, and are moved to one end of the ingot.  Zone refining was invented by [[John Desmond Bernal]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q4XIEatYlQEC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=Zone+Refining+Kapitza&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D39HGA2JA8&amp;sig=snB30WvCddQviHJGjTgg7WQHENU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_0PWer7PQAhXFVxoKHXQsBAMQ6AEIJDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Zone%20Refining%20Kapitza&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed by [[William Gardner Pfann]] in [[Bell Labs]] as a method to prepare high purity materials, mainly [[semiconductors]], for manufacturing [[transistor]]s. Its early use was on [[germanium]] for this purpose, but it can be extended to virtually any [[Solution|solute]]-[[solvent]] system having an appreciable concentration difference between solid and liquid phases at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/elmat_en/kap_6/advanced/t6_1_3.html Float Zone Crystal Growth]&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is also known as the float zone process, particularly in semiconductor materials processing.

==Process details==

The principle is that the segregation coefficient ''k'' (the ratio of an impurity in the solid phase to that in the liquid phase) is usually less than one. Therefore, at the solid/liquid boundary, the impurity atoms will diffuse to the liquid region. Thus, by passing a crystal [[boule (crystal)|boule]] through a thin section of furnace very slowly, such that only a small region of the boule is molten at any time, the impurities will be segregated at the end of the crystal. Because of the lack of impurities in the leftover regions which solidify, the boule can grow as a perfect single crystal if a [[seed crystal]] is placed at the base to initiate a chosen direction of crystal growth. When high purity is required, such as in semiconductor industry, the impure end of the boule is cut off, and the refining is repeated.

In zone refining, solutes are segregated at one end of the ingot in order to purify the remainder, or to concentrate the impurities. In '''zone leveling''', the objective is to distribute solute evenly throughout the purified material, which may be sought in the form of a single [[crystal]]. For example, in the preparation of a transistor or [[diode]] [[semiconductor]], an ingot of germanium is first purified by zone refining. Then a small amount of [[antimony]] is placed in the molten zone, which is passed through the pure germanium. With the proper choice of rate of heating and other variables, the antimony can be spread evenly through the germanium. This technique is also used for the preparation of [[silicon]] for use in [[computer chip]]s.

===Heaters===

A variety of heaters can be used for zone melting, with their most important characteristic being the ability to form short molten zones that move slowly and uniformly through the ingot. [[Induction coil]]s, ring-wound [[resistance heater]]s, or gas flames are common methods. Another method is to pass an [[electric current]] directly through the ingot while it is in a [[magnetic field]], with the resulting [[magnetomotive force]] carefully set to be just equal to the weight in order to hold the liquid suspended. Optical heaters using high powered [[Halogen lamp|halogen]] or [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon]] lamps are used extensively in research facilities particularly for the production of insulators, but their use in industry is limited by the relatively low power of the lamps, which limits the size of crystals produced by this method. Zone melting can be done as a [[Batch production|batch process]], or it can be done continuously, with fresh impure material being continually added at one end and purer material being removed from the other, with impure zone melt being removed at whatever rate is dictated by the impurity of the feed stock.

''Indirect-heating floating zone'' methods use an induction-heated tungsten ring to heat the ingot radiatively, and are useful when the ingot is of a high-resistivity semiconductor on which classical induction heating is ineffective.

===Mathematical expression of impurity concentration===

When the liquid zone moves by a distance &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt;, the number of impurities in the liquid change.  Impurities are incorporated in the melting liquid and freezing solid.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Plummer, Michael D. Deal, and Peter B. Griffin, Silicon VLSI Technology, Prentice Hall, 2000, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_O&lt;/math&gt;: Segregation coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;: Zone length
:&lt;math&gt;C_O&lt;/math&gt;: Initial uniform impurity concentration of the rod
:&lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt;: Concentration of impurities in the liquid
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;: Number of impurities in the liquid
:&lt;math&gt;I_O&lt;/math&gt;: Number of impurities in zone when first formed at bottom

The number of impurities in the liquid changes in accordance with the expression below during the movement &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; of the molten zone

:&lt;math&gt;dI = (C_O - k_O C_L) \, dx\;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_L = I/L\;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^x dx = \int_{I_O}^I \frac{dI}{C_O - \frac{k_O I}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_O = C_O L\;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_S = k_O I / L\;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_S (x) = C_O \left ( 1 - (1 - k_O) e^{- \frac{k_O x}{L} } \right )&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===Solar cells===

In [[solar cells]] float zone processing is particularly useful because the single crystal silicon grown has desirable properties.  The bulk charge [[carrier lifetime]] in [[float-zone silicon]] is the highest among various manufacturing processes.  Float-zone carrier lifetimes are around 1000 microseconds compared to 20-200 microseconds with [[Czochralski process]], and 1–30 microseconds with cast [[multi-crystalline silicon]].  A longer bulk lifetime increases the efficiency of [[solar cells]] significantly.

==Related processes==

===Zone remelting===

Another related process is '''zone remelting''', in which two solutes are distributed through a pure metal. This is important in the manufacture of semiconductors, where two solutes of opposite conductivity type are used. For example, in germanium, pentavalent elements of [[group V]] such as [[antimony]] and [[arsenic]] produce negative (n-type) conduction and the trivalent elements of [[Boron group|group III]] such as [[aluminum]] and [[boron]] produce positive (p-type) conduction. By melting a portion of such an ingot and slowly refreezing it, solutes in the molten region become distributed to form the desired n-p and p-n junctions.
