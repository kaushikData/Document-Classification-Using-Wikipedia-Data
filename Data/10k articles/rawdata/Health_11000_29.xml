The '''15th Medical Battalion''' is a former [[battalion]] of the [[United States Army]].

==Organization==
The '''15th Medical Battalion''' was a [[non-combatant|non-combat]] [[battalion]] of the [[United States Army]] [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Medical Department]], originally formed on 23 March 1925 as the 1st Medical Squadron and redesignated as the 15th Medical Battalion on 25 March 1949.  On 1 October 1984, the 15th Medical Battalion was redesignated the 2nd Forward Support Battalion.  Two of the medical companies were reassigned and a Quartermaster company from the [[115th Brigade Support Battalion|15th Supply &amp; Transportation Battalion]] became the new Company A, while Company B came from the 27th Maintenance Battalion.  On 15 May 1987, the Battalion became the 15th Support Battalion (Forward).  The Battalion has been assigned to the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] since it was formed.

==Service==
The unit saw service during the [[Second World War]], the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), the [[Bosnian War]] (as part of rotation [[Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina|SFOR]] 5), the war in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] (Operation Iraqi Freedom), [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the war in Afghanistan [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|(Operation Enduring Freedom)]].  It is currently designated the 15th Brigade Support Battalion, providing logistics support to the [[2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division (United States)|2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;1st Air Cavalry Division: Memoirs of the First Team, Vietnam, August 1965-December 1969, [[Turner Publishing Company]], 1995, {{ISBN|1563111802}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5-SPICE framework was developed by clinicians and researchers from [[Partners In Health]], [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]] in Boston, MA.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palazuelos|first=Daniel|author2=Kyla Ellis |author3=Dana DeEun Im |author4=Matthew Peckarsky |author5=Daniel Schwartz|title=5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting|journal=Global Health Action|date=April 3, 2013|volume=6|doi=10.3402/gha.v6i0.19658|pmid=23561023|pmc=3617878|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework lays out a model for integrating community health workers into public health systems, learning from the experiences Partners In Health and partner organizations at their project sites in resource-poor settings around the world.&lt;ref name="pih"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Workers|url=http://www.pih.org/priority-programs/community-health-workers/about|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE draws upon experiences from Haiti, Rwanda, Lesotho, Liberia, Nepal, Mali, and elsewhere, where CHWs have been employed to improve patient outcomes and overcome personnel shortages.&lt;ref name="pih_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work|url=http://www.pih.org/our-work|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of CHWs.

==Background==
5-SPICE allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of community health workers.

The name 5-SPICE is derived from Chinese cuisine emphasizing the balance between inputs and elements. The five main elements form an acronym:
*Supervision (especially management plans and structures)
*Partners (especially ownership and stewardship)
*Incentives (part of the larger theme of motivation)
*Choice (how CHWs are recruited to work and why they take the job)
*Education (what CHWs bring to their job and how they are trained) &lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

These elements are not a static list, but a way to holistically analyze how core programmatic elements affect each other in the field. In the [[Freire, Paulo|Freirean]] tradition of awareness, the 5-SPICE model emphasizes facilitated discussion and contemplation among stakeholders, particularly CHWs, to maximize program outputs. Ultimately, the 5-SPICE framework allows program implementers to study the relationship between the health system and the local community.

Other CHW program frameworks exist, such as the CHW Assessment and Improvement Matrix (AIM) developed by the USAID-funded Health Care Improvement (HCI) project.&lt;ref name="hciproject"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Worker Assessment and Improvement Matrix (CHW AIM): A Toolkit for Improving CHW Programs and Services|url=http://www.hciproject.org/node/2359|publisher=USAID|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE complements these other frameworks by providing an acronym that condenses the many elements discussed in other frameworks into an easy-to-remember heuristic, allowing for more effective and efficient assessments that are exploratory rather than prescriptive.

==Scholarly Dissemination==

The 5-SPICE framework was first formally introduced in an April 2013 publication in [[Global Health Action]], in an article entitled “5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting.”&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;  The framework was subsequently presented at the 2013 Consortium of Universities for Global Health Conference,&lt;ref name=CUGH&gt;{{cite web|title=5-SPICE: An Original Framework for Community Health Worker Program Design, Quality Improvement and Research Agenda Setting|url=http://cugh.conferencespot.org/APP_TECH.34/APP_TECH.34/1|publisher=Consortium of Universities for Global Health|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the 2013 Swedish Society of Medicine’s annual conference, Global Health—Beyond 2015.&lt;ref name=Sweden&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond 2015|url=http://www.sls.se/GlobalHealth/Om-konferensen/Editorial/|publisher=Swedish Medical Society|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article has also been accepted for presentation at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the  [[American Public Health Association]].&lt;ref name=APHA&gt;{{cite web|title=A unique non-linear chw program framework for quality improvement|url=https://apha.confex.com/apha/141am/webprogram/Paper284734.html|publisher=APHA|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''After the Sirens''''' is a 2018 Canadian documentary television program about the epidemic of [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] among [[paramedics]]. It consists of interviews with emergency medical workers and mental health experts as well as dramatic recreations of emergency calls experienced by the interview subjects. It was directed by Kevin Eastwood, and produced and commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] for the ''Docs POV'' television program.

==Summary==

The documentary recounts the stories of three paramedics who suffered [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] incidents during the course of their careers and subsequently developed symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], including [[severe depression]] and [[substance abuse]]. Experts cite statistics and research showing paramedics to be at particular risk for PTSD and [[suicide]], and discuss the bureaucratic roadblocks faced by paramedics who attempt to seek treatment. 

The documentary is structured to highlight similarities in the paramedics’ stories, from their initial idealism and hope about their careers, through the traumatic incidents that stood out from the normal pressures of their profession, the periods of depression and [[self-medication]] with alcohol and/or drugs, [[suicidal ideation]] or [[suicide attempts]], to their struggles with recovery.

==Featured individuals==
* Clive Derbyshire is a paramedic based in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. He works in [[Downtown Eastside]], a Neighbourhood whose residents have a disproportionately high rate of [[homelessness]], mental health problems, and [[addictions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Mental Health &amp; Addiction Program |url=http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/library/publications/year/2013/improving-severe-addiction-and-mental-illness-services.pdf |publisher=Vancouver Coastal Health |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes his PTSD derives from his experience responding to a motor vehicle accident incident in which a close friend died.
* Natalie Harris is a retired paramedic from [[Barrie, Ontario]], who cites treating, and later encountering in court, [https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/01/15/man-guilty-of-murdering-two-women-in-barrie-in-satanic-suicide-pact.html multiple-murderer Mark Dobson] as the source of her PTSD, which sparked addictions to alcohol and prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Myers |first1=Bryan |title=Simcoe County paramedic Natalie Harris featured in PTSD doc |url=https://www.simcoe.com/news-story/8370448-simcoe-county-paramedic-natalie-harris-featured-in-ptsd-doc/ |publisher=Barrie Advance |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Don Devine was among the first Canadians to train as a paramedic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ladouceur |first1=Dan |title=History of Paramedicine |url=https://www.ottawaparamedics.ca/before-9-1-1/history-of-paramedicine |publisher=Professional Paramedic Association of Ottawa |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s. He worked in the [[Vernon, British Columbia]] region and in 1996 responded to the scene of the massacre of the Ghakal family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Handschuh |first1=Darren |title=A heavy price to pay |url=https://www.castanet.net/news/Vernon/223039/A-heavy-price-to-pay |publisher=Castanet |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after which he too developed symptoms of PTSD. 
* Cheryl Drewitz-Cheney is a former nurse and the author of the study “Posttraumatic Stress Disorder among Paramedics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drewitz-Chesney |first1=Cheryl |title=Posttraumatic Stress Disorder among Paramedics |journal=Workplace Health &amp; Safety |date=1 June 2012 |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=257–63 |doi=10.1177/216507991206000605|pmid=22624848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;”. She has studied the statistically high incidents of addiction, suicide, PTSD, and related conditions in first responders.
* Vince Savoia is a former [[Dispatcher|emergency dispatcher]] and the founder and executive director of the Tema Conter Memorial Trust, an Ontario-based support group for sufferers of PTSD in the first-responder and military communities. He discusses the culture of the paramedic profession and the challenges faced by some first responders who seek treatment.

==Production==
Director Kevin Eastwood initially met Derbyshire during the filming of [[Knowledge Network]]’s factual series [[Emergency Room: Life + Death at VGH]]. In an interview with a Vancouver Sun reporter, Eastwood said "I didn’t know him well, but I knew him by face and we had been friendly in the emergency room. I had always seen him as being this charismatic, attractive, really good at his job, really confident, good paramedic. To learn what he was actually struggling with on the inside, well, I had no idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gee |first1=Dana |title=New CBC Docs POV looks at what's ailing those who are helping |url=https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/local-arts/new-cbc-docs-pov-looks-at-whats-ailing-those-who-are-helping |publisher=Vancouver Sun |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The documentary aired on CBC Television on April 8, 2018 in some provinces. It was pre-empted in some provinces by the broadcast of the [[Humboldt Broncos bus crash|Humbolt Broncos vigil]]. CBC aired the program in the rest of Canada on April 9. 

==Further developments==
Three days after the initial broadcast, the [[BC NDP|NDP Government]] announced Bill 9 – 2018: Workers Compensation Amendment Act, which included changes to [[WorkSafeBC|Worksafe]] regulations. Prior to this change, BC first-responders who developed PTSD were required to prove to Worksafe BC that their condition was related to their work, otherwise they could not receive the benefits associated with work-related injuries. If the legislation is approved, the [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] would not fall upon the first-responders themselves, making it easier for PTSD sufferers to access benefits and treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kerr |first1=Jessica |title=New legislation tackles mental health of first responders |url=https://www.vancourier.com/news/new-legislation-tackles-mental-health-of-first-responders-1.23263633 |publisher=Vancouver Courier |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Weaver|BC MLA Andrew Weaver]] summarized the change: "This bill updates the Workers Compensation Act for eligible occupations (correction officer, an emergency medical assistant, a firefighter, a police officer, a sheriff or other as prescribed by regulation) who are exposed to one or more traumatic events over the course of their employment and are subsequently diagnosed with a mental disorder. The disorder will be presumed to have been caused by the nature of their work rather than having to prove that it was work-related. British Columbia is one of the last such jurisdictions in Canada to have such legislation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weaver |first1=Andrew |title=Bill 9: The Workers Compensation Amendment Act, 2018 |url=http://www.andrewweavermla.ca/2018/04/16/bill-9-workers-compensation-amendment-act-2018/ |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1611">'''Apparent infection rate''' is an estimate of the rate of progress of a disease, based on proportional measures of the extent of infection at different times.

Firstly, a proportional measure of the extent of infection is chosen as the disease extent metric. For example, the metric might be the proportion of leaf area affected by mildew, or the proportion of plants in a population showing dieback lesions. Measures of disease extent are then taken over time, and a [[mathematical model]] is fit. The model is based upon two assumptions:
* the progress of the infection is constrained by the amount of tissue that remains to be infected; and
* if it were not so constrained, the extent of infection would exhibit [[exponential growth]].

There is a single model parameter&amp;nbsp;''r'', which is the apparent infection rate. It can be calculated analytically using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{t_2-t_1} \log_e \left [ \frac{x_2 (1-x_1)}{x_1 (1-x_2)} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Aursunden''' or '''Aursund''' is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Røros]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]].  The village of [[Brekken]] lies along the eastern shore and the village of [[Glåmos]] lies along the western shore.

There are several inflows to the {{convert|46|km2|adj=on}} lake including the lakes [[Rien (Norway)|Rien]], [[Riasten]], and [[Bolagen]].  The outflow is regulated by a [[hydropower]] [[dam]] through which water passes into the river [[Glomma]].  The lake is about {{convert|22|km}} long and about {{convert|5|km}} wide.  The deepest part of the lake reaches a depth of {{convert|52|m}}.

Aursunden is often cited as the source of the river [[Glomma]], the longest and largest river in [[Norway]].  The actual headwaters are near Aursunden near the start of the [[Glommadal]] valley.  The locals claim that the headwater of the Glomma river is Mustjønna, a tiny lake about {{convert|30|km}} north of Aursunden.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Aursunden|title=Aursunden|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6895">The '''Bioinformatics Resource Centers''' ('''BRCs''') are a group of five [[Internet|Internet-based]] [[research centers]] established in 2004 and funded by NIAID (the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]].) &lt;ref name="Overview, Bioinformatics Resource Centers"&gt;[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/brc/overview.htm Overview, Bioinformatics Resource Centers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515231930/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/brc/overview.htm |date=May 15, 2008 }}, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The BRCs were formed in response to the threats posed by emerging and re-emerging [[pathogen]]s, particularly [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) Category A, B, and C pathogens,&lt;ref name="CDC Bioterrorism Agents"&gt;[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp CDC Bioterrorism Agents and Diseases (By Category)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722181901/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp |date=2014-07-22 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Department of Health and Human Services), accessed July 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and their potential use in [[bioterrorism]]. The intention of NIAID in funding these [[bioinformatics]] centers is to assist researchers involved in the experimental characterization of such pathogens and the formation of [[drugs]], [[vaccines]], or diagnostic tools to combat them.

The main goals of the BRCs are as follows:

1)	To create comprehensive [[databases]] of reliable, up-to-date bioinformatic data ([[genetics|genetic]], [[proteomic]], [[biochemical]], or [[microbiological]]) related to the pathogens of interest; &lt;br&gt;
2)	To provide researchers with easy access to this data through Internet-based search and data retrieval [[user interfaces]]; &lt;br&gt;
3)	To provide researchers with relevant, state-of-the art [[computational biology|computational tools]] for bioinformatic analysis of these data.

The five BRCs are supported by various institutions, both publicly and privately owned, throughout the USA and Canada. Each BRC focuses on a different group of pathogens. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110105165721/http://pathogenportal.org/ Pathogen Portal] serves as a common repository and provides summary information about and links into the BRCs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5695">The '''Black Report''' was a 1980 document published by the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] (now the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]]) in the [[United Kingdom]], which was the report of the expert committee into [[health inequality]] chaired by [[Douglas Black (physician)|Sir Douglas Black]]. It was demonstrated that although overall health had improved since the introduction of the [[welfare state]], there were widespread [[health inequalities]]. It also found that the main cause of these inequalities was economic inequality. The report showed that the death rate for men in social class V was twice that for men in social class I and that gap between the two was increasing, not reducing as was expected. 
==Commissioning==
The Black report was commissioned in March 1977 by [[David Ennals, Baron Ennals|David Ennals]], Labour Secretary of State, following publication of a two-page article by [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] in [[New Society]], on 16 December 1976, entitled ''[http://www.sochealth.co.uk/public-health-and-wellbeing/poverty-and-inequality/the-black-report-1980/the-origin-of-the-black-report/dear-david-ennals/ Dear David Ennals].'' The report was nearly ready for publication in early 1979.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|General Election on 3 May 1979]], the Conservatives were elected.  The Black Report was not issued until 1980 by the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservative Government]].  The Black report was published on August Bank Holiday with only 260 copies made available on the day for the media.  The foreword, by [[Patrick Jenkin]] rejected "the view that the causes of health inequalities are so deep rooted that only a major and wide-ranging programme of public expenditure is capable of altering the pattern."  He made "it clear that additional expenditure on the scale which could result from the report’s recommendations – the amount involved could be upwards of £2 billion a year – is quite unrealistic in present or any foreseeable economic circumstances, quite apart from any judgement that may be formed of the effectiveness of such expenditure in dealing with the problems identified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inequalities in Health|date=August 1980|publisher=DHSS|location=London|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/public-health-and-wellbeing/poverty-and-inequality/the-black-report-1980/black-report-foreword/|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report had a huge impact on political thought in the United Kingdom and overseas. It led to an assessment by the Office for Economic Co-Operation and Development and the World Health Organization of health inequalities in 13 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7365/661.1 BMJ Obituary of Sir Douglas Black:"Sir Douglas Black: Professor of medicine whose famous report on inequality and health fell foul of the Thatcher government".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Professor Clare Bambra in 2016 compared the report with the later [[Acheson Report]] and the subsequent report by [[Michael Marmot]]. The Acheson report was released into a more favourable climate than either. She said that at least between 1997 and 2003, health policy across the UK reflected some of the ideas set out in the Black and Acheson Reports.  There was a consistent emphasis on the need to tackle the social and economic determinants of health inequalities as well as a commitment to employing cross-cutting government policies to tackle health inequality. Most importantly, by 2004, national targets to reduce health inequalities were also introduced with a focus on life expectancy and Infant Mortality Rate.  A series of initiatives were introduced - [[Health Action Zone]]s, Healthy Living Centres, Health Improvement Programmes and the [[New Deal for Communities]]. But, perhaps because of these initiatives, from 2004 to 2007, public health policy moved away from social and economic determinants and instead focused more on health services and lifestyle behaviours.  The health inequalities targets were abandoned across the UK in 2011.  The effect of policy in reducing health inequality was modest. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bambra|first1=Clare|title=Health Divides|date=2016|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447330356|pages=192-7|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/2016/12/30/health-divides-live-can-kill/|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related publications ==
[[Penguin Books]] published a shortened version of the Black Report in 1982, making it widely available &lt;ref&gt;''Inequalities in Health: Black Report'' Pelican Series, Penguin Books, 1982. {{ISBN|0-14-022420-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Whitehall Report]] published in 1987 came to the same conclusions as the Black report, as did the [[Acheson Report]] later in 1998, and the [[Marmot Review]]&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17390">The '''''Callanetics''''' exercise programme was created by [[Callan Pinckney]] in the early 1980s.  It is a system of exercise involving frequent repetition of small muscular movements and squeezes, designed to improve [[muscle tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/Callanetics|title=Callanetics definition - English definition dictionary - Reverso|website=dictionary.reverso.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was developed by Pinckney from classical ballet exercises, to help ease a back problem that she was born with.

The theory of callanetics is that the surface muscles of the body are supported by deeper muscles, but popular exercise programmes often exercise only the surface muscles.  According to callanetics, deeper muscles are best exercised using small but precise movements.  Exercising the deeper muscles also leads to improved posture, which may result in the appearance of weight loss even if very little weight was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Book: Callanetics, by Callan Pinckney and Sallie Batson, 1984, inside page&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinckney also recommends exercising with clothing that highlights (not flatters) the body's natural shape, and exercising in bright light, to show up the body's imperfections to the exerciser.

'''Cellulite''' (also known as '''adiposis edematosa''', '''dermopanniculosis deformans''', '''status protrusus cutis''', '''gynoid lipodystrophy''', and '''orange peel syndrome''') is the [[hernia]]tion of subcutaneous [[adipose tissue|fat]] within fibrous [[connective tissue]] that manifests topographically as [[human skin|skin]] dimpling and nodularity, often on the [[pelvic]] region (specifically the [[buttocks]]), [[human leg|lower limbs]], and [[abdomen]].&lt;ref name =Rossi&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1468-3083.2000.00016.x |pmid=11204512 |title=Cellulite: A review |journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=251–62 |year=2000 |last1=Rossi |first1=Ana Beatris R |last2=Vergnanini |first2=Andre Luiz }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pinna |first1=K. |year=2007 |title=Nutrition and diet therapy |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulite occurs in most postpubescent [[females]].&lt;ref name="pmid16020201"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14764170410003057 |pmid=16020201 |title=Cellulite: A review of its physiology and treatment |journal=Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=181–5 |year=2004 |last1=Avram |first1=Mathew M }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review gives a prevalence of 85 to 98% of women,&lt;ref name="pmid_25518090"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25518090| year = 2014| author1 = Janda| first1 = K| title = Cellulite - causes, prevention, treatment| journal = Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis| volume = 60| issue = 1| pages = 29–38| last2 = Tomikowska| first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that it is physiologic rather than pathologic.

===Hormonal factors===
Hormones play a dominant role in the formation of cellulite. [[Estrogen]] may be the important hormone in the development of cellulite. However, there has been no reliable clinical evidence to support such a claim. Other hormones, including [[insulin]], the [[catecholamines]] [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]], [[thyroid hormone]]s, and [[prolactin]], are all believed to participate in the development of cellulite.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;

===Genetic factors===
There is a genetic element in individual susceptibility to cellulite.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt; Researchers led by [[Enzo Emanuele]] have traced the genetic component of cellulite to particular [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|polymorphisms]] in the [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] ([[angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]]) and [[HIF1A|hypoxia-inducible factor 1A]] ([[HIF1A|HIF1a]]) genes.&lt;ref name="doi 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2009.03556.x" /&gt;

===Predisposing factors===
Several factors have been shown to affect the development of cellulite. [[Sex]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], biotype, distribution of subcutaneous fat, and [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to lymphatic and circulatory insufficiency have all been shown to contribute to cellulite.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;

===Lifestyle===
A high-[[Stress (medicine)|stress]] lifestyle will cause an increase in the level of [[catecholamines]], which have also been associated with the development of cellulite.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;

== Treatments ==
Cellulite is a multifactorial condition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.det.2013.09.005 |pmid=24267421 |title=A Modern Approach to the Treatment of Cellulite |journal=Dermatologic Clinics |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=51–9 |year=2014 |last1=Rossi |first1=Anthony M. |last2=Katz |first2=Bruce E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be resistant to the array of treatments currently available. Aside from 'topical' products (creams, ointments, etc) and injectables (eg collagenase), treatments for cellulite include [[Minimally_invasive_procedures#Non-invasive_procedure|non-invasive therapy]] such as mechanical suction or mechanical massage. Energy-based devices include [[radio frequency]] with deep penetration of the skin, ultrasound, &lt;ref name="pmid29846343"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Juhász M, Korta D, Mesinkovska NA| title=A Review of the Use of Ultrasound for Skin Tightening, Body Contouring, and Cellulite Reduction in Dermatology. | journal=Dermatol Surg | year= 2018 | volume= 44 | issue= 7 | pages= 949-963 | pmid=29846343 | doi=10.1097/DSS.0000000000001551 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=29846343  }} &lt;/ref&gt; laser and pulsed-light devices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28123311" /&gt; Combinations of mechanical treatments and energy-based procedures are widely used.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1610-0387.2012.07950.x |pmid=22726640 |title=Cellulite – an overview of non-invasive therapy with energy-based systems |journal=JDDG |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=553–8 |year=2012 |last1=Gold |first1=Michael H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; More invasive 'subcision' techniques utilise a needle-sized micro-scalpel to cut through the causative fibrous bands of connective tissue.

'''Community health clubs (CHCs)''' also known as '''community hygiene clubs''' are voluntary community-based organizations in Africa dedicated to improving [[public health]] through the promotion of [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Africa AHEAD {{!}} Applied Health Education &amp; Development|url = http://africaahead.com/|website = africaahead.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHCs are formed at the village level. The concept was developed and popularized by [[Africa AHEAD]], a [[Zimbabwe]] [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]].&lt;!-- The [[WP:LEAD]] should provide a three to four paragraph summary or overview in basic language. The lead should contain only one image. --&gt;

== History ==
The idea of CHCs originated in Kenya, where Juliet Waterkeyn developed illustrations for training materials to be used for the Kenya Water for Health Organisation (KWAHO). She observed the living conditions and habits of rural Kenyan communities. She claimed that a lack of ownership was the cause for slow community development. The concept of CHC was developed to gather communities and communally discuss hygiene to improve the health of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africaahead.com/about-us/vision/|title=VISION {{!}} Africa AHEAD|website=africaahead.com|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Operation ==
Community Health Workers (CHW) and Environmental Health Technicians (EHT) often help run the clubs. They receive one week of training; they are given the training materials and taught how to use them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waterkeyn, Cairncross|first=Juliet, Sandy|date=31 May 2005|title=Creating demand for sanitation and hygiene through Community Health Clubs: A cost-effective intervention in two districts in Zimbabwe|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953605001759|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=61|issue=9|pages=1958|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.04.012|pmid=|access-date=1 Jul 2005|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two types of CHCs are Classic and Lite. The difference is the length of the training of the CHWs and the number of dialogue sessions that they are trained to offer.

CHCs attract an average of 75 members, which includes an elected six member committee, a chairperson, a secretary and a Community Health Worker (CHW) facilitator. The facilitator is responsible for leading dialogue sessions and motivating club members to adopt better hygiene.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaahead.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2014..Africa-AHEAD-Strategic-Plan.pdf|format=PDF|title=Strategic Plan|website=Africaahead.org|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic CHCs have a training session of 6 months where the club meets weekly to discuss one of the 20 - 24 dialogue sessions on health and hygiene. Lite CHCs have a training period of 3 months and discuss a total of 8 dialogue sessions concentrating only on WASH topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaahead.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2014-15-Annual-Report-final.pdf|format=PDF|title=Africa Ahead : Annual Report June 2014 — March 2015|website=Africaahead.org|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=WASH?|date=May 2018}}

After each session, members are given homework and are encouraged to complete it before the next session. Each member is given a membership card when they join the club, and the CHW is responsible for signing off the dialogue sessions attended by each member.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A certificate of completion is awarded to club members that complete all dialogue sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africaahead.com/|title=Africa AHEAD|last=|first=|date=|website=Africaahead.com|publisher=|access-date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The four main CHC stages:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Health Promotion ===
Members meet weekly for a two-hour session. During these sessions cards are used to engage members in discussions and debates on topics promoting health and hygiene. Various participatory activities take place that entertain and encourage members to get involved in the decision-making process on improving daily hygiene habits. Members are encouraged to make small changes in their own homes each week. These recommended practices rarely require financial expenditure and are solely habit changing &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  

=== Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation ===
Once club members begin to understand the transmission of germs. When a majority of the members become convinced, peer pressure makes sanitation a priority and club members help each other meet their new hygiene standards. Latrines and wells are dug, hand washing facilities are built without outside funds. The maintenance of water facilities is the responsibility of the CHC committee. At the end of this stage, high-risk habits have been replaced by safe hygiene practices and basic safe water and sanitation facilities are available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Food Agriculture and Nutrition (FAN) ===
Members focus on child survival and a balanced diet. Communal nutrition gardens are started by CHC members where produce is organised to maintain a balanced year-round diet. These gardens help to support vulnerable families.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

=== Empowerment of Women ===
CHC meetings can result in the construction of a permanent meeting shelter, which can be used for [[Child care|day care]] for toddlers. Other clubs start income generating projects such as soap making, whilst others create saving and loan schemes to enable members to buy products needed to maintain hygiene standards. As most CHCs have more female members,{{Cn|date=May 2018}} the clubs end up becoming a safety net for mothers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Computerized neuropsychological assessment''' helps [[neuropsychologist]]s and [[psychologists]] to assess functions relative to possible brain damage using a [[software]].
For more information about the tests, see [[Neuropsychological tests]].

==Available packages==

Currently there are some commercial packages available for buying. Once bought, they can be installed at a clinic and be used to assess patients.

==Computerized versus traditional tests==

There are some discussions on the effectiveness of computerized tests.
The detriments in using computerized versions are discussed in an article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VDJ-4MBC51B-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d8698c1166083f509ab3529b72b031c0 | title=Sources of error in computerized neuropsychological assessment | accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computerized tests have the following main benefits:

===Speed===
Results are obtained as soon as the tests are finished – no need to consult tables or other informations.

===Security===
Every rule is programmed in the software, so there will be no errors during the execution or getting the results.

==Hemispheric Asymmetry==

To assess different hemispheric functions, some packages offer verbal and non verbal tests. These tests are applied according to [[Neuropsychological tests]].

==Development at Universities==

By having clinical applications, some universities develop their own packages, like [[University of Cambridge]] (CANTAB - Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery {{ref|cantab}}) and [[Universidade Federal de São Paulo]] (NAFW - Neuropsychological Assessment Framework {{ref|nafw}}, LAACS - Lateralized Attention Assessment Computerized System {{ref|laacs}} and ThoughtFlow-Sys {{ref|unifesp-dis}}).

'''Consumer-driven healthcare''' ('''CDHC'''), defined narrowly, refers to third-tier [[health insurance]] plans that allow members to use [[health savings account]]s (HSAs), [[Health Reimbursement Account]]s (HRAs), or similar medical payment products to pay routine healthcare expenses directly, but a [[high-deductible health plan]] protects them from catastrophic medical expenses. High-deductible policies cost less, but the user pays medical claims using a prefunded spending account, often with a special debit card provided by a bank or insurance plan.

If the balance on this account runs out, the user pays claims just like under a regular deductible. Users keep any unused balance or "rollover" at the end of the year to increase future balances or to invest for future expenses. CDHC plans are subject to the provisions of the [[Affordable Care Act]], which mandates that routine or health maintenance claims must be covered, with no cost-sharing (copays, co-insurance, or deductibles) to the patient.

This system is referred to as "consumer-driven healthcare" because claims are paid using a consumer-controlled account versus a fixed health insurance benefit. That gives patients greater control over their own health budgets. According to economist [[John C. Goodman]], "In the consumer-driven model, consumers occupy the primary decision-making role regarding the healthcare they receive."

Goodman points to a McKinsey study which found that CDHC patients were twice as likely as patients in traditional plans to ask about cost and three times as likely to choose a less expensive treatment option, and chronic patients were 20% more likely to follow treatment regimes carefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Goodman| first=John C.| year=2006| title=Consumer Driven Health Care | periodical=Networks Financial Institute Policy Brief, Indiana State University | ssrn=985572| doi=10.2139/ssrn.985572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer-driven healthcare received a boost in 2003, with passage of federal legislation providing tax incentives to those who choose such plans. Proponents argue that most Americans will pay less in the long haul under CDHC not only because their monthly premiums will be lower but also because the use of HSAs and similar products increases free-market variables in the healthcare system, fostering competition, which, in turn, lowers prices and stimulates improvements in service.

Critics argue that it will cause consumers, particularly those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare because of the cost burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," said [[Jonathan Oberlander]]. It is "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people will never be able to save anything in their savings accounts. "Employers like it because they're going to save money," but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. If you move to high-deductible plans, people will think twice. If I have a sore throat, instead of going to my physician, I'll have a cup of tea instead." &lt;ref&gt;Fresh Air from WHYY, July 9, 2007. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11826524 Diagnosing U.S. Health Care — and 'Sicko,' Too]. Terry Gross interviewing Jonathan Oberlander, associate professor, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Consumer-driven healthcare plans had their origin in the U.S. in the late 1990s. It was developed as a business model for health ventures. They were designed to engage consumers more directly in their healthcare purchases. The initial conceptual model made cost and quality information available to the consumer, usually through the Internet.

HSAs are seen by proponents as a way to make healthcare more affordable and accessible in the U.S. The [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], which included provisions designed to stimulate the popularity of these plans, was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in November 2003 and signed into law by President Bush in December 2003. The law expanded medical savings accounts, renaming them Health Savings Accounts and created tax incentives to encourage adoption of high-deductible health plans. Banks were empowered to create HSAs, which deliver tax-free interest to the holders, who can then withdraw money tax free to pay for qualified expenditures. To qualify for an HSA, the purchaser must also have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance plan. Over time, participants are allowed to contribute more (cumulatively) to the savings account than would be required to fulfill their annual [[deductible]] for a given year (although annual limits on pre-tax contributions [other than a 1-time IRA rollover option] are well below the annual deductible), and any unused portions of the account accrue without [[tax]] penalty so long as the funds are used only for qualified medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2010 Publication 969 | publisher = U.S. Department of the Treasury – Internal Revenue Service | date = 2011-01-14 | url = https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf | accessdate = 2011-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further enhancements to HSAs went into effect in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = President Bush Signs Bill to Make Health Care more Affordable, Accessible | publisher = U.S. Department of the Treasury | date = 2006-12-20 | url = http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp209.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of tax breaks for premiums and the health savings account as well as a tax subsidy to pay for the catastrophic [[insurance]] [[Insurance premium|premium]] of lower income individuals has boosted the popularity of these plans. By April 2007, some 4.5 million Americans were enrolled in HSAs; more than a fourth of those were previously uninsured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = 4.5 Million Enrolled in Health Savings Account Plans | publisher = America's Health Insurance Plans | date = 2007-04-02 | url = http://www.ahip.org/content/pressrelease.aspx?docid=19314 | accessdate = 2007-07-10 | quote =The full census is available at http://www.ahipresearch.org.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model of consumer driven healthcare is [[Health Reimbursement Arrangement]]s (HRAs), which are employer-funded, and in which employers receive the tax benefits.

By 2007, an estimated 3.8 million U.S. workers, about 5% of the covered workforce, were enrolled in consumer-driven plans. About 10% of firms offered such plans to their workers, according to a study by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/insurance/7672 Employer Health Benefits 2007 Annual Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915144031/http://www.kff.org/insurance/7672/ |date=2007-09-15 }}, Kaiser Family Foundation, 2007-09-11, accessed 2007-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2008 the Atlanta Business Chronicle reported that enrollment in consumer-driven plans was increasing, accounting for 13% of all plans offered by employers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/08/18/daily22.html "Survey shows consumer-driven health plans growing in popularity,"] Atlanta Business Chronicle, August 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, when major portions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] are implemented in the United States, high deductible plans and the concept of consumer-driven healthcare may become more popular. Although new federal tax subsidies will help reduce health insurance rates for many consumers, individuals and families that do not qualify, are expected to consider Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) if they do not have employer-sponsored coverage.

Other countries with experience in this type of health insurance include [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Africa]].

==Impact==
Researchers at the [[Carlson School of Management]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] (Stephen T. Parente),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehealthplan.org |title=eHealthPlan.org |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]] (Meredith Rosenthal), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (Anthony LoSasso) and [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]] have examined results of these plans. Health insurers, [[Aetna]], [[Wellpoint]], [[Humana]] and [[UnitedHealth Group]] have all provided their own independent analyses as well.

In general, most studies, starting with the RAND study, conclude that increasing the costs (co-payments and deductibles) to the patient reduces the consumption of healthcare, but it reduces the consumption of both appropriate and inappropriate care, and the reduction is greater for low-income patients. For example, [[Joseph Newhouse]], in summarizing the RAND study, reported that visits to doctors and hospitals decline with higher cost sharing, "although for low income families such cutbacks reduced their use of beneficial as well as unnecessary services and was estimated to have increased rates of death from preventable illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newhouse JP |title=Consumer-directed health plans and the RAND Health Insurance Experiment |journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope) |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=107–13 |year=2004 |pmid=15584103 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15584103 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.6.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, proponents counter these findings with studies indicating that CDHCs have broad appeal, provide a new option for the uninsured, and are leading to new incentives for people to be more engaged in managing their health.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} One study found that the levels and trends of use of preventive and screening services by enrollees in consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs) was similar to that of enrollees in [[Preferred provider organization]] (PPO) plans.  The authors concluded that "[p]eople enrolled in CDHPs such as those we studied do not underuse preventive services to any greater degree than do those in traditional PPOs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowe JW, Brown-Stevenson T, Downey RL, Newhouse JP |title=The effect of consumer-directed health plans on the use of preventive and chronic illness services |journal=Health Affairs |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=113–20 |year=2008 |pmid=18180485 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.27.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaiser Family Foundation studied how consumer-driven health plans cover pregnancy. They found wide variations in cost sharing. Pregnant women could face exposure to high out-of-pocket costs under consumer-driven health plans, particularly when complications arise. In one scenario, a complicated pregnancy, with gestational diabetes, pre-term labor, cesarian section and neonatal intensive care, would cost $287,000. Under some consumer-directed health plans, the cost to the family would be $6,000, less than some traditional policies. But under other consumer-directed health plans, the cost to the family would be as high as $21,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/womenshealth/upload/7636ES.pdf Maternity care and consumer-driven health plans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203050/http://www.kff.org/womenshealth/upload/7636ES.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Kaiser Family Foundation, June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information needs and providers==
Key to CDHC's success is ready access of plan users to information about health products, services, and pricing. Critics of CDHC argue that the system will only saddle consumers with more expenses because free-market variables can never exist in healthcare due to lack of [[Transparency (market)|pricing transparency]]. "Despite the theory (as expressed in the Economic Report of the President) that health insurance with higher deductibles will lead to consumers shopping around for health services (based on price and quality), the reality of...inadequate information in the marketplace about health care quality and prices precludes the workability of a 'consumer-choice' type of model," Gail Shearer, director of health policy analysis for Consumers Union, told the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/0225JECTestimonyNoSummary.pdf |title=Testimony of Gail Shearer, Director, Health Policy Analysis, Washington Office, Consumers Union before the Joint Economic Committee, on Impact of "Consumer-Driven" Health Care on Consumers |accessdate=2007-07-10 |format=PDF |work=Consumers Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessie Gruman]], who interviewed 200 patients and families about how they used scientific information after devastating medical diagnoses, said, "I fear that the trend toward consumer-driven healthcare will disproportionately damage the health of the less educated and less wealthy, and that the net effect on the nation's health has already proved negative." She concluded that most patients are unable to make critical decisions about their healthcare in the consumer-driven model. Some people, called "monitors," track down detailed information, while other people, called "blunters," don't want information. One blunter, a theoretical physicist, said he would be "insulted" if someone read 15 papers on theoretical physics and asked him to help design an experiment; he pays his doctor to explain his choices. A "monitor," a lawyer, applied her legal research skills but couldn't think clearly enough to decide. People turn to the Internet, become overwhelmed, or don't understand the significance of the information. "Most health information is bad news," is stressful, and makes decisions even more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cfah.org/pdfs/Promises%20and%20Pitfalls%20in%20Consumer%20Decision%20Making.pdf |title=Promises and Pitfalls in Consumer Decision Making |accessdate=2007-07-10 |format=PDF |work=Keynote Address: Transforming Consumer Decision Making Conference, Park City, Utah, 22 September 2005, by Jessie Gruman, PhD, Executive Director, Center for the Advancement of Health |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129091257/http://www.cfah.org/pdfs/Promises%20and%20Pitfalls%20in%20Consumer%20Decision%20Making.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and vice chairman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, "Accessible information on the quality, price, effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare services and providers is developing rapidly, but is nowhere near the minimum standard assumed by well functioning CDHC. And employers, bound in part by Treasury Department regulations, do not vary deductibles, catastrophic caps or contributions to HSAs and HRAs to workers' family incomes or health status as equitable CDHC would call for....Many things we buy in health care are pieces of larger packages which are undefined when the decisions are made concerning whether to purchase and where to purchase. For example, when one goes to the doctor because of a particular set of symptoms, the doctor ask a number of questions which leads to a series of recommended tests whose results then determine an appropriate treatment regime. One could select the doctor to visit on the basis of price and quality but that is no guarantee that the package of tests and treatments that resulted would be the lowest cost or highest quality....The costs of the really expensive treatments would be largely unaffected."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Consumer Choice: Can It Cure The Nation's Health-Care Ills? |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB113414975523918595.html | work=The Journal Report: Big Issues |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2005-12-13 |accessdate=2007-07-10 | quote= Consumers are increasingly being asked to bear more of the costs and responsibility of their health care, in a growing trend called consumer-driven health care, or CDHC.}} Debate between American Enterprise Institute scholar Joseph Antos, formerly assistant director for health and human resources at the Congressional Budget Office; John C. Goodman, founder and president of the National Center for Policy Analysis; and Robert Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and vice chairman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

But proponents of CDHC, such as former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], have pointed to the rise of the Internet and online comparative shopping health services as one reason they believe the CDHC model is viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://healthtransformation.net/news/cht_articles_and_op_eds/4375.cfm |title = The Last, Best Hope for Healthcare | accessdate=2007-07-10 | author= Newt Gingrich | author-link= Newt Gingrich  | author2= David Merritt| last-author-amp= yes | date=2006-07-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312003625/http://healthtransformation.net/news/cht_articles_and_op_eds/4375.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-12}}Op-ed originally published in the ''Chicago Sun-Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, several technology firms, such as [[Vimo]], [http://healthsouk.com/ HealthSouk] and [http://myhealthdirect.com/ My Health Direct], emerged to take advantage of what they believe will be a new market for comparative health care shopping with the rise of CDHC plans and with the goal of leveraging the Internet to increase price transparency in the health care market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tom |last=Salemi |title=Prognosis Positive: Web Health Ventures |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114850936291862362 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2006-05-25 |accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer satisfaction==
Results of [[consumer satisfaction]] studies regarding consumer-driven health plans have been mixed. While a 2005 survey by the [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association]] found widespread satisfaction among HSA customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsafinder.com/10-05_1.shtml |title=Surveys Indicate Consumers Are Happy With HSA Offerings, But Want Some Changes In Custodial Accounts  |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=HSA Finder.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415053315/http://www.hsafinder.com/10-05_1.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a survey published in 2007 by employee benefits consultants Towers Perrin came to the opposite conclusion; it found that employees currently enrolled in such plans were significantly less satisfied with many elements of the health benefit plan compared to those enrolled in traditional health benefit plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Without the Correct Approach and Implementation, Long-Term Effectiveness of Account-Based Health Plans Could Be Undermined, Towers Perrin Research Shows | publisher = Towers Perrin | date = 2007-05-22 | url = http://www.towersperrin.com/tp/jsp/hrservices_webcache_html.jsp?webc=HR_Services/United_States/Press_Releases/2007/20070522/2007_05_22.htm&amp;selected=press&amp;language_code=global  | accessdate = 2007-07-10 | quote =As compared to traditional health benefit plan participants, ABHP members are less comfortable with the level of financial risk their plan exposes them to, less likely to understand how the plan works, less favorable about how easy it is to use the plan, less favorable about the clarity of communication around benefit change and less satisfied with the basic elements of their plans. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some policy analysts say that patient satisfaction does not reflect quality of healthcare. Researchers at [[RAND Corporation|RAND Corp]]. and the [[Department of Veterans Affairs]] asked 236 elderly patients from 2 managed care plans to rate their care, and then examined care in medical records, as reported in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]''. There was no correlation found. "Patient ratings of healthcare are easy to obtain and report, but do not accurately measure the technical quality of medical care," said John T. Chang, UCLA, the study's lead author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David |last=Wessel |title= In health care, consumer theory falls flat |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115758434624755703 |work=Capital |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2006-09-07 |accessdate=2007-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | author = &lt;!-- staff author, no byline --&gt; | date = May 1, 2016 | title = RAND Study Finds Patients' Ratings of Their Medical Care Do Not Reflect thee Technical Quality of Their Care | url = https://www.rand.org/news/press/2006/05/01.html | publisher = [[RAND Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang JT, Hays RD, Shekelle PG |title=Patients' global ratings of their health care are not associated with the technical quality of their care |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=144 |issue=9 |pages=665–72 | date=May  2006 |pmid=16670136 |url=http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=144&amp;issue=9&amp;page=665 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-144-9-200605020-00010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darko Milinović''' (born 25 April 1963) is a [[Croatia]]n politician and gynecologist who served as [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Croatia)|Minister of Health and Social Welfare]] from 2008 until 2011.

==Biography==

Milinović was born in [[Gospić]]. After graduating from the [[School of Medicine, University of Zagreb|University of Zagreb School of Medicine]] in 1987,&lt;ref name="saborcv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=1038|title=Prošireni životopis Darka Milinovića|publisher=[[Croatian Parliament]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milinović went on to [[Specialty (medicine)|specialise]] [[gynaecology]], passing his specialty exam in 1996.&lt;ref name="saborcv"/&gt; He spent most of his professional career practicing in his home town of Gospić, and from 1998 to 2002 he held the post of the Gospić General Hospital director.

After joining the centre-right [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) in the 1990s he obtained his first political post when he was appointed a member of the Gospić city council in 1998. In 2000 he was made member of the HDZ central committee and from 2000 to 2002 was head of HDZ in the city of Gospić. From 2002 to 2003 he held the office of deputy head of the [[Lika-Senj County]]. Following HDZ's victory in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 parliamentary elections]] Milinović was elected to the [[Croatian Parliament]]. From 2003 to 2008 he held posts of Deputy Speaker of the Parliament and was a member of the parliamentary committee for family affairs, youth and sports.

After HDZ won the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 elections]] Milinović was appointed Minister of Health and Social Welfare in the new cabinet headed by Prime Minister [[Ivo Sanader]] on 12 January 2008, replacing [[Neven Ljubičić]] who had held the post from 2005 to 2008. Following Sanader's abrupt resignation on 1 July 2009, the cabinet was reconstructed and Milinovć retained his post in the new cabinet headed by Sanader's successor, [[Jadranka Kosor]], which was officially announced on 6 July 2009.

'''''Experimental Bacteriology: in Its Applications to the Diagnosis, Epidemiology, and Immunology of Infectious Diseases''''' is a [[textbook]] on [[bacteriology]] and [[infectious diseases]]. It was one of the most authoritative works in [[medical microbiology]] in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz31921.html Hetsch, Heinrich]," in ''[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]]'', 1972, Vol. 9 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Aimed at medical students and practitioners, it has been published in ten/eleven editions in German, and in editions in French and English. The first edition appeared in 1906, written by [[Wilhelm Kolle]] and [[Heinrich Hetsch]], and the book is frequently referred to as "Kolle-Hetsch." The eighth (1938) and ninth (1942) editions were edited by Hetsch and [[Hans Schlossberger]]. The last, significantly revised and largely newly written edition, numbered as a combined tenth and eleventh edition, was published in 1952 by [[Urban &amp; Schwarzenberg]] (now [[Elsevier]]) with Hans Schlossberger as general editor, and with contributions from [[Henning Brandis|H. Brandis]], [[Bernhard Schmidt (microbiologist)|B. Schmidt]], [[Hans Georg Haussmann|H.G. Haussmann]], {{abbr|G. Straulino-v. Holzhausen|Dr. Gertrud Straulino-von Holzhausen (née Baroness von Holzhausen)}}, I. Weimershaus-Eckart, {{abbr|W. Frieber|Dr. Walther Frieber}}, A. Kutzsche and [[Wolfgang Weimershaus|W. Weimershaus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stabikat.de/DB=1/SET=2/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=1 Experimentelle Bakteriologie und Infektionskrankheiten mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Immunitätslehre]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Schlossberger was general editor, much of the editing work was done by Brandis.
 
A French translation appeared in 1910, published by Doin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idref.fr/085696056 IDREF.fr] (bibliography)&lt;/ref&gt; and an English edition was published in 1934 by [[Allen &amp; Unwin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15617">The eye care system in '''[[Ghana]]''' can be said to be one in its infant or growing stages. Today there are less than 300 eye care professionals taking care of the eye needs of over 23 million Ghanaians.
[[File:Guantanamo captive's optometry clinic.jpg|thumb|The general setup of an optometry clinic]]

==History==
Since [[Ghana]]'s independence on March 6, 1957, there has been much work done to promote and improve the eye care needs of Ghanaians. The main groups who are championing this goal now are the Ghana Society of Ophthalmologists, ophthalmic nurses group of ghana and the Ghana Optometric Association.

==Regulatory bodies==

===Ophthalmological Society of Ghana (OSG)===
The Ophthalmological Society of Ghana&lt;ref&gt;[http://osghana.org Ophthalmological Society of Ghana]&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional body of ophthalmologists in Ghana which governs the practice of [[ophthalmology]] in Ghana. At its inauguration in 1992, there were only 15 members including several expatriates. As of 2011, their numerical strength has increased to 50 with not less than 5 expatriates. Their objectives include promoting good eye health in Ghana and maintaining professionalism in their profession as ophthalmologists. Their activities include organizing continuous medical education for their members and collaborating with each other and members of other ophthalmological societies around the world to improve patient care. They are associated with the [[Illinois College of Optometry]], the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]], and the WGA.

===Ghana Optometric Association===
The Ghana Optometric Association (GOA) is the country's governing body for the [[optometry]] profession.&lt;ref name="goa"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ghanaoptometry.org/pages/ |title=Ghana Optometric Association |last=Abaka-Cann |first=J. |accessdate=2017-06-04 |year=2011 |website=ghanaoptometry.org |publisher=ghanaoptometry.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 all optometrists wanting to be members have been required to write a professional exam. Upon successfully passing the exam, the certification required to practice optometry is awarded. The group has about 200 members. In 2010 the Ghana Optometric Association along with the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology's Faculty of Distance Learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/90811/1/knust-inaugurates-faculty-of-distance-learning.html |title=KNUST Inaugurates Faculty of Distance Learning - modernghana.com/regional news |accessdate=2009-10-30 |publisher=Modern Ghana Media Communication Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; rolled out a two-year program to offer all members of GOA who did not have the Doctor of Optometry degree to enroll for it.
===Nurses and midwives council===
The Nurses and midwives council is the statutory body that regulate the activities of ophthalmic nursing practice in Ghana. The ophthalmic nurses group of Ghana is a professional body that serves as the mouth piece of the ophthalmic nurses in Ghana. The group has a membership drive of about 500 nurses spread out across the country. they serve as first point of call in eye care. They also collaborate with other health care professionals in the county to provide eye care service for the teaming populates.

==Services==
The Ministry of Health through its hospitals and health facilities is the main provider of eye care services in the country. Over the years it has taken various initiatives to train more eye care professionals through the various universities, teaching hospitals, nursing schools, training schools, etc. The aim of the Ministry of Health is to ensure that there is at least one functioning eye unit in every district of the country. Despite the current work, much work is still needed to improve access to eyecare in Ghana due to the low number of eye care professionals per 1000 people. Another group that is helping the Ministry of Health is the Christian Health Association of Ghana. Thirty-five percent of Ghana's health service provision is done by the Christian Health Association of Ghana. Most of the facilities that CHAG runs have eye clinics and these aid in service delivery in those towns and villages that are situated in.

The services that eye care professionals offer are varied and include:
* Cataracts surgery
* Glaucoma surgery
* Refraction
* Rehabilitative care

The chart below shows the number of eye care professionals in the various regions and also the progress made to restore sight to people with Cataracts in 2005.&lt;ref name="ghanaeyefoundation.org"&gt;http://ghanaeyefoundation.org/privatecontent/.../Annual%20report%2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western Ghana ===
Despite a population exceeding 2.1 million,&lt;ref&gt;http://.ghanaeyefoundation.org/privatecontent/.../Annual%20report%2005.pdf//&lt;/ref&gt; the eighteen districts in Ghana's Western Region are among the least resourced in terms of eyecare services.&lt;ref name="ghanaeyefoundation.org"/&gt; Professional eye care services are available in four districts, [[Wassa West District|Wassa West]], [[Bibiani/Anhwiaso/Bekwai District|Bibiani/Anhwiaso/Bekwai]], [[Ahanta West District|Ahanta West]] and [[Shama Ahanta East Metropolitan District|Shama Ahanta East Metropolitan]].

In 2005 there were five eye care specialists in the region, comprising two ophthalmologists, two optometrists, one optician and an ophthalmic nurse.&lt;ref name="ghanaeyefoundation.org"/&gt; Specialists operate from the Imperial Eye Care Centre and the SAEMA district hospital in [[Takoradi]], and from the Government Hospitals in [[Tarkwa]] and [[Dixcove]]. Supporting services are provided by the region's 106 general practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://modernghana.com/GhanaHome/regions/western.asp?menu_id=6&amp;menu_id2=14&amp;sub_menu_id=130&amp;gender=&lt;/ref&gt; International assistance is offered through [[Operation Eyesight Universal]], which funds three district hospital satellite eye clinics in the Western Region.&lt;ref&gt;http://operationeyesight.com/Page.aspx?pid=288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training Schools==

===Ophthalmologists===
Teaching hospitals in [[Ghana]] train [[medical doctor]]s for a period of three to five years in Ophthalmology. A total of at least ten years is needed to train an individual from the Undergraduate level to the level of an Ophthalmologist in Ghana.

===Optometrists===
The first optometrist school in Ghana started at the department of Physics, [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://knust.edu.gh Kwame Nkrumah University Of Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992. The first class had just five students and were under the tutelage of Ghana's first Optometrist, Dr. K Monny. It was opened to only to those who had had their first degrees in either Biochemistry, Physics or Biology. Graduates from the school were awarded the Postgraduate Diploma in Optometry (Pg. Dip. Optometry). In 2000, a four-year Bachelor of Science Degree program was started to phase out the Pg. Dip. Optometry program and also accelerate the training of more eye care professionals in Ghana. In 2004, just as the first batch of Optometrist with the BSc. Degree had graduated, they were enrolled for the two-year Doctor of Optometry (O.D) program. They passed out in 2007. In 2002, the [[University of Cape Coast]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucc.edu.gh University of Cape Coast&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; also rolled out its Doctor of Optometry program. Five students enrolled for the program and graduated with the 2008 batch of O.Ds from KNUST. Today, there are about two hundred Optometrists in Ghana working hand-in-hand with other eye care professionals to save sight.

===Ophthalmic nurses===
Trained nurses who wish to become ophthalmic nurses undergo a one-year post nursing school training in eye care at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Their training involves training in detection of eye condition and referring to the right eye care professional for treatment. They also are trained in managing common disease conditions of the eye as well as training to assist the Ophthalmologist in surgery.

===Opticians===
The Oyoko town in the New Juaben district of the Ashanti Region hosts Ghana's only school for the training of opticians. Secondary school graduates who qualify undergo a three-year training in lens glazing and fitting, optics and a lot more to qualify as an optician. They work closely with Optometrists in refractive therapy and refraction.

==Major Eye conditions==
There are a lot of ocular conditions in Ghana and as of now virtually all conditions can be treated in the country including those that require laser surgery. Occasionally, though, some conditions require the individual being taken outside the country for treatment. Below are the more common conditions in Ghana.
* [[Refractive errors]]
* [[Cataracts]]
* [[Diabetic]] [[Retinopathy]]
* [[Hypertensive]] [[Retinopathy]]
* [[Glaucoma]]
* [[Bacterial Infections]]
* [[Viral Infections]]
* [[Agricultural]] [[injuries]] to the eye
* [[Trauma (medicine)|Trauma]]
* [[HIV/AIDS]] associated ocular complications
* [[Sickle cell]] retinopathies
* [[Allergic conjunctivitis]]

===Glaucoma===
Ghana is ranked second in worldwide statistics for the prevalence of glaucoma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghanaian-chronicle.com/news/other-news/ghana-second-highest-in-glaucoma-worldwide/ Ghana, second highest in glaucoma worldwide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that  600,000 Ghanaians are said to be suffering from glaucoma out of the number, 30,000 are likely to become blind if the disease is left untreated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=204834 30,000 Ghanaians Likely To Go Blind | General News 2011-03-11&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The statistics continues to show that 8.5 percent of persons above 40 years have the disease and 7.7 percent of persons above 30 years also are with the disease.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.glaucoma.org/news/in_africa_ghana.php News | Glaucoma Research Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 15 to 20 percent of blindness cases in Ghana are due to glaucoma.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Ghana Health Service (GHS) is the government agency responsible for health care administration and delivery in the country. GHS has over the years initiated various programs aimed at improving the eye care system in the country. One of such measure is the celebration of World Sight Day which falls on every second Thursday in October. In 2008, the day was celebrated under the theme “Eyes on the Future - Fight Vision Impairment in Later Life Now &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In Ghana, it is only the Ophthalmologist and optometrist  who are licensed to manage glaucoma.

==Challenges in Eye care==
There are many challenges in the growth of eye care sector in Ghana:
* Lack of personnel (about 300 eye care professionals taking care of the needs of 23 million Ghanaians).
* Lack of funds to undertake major outreaches and screening.
* Lack of equipment and diagnostic tools in many parts of the country
* Lack of adequate eye care education for the public
* Continual use of uncertified herbal preparations to treat conditions

===The Patient's Needs===
As the average Ghanaian becomes more enlightened concerning they eye and its conditions, eyecare professionals would be required to do more too for his or her patient. The major concerns that eye patients raise are:
* the long wait periods for them to see the eye doctor. One the average it take about two hours for patients to access eye care services in most MOH hospitals and clinics.
* poor patient education practice from doctor to the patient

With respect to the above most eye care professionals the world over are adapting [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] to help the patient better. With respect to the long wait hours, various Electronic Medical Records [[Electronic health record|EMRs]] are being used. These do away with paper and manual recording of patient data. As such the patient does not need to wait for his or her records before seeing the doctor. EMRs the world over have been shown to reduce doctor-patient interactions by up to three times. Ghanaian Optometrist are now turning to the use of EMRs&lt;ref&gt;[http://templecos.blogspot.com/2011/03/ghanaian-optometrist-turn-to-emrs.html Temple Computer Systems: Ghanaian Optometrist turn to EMRs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to improve their daily work. Those who are using these EMRs bear witness to this fact and are continually advocating for the use of EMRs among their colleagues. One of the EMRs in use in Ghana are:
* the Facility Overall Versatile Eyecare Application (FOVEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOVEA|url=http://www.foveasoft.blogspot.com|publisher=www.foveasoft.blogsopt.com|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Personal Digital Assistant for Eye Clinics (PDAEC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://templecos.blogspot.com/2011/03/optometrist-and-pdaec.html Temple Computer Systems: The Optometrist and PDAEC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning patient education, various ICT tools are also being used. They include:
* [[TV]] based educational tools that play (with vocal renditions in the most widely spoken language within the location of the clinic) whiles patients wait their turn in the waiting area.
* Computer Assisted Patient Educational tools, that serve as a one-on-one tool for the eyecare professional during his or her patient education.

With all these new changes the sky will indeed be the limit for the well trained, well informed, computer assisted eyecare professional. And this will in turn impact positively on the Ghanaian who will seek their services.

==Future==
Due to the general [[Human Development Index|living conditions]] of the country, many citizens of Ghana are unable or unwilling to access eye care when their income is too low to pay for basic living essentials. The low number of eye care professionals in the country along with the living standard need to improve before eye care is readily accessible in [[Ghana]]. As the number of professionals in the field increase, Ghanaians will experience available, accessible and afford eye care services throughout the country.

==Flyability Activities==
===Equipment loans===
Flyability loans out specialist equipment to BHPA schools for training disabled people. This includes a range of paragliding buggies including the Flychair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flychair.fi/|title=FlyChair|website=Flychair Paragliding buggy|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Swanton, the Chevron paragliding wheelchair and the Sanderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flyability Equipment|url=http://www.flyability.org.uk/how-can-flyability-help-you/equipment/|website=Flyability|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flyability was involved in encouraging the development of some of these buggies and has passed some of their older buggies onto disabled flying organisations in other countries. One Sanderson buggy has even got as far as New Zealand where Making Trax and Infinity Paragliding use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The thrill-seeking tetraplegic refusing to live a boring life|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/the-thrill-seeking-tetraplegic-refusing-to-live-a-boring-life?autoPlay=4654707283001|website=1 News Now|publisher=TV New Zealand|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our tours &gt; Air|url=http://www.makingtrax.co.nz/Our-Tours/Air/|website=Making Trax|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Graz tube weaning model''' ({{lang-de|Graz Sondenentwöhnung}}) is a method that supports [[parent]]s, [[caregiver]]s and professionals to help and empower medically fragile [[children]] with early and post-traumatic [[Eating disorder|eating behavior disorder]]s, particularly [[tube dependency]].

== Overview ==
Enteral feeding via a tube ([[nasogastric tube]], [[PEG tube|PEG]] or [[jejunostomy]]) is commonly used in the treatment of premature infants and young children to support them during periods of severe illness and health disorders when a child is unable to swallow food safely. In specific cases, [[tube feeding]] is a necessary intervention, however, it can cause problems when it comes to tube weaning and resuming an oral diet.

Children may suffer from food aversion when fed without a tube and resist natural oral feeding. This effect is caused by a combination of [[Physical disorder|physical]] and [[psychological disorder]]s, which are addressed during a tube weaning program.

The Graz tube weaning model was developed by a multidisciplinary team based at the Children’s Hospital, Graz during the 1990s and first published in 2000.

== Medical uses ==
Tube weaning program is specifically designed for premature infants and children who are fed via a nasogastric, nasojejunal, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube. The treatment is performed either when the feeding tube is no longer needed or if children experience side effects and poor response to enteral feeding. The program is suitable both for primary weaning and children that had been unsuccessfully weaned in the past. It is especially recommended for children that are struggling with oral feeding or have developed tube dependency.&lt;ref&gt;Dunitz-Scheer, Marguerite, et al. "Prevention and treatment of tube dependency in infancy and early childhood." [[ICAN: Infant, Child, &amp; Adolescent Nutrition]] 1.2 (2009): 73-82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraindications ==
Tube weaning is contraindicated in children who do not have a safe swallowing response. It is not recommended if there is a high possibility of an upcoming surgery or intervention that will require further usage of a feeding tube.

== Medical risks ==
One of the medical risks is [[weight loss]]. Losing up to 10% of a child’s weight is expected in the transition from exclusive enteral feeding to oral intake and is acceptable during the initial phase of treatment.

There's also risk of [[choking]] and [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]. Children are assessed for risk of choking and aspiration prior to starting the tube weaning process and are excluded from learning to eat if aspiration or choking is a medically confirmed finding.

== Techniques ==
The original technique is an intense 3-week inpatient treatment program. The child is admitted to the unit with at least one parent or caregiver and has ongoing input from multiple [[therapist]]s, as well as medical rounds several times a day and 24-hour support from [[nursing]] and medical staff. This method is especially suitable for children with co-existing, notable health issues when close medical supervision is highly recommended.

The child and parent/caregiver attend multiple therapy sessions:
* [[Developmental psychology]] and [[Play therapy|play sessions]], including puppet interactions to assess and treat [[attachment disorder]]s.
* [[Physiotherapy]] which is aimed to improve motor tone and self-feeding movements.
* [[Occupational therapy]] to improve [[Touch|tactile]] ability and [[Motor coordination|coordination]] and [[Acclimatization|acclimatize]] the child to ‘biological’ textures.
* [[Speech and language therapy]] to introduce non-traumatic oral stimulation to oro-facial area as well as being involved in assessment of swallowing.
* [[Dyadic developmental psychotherapy|Developmental psychotherapy]] sessions with the child and sessions for parents on request, working on management of past traumatic experiences, parent-child attachment issues and relationship [[Stress (biology)|stresses]].
* [[Nutrition]] [[counseling]] is intense educational support regarding future diet in terms of adequate [[Calorie|caloric]] and nutritional intake for the child’s growth and condition needs.

The treatment includes daily play picnic, which is usually lasts one hour. Children spend time in a room where food is attractively portioned/positioned and usually served on the floor. Using a psychoanalytically based play therapy, children may choose to examine, touch or taste the available food. According to the program, children must become self-motivated and no encouragement or distraction is received from parents. Parents’ interactions are monitored by video and one-way mirrors with positively-framed feedback given after each session. During the rest of the time, food is freely available to the child with no offering or encouragement.
Since its development, the method has been modified so that children can attend on an outpatient basis, or treated remotely by a net coaching program.

== Recovery ==
Studies in 2001 and 2010 have shown a 95% (n=62) and 92% (n=221) success rate respectively (success being defined as obtaining all nutrition orally) in children treated with this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Dunitz-Scheer, Marguerite, et al. "Sondenentwöhnung in der frühen Kindheit". ''Monatsschrift Kinderheilkunde'' 149.12 (2001): 1348-1359&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trabi, Thomas, et al. "Inpatient tube weaning in children with long‐term feeding tube dependency: A retrospective analysis". ''Infant Mental Health Journal'' 31.6 (2010): 664-681&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-up contacts show that fully weaned children have increased BMIs when measured after treatment compared to when they were entirely tube fed.
2014 study compared inpatient treatment and Netcoaching approaches and showed 90.5% (n=169) and 81.3% (n=209) success rates respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Marinschek, Sabine, et al. "Weaning children off enteral nutrition by netcoaching versus onsite treatment: A comparative study". ''Journal of paediatrics and child health'' 50.11 (2014): 902-907&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health care in Poland''' is free and is delivered through a publicly funded health care system called the National Health Fund (in Polish: Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia), which is free for all the citizens of [[Poland]] provided they fall into the "insured" category (usually meaning that they have their health insurance paid for by their employer, or are the spouse or child of an insured person).  According to Article 68 of [[Constitution of Poland|the Polish Constitution]] everyone has a right to have access to health care. Citizens are granted equal access to the publicly funded healthcare system. In particular, the government is obliged to provide free health care to young children, pregnant women, disabled people and to the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PolishConstitution|url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/polski/kon1.htm|publisher=Polish Parliament|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, private healthcare use is very extensive in Poland. Patients who are uninsured have to pay the full cost of medical services. According to study conducted by CBOS in 2016, out of 84% patients taking part in survey, 40% declare to use both private and public health services, 37% use only public health care and 7% use only private health services. 77% of all responders declare using of private health care is caused by long awaiting for public health care services.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2016/K_112_16.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing and health expenses==
The main financing source is health insurance in the National Health Fund. Citizens are obligated to pay insurance fee (redistributed tax) which is 9% deducted from personal income (7,75% is deducted from the tax, 1,25% covered by insured goes directly to the National Health Fund).  
National budget covers around 5% of all health care expenses. Since 2007 emergency rescue services are financed in total from national budged.

==Emergency medical services==
[[File:Mercedes_ambulance_PICT0112.jpg|thumb|right|Ambulance in Poland]]
{{main|Emergency medical services in Poland}}

Emergency Medical Services ({{lang-pl|Ratownictwo Medyczne}}, RM) in [[Poland]] are a service of public, pre-hospital emergency healthcare, including [[ambulance]] service, provided by the individual Polish cities and counties.  These services are typically provided by the local, publicly operated hospital, and are generally funded by the government of Poland.  In a number of cases, the hospitals contract these services to private operators.  In addition to publicly funded services, there are a variety of private-for-profit ambulance services operating independently.

==Problems in health system in Poland==
Health care system in Poland is experiencing problems from many years. According to Euro Health Consumer Index 2016, Poland is on 31. Place out of 35.&lt;ref&gt;https://piu.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Europejski-Konsumencki-Indeks-Zdrowia-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Main problems listed in Health Consumer Index 2016 are: 
* difficult access to specialist physician (especially to hospital treatment) and long time of waiting for health services: planned, serious surgery: more than 90 days, cancer treatment: more than 21 days, tomography: more than 7 days
* bad results in cancer treatment - no access to modern medicines and high level of mortality 
* access to legal abortion - Poland, Malta and Cyprus are the only countries in Europe with score "0" in Health Consumer Index 2018
* digital structure of health information: difficulties with electronic prescriptions and referrals, no access to examination results or list of authorised physicians

==Life expectancy==
{{See also|Demographics of Russia|List of federal subjects of Russia by life expectancy|List of countries by life expectancy}}
[[File:Russian male and female life expectancy.PNG|thumb|450px|Russian male and female life expectancy since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/pril.php Life expectancy of the Russian Federation since 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514001827/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/pril.php |date=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/2008/demo/osn/05-08.htm Life Expectancy of the Russian Federation since 1992] Retrieved on May 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;]]
===Pre-soviet era===
Before the revolution annual mortality was 29.4 per 1000 and infant mortality 260 per 1000 births. In 1913 life expectancy was 32 years. The cholera epidemic of 1910 killed 100,000 people. A typhus epidemic between 1918 and 1922 caused 2.5 million deaths, and doctors were particularly affected. There was an outbreak of malaria in 1920.  The Institute of Tropical Medicine in Moscow instituted a programme of registration of cases and free distribution of quinine.  The famine of 1921/2 caused widespread starvation. As many as 27 million people were affected.  Another cholera outbreak between 1921 and 1923 caused an estimated 13 million deaths.  By 1926 life expectancy had reached 44 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khwaja|first1=Barbara|title=Health Reform in Revolutionary Russia|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/2017/05/26/health-reform-revolutionary-russia/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=Socialist Health Association|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-soviet era===
As of 2013, the average [[life expectancy]] in Russia was 65.1 years for males and 76.5 years for females.&lt;ref&gt;http://ria.ru/society/20140418/1004478479.html&lt;/ref&gt; The average Russian life expectancy of 71.6&lt;ref&gt;http://itar-tass.com/obschestvo/1614450&lt;/ref&gt; years at birth is nearly 5 years shorter than the overall average figure for the European Union, or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ee.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|title=European Union|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest factor contributing to this relatively low life expectancy for males is a high mortality rate among working-age males from preventable causes (e.g., [[alcohol poisoning]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]], [[smoking]], [[traffic accident]]s, [[violent crime]]s). Mortality among Russian men rose by 60% since 1991, four to five times higher than European average.&lt;ref name=heart&gt;{{Cite web|title=Heart disease kills 1.3 million annually in Russia&amp;nbsp;— chief cardiologist|publisher=RIA Novosti|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070214/60721668.html|accessdate=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the large difference in life expectancy between men and women, (the greatest in the world) the gender imbalance remains to this day and there are 0.859 males to every female.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{Cite web|last=The World Factbook|title=Russia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)|accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major health issues==

===Common causes of death===
In 2008, 1,185,993, or 57% of all deaths in Russia were caused by [[cardiovascular disease]]. The second leading cause of death was cancer which claimed 289,257 lives (14%). External causes of death such as suicide (1.8%), road accidents (1.7%), murders (1.1%), accidental alcohol poisoning (1.1%), and accidental drowning (0.5%), claimed 244,463 lives in total (11%). Other major causes of death were diseases of the digestive system (4.3%), respiratory disease (3.8%), infectious and parasitic diseases (1.6%), and tuberculosis (1.2%).&lt;ref name="gks2"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/wps/PA_1_0_S5/Documents/jsp/Detail_default.jsp?category=1112178611292&amp;elementId=1140096846203 Rosstat demographics report for the year 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215012413/http://www.gks.ru/wps/PA_1_0_S5/Documents/jsp/Detail_default.jsp?category=1112178611292&amp;elementId=1140096846203 |date=2010-12-15 }} Federal State Statistics Service, Retrieved on June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[infant mortality rate]] in 2008 was 8.5 deaths per 1,000, down from 9.6 in 2007. Since the Soviet collapse, there has been a dramatic rise in both cases of and deaths from tuberculosis, with the disease being particularly widespread amongst prison inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=119,000 TB cases in Russia&amp;nbsp;— health official|publisher=RIA Novosti|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20060127/43221133.html|accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smoking===
Until 2007 Russia was the world leader in smoking.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} According to a survey reported in 2010 by Russia’s Health and Social Development Ministry, 43.9 million adults in Russia are smokers. Among Russians aged 19 to 44 years, 7 in 10 men smoke and 4 in 10 women smoke.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15664613&amp;PageNum=0{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 330,000-400,000 people die in Russia each year due to smoking-related diseases.  A [[List_of_smoking_bans#Russia|smoking ban]] was introduced in 2014.

===Alcohol consumption===
{{Main|Alcoholism in Russia}}
Alcohol consumption and alcoholism are major problems in Russia.
It is estimated that Russians drink 15 litres (26 pints) of pure alcohol each year. This number is nearly 3 times as much as it was in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1647475.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Tony | last=Halpin | title=Health alert as Russias alcohol consumption triples | date=April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Moscow on September 24 of 2009, Russia's interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev cited the average intake at an estimated 18 liters a year; "In Russia, each person, including babies, accounts for about 18 liters of spirits per year. In the opinion of WHO experts, consumption of more than 8 liters per year poses a real threat to the health of the nation. Russia has long exceeded this level".&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090924/156238102.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been reported that excessive alcohol consumption is to blame for nearly half of all premature deaths in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/alcohol-blamed-for-half-of-russias-premature-deaths-453197.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Jeremy | last=Laurance | date=June 15, 2007 | title=Alcohol blamed for half of Russia's premature deaths}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study blamed alcohol for more than half the deaths (52%) among Russians aged 15 to 54 from 1990 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], [[Khaltourina D.]] [https://www.academia.edu/32754260/Russian_Demographic_Crisis_in_Cross-National_Perspective._In_Russia_and_Globalization._Baltimore_John_Hopkins_University_Press Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective.

A., &amp; Korotayev, A. V.

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Russia}}
HIV/AIDS, virtually non-existent in the Soviet era, rapidly spread following the collapse, mainly through the explosive growth of intravenous drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=HIV/AIDS in the Russian Federation|publisher=The World Bank|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/EXTECAREGTOPHEANUT/EXTECAREGTOPHIVAIDS/0,,contentMDK:20320143~menuPK:616427~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:571172,00.html|accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 report by [[UNAIDS]], the HIV epidemic in Russia continues to grow, but at a slower pace than in the late 1990s. At the end of December 2007 the number of registered HIV cases in Russia was 416,113, with 42,770 new registered cases that year. The actual number of people living with HIV in Russia is estimated to be about 940,000.&lt;ref name=aids2&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2008/jc1529_epibriefs_eeurope_casia_en.pdf Eastern Europe and Central Asia AIDS epidemic update] [[UNAIDS]] Retrieved on May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 83% of HIV infections in Russia were registered among injecting drug users, 6% among sex workers, and 5% among prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2008/russia_2008_country_progress_report_en.pdf UNAIDS Russia] [[UNAIDS]] Retrieved on July 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is clear evidence of a significant rise in [[heterosexual]] [[sexually transmitted disease|transmission]]{{citation needed|reason=Vadim Pokrovskiy from Federal HIV Center states that by 2019 there homosexual transmission will only account for 1% of HIV/AIDS cases as opposed to 40% for heterosexual transmission. https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/09/15/awash-in-aids#/en/feature/2015/09/15/awash-in-aids|date=April 2016}}. In 2007, 93.19% of adults and children with advanced HIV infection were receiving [[antiretroviral therapy]].&lt;ref name=aids2/&gt;&lt;ref name=aids&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Countries/russian_federation.asp UNAIDS: Russian Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409120835/http://www.unaids.org/en/CountryResponses/Countries/russian_federation.asp |date=2008-04-09 }} [[UNAIDS]] Retrieved on March 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, the [[State Council of the Russian Federation|State Council]] met with the [[Russian President]] to set goals for developing a strategy for responding to AIDS; improving coordination, through the creation of a high-level multisectoral governmental commission on AIDS; and establishing a unified [[monitoring and evaluation]] system. A new Federal AIDS Program for 2007 - 2011 was also developed and adopted. [[Federal budget of Russia|Federal funding]] for the national AIDS response in 2006 had increased more than twentyfold compared to 2005, and the 2007 budget doubled that of 2006, adding to the already substantial funds provided by the main donor organizations.&lt;ref name=aids/&gt;

Coordination of activities in responding to AIDS remains a challenge for Russia, despite increased efforts. In 2006, [[HIV#Treatment|treatment]] for some patients was interrupted due to delays in tender procedures and unexpected difficulties with customs. Additionally, lack of full commitment to an in-depth program for [[sex education|education on sex]] and [[drug education|drugs]] in schools hinders effective prevention programs for children.&lt;ref name=aids/&gt;

===Suicide===
{{Main|Suicide in Russia}}

In 2008, [[suicide]] claimed 38,406 lives in Russia.&lt;ref name="gks2009"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b09_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d07/8-0.htm H1 2009 demographic figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218100517/http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b09_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d07/8-0.htm |date=2012-02-18 }} [[Goskomstat|Rosstat]] Retrieved on August 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; With a rate of 27.1 suicides per 100,000 people, Russia has one of the highest [[List of countries by suicide rate|suicide rates]] in the world, although it has been steadily decreasing since it peaked at around 40 per 100,000 in the mid-late 90s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/russ.pdf WHO Russia suicide statistics] [[WHO]] retrieved on March 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; including a 30% drop from 2001 to 2006. In 2007 about 22% of all suicides were committed by people aged 40–49, and almost six times as many Russian males commit suicide than females.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/society/20080131/98094233.html One million people commit suicide every year globally] [[RIA Novosti]] Retrieved on March 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy alcohol use is a significant factor in the suicide rate, with an estimated half of all suicides a result of alcohol abuse. This is evidenced by the fact that Russia's suicide rate since the mid-90s has declined alongside per capita alcohol consumption, despite the economic crises since then; alcohol consumption is more of a factor than economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2010/0427/analit05.php Demoscope - Demographic, social and economic consequences of alcohol abuse in Russia] [[Demoscope]] Retrieved on July 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The pulmonary TB death rate in Russia around 1900 was 4 per 1000, more than double the rate in London. The All Russia League for the Struggle Against TB was set up in 1909. In 1919 the [[Commissariat of Public Health]] established a TB Commission. The incidence of tuberculosis in Moscow was about three times that in London in 1922.  The director of the Institute of Control of Serums and Vaccines in Russia, Tarasevich, brought a serum of the [[BCG vaccine]] from the [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1925 and a vaccination programme started shortly afterwards, starting with children in homes with an active TB patient, but there was initially very low take up.  It was not until the 1930s that rates increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khwaja|first1=Barbara|title=Health Reform in Revolutionary Russia|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/2017/05/26/health-reform-revolutionary-russia/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=Socialist Health Association|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese cuisine}}

This article traces the history of [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine of Japan]]. Foods and food preparation by the early Japanese [[Neolithic]] settlements can be pieced together from [[archaeology|archaeological]] studies, and reveals paramount importance of rice and seafood since early times. 

The [[Kofun period]] (3rd to 7th centuries) is shrouded in uncertainty. Some entries in Japan's earliest written chronicles hint at a picture of food habits from the time of the formation of the Yamato dynasty. When Buddhism became widely accepted with the rise of the [[Soga clan]], a taboo on the eating meat (especially mammals) began to be enforced, and became common practice, although wild game was still being taken by mountain people, and would be eaten by townspeople when the opportunity arose. 

Treatises on ceremony, tax documents, and fiction allows one to make a list of food ingredients used, and basic preparation methods in the [[Heian period]]. However anything like recipes from the Middle Ages are a rare commodity in Japan or any country. 

Records throughout Middle Ages may give some idea of the dishes being enjoyed, but do not give details such as to provide accurate recipes. 

Once Japan entered the [[Edo period]], there were rich records of foods and cuisine from commoners (i.e., non-samurai), who were largely literate, and produced a great deal of wood-block printed literature.

==Heian period==
Following the [[Jōmon period]], Japanese society shifted from semi-[[sedentism|sedentary]] [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to an [[agriculture|agricultural society]]. This was the period in which [[rice]] cultivation began, having been introduced by [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-25.html|title=Road of rice plant|publisher=[[National Science Museum of Japan]]|accessdate=2011-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405000536/http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-25.html|archivedate=2015-04-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice was commonly boiled plain and called ''gohan'' or ''meshi'', and, as cooked rice has since been the preferred staple of the meal, the terms are used as synonyms for the word "meal". Peasants often mixed [[millet]] with rice, especially in mountainous regions where rice did not proliferate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kiple|Ornelas|2001}}, 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Kofun period]], Chinese culture was introduced into Japan from [[Korea]]. As such, [[Buddhism]] became influential on Japanese culture. After the 6th century, Japan directly pursued the imitation of Chinese culture of the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this influence that marked the taboos on the consumption of meat in Japan. In 675 AD, [[Emperor Tenmu]] decreed a prohibition on the consumption of [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, [[dog]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[chicken]]s during the 4th-9th months of the year; to break the law would mean a death sentence. Monkey was eaten prior to this time, but was eaten more in a ritualistic style for medicinal purposes. Chickens were often domesticated as pets,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} while cattle and horses were rare and treated as such. A cow or horse would be ritually sacrificed on the first day of rice paddy cultivation, a ritual introduced from China. Emperor Temmu's decree, however, did not ban the consumption of [[deer]] or [[wild boar]], which were important to the Japanese diet at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th century saw many additional decrees made by emperors and empresses banning the killing of any animals. In 752 AD, [[Empress Kōken]] decreed a ban on fishing, but made a promise that adequate rice would be given to fishermen whose livelihood would have otherwise been destroyed. In 927 AD, regulations were enacted that stated that any government official or member of nobility that ate meat was deemed unclean for three days and could not participate in [[Shinto]] observances at the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chopstick.png|thumb|right|[[Chopsticks]] on a [[chopstick rest]] ]]
It was also the influence of Chinese cultures through Korea that brought [[chopsticks]] to Japan early in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 67 "chopsticks originated in ancient China, spreading from the Yeelow River basin, which was then the center of Chinese civilization, to surrounding regions from about fifth century BCE."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kokusai-hashi.org/info.html The International Institute of Hashi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325154051/http://kokusai-hashi.org/info.html |date=2012-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaka-kyoiku.ac.jp/~ioku/foodsite/hashi/rekisi.html [[Osaka Kyoiku University]]　箸の伝来 "Transmission of chopsticks"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umds.ac.jp/faculty/koza/08-07/07mori.html [[University of Marketing and Distribution Sciences]] Mori Takayuki (professor of Department of Commercial Science)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komajo.ac.jp/uni/window/jpculture/essay_backnumber_know.html#b13 [[Komazawa Women's University]] "箸と日本人 (Chopsticks and Japanese)]&lt;/ref&gt; Chopsticks at this time were used by nobility at banquets; they were not used as everyday utensils however, as hands were still commonly used to eat. Metal spoons were also used during the 8th and 9th centuries, but only by the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dining tables were also introduced to Japan at this time.  Commoners used a legless table called a ''oshiki'', while nobility used a lacquered table with legs called a ''zen''. Each person used his own table. Lavish banquets for the nobility would have multiple tables for each individual based upon the number of dishes presented.&lt;ref name="Ishige, 71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the decline of the Tang dynasty in the 9th century, Japan made a move toward its individuality in culture and cuisine. The abandonment of the spoon as a dining utensil – which was retained in [[Korea]] – is one of the marked differences, and commoners were now eating with chopsticks as well. Trade continued with China and Korea, but influence en masse from outside Japan would not be seen again until the 19th century.  The 10th and 11th centuries marked a level of refinement of cooking and etiquette found in the culture of the [[Heian period|Heian]] nobility. Court chefs would prepare many of the vegetables sent as tax from the countryside.  Court banquets were common and lavish; garb for nobility during these events remained in the Chinese style which differentiated them from the plain clothes of commoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dishes consumed after the 9th century included grilled [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[meat]] (''yakimono''), simmered food (''nimono''), steamed foods (''mushimono''), soups made from chopped vegetables, fish or meat (''atsumono''), jellied fish (''nikogori'') simmered with seasonings, sliced raw fish served in a vinegar sauce (''namasu''), [[vegetable]]s, [[edible seaweed|seaweed]] or fish in a strong dressing (''aemono''), and pickled vegetables (''[[tsukemono]]'') that were cured in salt to cause lactic fermentation. Oil and fat were avoided almost universally in cooking. Sesame oil was used, but rarely, as it was of great expense to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents from the Heian nobility note that fish and wild fowl were common fare along with vegetables. Their banquet settings consisted of a bowl of [[rice]] and soup, along with chopsticks, a spoon, and three seasonings which were salt, vinegar and ''[[hishio]]'', which was a fermentation of soybeans, wheat, sake and salt. A fourth plate was present for mixing the seasonings to desired flavor for dipping the food. The four types of food present at a banquet consisted of dried foods (''himono''), fresh foods (''namamono''), fermented or dressed food (''kubotsuki''), and desserts (''kashi''). Dried fish and fowl were thinly sliced (e.g. salted [[salmon]], [[pheasant]], steamed and dried [[abalone]], dried and grilled [[octopus]]), while fresh fish, shellfish and fowl were sliced raw in vinegar sauce or grilled (e.g. [[carp]], [[sea bream]], salmon, [[trout]], pheasant). ''Kubotsuki'' consisted of small balls of fermented [[sea squirt]], fish or [[giblets]] along with [[jellyfish]] and ''[[aemono]]''. Desserts would have included Chinese cakes, and a variety of fruits and nuts including [[pine nut]]s, dried [[chestnut]]s, [[acorn]]s, [[jujube]], [[pomegranate]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[persimmon]] and [[citrus]]. The meal would be ended with [[sake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kamakura period==
The [[Kamakura period]] marked a large political change in Japan. Prior to the Kamakura period, the [[samurai]] were guards of the landed estates of the nobility. The nobility, having lost control of the Japanese countryside, fell under the militaristic rule of the peasant class samurai, with a military government being set up in 1192 in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] giving way to the period. Once the position of power had been exchanged, the role of the court banquets changed. The court cuisine which had prior to this time emphasized flavor and nutritional aspects changed to a highly ceremonial and official role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minamoto no Yoritomo]], the first ''[[shōgun]]'', punished other samurai who followed the earlier showy banquet style of the nobility. The shōgun banquet, called [[ōban]], was attended by military leaders from the provinces. The ōban originally referred to a luncheon on festival days attended by soldiers and guards during the Heian period, and was attached to the warrior class. The menu usually consisted of dried [[abalone]], jellyfish ''aemono'', pickled [[ume]] called ''[[umeboshi]]'', salt and vinegar for seasoning, and rice. Later in the period, the ''[[honzen-ryōri]]'' banquet became popularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cuisine of the samurai came distinctly from their peasant roots. The meals prepared emphasized simplicity while being substantial. The cuisine avoided refinement, ceremony and luxury, and shed all further Chinese influence. One specific example is the change from wearing traditional Chinese garb to a distinct clothing style that combined the simple clothing of the common people. This style evolved into the [[kimono]] by the end of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist vegetarian philosophy strengthened during the Kamakura period as it began to spread to the peasants. Those who were involved in the trade of slaughtering animals for food or leather came under discrimination. Those practicing this trade were considered in opposition to the Buddhist philosophy of not taking life, while under the [[Shinto]] philosophy they were considered defiled. This discrimination intensified, and eventually led  to the creation of a separate caste, the [[burakumin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishige|2001}}, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Health Transfer Policy''' of [[Canada]], provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal Canadians]] and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on the concept of self-determination in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWbF_tfYUuEC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=Indian+Health+Transfer+Policy+in+canadal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SLL8UWqmnS&amp;sig=swsX5CK_9WsknURGPZVkHNNnwPM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jhXBSt7ZNYya8AbXiq2lAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Unhealthy health policy: a critical anthropological examination|work=By Arachu Castro, Merrill Singer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this process, the decision to enter into transfer discussions with [[Health Canada]] rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities are able to take control of health program responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/alt_formats/fnihb-dgspni/pdf/pubs/agree-accord/1999_finance_integr-eng.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111060520/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/alt_formats/fnihb-dgspni/pdf/pubs/agree-accord/1999_finance_integr-eng.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-11 |title=Financing a First Nations and Inuit Integrated Health System |work=Heallth Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{See also|The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples}}
To put [[Canada Health Transfer|Health Transfer]] in context, it is useful to understand from a historical perspective how [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] and the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]] through [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|Indian and Northern Affairs]] have worked together to respond to Aboriginal peoples expressed desire to manage and control their own health programs.

=== 1969 White Paper ===
{{Main|1969 White Paper}}
Federal Government [[Policy]] Paper which proposed to remove the status of treaty individuals under the [[Indian Act]] and to discontinue special services so identified, advocating the increased assimilation of Indigenous  people into the [[culture of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danielnpaul.com/Canada'sWhitePaper1969.html|title=CANADIAN GOVERNMENT'S 1969 WHITE PAPER|work= Dr. Daniel N Paul, C.M., O.N.S., Hon.D.Litt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970 Red Paper===
Aboriginal response to the White Paper emphasizing federal responsibility for [[health care]] to First Nation peoples and emphasizing plans to strengthen community control of their lives and of government-delivered community programs.&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt;

===1975 Indian Relationships Paper===
The White and Red Papers served as an impetus for the collaborative effort of the Federal Government and Aboriginal to begin serious planning for the future.&lt;ref name="cast"&gt;Castile, George Pierre Taking Charge: Native American Self-Determination and Federal Indian Policy, 1975-1993 Tucson: The University of Arizona Press 168p, {{ISBN|0-8165-2542-0}} Publication Date: September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in the 1975 paper, The Canadian Government/The Canadian Indian Relationships, which defined a policy framework for strengthening Indian control of programs and services. In the health sector, under contribution agreements 75% of the Bands became responsible for such programs as the Native Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program and the Community Health Representative Program.&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt;

===1979 Indian Health Policy===

The stated goal of the Indian Health Policy adopted by the Federal Government on September 19, 1979, is "to achieve an increasing level of health in Indian communities, generated and maintained by the Indian communities themselves". In this regard the policy recognized the historic responsibilities of both federal and provincial governments in providing health services to First Nations and Inuit people, and it removed the issue of treaty rights from health policy considerations to where it rightly belonged &amp;ndash; [[Indian Affairs]]. The policy reasoned that improvements to the health status of the Indian population should be built on three pillars: (1) community development, both socio-economic and cultural/spiritual, to remove the conditions which limit the attainment of well-being; (2) the traditional trust relationship between Indian people and the federal government; and (3) the interrelated Canadian health system, with its federal, provincial, municipal, Indian and private sectors.&lt;ref name="healt"/&gt;

A further important aspect of the new policy was the recognition that First Nation and Inuit communities could take over any or all aspect(s) of the administration of their own community health programs, at their discretion and with the support of the Department of National Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, P. and M.E. Turpel. "Implementing Aboriginal Self-Government: Constitutional and Jurisdictional Issues." The Canadian Bar Review. Vol. 74, No. 2, June 1995, p. 187-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980 (Berger Report)===
The report of the Advisory Committee on Indian and Inuit Health Consultation known as the "Berger Report". Recommended methods of consultation that would ensure substantive participation by First Nations and Inuit people in the design, management and control of health care services in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/_agree-accord/10_years_ans_trans/2_intro-eng.php|title= Ten Years of Health Transfer First Nation and Inuit Control|work=health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1983 (Penner Report) ===
The Report of the Special Committee on Indian Self-Government knows as the "Penner Report" recommended that the Federal government establish a new relationship with First Nations and Inuit people and that an essential element of this relationship be recognition of Indian Self-Government. The report identified health as a key area for takeover.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicc.sk.ca/saskindian/a84apr22.htm|title=The Impact Of The Penner Report|work=Law Firm of Soonias and Pennington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1983-86 Community Health Projects ===
First Nations and Inuit Health Branch sponsored demonstration projects for First Nations. The experiment was initiated to provide both Federal and First Nation authorities with the same substantive information with respect to First Nation control of health services.&lt;ref name="firm"/&gt;

=== 1986 The Sechelt Band Self-Government Act ===
The Sechelt Indian Band Self-Government Act was passed by Parliament in 1986. In April of the following year, the British Columbia Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a bill to give the Sechelt community municipal status. Consequently, the Sechelt Indian Band signed the first Self-Government agreement in which a First Nation community assumed control of their health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-1986-c-27/latest/sc-1986-c-27.html |title=Sechelt Indian Band Self-Government Act, S.C. 1986, c. 27|work=Federation of Law Societies of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1988 Health Transfer South of the 60th Parallel ===
In order for First Nations and Inuit Health Branch to proceed with health transfer to First Nations as part of administrative reform, the policy framework, authorities and resources had to be developed and secured. A Subcommittee on the Transfer of Health Programs to Indian Control was established with representation from First Nations with experience in health care. The Subcommittee incorporated the experiences from the Community Health Projects and recommended a developmental and consultative approach for health transfer. These recommendations were then used to finalize the health transfer policy framework.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;Cameron, K. and G. White. Northern Governments in Transition: Political and Constitutional Developments in the Yukon,  Nunavut and the Western Northwest Territories. The Institute for Research on Public Policy, Montreal, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 1988, the Federal Government Cabinet approved the health transfer policy framework for transferring resources for Indian health programs south of the 60th parallel to Indian control through a process which:&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

permits health program control to be assumed at a pace determined by the community, i.e., the community can assume control gradually over a number of years through a phased transfer;
enables communities to design health programs to meet their needs;
requires that certain mandatory public health and treatment programs be provided;
strengthens the accountability of Chiefs and Councils to community members;
gives communities:
the financial flexibility to allocate funds according to community health priorities and to retain unspent balances;
the responsibility for eliminating deficits and for annual financial audits and evaluations at specific intervals;
permits multi-year (three to five year) agreements;
does not prejudice treaty or Aboriginal rights;
operates within current legislation;
is optional and open to all First Nation communities south of the 60th parallel.

=== 1989 Treasury Board Authorities for Transfer ===
In 1989, Treasury Board approved the financial authorities and resources to support pre-transfer planning and to fund community health management structures.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Aboriginal Self-Government: Legal and Constitutional Issues. Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Ottawa, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The process is designed to occur within the present funding base of federal health programs for [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]] and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples. Communities are required to provide certain mandatory programs such as communicable disease control, environmental and occupational health and safety programs, and treatment services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/index-eng.php#agree-accord |title=Funding - Reports and Publications |work=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the enthusiasm for this process was varied. For some, it was seen as an important link to [[Self-Government]] where the community plans and controls health programs in their communities according to its own priorities. It was seen as a way to develop programs relevant to a community's own cultural and social needs. Others took a more hesitant approach. As the uptake of control of health services by First Nations increased, the Indian Health Transfer Policy began to be seen increasingly by First Nations people as a stepping stone towards the inherent right of Self-Government.&lt;ref name="healt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aboriginal health in Canada: historical, cultural, and epidemiological |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=O-jBWP_HgT8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Aboriginal+health+in+Canada:+historical,+cultural,+and+epidemiological&amp;ots=xUvBrZUKlN&amp;sig=dCHefz8KNuzAzZqU82wdnqRKdQI#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|work=By James Burgess Waldram, Ann Herring, T. Kue Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Transfer became the cornerstone of [[Health Canada]]'s relationship with First Nations and Inuit communities. Health Services Transfer Agreements between Health Canada and First Nation and Inuit provided the opportunity for communities or First Nations and Inuit organizations to manage their own health programs and services. At first, Transfer was the only option communities had for increasing their control over health programs and services beyond Contribution Agreements. Although many communities were interested in assuming increased control over health services and programs, not all communities were ready to move into this level of control so quickly. It became increasingly apparent that one design could not fit all the diversity of readiness. Some communities expressed interest in alternative strategies which would also give them increased control of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usask.ca/nursing/aboriginalglossary/i.htm|title=Aboriginal Health &amp; Cultural Diversity Glossary|work=usask}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year brought pressures for change and restructure in the transfer approach. First Nations and Inuit Health Branch searched for ways to respond to communities desiring to increase their control of community resources, either through the transfer process, or through other initiatives. This movement was further supported by a decision of the Departmental Executive Committee of Health Canada on March 15, 1994, which directed First Nations and Inuit Health Branch to commence planning all activities toward the following goals:

the devolution of all existing First Nations and Inuit Health Branch Indian health resources to First Nations and Inuit control within a time frame to be determined during consultations with First Nations and Inuit communities; moving First Nations and Inuit Health Branch out of the health care service delivery business; the transfer of knowledge and capacity to First Nation and Inuit communities so that they can manage and administer their health resources; a refocused role for First Nations and Inuit Health Branch; and a refocused role for Health Canada which will take into account First Nations and Inuit Health Branch's strategic direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/branch-dirgen/fnihb-dgspni/poli_1979-eng.php |title=Indian Health Policy 1979|work=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In further support the search for alternative pathways to transfer, in late 1994, [[Treasury Board]] approved the Integrated Community-Based Health Services Approach as a second transfer option for communities to move into a limited level of control over health services.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

1995 saw the distribution and implementation of Pathways to First Nations Control Report of Project 07 Strategic Planning Exercise. This cornerstone document set the essential differences between The Integrated Approach and Transfer. The Integrated Approach is an intermediate measure which provides more flexibility than Contribution Agreements, but less flexibility than the Transfer Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Canada. House of Commons Special Committee on Indian Self-Government. Second Report: Indian Self-Government in Canada. 1st Session, 32nd Parliament, Issue No. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] announced the inherent Right to Self-Government Policy . This policy recognizes First Nations and Inuit have the constitutional right to shape their own forms of government to suit their particular historical, cultural, political and economic circumstances. The policy thus introduced a third option for communities to further increase their control of health services.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, A.C. A New Partnership: Report of the Honourable A.C. Hamilton, Fact Finder. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Ottawa, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-governance gives Bands more flexibility to establish program priorities in response to tribal needs rather than following Federal program objectives. Bands are able to expand, consolidate and create new programs to improve services to their communities and to make certain laws governing their community with respect to health. Furthermore, the range of resources for health programs which can be included in a Self-Government arrangement is greater than those included in a Health Service Transfer arrangement and may eventually include fixed assets and services under the [[Non-Insured Health Benefits]] Program.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Joyce. "Constitutionalising the Patriarchy: Aboriginal Women and Aboriginal Government." 4 Constitutional Forum 110, Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The flexibility in terms of how resources are allocated is also greater and reporting requirements are fewer.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 1999-2000 Estimates, Part III – Report on Plans and Priorities, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

First Nations and Inuit peoples will determine the pace at which Self-Government arrangements proceed. Putting the arrangements in place will of course take time. The process will require intense local or regional negotiations between First Nations and Inuit peoples, the federal government and the provincial or territorial government concerned. Figure 3 depicts the status of First Nations and Inuit control activities at the close of the first decade of transfer, March 31, 1999. The uptake of transfer has steadily increased over the past decade the maps on figure 3 present a progressive overview of the rate of uptake of transfer by First Nation and Inuit communities starting in year one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caid.ca/IndHeaPol1979.pdf|title=About Health Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">An '''infection rate''' (or incident rate) is the [[probability]] or [[risk]] of an [[infection]] in a [[population]]. It is used to measure the [[Rate (mathematics)|frequency of occurrence]] of new instances of infection within a population during a specific time period.

[[File:Infection rate formula.jpg|center|500px||A formula that describes the incidence of infection within a population]]

The number of infections equals the cases identified in the study or observed. An example might by [[HIV|HIV infection]] during a specific time period in the defined population. The population at risk are the cases appearing in the population during the same time period. An example would be all the people in a city during a specific time period. The constant, or K is assigned a value of 100 to represent a percentage. An example would be to find the percentage of people in a city who are infected with HIV: 6,000 cases in March divided by the population of a city (one million) multiplied by the constant (K) would give an infection rate of 0.6%.
.
Calculating the infection rate is used to analyze trends for the purpose of infection and disease control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Calculation of Infection Rates|url = http://health.utah.gov/epi/diseases/HAI/resources/Cal_Inf_Rates.pdf |publisher = Utah Department of Health|date= 2017| accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online infection rate calculator has been developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] that allows the determination of the [[Streptococcus|Streptococcal A infection]] rate in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Group A Streptococcus Calculator | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= 4 July 2008 |url = https://www2a.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/abcs/calc/calc_new/calculator.html 
| accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical applications==
[[Health facility|Health care facilities]] routinely track their infection rates according to the guidelines issued by the [[Joint Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Basic Statistical Data Used in Acute Care Facilities | publisher = JB Learning | url = http://www.jblearning.com/samples/0763750344/45561_CH01.pdf | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hospital-acquired infection|healthcare-associated infection]] (HAI) rates measure infection of patients in a particular hospital. This allows rates to compared with other hospitals. These infections can often be [[Infection control|prevented]] when healthcare facilities follow guidelines for safe care. To get payment from [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], hospitals are required to report data about some infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Hospitals currently submit information on [[Central line-associated bloodstream infection|central line-associated bloodstream infections]] (CLABSIs), [[Catheter-associated urinary tract infection|catheter-associated urinary tract infections]] (CAUTIs), [[Surgical site infection|surgical site infections]] (SSIs), [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA Bacteremia]], and ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|C. difficile]]'' laboratory-identified events. The public reporting of these data is an effort by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) data | publisher = Medicare.gov| url = https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/Healthcare-Associated-Infections.html | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For meaningful comparisons of infection rates, populations must be very similar between the two or more assessments. However, a problem with mean rates is that they cannot reflect differences in risk between populations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= NHSN Standardized Infection Ratio |url = https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps-analysis-resources/nhsn-sir-guide.pdf | accessdate = 2017-01-09 | date= December 2016 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8700">The '''Integrated Opisthorchiasis Control Program''', commonly known as the "Lawa Project",  located in [[Khon Kaen Province]],  [[Thailand]], is an effort to reduce chronic infection by the Southeast Asian [[liver fluke]] (''[[Opisthorchis viverrini]]'') among the native peoples of [[Isan]] ({{lang-th|อีสาน}}; {{rtgs|''isan''}}), the northeast region of Thailand.&lt;ref name=Sripa2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sripa|first1=Banchob|last2=Tangkawattana|first2=Sirikachorn|last3=Laha|first3=Thewarach|last4=Kaewkes|first4=Sasithorn|last5=Mallory|first5=Frank F.|last6=Smith|first6=John F.|last7=Wilcox|first7=Bruce A.|title=Toward integrated opisthorchiasis control in northeast Thailand: The Lawa project|journal=Acta Tropica|date=January 2015|volume=141|pages=361–367|doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2014.07.017|pmc=4454771}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project operates under the  aegis of the Tropical Disease Research Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, [[Khon Kaen University]]. It is directed by [[Banchob Sripa]]. Its aim is to eliminate the practice of consuming raw or undercooked fish, the major cause of [[opisthorchiasis|liver fluke infection]] and [[cholangiocarcinoma|bile duct cancer]] in the region. The project is unique in that it follows the principles of [[EcoHealth]], a [[One Health]] approach to improving human and animal health. The project has been the subject of newspaper and TV reports by BBC, ''The New York Times'', and ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holmes|first1=Oliver|title=Thai doctor fights against carcinogenic raw fish dish that killed his parents|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/28/thai-doctor-fights-against-carcinogenic-raw-fish-dish-that-killed-his-parents|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 January 2018|language=en|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Head|first1=Jonathan|title=Thailand's deadly fish dish|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-33095945|work=BBC News|accessdate=24 January 2018|date=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Thomas|title=In Thailand, a Treasured Delicacy That Can Prove to Be Deadly|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE3DC1F31F934A15757C0A9679D8B63|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The area and population==
The project area consists of several villages around the ''Kaeng Lawa'' (Thai: แก่งละว้า), a lake and wetlands about 25 kilometers south of the city of Khon Kaen. The people's primary occupations are rice farming and fishing. The lake is a source of the [[Cyprinidae|cyprinid]] fish that the locals consume raw in dishes known as ''[[Koi (dish)|koi pla]]'' and ''pla som'', which are often infested with the cysts or [[metacercariae]] of the liver fluke. Cats and dogs also ingest the fish, making them hosts for the fluke. Northeast Thailand still has the highest incidence of bile duct cancer in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Cholangiocarcinoma Day 2018  CCA: The statistics|url=http://worldcholangiocarcinomaday.org/the-statistics/|website=worldcholangiocarcinomaday.org|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalence of ''O. viverrini'' infection in some villages in Khon Kaen Province has reached 100 percent.&lt;ref name=Sripa2015/&gt;
&lt;!--Kaeng Lawa (Kaeng Lawa) is a lake (class H - Hydrographic) in Changwat Khon Kaen (Khon Kaen), Thailand (Asia) with the region font code of Asia/Pacific. It is located at an elevation of 155 meters above sea level.

Its coordinates are 16°9'0" N and 102°40'59" E in DMS (Degrees Minutes Seconds) or 16.15 and 102.683 (in decimal degrees). Its UTM position is TC58 and its Joint Operation Graphics reference is NE48-13.

Current local time is 14:31; the sun rises at 08:08 and sets at 20:16 local time (Asia/Bangkok UTC/GMT+7). The standard time zone for Kaeng Lawa is UTC/GMT+7

==Lawa model==
The first attempts at opisthorchiasis control in Thailand began in the 1950s and included education on liver fluke infection and safe cooking, but these efforts had limited success since the consumption of raw fish dishes is an ingrained part of the rice-fish culture of the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=Sripa2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sripa|first1=Banchob|last2=Echaubard|first2=Pierre|title=Prospects and Challenges towards Sustainable Liver Fluke Control|journal=Trends in Parasitology|date=October 2017|volume=33|issue=10|pages=799–812|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2017.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of [[praziquantel]] in the 1980s, treatment became a part of the program. The prevalence of infection was reduced, but after funding reductions during the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|economic crises]] in the 1990s, prevalence rates rose again to as high as 85 percent in some areas of the northeast by 2009.&lt;ref name=Sripa2015 /&gt; In 2007, researchers at Khon Kaen University, led by Banchob Sripa, decided to take a more multidisciplinary approach, incorporating EcoHealth principles, which involve the collaboration of human and animal health specialists toward improving the health of people, animals and the environment as well as achieving greater understanding of how the ecosystem affects human and animal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sripa|first1=Banchob|last2=Tangkawattana|first2=Sirikachorn|last3=Sangnikul|first3=Thinnakorn|title=The Lawa model: A sustainable, integrated opisthorchiasis control program using the EcoHealth approach in the Lawa Lake region of Thailand|journal=Parasitology International|date=August 2017|volume=66|issue=4|pages=346–354|doi=10.1016/j.parint.2016.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lawa model" as it became known, involves community participation as a key element. Village health volunteers, staff of local sub-district hospitals, teachers, and others maintain a campaign of continuous education, teaching in the community and the schools about liver fluke disease and discouraging the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. The campaigns often involve "edutainment" activities (songwriting, dancing, and music) to attract public attention.

==Benefits==
After implementation of the Lawa model, the prevalence of infection declined from 67 percent  to 16 percent over three years in Lawa village with little reinfection after treatment, a common reason for failure in the past.&lt;ref name = Sripa2015/&gt; An intensive program in nine schools in the village reduced infection to undetectable levels. In 2012, the schools were certified as liver fluke free. Infection typically begins in childhood, leading to the lifelong chronic infection that often results in cancer.

An analysis conducted by the university on the [[social return on investment]] estimates a return of 3.47 relative to resources invested, with the primary benefit going to villagers and especially the children of the students who should avoid a lifetime of chronic infection and its possible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarnwong|first1=Auttapan|title=Analysis of Social Return on Investment Integrated Opisthorchiasis Control Using the  EcoHealth/ One Health Approach (Lawa Project)|date=June 2017|publisher=Office of the Research Promotion Program in  Higher Education and National Research Universities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such projects are hard to assess solely on the basis of an economic analysis.

'''Isolation''' ({{lang-de|Isolierung}}) is a [[defence mechanism]] in [[psychoanalytic theory]] first proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]].  While related to [[Psychological repression|repression]] the concept distinguishes itself in several ways.  It is characterized as a mental process involving the creation of a gap between an unpleasant or threatening cognition, and other thoughts and feelings.  By minimizing associative connections with other thoughts, the threatening cognition is remembered less often and is less likely to affect [[self-esteem]] or the [[self concept]].&lt;ref name = foo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F. |author2=Karen Dale |author3=Kristin L. Sommer|title=Freudian Defense Mechanisms and Empirical Findings in Modern Social Psychology: Reaction Formation, Projection, Displacement, Undoing, Isolation, Sublimation, and Denial|journal=Journal of Personality|date=1 December 1998|volume=66|issue=6|pages=1081–1124|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00043}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Freud illustrated the concept with the example of a person beginning a train of thought and then pausing for a moment before continuing to a different subject.  His theory stated that by inserting an interval the person was  "letting it be understood symbolically that he will not allow his thoughts about that impression or activity to come into associative contact with other thoughts."&lt;ref name=freud&gt;{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The standard edition of the complete works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. 20)|year=1961|publisher=Hogarth Press|location=London|pages=77–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a defense against harmful thoughts, isolation prevents the self from allowing these cognitions to become recurrent and possibly damaging to the self-concept.

==Evidence==
A wide range of studies supports the conclusion that people defend themselves against threats by mentally isolating them.  Repressors have been shown to process information in a rushed, shallow, or minimal fashion.&lt;ref name=bonanno&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=G. A.|author2=Davis, P. J. |author3=Singer, J. L. |author4=Schwartz, G. E. |title=The repressor personality and avoidant information processing: A dichotic listening study.|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=1991|volume=62|pages=386–401|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(91)90029-p }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When presented with some negative information, they will often generate spontaneous happy thoughts or feelings, minimizing its impact.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt; Depressed people process information much more thoroughly, whether it is good or bad. This high level of processing develops strong associative links with similar information.  When a depressed person tries to avoid a damaging cognition, they often think of some other negatively affecting thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=J. A.|author2=Weary, G.|title=Depression and the impression-forming continuum: Piecemeal processing despite the availability of category information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1993|volume=64|pages=636–645|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from human and animal studies shows that isolation prompts sensitivity to social threats and motivates the renewal of social connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = J. T. | last2 = Hawkley | first2 = L.C. | last3 = Norman | first3 = G.J. | last4 = Berntson | first4 = G.G. | year = 2011 | title = Social isolation | url = | journal = Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. | volume = 1231 | issue = | pages = 17–22 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06028.x| pmc = 3166409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study showed that people would remain satisfied with their performance in the face of negative feedback as long as they could keep the feedback isolated from performance standards.  The researchers would present the standards either before the performance, or after the performance but before the feedback, or after both the performance and the feedback. The people who received the standards early recalled them as well as the others, but simply ignored it.  They managed to isolate their feedback from the standards thereby minimizing the threat to their self-esteem.  Those who received the standards later were less satisfied with their performance, unable to avoid their lack of success as compared to the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schul|first=Y|author2=Schiff, M.|title=On the costs and benefits of ignorance: How performance satisfaction is affected by knowing the standard prior to performance|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1995|volume=21|pages=491–501|doi=10.1177/0146167295215007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of isolation has been referred to as trivializing.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;

Another noteworthy type of isolation is referred to as "temporal bracketing", in which some perceived failure or shortcoming is buried away in one's past, effectively removing its impact on the current self.  This type of separation from the past can be seen in religious conversion or "born again" experiences, in certain drug addiction recovery programs, and in the throwing away of delinquent files in the legal system.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  These socially accepted practices effectively make isolation socially permissible, at least in certain instances; and those behaviors seem to relieve some of the stress from past events.  People with low self-esteem often use temporal bracketing when describing past failures.  By isolating themselves from whatever misdeed they are bringing to cognition, they contend that it has nothing to do with their current state or relationships with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=R. F.|author2=Ilko, S. A.|title=Shallow gratitude: Public and private acknowledgment of external help in accounts of success|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=16|series=191-209|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1601&amp;2_12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect ===
Habitual repressors have been shown to have fewer unhappy memories than other people, but the difference rests in the secondary associations.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  Research of repressors concluded that they had equally strong negative reactions to bad memories, however those memories did not evoke other negative feelings as much as they did for non-repressors.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=R. D.|author2=Hansen, C. H.|title=Repression of emotionally tagged memories: The architecture of less complex emotions.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=55|pages=811–818|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.5.811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase, "architecture of less complex emotions" was created to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;&lt;ref name=hansen /&gt;  Repressors have bad memories just like anyone else, but are less troubled by them because they are relatively isolated in memory.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  The most current researchers have agreed that isolation is one of the more effective and important mechanisms of defense from harmful cognitions.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;  It is a coping mechanism that does not require delusions of reality, which makes it more plausible than some alternatives ([[denial]], [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], etc.).  Further research will be needed for accounts of isolation to be considered fully concrete.&lt;ref name=foo /&gt;

'''Lake Tisza''' ({{lang-hu|Tisza-tó}}), also known as '''Kisköre Reservoir''' (Hungarian: ''Kiskörei-víztározó''), is the largest [[artificial lake]] in [[Hungary]]. It is located at the southeastern edge of [[Heves (county)|Heves county]], next to counties  [[Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén]], [[Hajdú-Bihar]] and [[Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok]].

As part of the ongoing [[Tisza River]] [[flood]] control project, the [[Tisza Dam]] was built in 1973. Its filling was finished in the 1990s, resulting a 127&amp;nbsp;km² [[lake]]. The lake is 27&amp;nbsp;km in length, with an average depth of 1.3&amp;nbsp;m and a maximum depth of 17&amp;nbsp;m; it contains 43&amp;nbsp;km² of small [[island]]s.

Following the [[reservoir (water)|reservoir's]] completion, Hungarians began to flock to the site for holidays, since it compared favorably with the crowded and expensive [[Lake Balaton]], the traditional holiday site.  As a result, [[tourist]] infrastructure has been developed on the reservoir&amp;mdash;renamed Lake Tisza&amp;mdash;and the [[Politics of Hungary|government]] has designated it an official tourism destination.

The lake (or reservoir) has a new local [[ecology]] with a diversity of [[birds]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Lake Tisza Ecocentre in Poroszló was erected to collect and display the [[nature]] and [[wildlife]] of the Tisza River valley and Lake Tisza. It was opened to the public on 27 April 2012.

In the United States, no explicit legislation exists regarding an employer's obligation to monitor the safety of its lone or isolated employees except in the shipbuilding industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA_FS_3591.pdf], OSHA Shipbuilding Factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of Monitoring Lone Worker Safety==
Numerous methods have been developed and are currently in use by companies world-wide. These methods include:
* '''Phone-based check-in systems.''' Employees are required to call in to a designated receiver after a predetermined time. Check-ins are often performed hourly or bi-hourly. The two approaches to phone-based check-in systems are call centre-driven and cloud-based automated monitoring, which may use a [[Software as a service|software-as-a-service]] (SaaS) model.
* '''Buddy systems.''' Employees may be paired up to perform certain tasks. Theoretically, should an emergency occur and one of the employees be rendered incapacitated, the other would remain available to call for help and provide aid.
* '''Safety monitoring smartphone applications.''' With the widespread adoption of [[smart phones]], the deployment of a dedicated application allowing employees to quickly request aid has become more feasible. These applications may provide a [[panic button]] or allow for prompt check-in without requiring a phone call to be made.
* '''Safety monitoring devices.''' Dedicated monitoring devices for monitoring local environmental conditions, such as dangerous levels of gases, that smartphone-based Lone Worker monitoring solutions are unable to account for.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1892">'''Maria Weizmann''' ({{lang-ru|Мари́я Ве́йцман}}; born 1893) was a sister of Israeli politician and scientist [[Chaim Weizmann]] (the first President of the State of [[Israel]]). She graduated from a university in [[Switzerland]] and worked as a doctor in [[Moscow]] from 1915.

Maria Weizman and her husband V.M. Savitsky were long denied the right to emigrate from the [[Soviet Union]] by the authorities (see also [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|refusenik]]). Her husband was arrested in 1949.

On February 10, 1953 she was arrested in connection with the alleged [[Doctors' plot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=V-ZVcsl0h3EC&amp;pg=PA463|title=Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations|last=Trahair|first=R.

After [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death and the admission by the Soviet leadership that the "plot" was made up, she was still kept in [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]] prison, and released only on August 12, 1953. Weizmann immigrated to Israel in 1956.

She was officially rehabilitated after [[Perestroika]] in 1989.

'''Mosul Dam''' ({{lang-ar|سد الموصل}}), formerly known as '''Saddam Dam''' ({{lang|ar|سد صدام}}), is the largest [[dam]] in [[Iraq]].  It is located on the [[Tigris]] river in the western governorate of [[Ninawa Governorate|Ninawa]], upstream of the city of [[Mosul]]. The dam serves to generate hydroelectricity and provide water for downstream irrigation. At full capacity, the structure holds about {{convert|11.1|km3}} of water and provides electricity to the 1.7&amp;nbsp;million residents of Mosul.

The dam's main {{convert|750|MW|adj=on}} power station contains four {{convert|187.5|MW|adj=on}} [[Francis turbine]]–generators. A [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] power plant with a capacity of {{convert|250|MW}} and a [[run-of-the-river]] dam downstream with a {{convert|62|MW|sing=on}} capacity also belong to the Mosul Dam scheme. It is the fourth largest dam in the [[Middle East]], as measured by reserve capacity, capturing snowmelt from [[Turkey]], some {{convert|70|mi}} north.&lt;ref name=ENR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enr.cbonstruction.com/news/Front2003/archives/030505.asp| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030808092931/http://enr.construction.com/news/front2003/archives/030505.asp| archivedate=8 August 2003| title=Iraqi Dam Has Experts On Edge Until Inspection Eases Fears| last=Wright| first=Andrew G. |work=[[Engineering News-Record]]|date=5 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built on a [[karst]] foundation, concerns over the dam's instability have led to major remediation and rehabilitation efforts since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

== Characteristics ==
The Mosul Dam is a {{convert|113|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|3.4|km|abbr=on}} long earth-fill embankment-type with a clay-core. The width of the crest is {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}}. At an elevation of {{convert|330|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the reservoir, named Lake Dahuk, withholds {{convert|11100000000|m3|acre.ft||abbr=on|sigfig=3}} of water. Of that capacity {{convert|8100000000|m3|acre.ft||abbr=on|sigfig=2}} is active (or useful for power and downstream releases) and {{convert|2950000000|m3|acre.ft||abbr=on|sigfig=3}} is inactive (dead) storage. On the east side of the dam is the service [[spillway]] which is controlled by five [[radial gate]]s and has a maximum discharge capacity of {{convert|13000|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Further to the east is a [[fuse-plug]]-controlled emergency spillway with a {{convert|4000|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} capacity.&lt;ref name=multi/&gt;

At the toe of the dam on its west side is the main hydroelectric power station (Mosul 1). It contains four {{convert|187.5|MW|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} [[Francis turbine]]-generators for an installed capacity of 750 MW. Behind the power station are four [[surge tank]]s. Downstream of the dam is the Mosul regulation dam, which serves to regulate the tail-waters of the main dam but to generate electricity as well. The hydroelectric plant (Mosul 2) has an installed capacity of 62 MW with four 15.5 MW [[Kaplan turbine]]-generators. Immediately upstream of the dam is the 240 MW [[pumped-storage]] power station (Mosul 3). It serves as a [[peaking power station]] by pumping water to small reservoir above Lake Dahuk, storing it, then releasing the water back down to two 120 reversible-Francis turbines during peak energy usage. The entire Mosul multi-purpose project has an installed capacity of 1,052 MW.&lt;ref name=multi/&gt;

== History ==
=== Planning ===
[[File:Aski Mosul.gif|thumb|left|Historical Castle of Aski Mosul before being submerged by the dam's reservoir]]
Development of Iraq's rivers progressed rapidly in the mid-20th century as the country sought to control water resources for agriculture and to prevent flooding in [[Baghdad]]. Planning for the Mosul Dam began in the 1950s with the help of [[Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners]], a British firm who identified a location in 1953. In 1956, the Iraq Development Council contracted Koljian American to carry out studies for an irrigation dam at the location. The studies were completed the next year when Iraq asked the Harza Company to carry out a similar investigation who recommended a different location in 1960, based on [[karst]] foundations for two other recommended locations. In 1962, Iraq sought a third opinion from the Soviet Technoprom Export company who recommended a separate site. A fourth company, a Finland firm, Imatran Voima carried out a study in 1965 and a fifth company, Geotehnika of Yugoslavia, carried out studies in 1972. Based off the findings of all five companies which cited complex foundations, Iraq had a French firm, Soletanch, to carry out in-depth geological studies which occurred between 1974 and 1978. In 1978 the Swiss Consultants Consortium became the official consultants for the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nadhir Al-Ansari|author2=Issa E.

=== Construction ===
During [[Saddam Hussein]]'s rule, the construction of the Mosul Dam began in 1981 by a German-Italian consortium that was led by [[Hochtief]] Aktiengesellschaft. Because the dam was constructed on a foundation of soluble [[gypsum]], the engineers recommended thorough grouting within the foundation before the superstructure was built. Instead, to speed construction of the dam, engineers blanket-grouted {{Convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep around the foundation and a curtain {{Convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} directly below the dam.&lt;ref name=USACE&gt;{{cite web |author1=Julie R. Kelley |author2=Lillian D. Wakeley |author3=Seth W. Broadfoot |author4=Monte L. Pearson |author5=Christian J. McGrath |author6=Thomas E. McGill |author7=Jeffrey D. Jorgeson |author8=Cary A.

Construction was complete in 1984 and in the spring of 1985, the Mosul Dam began to inundate the [[Tigris River]], filling the reservoir which submerged many archaeological sites in the region. The power station began generating power on 7 July 1986. Because of significant structural stability issues associated with the Mosul Dam, ongoing grouting and additional construction and repairs are necessary. In 1988, Iraq began construction on the [[Badush Dam]] downstream which would serve the primary purpose of absorbing and releasing a Mosul Dam flood wave in the event of a breach. Works were halted in 1991 though due chiefly to UN sanctions.&lt;ref name=daniel&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Pipes |url=http://www.danielpipes.org/5107/saddams-damn-dam-ie-the-mosul-dam |title=Saddam's Damn Dam |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/worries-grow-over-mosul-dam/304195.article|title=Worries grow over Mosul Dam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demolition concerns during the 2003 invasion ===
[[File:Mosul Dam chute spillway.jpg|thumb|Chute [[spillway]] with ski jump section to dissipate the energy of the rushing water]]
In early April 2003, following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] by a U.S.-led coalition, military intelligence had developed several scenarios, including one in which Iraqi forces would have wired the dam for detonation. This would release the {{convert|110|m|adj=on}} high waterline of the lake reservoir, to reach Mosul in about two hours. Subsequent investigation found nearly 500 dam workers to still be at work nearly a month after pay had stopped being distributed.

=== 2014 takeover of dam by ISIS ===
{{Main|Battle for Mosul Dam}}
For several weeks in July and August 2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS or ISIL) held Mosul Dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tilghman |first=Andrew |date=2 September 2014 |title=Islamic State still threat to Mosul Dam, Pentagon says |url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20140902/NEWS05/309020056/Islamic-State-still-threat-Mosul-Dam-Pentagon-says |newspaper=Army Times |accessdate=16 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 2014, the organization captured the dam complex from the [[Peshmerga]]. ISIL's control of the dam created fears that its power supply could be restricted or that its water flows to downstream areas would be greatly inhibited. In a less likely scenario, there were worries the dam could be breached, causing widespread flooding and destruction downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/world/middleeast/isis-forces-in-iraq.html?_r=0 | title=Rebels Captured Iraq's Largest Dam | date=7 August 2014 | agency=New York Times | accessdate=7 August 2014 | author=Rubin, Alissa J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/mosul-dam-control-terrifying-dam-iraq-life-death/story?id=24878057 | title=Why Control of a Terrifying Dam in Iraq Is Life or Death for Half Million People | date=7 August 2014 | agency=ABC News | accessdate=7 August 2014 | author=Ferran, Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2014, the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Army launched a successful operation to retake control of the dam from ISIL militants. [[United States]] airstrikes assisted the Kurdish and Iraqi military, damaging or destroying 19 vehicles belonging to ISIS, as well as striking an ISIL checkpoint near the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28826349 | title=Kurdish forces 'retake Mosul dam' from IS militants | date=17 August 2014 | agency=BBC News | accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instability and remediation ==
The earthen [[embankment dam]] is located on top of [[gypsum]], a soft mineral that dissolves in contact with water. Continuous maintenance is required to plug, or "[[grout]]", new leaks with a liquefied slurry of cement and other additives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a090905ms3.html "Mosul Dam Repairs Benefit Tigris Basins"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101034648/http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a090905ms3.html |date=2007-11-01 }}, defendamerica.mil, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; More than {{convert|50000|t}} of material have been injected into the dam since leaks began forming shortly after the reservoir was filled in 1986, and 24&amp;nbsp;machines currently continuously pump grout into the dam base. Between 1992 and 1998 four sinkholes formed downstream of the dam and a fifth sinkhole developed east of the dam in February 2003 that was filled several times. In August 2005 another sinkhole developed to the east.&lt;ref name=USACE/&gt;

A September 2006 report by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] noted, "In terms of internal erosion potential of the foundation, Mosul Dam is the most dangerous dam in the world." The report further outlined a worst-case scenario, in which a sudden collapse of the dam would flood Mosul under {{convert|65|ft}} of water and [[Baghdad]], a city of 7&amp;nbsp;million, to {{convert|15|ft}}, with an estimated death toll of 500,000.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/29/AR2007102902193.html?hpid=topnews "Iraqi Dam Seen In Danger of Deadly Collapse"] by Amit R. Paley, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A report on 30 October 2007 by the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) said that the dam's foundations could give way at any moment.&lt;ref name=bbcmosuladam1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7070706.stm#infographic "Iraq dismisses Mosul Dam warnings"] BBC news, October 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "One study says that if the dam collapses, Mosul would be submerged within hours. Another warns that half a million Iraqis could be killed by floodwaters, and more than a million forced from their homes. Disease and looting as the floodwaters raced through [[Baiji, Iraq|Baiji]], [[Tikrit]], [[Samarra]], and even parts of [[Baghdad]] would complete that dreadful scenario."&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; Nadhir al-Ansari, an engineer involved in the building of the dam who is currently Professor of Engineering at the [[Luleå University of Technology]], Sweden, said that the floodwaters would take four hours to reach Mosul and 45 hours to reach Baghdad, and that more than a million people would be killed if a "good evacuation plan" were not in place.&lt;ref name="graun2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borger|first1=Julian|title=Mosul dam engineers warn it could fail at any time, killing 1m people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/mosul-dam-engineers-warn-it-could-fail-at-any-time-killing-1m-people|accessdate=2 March 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, dam manager Abdulkhalik Thanoon Ayoub ordered the dam's water level, which can reach {{convert|330|m|ft|0}} above sea level, to have a maximum of {{convert|319|m}}, thus reducing the pressure on the structure. Nevertheless, Iraqi officials maintain that the U.S. government is overstating the risk. The Army Corps of Engineers has proposed that the [[Badush Dam]] downstream be completed to serve its purpose of obstructing the large wave that would result if the Mosul Dam collapsed. This has been resisted by Iraqi officials, who note that the current plan for the Badush Dam is US$300&amp;nbsp;million to provide hydroelectric power and help irrigation while the proposed expansion would cost $10&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=wapo /&gt;

In 2007, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] developed and executed a US$27&amp;nbsp;million plan to help continue maintenance and repairs on the dam in the short-term. The Iraq Government was also recommended a long-term solution that  includes the construction of {{Convert|67|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep walls around the dam foundation. The project would cost $4 billion and take approximately four to five years to complete.&lt;ref name=daniel /&gt;

===Renewed instability concerns following ISIL control===
Maintenance had been deferred during the [[Battle for Mosul Dam]] due to security concerns, and many workers did not work both because of the risk of attacks by ISIL and lack of pay. Half of the workers who worked at the dam have quit because they had not been paid for more than five months, and budget shortfalls and political infighting between the Kurdish regional government and the central government of Iraq have made it difficult to hire new workers. Together these factors have made Mosul Dam the "most dangerous dam in the world", because there are "almost certainly an unprecedented level of untreated voids" in the dam's foundation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Most dangerous dam’ facing collapse, threatens half million in Mosul: U.S. Army|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/02/10/world/dangerous-dam-facing-collapse-threatens-half-million-mosul-u-s-army/#.VtSfNPkrLIV|accessdate=29 February 2016|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[Japan Times]]|date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing instability concerns due to the previous control of the dam by ISIL, and poor security led the Iraq government to award a US$2 billion contract to an Italian company, Trevi, in December 2015. The contract covers repairs to the dam and the Italian government plans to send 450 additional troops to provide security at the dam site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title=Italy to send 500 soldiers to defend Iraq's largest dam in Mosul|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/12053500/Italy-to-send-500-soldiers-to-defend-Iraqs-largest-dam-in-Mosul.html|accessdate=30 December 2015|work=Telegraph|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, U.S. General [[Sean MacFarland]] warned that the dam might undergo a "catastrophic" collapse. He added, "What we do know is this—if this dam were in the United States, we would have drained the lake behind it."&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mosul dam: A watery time-bomb: The most dangerous dam in the world |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21692903-most-dangerous-dam-world-watery-time-bomb|accessdate=14 February 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance had suffered as ISIL had removed equipment and chased technicians away in August 2014, and the grouting schedule had not been maintained.&lt;ref name=reuters0128&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/iraqs-mosul-dam-could-face-catastrophic-collapse-top-121320504.html |agency=[[Reuters]] |title=Iraq's Mosul dam could face catastrophic collapse: top U.S. general |publisher=News.Yahoo.com |date=January 28, 2016 |accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated that contingency plans are in the works to protect people downstream in case of a collapse.&lt;ref name=reuters0128 /&gt; Some Iraqi officials continued to dismiss claims of a potential failure. In February 2016, the Minister of Water Resources, Muhsin al-Shammari, stated "The looming danger to Mosul dam is one in a thousand. This risk level is present in all the world's dams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq's water minister judges only tiny danger of Mosul dam collapse|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-mosul-dam-idUSKCN0VF0VE|accessdate=29 February 2016|agency=Reuters|date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the [[United States Embassy in Iraq]] warned of a "serious and unprecedented" danger of the dam collapsing and suggested that plans for evacuation should be made, as the cities [[Mosul]], [[Tikrit]], [[Samarra]], and [[Baghdad]] could be at risk in the event of collapse, and that up to 1.5 million people could be killed due to the ensuing [[flash floods]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35690616 BBC News (2015) US warns of Mosul dam collapse in northern Iraq, February 29th]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prime Minister of Iraq]], [[Haider al-Abadi]], repeated these concerns, and called for citizens in Mosul to evacuate and move at least 3.5 miles away from the river,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borger|first1=Julian|title=Iraqi PM and US issue warnings over threat of Mosul dam collapse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/iraq-us-issue-warnings-threat-of-mosul-dam-collapse|accessdate=29 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a proposal that was criticized by Professor al-Ansari: "What are all these people, millions of people, supposed to do when they get 6&amp;nbsp;km away? There is no support for them there. Nothing to help them live."&lt;ref name="graun2" /&gt;

On February 29, a Trevi spokesman said that the contract had still not been signed. There were concerns that the dam could collapse before the repair works begin.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt; On March 2, 2016, the Iraqi government announced that the contract with Trevi was finalized and signed.&lt;ref name="JBorgG3-2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borger|first1=Julian|title=Mosul dam engineers warn it could fail at any time, killing 1&amp;nbsp;m people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/mosul-dam-engineers-warn-it-could-fail-at-any-time-killing-1m-people|accessdate=4 March 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of Italian specialists from Trevi arrived on April 14 to set up camp for the group of engineers who are expected to arrive within a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italian team arrives as part of Mosul Dam emergency repair |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/italian-team-arrives-as-part-of-mosul-dam-emergency-repair-project/|accessdate=April 18, 2016|publisher=CBS News|date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Italian Defence Minister]] [[Roberta Pinotti]] met Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on May 9 to discuss logistics for deploying 450 troops near the frontline with ISIL to protect the workers carrying out repairs on the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italian defense minister in Iraq for Mosul dam talks |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=517&amp;nID=99006&amp;NewsCatID=352|accessdate=May 18, 2016|work=Hurriyet Daily News|date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevi started working on the dam in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mosul battle may cost ‘the most dangerous dam in the world’ |url=https://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/features/2016/10/20/Is-Mosul-hosting-one-of-most-dangerous-dams-in-the-world-.html|author=Francesca Astorri|accessdate=28 December 2016|publisher=Al-Arabiya|date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repairs were started in October 2016. In May 2017, Iraqi [[Ministry of Water Resources (Iraq)|Minister of Water Resources]] Hassan Janabi stated that no danger to the dam remained and it was going back to normal operation. Carlo Crippa, the project manager, said the dam structure now showed no significant signs of distress. However, constant maintenance will be necessary, as "the rocks of the foundations are prone to dissolution due to the circulation of water." Five waterways that controlled the flow of water into the dam became operational after 12 years, with Janabi saying the water level was at the highest level since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/mosul-dam-no-longer-brink-catastrophe/3839850.html|title=Mosul Dam No Longer on Brink of Catastrophe|first=Rikar|last=Hussein|agency=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins with a man waking up in decrepit old house in an unknown area. He gets a call from his wife enquiring where he is. The man doesn't know where he and searches the house for a cigarette. He accidentally opens a room and finds it filled with Russian soilders. One of the them starts chasing him and opens fire at him. The man gets shot in the leg and jumps into a bathtub he finds in the snow.
The man wakes up in a bathtub. The man is revealed to be'K' ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) a wealthy businessman in his 30s, and a heavy chain-smoker. He is confident, narcissistic and very arrogant in nature. His family and friends beg him to quit smoking, to no avail. K's friend Abbas ([[Ranvir Shorey]]) and his doctor ([[Kiku Sharda]]), offer to set up an appointment at a rehabilitation centre called 'Prayogshaala' ('The Laboratory'), which they claim will surely rid K of his habit. K finally relents after his wife Anjali ([[Ayesha Takia]]) leaves him, unable to take the strain K's smoking addiction places on their relationship.

K decides to check out Prayogshaala, and meets Shri Shri Prakash Guru Ghantal Baba Bengali Sealdahwale ([[Paresh Rawal]]). The centre operates behind the front of another business, 'Kalkatta Karpets'. K finds the building to be unconventional and confusing, similar to a [[Labyrinth]]. The method Prayogshaala uses to cure their patients of their addiction is based on fear and psychological manipulation. Each time a patient gives in to their vice, Baba makes sure that something shocking happens to them.

The first offense is almost killing a loved one, by keeping him/her in a chamber full of cigarette smoke the person has smoked in his entire life, for a duration of 5 minutes.
The second offense is losing a finger.
The third offense is the death of a loved one.
The last offense is taking the soul of the person from his body, although this offense is described very loosely.

K initially refuses to sign the contract and pay the fee of {{INR}} 21,11,111 for his treatment but is forced to do so by Baba and his disciples. Baba then tells K that he is free to leave, but he must abide by the rules or he will suffer the consequences. K witnesses other members of the group as they try to quit smoking. Many end up losing fingers as they cannot resisit the urge to smoke.
K tries to keep to the terms but fails twice and is punished. He is now very conscious about the third time.

After some time, K meets an old friend, Alex, who is now a Cuban cigar seller. At an event, K is forced to place a cigar in his mouth, in order to appease his friend. Seconds later, he receives a phone call from the police, who inform him that his wife is missing and possibly dead. He calls Baba and is told that for smoking, his wife will be killed, as per the rules. He protests that he did not actually smoke and Baba apologizes for the mistake, but says it is too late. K asks Baba to tell the police about this, but the line goes dead and the phone number is non-existent on dialling. K's protests are ignored and the police believe that he is delusional. Trying to prove his story, he seeks out Abbas, who had lost a finger at the rehabilitation centre, only to find that the man has all fingers intact. Mocking him, the police force K to smoke. Shortly afterwards, K gets a phone call that his brother committed suicide due to his smoking habit. K raves angrily at the police and is thrown in the jail.

K is eventually bailed out. Soon, he learns that Baba permits sins and vices to be done during a period known as 'Zero Minute'. He attends an event, where he sees Baba, but is unable to reach him. K decides to light a cigarette. Suddenly, K wakes up in a Russian army base, with a call from his wife. She asks him why he believes she is dead. K is confused, but escapes from the base by jumping into water and ends up in a ragged room, from which he sees himself staring out from a hospital room. He also sees his wife and Baba. He calls out but no one can hear him, and he is told that it is because his body no longer hears his inner soul. The final punishment is complete.

In a series of haphazard events, the twisted path of K's soul is shown, until it finally reaches his body once again. K wakes up in his home to find his wife sleeping near him. He also discovers that he is missing two fingers. Later, K is seen recommending the "Prayogshala" centre to a friend.

==Production==

===Development===
The idea for the film came during the making of ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'' (1998), when director [[Ram Gopal Varma]] pitched a story about a chain smoker's encounter with someone who despises smoking. Varma later incorporated his own idea of the story as a short segment in his anthology film, ''[[Darna Mana Hai]]'' (2003). During the shooting of Kashyap's ''[[Black Friday (2007 film)|Black Friday]]'', his assistant narrated him a different script about a chain smoker who wakes up without cigarettes and is unable to get any because of a curfew.&lt;ref name=ns10/&gt; Kashyap decided to take the story forward, taking inspiration from ''Quitters, inc'' and a surreal moment from ''Cats Eye'', subsequently making him develop the story into a darker and more unreal version.

===Casting===
After the scripting was complete in 2006, Kashyap narrated the film to [[Shahrukh Khan]], who was keen to do the film but later would back out for unknown reasons. When the deal fell through Kashyap who was in bad shape at the time, as one of his films were delayed and the other stuck in production, tried to get a hold of all the top actors, though none of them responded except for Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking passes from Shahrukh to John|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/gupshup/2007/no-smoking-shahrukh-john-abraham-041007.html|publisher=''[[Oneindia.in]]''|author=[[Taran Adarsh]]|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishal Bhardwaj]], Kashyap's friend and producer of the fiim recommended [[Saif Ali Khan]], as he was part of the smoking segment in ''Darna Mana Hai'', though Kashyap had already finalised Abraham. Later false reports surfaced that Saif be appearing in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]], on the request of co-producer Kumar Mangat, who worked together in ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saif and Bipasha: No butts please|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-07-21/news-interviews/27990194_1_saif-ali-khan-bipasha-basu-saif-and-bipasha|publisher=''[[Times of India]]''|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saif Ali Khan is not doing 'No Smoking'|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20070726-2.html|publisher=Apunkachoice|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the film having a complex storyline, when Kashyap was auditioning Abraham he read him a badly written fake script title ''Lapata'' (Lost), which Abraham declined to. After which he read him the real script of ''No Smoking'', he immediately agreed to do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='No Smoking will create a genre|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/oct/23slid4.htm|publisher=''[[Rediff.com]]''|author=Patcy N|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Takia was not comfortable with the love making scenes and the clothes of the secretary (Annie), though Kashyap refused to make any changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Our cinema is immature'|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/oct/24anurag.htm|publisher=''[[Rediff.com]]''|author=Patcy N|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a scene where Abraham is seen nude from rear, this stirred up some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Abraham to do a nude scene for No Smoking|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/1179640/John-Abraham-to-do-a-nude-scene-for-No-Smoking|publisher=''[[Bollywood Hungama]]''|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=19 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham who had previously quit smoking, smoked up to 90 cigarettes a day during the shooting to give the film a more believable look. Later when the film was complete Abraham went for an X-ray and found his lungs were heavily damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoking turns John Abraham's lungs black|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/features/2007/john-lungs-turns-black-191007.html|publisher=''[[Oneindia.in]]''|author=Upala KBR|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally director [[Rajkumar Santoshi]] was set to make his acting debut by playing the role of the doctor, and writer [[Abbas Tyrewala]] was to play the role later given to Shorey, hence Kashyap named the character after the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rajkumar Santoshi to act in No Smoking|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/1174279|publisher=''[[India Fm]]''|author=|date=31 October 2006|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Most of the filming was done in unique ways. In one scene where Abraham and Shorey are seen as teenagers smoking [[Marijuana]], most directors would have used child actors but Kashyap decided instead to alter the appearance of the actors and make them improvise and behave as kids themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='No Smoking' defies convention|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20071025-4.html|publisher=Apunkachoice|author=Nikhil Kumar|accessdate=16 August 2012|date=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot extensively in parts of the [[Russian Federation]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Siberia]], in extremely cold climates with temperatures of minus 25 [[Celsius|degrees Celsius]] (°C), despite this none of the crew members had any problems during the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking to be shot in Russia|url=http://businessofcinema.com/bollywood-news/ino-smokingi-to-be-shot-in-russia/|publisher=''Businessofcinema''|author=Johnny Vaz|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Abraham shoots in chilly climate|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20070122-2.html|publisher=Apunkachoice|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the shooting in Uzbekistan, a Russian actor dressed as a soldier had to chase Abraham. After running 200 meters the man collapsed, as the shooting was on high altitudes, there was a lack of oxygen. He had to be rushed to the hospital, as he had stopped breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='I am doing films that are more meaningful'|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/oct/23slid4.htm|publisher=''[[Rediff.com]]''|author=Patcy N|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

====India====
The film was heavily panned by Indian critics. ''[[Sify]]'' gave it 2 out of 5 stars saying "You try so hard to understand what ''No Smoking'' tries to say, but the film is like one big puzzle that refuses to get solved. John makes a sincere attempt to leave a mark and succeeds to an extent. Really, one wonders, what prompted John to instantly approve this bizarre story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/no-smoking-review-bollywood-14549765.html|publisher=''[[Sify]]''|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajeev Masand]] of ''[[IBN Live]]'' giving it 1.5/5 said "What the director gives us is an extremely arrogant piece of work that reeks of over-confidence and self-proclaimed genius. How else do you explain the intentionally incohesive screenplay, the bizarre dialogue, and the blatant disregard for the viewer's time and patience?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking Review|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/review-no-smoking-is-a-colossal-disappointment/51232-8.html|publisher=''[[IBN Live]]''|author=[[Rajeev Masand]]|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikhat Kazmi]] of ''[[Times of India]]'' also gave it 1.5/5 stars and said "''No Smoking'' leaves you completely baffled and desperately looking for logic in its surreal sequences of John in a jaded jail, John in a tunnel, John in a bathtub, John in Siberia-like surroundings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/hindi/No-Smoking/movie-review/2493801.cms|publisher=''[[Times of India]]''|author=[[Nikhat Kazmi]]|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indu Mirani from ''[[DNA India]]'' rated it 1.5/5 saying "There is a fine line between intelligence and indulgence and with ''No Smoking'', director Anurag Kashyap crosses it often. It’s not like he has made a rank bad film, but ‘No Smoking’ is so influenced by graphic novels and Neil Gaiman books, that understanding its plot’s many forward and backward movements would be out of the scope of the layman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No smoking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mobile/report.php?n=1130068|publisher=''[[DNA India]]''|author=Indu Mirani|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid Mohamed]] of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' rated it 1 star and said "Too in-depth man, too in-depth, puffing, driving, the sex act, fingers being chopped.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = “I was extremely angry and bitter after ''No Smoking''. People reviewed me rather than the movie. It was a new kind of film and while it was getting international recognition, in my own country it was being ripped apart. I learnt a lesson though and it was that if you have to do something new, you have to go step by step. First and foremost, look at how the film would recover money. ''No Smoking'' was an expensive film and it hurts"

The film was made on huge budget and at the time when it sank at the box office, the director Kashyap fell into depression not expecting the critics to lash at it.&lt;ref name=ns4/&gt; He admitted that most of the audience expected to see a film about quitting smoking and that pre release the extensively played item song featuring Basu gave audience the wrong type of image as they expected her to play the lead role opposite Abraham.&lt;ref name=ns2/&gt; In 2011 Kashyap stated that ''No Smoking'' was his favourite, of all his films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anurag Kashyap: I loved No Smoking the most|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-part-two-interview-of-anurag-kashyap/20110905.htm|publisher=''[[Rediff.com]]''|author=Aseem Chhabra|date=5 September 2011|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No Smoking has been played at several [[Film festivals]]. It was played at the Indian film festival and won multiple awards, after being repeatedly screened. The film was also played at various venues in [[Beijing]], ([[China]]) and [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=ns8/&gt;

''No Smoking'' is notable as being the only [[Bollywood]] film which can have multiple interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is your Interpretation|url=http://interpretationofnosmoking.blogspot.in/2010/03/interpretaion-of-no-smoking-by-anurag.html|publisher=blogspot|accessdate=1 February 2015|date=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashyap explained that the film has nothing to do with quitting smoking but relatively about the state of mind, which refers to the [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or the [[Mental health|mental state]] of the films [[protagonist]], K.

===Reception===
The soundtrack album received critical acclaim. Abhishek Singh from ''Planet Bollywood'' said "Over all, as expected, the music turns out to be daringly different and in complete contrast to anything that you might have ever listened. Almost all the songs carry the message of the film along and for that reason only, one can’t be sure of this album on a stand alone basis but seen along side the concept of the movie, it sure hits the bulls eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking music review|url=http://www.planetbollywood.com/displayReview.php?id=101407073113|publisher=''Planet Bollywood''|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joginder Tuteja from ''[[India Fm]]'' said "With music by Vishal Bhardwaj and lyrics by Gulzar saab, one expects an unconventional soundtrack in the offering. Well, unconventional it is and in at least a couple of places, exciting too! This has to be one of the most original tracks ever written. 'Jab Bhi Cigarette' is the opening song of the album and may well be termed as the title song of the album".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking - Music Review|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/music/reviews/2007/no-smoking-music-review-021107.html|publisher=''[[Oneindia.in]]''|author=Joginder Tuteja|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satyajit from ''Glamsham'' said "''No Smoking'' dares to be different for chartering unexplored territories and have surprises in raucously driven vivacious tracks like “Phoonk De” and “Jab Bhi Cigarette”. [[Rekha Bhardwaj]]’s peculiar nasal twang will be garnering major spotlight in “Phoonk De (club mix) with chartbusting success after her subtle and submissive ''[[Laaga Chunari Mein Daag]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music Review : No Smoking|url=http://www.glamsham.com/music/reviews/13_music_review_no_smoking_100701.asp|publisher=''Glamsham''|author=Satyajit|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osteoblast milk protein''' ('''OMP''', {{zh|造骨牛奶蛋白}}) is the name used by [[Mengniu]], a Chinese dairy company, for a [[milk protein]] used as a [[food additive]] in their Milk Deluxe ({{zh|s=特伦苏|t=特倫蘇|p=Telunsu}}) since 2005.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/099200903021022.htm|title=Health official says milk additive OMP safe but not legal|date=2009-03-02|work=[[The Hindu]] via [[Xinhua]]|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supposed to help the absorption of [[calcium]] and promote [[bone growth]] in the [[osteoblast]]s and prevent [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="Ang"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/12/china-milk-investigation/|title=China milk investigation|last=Ang|first=Audra|date=2009-02-12|work=[[The Washington Times]] / [[Associated Press|AP]]|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the safety of OMP was questioned by the [[General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine]] (AQSIQ), national quality supervision department in China, when they were doing a general clean-up on the use of food additives after the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]] where [[melamine]] was found in some milk products.&lt;ref name="Ang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wei"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/02/11/afx6037577.html|title=China says probing two firms on milk products|last=Wei|first=Michael|author2=Lucy Hornby |author3=Ben Blanchard |author4=ed.

A director of the [[Guangdong Dairy Industry Association]] said that OMP is seldom used in milk products overseas and no conclusion about the impact of OMP on human health has been proven globally.

According to Mengniu and the Ministry of Health, OMP is made from milk by degreasing by [[Skimmer (machine)|skimming]] and [[Membrane technology|membrane filtration]] and its major components are [[lactoferrin]] and [[lactoperoxidase]].&lt;ref name="caijing1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hk"&gt;{{cite press release |title=LCQ11: Dairy products containing OMP and IGF-1 |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200903/04/P200903040156.htm |publisher=[[Government of Hong Kong]] |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on Nov 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of patients diagnosed with [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] or [[gonorrhea]] by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner.&lt;ref name=EPTFinalReport2006&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/EPTFinalReport2006.pdf Expedited Partner Therapy in the Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (2 February 2006)] U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention&lt;/ref&gt;

EPT may also include other forms of implementation than PDPT.&lt;ref name=EPTFinalReport2006/&gt;

==Efficacy==
PDPT works as an addition to the usual ''patient referral'', the latter being that the [[index patient]] has a responsibility for informing sex partners of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection.&lt;ref name=trelle/&gt; PDPT significantly reduces the risk of persistent or recurrent infection compared with patient referral alone; a review found that addition of PDPT gives a [[relative risk]] of 0.73, with a 95% [[confidence interval]] of 0.57 to 0.93.&lt;ref name=trelle&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trelle S, Shang A, Nartey L, Cassell JA, Low N |title=Improved effectiveness of partner notification for patients with sexually transmitted infections: systematic review |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7589 |pages=354 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17237298 |pmc=1801006 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39079.460741.7C |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitfalls include that EPT may compromise the quality of care provided to partners, especially when used as a first-line approach for partners who would otherwise seek clinical services. For instance, the medication could cause serious adverse reactions, including allergy, which could have been foreseen by a visit to a health care provider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdph.ca.gov/pubsforms/Guidelines/Documents/CA-STD-PDPT-Guidelines.pdf Patient-Delivered Partner Therapy for [[Chlamydia trachomatis]] and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Interim Guidance for Medical Providers in California] California Department of Public Health.

'''Princess Tsehai Haile Selassie''' (13 October 1919 – 17 August 1942) was the third daughter and fourth child of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] and Empress [[Menen Asfaw]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]].

==Biography==
Princess Tsehai was born in [[Addis Ababa]]. She often accompanied the Emperor to public events during his exile in [[Great Britain]] (1936–1941), where she trained as a nurse at [[London]]'s [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children]]. She graduated as a state registered children's nurse on 25 August 1939. After the restoration of her father in 1941, she married Lieutenant-General (later Brigadier-General) ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Lij]]'' [[Abiye Abebe]], and moved with him to [[Welega Province]] when he was appointed governor there.

She later worked at [[Dessie]] Hospital in [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]].

Princess Tsehai died in [[Nekemte]] on 17 August 1942, from complications during childbirth. Her baby did not survive. She was buried in the crypt of the [[Ba'eta Le Mariam Monastery]] in Addis Ababa that had been built as the mausoleum church of Emperor [[Menelik II]].&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned by her father in his ''Life and Ethiopia's Progress'' (translated by [[Edward Ullendorff]] [Chicago: Research Associates, 1999]), at p.&amp;nbsp;296. Ullendorff's note provides some details about her and Abiye Abebe's lives.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Haile Selassie founded the Princess Tsehai Memorial Hospital in her memory, which also served as a nursing school. After the [[Ethiopian Civil War|1974 revolution]], the hospital was renamed the [[Armed Forces General Hospital (Ethiopia)|Armed Forces General Hospital]].

Female [[breast]] '''ptosis''' or sagging is a natural consequence of [[Ageing|aging]]. The rate at which a woman's breasts drop and the degree of ptosis depends on many factors. The key factors influencing breast ptosis over a woman's lifetime are [[cigarette]] smoking, her [[gravidity|number of pregnancies]], [[gravity]], higher [[body mass index]], larger [[bra]] cup size, and significant weight gain and loss.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Breast Ptosis: Causes and Cure |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=579-584 |date= May 2010 |url=https://journals.lww.com/annalsplasticsurgery/Abstract/2010/05000/Breast_Ptosis__Causes_and_Cure.16.aspx |doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181c39377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Post-menopausal women or people with collagen deficiencies (such as [[ehlers-danlos|Ehlers-Danlos]]) may experience increased ptosis due to a loss of skin elasticity. Many women and medical professionals mistakenly believe that [[breastfeeding]] increases sagging. It is also commonly believed that the breast itself offers insufficient support and that wearing a [[bra]] prevents sagging which has not been found to be true.&lt;ref name=stuart/&gt;

[[Plastic surgeons]] categorize the degree of ptosis by evaluating the position of the [[nipple]] relative to the [[inframammary crease|infra-mammary fold]], the point at which the underside of the breasts attach to the chest wall. In the most advanced stage, the nipples are below the fold and point towards the ground.

== Breast structure ==
{{main|breast}}
Anatomically, a female's [[breast]]s do not contain any [[muscle]] but are composed of soft, glandular tissue. Breasts are composed of [[mammary gland]]s, [[Lactiferous duct|milk duct]]s, [[adipose tissue]] (fat tissue) and [[Cooper's ligaments]].

Mammary glands remain relatively constant throughout life. Fat tissue surrounds the mammary glands, and its volume will normally vary throughout life. Although the exact mechanisms that determine breast shape and size are largely unknown,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page |first1=KA |last2=Steele |first2=JR |title=Breast motion and sports brassiere design: Implications for future research |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=205–211 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10367331 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=0112-1642&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=205|doi=10.2165/00007256-199927040-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount and distribution of fat tissue and, to a lesser extent, mammary tissue, cause variations in breast size, shape and volume. The Cooper's ligaments offer minimal [[connective tissue]] to support the breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theboobuddy.com/pages/the-coopers-ligament |title=The Cooper's Ligaments |website=Boobuddy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
{{See also|Women and smoking#Unique gender differences and health effects for females}}

[[University of Kentucky]] [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] Brian Rinker encountered many women in his practice who attributed their sagging breasts to [[breastfeeding]], which was also the usual belief among medical practitioners.&lt;ref name=lauersen&gt;{{cite book |last=Lauersen |first=Niels H. |title=The Complete Book of Breast Care |year=1998 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine/Ballantine |location=New York |isbn=978-0-449-91241-6 |author2=Stukane, Eileen |quote=...there is no medical reason to wear a bra, so the decision is yours, based on your own personal comfort and aesthetics. Whether you have always worn a bra or always gone braless, age and breastfeeding will naturally cause your breasts to sag.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to find out if this was true, and between 1998 and 2006 he and other researchers interviewed 132 women who were seeking [[breast augmentation]] or breast lifts. They studied the women's medical history, [[body mass index]] (BMI), their [[gravidity|number of pregnancies]], their [[Cleavage (breasts)|breast cup size]] before pregnancy, and smoking status. The study results were presented at a conference of the [[American Society of Plastic Surgeons]].&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asj.2008.07.004 |laysummary=http://www.livescience.com/1998-breastfeeding-breasts-sag-study-suggests.html |laysource=LiveScience |laydate=November 2, 2007 |title=The Effect of Breastfeeding on Breast Aesthetics |year=2008 |last1=Rinker |first1=B |last2=Veneracion |first2=M |last3=Walsh |first3=C |journal=Aesthetic Surgery Journal |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=534–537 |pmid=19083576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rinker's research, there are several key factors. A history of [[cigarette]] smoking "breaks down a protein in the skin called [[elastin]], which gives youthful skin its elastic appearance and supports the breast." The number of [[gravidity|pregnancies]] was strongly correlated with ptosis, with the effects increasing with each pregnancy.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; As most women age, breasts naturally yield to [[gravity]] and tend to sag and fold over the [[inframammary crease]], the lower attachment point to the chest wall. This is more true for larger-breasted women. The fourth reason was significant weight gain or loss (greater than {{convert|50|lb}}).&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; Other significant factors were higher [[body mass index]] and larger [[bra]] cup size.&lt;ref name=rinker2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinker |first1=Brian |last2=Veneracion |first2=Melissa |last3=Walsh |first3=Catherine P. |title=Breast Ptosis |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |date=March 2010 |page=1 |doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181c39377 |pmid=20354434 |volume=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rinker's study, 55% of respondents reported an adverse change in breast shape after pregnancy. Many women mistakenly attribute the changes and their sagging breasts to breastfeeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sagging Breasts |url=http://www.channel4embarrassingillnesses.com/conditions/sagging-breasts/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502011827/http://www.channel4embarrassingillnesses.com/conditions/sagging-breasts/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 May 2008 |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result some are reluctant to nurse their infants. Research shows that breastfeeding is not the factor that many thought it was.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; Rinker concluded that "Expectant mothers should be reassured that breastfeeding does not appear to have an adverse effect upon breast appearance."&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt; Also discounted as causes affecting ptosis are weight gain during pregnancy and lack of participation in regular upper body exercise.&lt;ref name=rinker2/&gt;

=== Effect of vigorous exercise ===

When running, breasts may move three dimensionally: vertically, horizontally and laterally, in an overall figure-8 motion. Unrestrained movement of large breasts may contribute to sagging over time.&lt;ref name=medbroadcast&gt;{{cite web| first=Amy |last=Toffelmire| title=Why do breasts sag? |url=http://www.medbroadcast.com/channel_section_details.asp?text_id=5822&amp;channel_id=1003&amp;relation_id=4536 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |publisher=MedBroadcast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion studies have revealed that when a woman runs, more than 50% of the breast's total movement is vertical, 22% is side-to-side, and 27% is in-and-out.&lt;ref name=calf&gt;{{cite web |title=Healthy Breast: Why You Should Wear Sports Bras on Every Workout? |url=http://www.calfreduction.net/content/healthy-breast%3A-why-you-should-wear-sports-bras-every-workout%3F |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found that encapsulation-type [[sports bra]]s, in which each cup is separately molded, are more effective than compression-type bras, which press the breasts close to the body, at reducing total breast motion during exercise. Encapsulation bras reduce motion in two of the three planes, while compression bras reduce motion in only one plane.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02640414.2010.497542 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070915124901.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=September 23, 2007 |title=The effect of breast support on the kinematics of the breast during the running gait cycle |year=2010 |last1=Scurr |first1=Joanna C. |last2=White |first2=Jennifer L. |last3=Hedger |first3=Wendy |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1103–1109 |pmid=20686995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, it was commonly believed that a woman with small to medium-size breasts benefited most from a compression-type sports bra, and women with larger breasts need an encapsulation-type sports bra.&lt;ref name=calf/&gt;

A woman's breasts change in size, volume, and position on her chest throughout her life. In young women with large breasts, sagging may occur early in life due to the effects of gravity. It may be primarily caused by the volume and weight of the breasts which are disproportionate to her body size.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;

=== Impact of pregnancy ===

During pregnancy, the [[ovaries]] and the [[placenta]] produce [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]. These hormones stimulate the 15 to 20 [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]] of the [[Mammary gland|milk-secreting glands]] in the breasts to develop. Women who experience [[gravidity|multiple pregnancies]] repeatedly stretch the skin envelope during engorgement while [[lactation|lactating]]. As a woman's breasts change in size during repeated pregnancies, the size of her breasts change as her mammary glands are engorged with milk and as she gains and loses weight with each pregnancy.&lt;ref name=medbroadcast/&gt; In addition, when milk production stops (usually as a child is [[weaned]]), the voluminous mammary glands diminish in volume, but they still add bulk and firmness to the breast.  A 2010 review found that weight gain during pregnancy and breastfeeding were not significant risk factors for ptosis. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rinker|first=Brian|last2=Veneracion|first2=Melissa|last3=Walsh|first3=Catherine P.|date=2010-5|title=Breast ptosis: causes and cure|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354434|journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery|volume=64|issue=5|pages=579–584|doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181c39377|issn=1536-3708|pmid=20354434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle-aged women ===
[[File:Saggy Breast.jpg|thumbnail|Severe ptosis]]
In middle-aged women, breast ptosis is caused by a combination of factors. If a woman has been pregnant, postpartum [[Hormone|hormonal]] changes will cause her depleted [[Lactiferous duct|milk glands]] to atrophy. Breast tissue and suspensory ligaments may also be stretched if the woman is overweight or loses and gains weight. When these factors are at play, the breast [[prolapse]]s, or falls forward. When a woman with sagging breasts stands, the underside or inferior skin of the breast folds over the [[inframammary crease|infra-mammary fold]] and lies against the chest wall. The nipple-areola complex tends to move lower on the breast relative to the inframammary crease. The nipple of the breast may also tend to point downward.

=== Post-menopausal women ===

In post-[[menopause|menopausal]] women, breast atrophy is aggravated by the inelasticity of over-stretched, aged skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=De la Torre |first=J. I. |title=Breast Mastopexy |year=2009 |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1273551-overview#showall |accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to the reduction in [[estrogen]], which affects all body tissues, including breast tissue. The loss of estrogen reduces breast size and fullness. Estrogen is also essential to maintaining a fibrous protein called [[collagen]], which makes up much of the breast's connective tissue.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Ptosis scale ===

[[File:Stades de affaissement.png|thumb|right|Stages of ptosis]]

Plastic surgeons describe the degree of breast sagging using a ''ptosis scale'' like the modified ''Regnault ptosis scale'' below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Younai|first=S. Sean|title=Breast Sagging - Ptosis|url=http://www.beautifulself.com/breastlift_ptosis.htm|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parker/&gt;

* ''Grade I: Mild ptosis''—The nipple is at the level of the infra-mammary fold and above most of the lower breast tissue.
* ''Grade II: Moderate ptosis''—The nipple is located below the infra-mammary fold but higher than most of the breast tissue hangs.
* ''Grade III: Advanced ptosis''—The nipple is below the inframammary fold and at the level of maximum breast projection.
* ''Pseudoptosis''—The nipple is located either at or above the [[inframammary crease|infra-mammary fold]], while the lower half of the breast sags below the fold. This is most often seen when a woman stops nursing, as her milk glands atrophy, causing her breast tissue to sag.
* ''Parenchymal Maldistribution''—The lower breast tissue is lacking fullness, the inframammary fold is very high, and the nipple and areola are relatively close to the fold. This is usually a developmental deformity.&lt;ref name=parker&gt;{{cite web|title=Anatomy of Breast Ptosis – How Breasts Sag |url=http://www.parkercenter.net/breast-enhancements-new-jersey/breast_lift_new_jersey/anatomy-of-breast-ptosis/ |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bras and ptosis ==
{{main|Brassiere}}

Since breasts are an external organ and do not contain muscle, exercise cannot improve their shape. They are not protected from external forces and are subject to gravity. Many women mistakenly believe that breasts cannot anatomically support themselves and that wearing a [[brassiere]] will prevent their breasts from sagging later in life.&lt;ref name="007b Breast"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.007b.com/why_wear_bras.php |title=Female Intelligence Agency: Why do women wear bras? |website=007b Breast |accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers, bra manufacturers, and health professionals cannot find any evidence to support the idea that wearing a bra for any amount of time slows breast ptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.007b.com/sagging.php |title=Female Intelligence Agency: What causes sagging of breasts?|website=007b Breast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bra manufacturers are careful to claim that bras only affect the shape of breasts while they are being worn.&lt;ref name="007b Breast"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cawthorne&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Cawthorn |title=Bras, the Bare Facts |publisher=Channel 4 |date=November 2000 |url=http://breathing.com/articles/brassieres-2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box

}}
Robert Mansell, a professor of surgery at the [[University Hospital of Wales]], in [[Cardiff]], reported that, "Bras don't prevent breasts from sagging, with regard to stretching of the breast ligaments and drooping in later life, that occurs very regularly anyway, and that's a function of the weight, often of heavy breasts, and these women are wearing bras and it doesn't prevent it." John Dixey, at the time [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Playtex]], agreed with Mansell. "We have no medical evidence that wearing a bra could prevent sagging, because the breast itself is not muscle so keeping it toned up is an impossibility."&lt;ref name=stuart&gt;{{cite news|last=Stuart|first=Julia|title=Don't burn your bra just yet |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/dont-burn-your-bra-just-yet-622008.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=4 February 2012 |date=November 2, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two small studies provide some indication that wearing a bra may have an overall negative effect on sagging breasts. In a Japanese study, 11 women were measured wearing a standardised fitted bra for three months. They found that breasts became larger and lower, with the underbust measurement decreasing and the overbust increasing, while the lowest point of the breast moved downwards and outwards. The effect was more pronounced in larger-breasted women. This may be related to the particular bra chosen for the experiment, as there was some improvement after changing to a different model.&lt;ref name=ashizawa&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ashizawa K, Sugane A, Gunji T |title=Breast form changes resulting from a certain brassière |journal=Journal of Human Ergology |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |date=June 1990 |pmid=2092072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical treatment ==
{{main|Mastopexy}}

Some women with ptosis choose to undergo [[plastic surgery]] to make their breasts less ptotic. Plastic surgeons offer several procedures for lifting sagging breasts. Surgery to correct the size, contour, and elevation of sagging breasts is called [[mastopexy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|plastic|128|Mastopexy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breastbook.com/excerpts.htm |first=Dr. R. Scott |last=Smith |title=Fuller Breasts: A Woman's Guide to Breast Augmentation |publisher=Breastbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women can also choose [[breast implants]], or may undergo both procedures. The breast-lift procedure surgically elevates the [[parenchyma|parenchymal tissue]] (breast mass), cuts and re-sizes the skin envelope, and transposes the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere. If sagging is present and the woman opts not to undergo mastopexy, implants are typically placed above the muscle, to fill out the breast skin and tissue. Submuscular placement can result in deformity. In these cases, the implant appears to be high on the chest, while the natural breast tissue hangs down over the implant.

'''Stratton parker syndrome''' is a rare disorder characterized by short stature, [[wormian bones]] (extra cranial bones), and [[dextrocardia]] (displaced heart).&lt;ref name="orphan"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Check Orphan| title=Short stature wormian bones dextrocardia| accessdate=2011-09-27| url=http://checkorphan.com/disease/short-stature-wormian-bones-dextrocardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other symptoms include [[dermatoglyphics]], tooth deformities or missing teeth, abnormal kidney development, shortened limbs, mental retardation, undescended testes or [[cryptorchidism]], and [[anal atresia]].&lt;ref name="orphan"/&gt; The condition was first described by Stratton and Parker in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stratton RF, Parker MW |title=Growth hormone deficiency, wormian bones, dextrocardia, brachycamptodactyly, and other midline defects |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=169–73 |date=February 1989 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320320205 |pmid=2564736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been only four reported cases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Endocrine Abstracts| title=Growth hormone deficiency and complex congenital abnormalities: a further case of Stratton-Parker syndrome?| last1=Simmgen| first1=M.| last2=Bano| first2=G.| last3=Nussey| first3=S.| year=2006| volume=12| id=P86| accessdate=2011-09-27| url=http://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0012/ea0012p86.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cases of the syndrome were reported by [[Gilles-Eric Seralini]] in 2010 after having been contacted in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mesnage | first1 = R. | last2 = Clair | first2 = E. | last3 = Spiroux De Vendomois | first3 = J. | last4 = Seralini | first4 = G.

==Design==
The study is following about 500,000 volunteers in the UK, enrolled at ages from 40 to 69.
Initial enrollment took place over four years from 2006, and the volunteers will be followed for at least 30 years thereafter.

Prospective participants were invited to visit an assessment centre,
at which they completed an automated questionnaire and were interviewed about lifestyle, medical history and nutritional habits; basic variables such weight, height, blood pressure etc. were measured; and blood and [[urine]] samples were taken. These samples were preserved so that it was possible to later extract [[DNA]] and measure other biologically important substances.  During the whole duration of the study it was intended that all disease events, drug prescriptions and deaths of the participants are recorded in a database, taking advantage of the centralized UK [[National Health Service]].&lt;ref name=draft&gt;[http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/docs/draft_protocol.pdf Draft protocol for the UK Biobank] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214144838/http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/docs/draft_protocol.pdf |date=2006-02-14 }}, 14 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index/strategy-strategy/strategy-science_strategy/strategy-strategy_implementation/strategy-government_spending_review_initiatives/strategy-biobank.htm Reviewers' comments on Draft protocol, and responses]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial physical examination, basic feedback was provided to the participant regarding their weight, height, BMI, [[blood pressure]], lung [[vital capacity]], [[bone density]] and [[intra-ocular pressure]]; however if any other medical problems were detected, neither the participant nor their physician would be notified. Problems detected later, such as genetic risk factors, were not conveyed to either participant or physician ("to ensure that volunteers are not penalised by insurance companies, for example, which may require customers to disclose the results of any genetic tests.").&lt;ref name=ns&gt;Andy Coghlan: [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18925353.800 One million people, one medical gamble]. ''[[New Scientist]]'', 20 January 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012, researchers were able to apply to use the database (though they are not given access
to the volunteers, who will remain strictly anonymous).
A typical study using the database might compare a sample of participants who developed a particular [[disease]], such as [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]], with a sample of those that did not, in an attempt to measure the
benefits, risk contribution and interaction of specific [[genes]], lifestyles, and medications.

In 2017 researchers were able to access the database including genetic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609184/uk-biobank-supercharges-medicine-with-gene-data-on-500000-brits/|title=UK Biobank supercharges medicine with gene data on 500,000 Brits|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|date=2017-11-15|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By 2017 Biobank participants had approximately 1.3 million hospitalisations, 40,000 cancer incidents with 14,000 of them  having died.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Littlejohns|first=Thomas J.|last2=Sudlow|first2=Cathie|last3=Allen|first3=Naomi E.|last4=Collins|first4=Rory|title=UK Biobank: opportunities for cardiovascular research|url=https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehx254/3836952|journal=European Heart Journal|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehx254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

An incremental approach was adopted to developing the study procedures and technology, using systems designed and developed by the [[Clinical Trial Service Unit]].  This consisted of a series of pilot  studies of increasing complexity and sophistication with interludes for assessment of results and additional scientific input.  In-house trials were conducted during 2005, and a fully integrated clinic was run at [[Altrincham]], Greater Manchester throughout Spring 2006 where 3,800 individuals were assessed.  On August 22, 2006, it was announced that the main programme would recruit men and women aged between 40 and 69 based from up to 35 regional centres.,&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Sarah Hall: [https://www.theguardian.com/science/story/0,,1855468,00.html £61m medical experiment begins] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; however recruitment proved more efficient than hoped and only 22 centres had been opened when the recruitment target of 500,000 was reached in 2010.

==Initial information collected==

The study was initially launched with a visit consisting of the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* A [[paperless]] [[consent]] process
* A [[touchscreen]] questionnaire on [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] and general health
* Touchscreen tests of [[memory]]
* An interview with a [[nurse]] on detailed medical history
* Measurement of [[blood pressure]]
* Measurement of sitting and standing heights
* Measurement of weight
* Body composition measurement using impedance
* Measurement of grip-strength
* Breath [[spirometry]]
* [[Ultrasound]] bone densitometry of the heel
* Collection of [[blood]] and [[urine]] samples

Once the visit-based assessment method was proven, the range of investigations was extended to include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Test of hearing discrimination
* Measurement of arterial pulse-wave velocity
* Measurement of [[visual acuity]]
* Measurement of [[intra-ocular pressure]]
* Lens refractometry
* Fundus image of [[retina]]
* [[Optical coherence tomography]] scan of retina
* [[Electrocardiogram]] during exercise
* Collection of [[saliva]] sample
* Dietary assessment

==Ethics and governance==

The UK Biobank project operates within the terms of an Ethics and Governance Framework.&lt;ref name=EGF&gt;[http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/docs/EGF20082.pdf UK Biobank Ethics and Governance Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227054532/http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/docs/EGF20082.pdf |date=2008-12-27 }}.

''[[BBC News]]'', 24 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Framework describes a series of standards to which UK Biobank will operate during the creation, maintenance and use of the resource and it elaborates on the commitments that are involved to those participating in the project, researchers and the public more broadly. The independent UK Biobank Ethics and Governance Council provides advice to the project and monitors its conformity with the Framework.&lt;ref name=WTEGC&gt;[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2004/WTX022802.htm Ethics and Governance Council formed to oversee UK Biobank] ''[[Wellcome Trust]]'', 1 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Council also advises more generally on the interests of research participants and the general public in relation to the project.

The UK Biobank Board is accountable to the members of the company (the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] and The [[Wellcome Trust]]) and acts as company directors and as charity trustees. It is chaired by Prof Sir [[Michael Rawlins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Biobank Board|url=http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/uk-biobank-board/|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==

Following the initial pilot stage in the 2005-6 period, the main study began in April 2007 and by the end of that year 50,000 people had taken part.
Recruitment reached 100,000 in April 2008, 200,000 in October 2008, 300,000 in May 2009, 400,000 in November 2009 and passed the 500,000 target in July 2010. Participant enrolment was declared complete in August 2010.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5270478.stm Biobank set for national roll out]. ''[[BBC News]]'', 21 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The volunteers were largely healthy, wealthy and white European. Rather than recruiting more participants into the biobank, the organisation is helping other institutions establish and run similar initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How 500,000 Britons are critical to assessing global disease risk |url=https://www.ft.com/content/80c82a0a-a48f-11e8-8ecf-a7ae1beff35b?emailId=5b7bce24992e45000493055c |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=22 August 2108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

The UK Biobank dataset was opened to applications from researchers in March 2012.&lt;ref name = BBC2012&gt;(30 March 2012) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17553931 UK biobank opens to researchers] BBC News, Health, Retrieved 30 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
The resource is available to scientists from the UK and outside, whether they work in the public or private sector, for industry, academia or a charity, subject to verification that the research is health-related and in the public interest. Researchers are required to publish their results in an open source publication site or in an academic journal and return their findings to the UK Biobank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
By April 2017 4,600 researchers had registered to use the resource, over 880 applications had been submitted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/approved-research/|title=Approved research summary|last=|first=|date=2017-05-31|website=UK Biobank|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 430 research projects were completed or underway. 130 peer-reviewed articles based on the UK Biobank data had been published by January 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/published-papers/|title=Published papers, Featured Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=UK Biobank|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==

Since the completion of recruitment several new types of data have been added:

* During 2011-12 participants who supplied an email address were asked to assist by completing web-based dietary questionnaires, with the aim of combining a series of daily 'snapshots' to form a picture of overall nutrition.  176,012 of the participants responded at least once and 27,535 completed four questionnaires over a 16-month period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* During 2012-13 25,000 participants at the Stockport centre were asked to attend the assessment centre to repeat the initial measurements. It was intended to repeat these assessments every few years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* In 2013 to 2015, Axivity AX3 tri-axial wrist physical activity monitors were distributed to 100,000 participants, which recorded week-long triaxial acceleration at 100 Hz.&lt;ref&gt;(2015) [http://axivity.com/case-studies/biobank UK Biobank; Large Scale Data Collection] Axivity company web page, Retrieved 30 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This data was centrally processed, and listed on the Data Showcase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169649] Large Scale Population Assessment of Physical Activity Using Wrist Worn Accelerometers: The UK Biobank Study&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=1008] UK Biobank Data Showcase - Physical activity measurement&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 and 2015 120,000 participants completed a questionnaire on cognitive functions. Four of the tests were repeats of the initial assessment and two tests (symbol digit substitution and trail making) were new.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* In 2015 and 2016, 117,500 participants completed questionnaires  on occupational history and related medical information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* In 2016 and 2017 137,400 participants completed questionnaires on mental health events including subjective well-being estimates, psychotic experiences, self-harm behaviours, traumatic events  and cannabis  and alcohol use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A genomic assay of 820,967 SNPs was conducted on the participants blood samples. Data from an initial 150,000 participants were released in 2015, the remainder in July 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welsh|first=Samantha|last2=Peakman|first2=Tim|last3=Sheard|first3=Simon|last4=Almond|first4=Rachael|date=2017-01-01|year=|title=Comparison of DNA quantification methodology used in the DNA extraction protocol for the UK Biobank cohort|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-016-3391-x|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=18|pages=26|doi=10.1186/s12864-016-3391-x|issn=1471-2164|pmc=5217214|pmid=28056765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/what-happens-when-you-put-500000-peoples-dna-online/543747/|title=What Happens When You Put 500,000 People's DNA Online|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|date=2017-11-06|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the first results in October 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0579-z |title = The UK Biobank resource with deep phenotyping and genomic data|journal = Nature|volume = 562|pages = 203–209|year = 2018|last1 = Clare|first1 = B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0571-7 |title = Genome-wide association studies of brain imaging phenotypes in UK Biobank|journal = Nature|volume = 562|pages = 210–216|year = 2018|last1 = Elliott|first1 = L.T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* Information from UK registries of [[death]] (from 2006) and [[cancer]] (Scotland from 1957, England and Wales from 1995) were linked to the main Biobank dataset on an ongoing basis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Data from [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital inpatient records (England from 1996, Scotland from 1997 and Wales from 1998) were linked to the main dataset on an ongoing basis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ongoing developments==

In 2018 a number of projects were underway to generate additional data:

* A set of additional assays on the blood and urinary samples were being conducted in 2016 and 2017&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with blood results expected to be released in Q4/2018.
* A new type of assessment centre opened in 2014 to collect imaging data. The visits extended the initial dataset to include magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]) scans of brain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nn.4393 |title = Multimodal population brain imaging in the UK Biobank prospective epidemiological study|journal = Nature Neuroscience|volume = 19|pages = 1523–1536|year = 2016|last1 = Miller|first1 = K.L.|pmc = 5086094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.034 |title = Image processing and Quality Control for the first 10,000 brain imaging datasets from UK Biobank|journal = NeuroImage|volume = 19|pages = 1523–1536|year = 2016|last1 = Alfaro-Almagro|first1 = F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv |last1=Alfaro Almagro |first1=F. |date=25 April 2017 |title=Image Processing and Quality Control for the first 10,000 Brain Imaging Datasets from UK Biobank |biorxiv=130385}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chest regions, whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ([[DXA]]) scan of bones and joints, ultrasound measurements of the [[carotid]] arteries and resting 12-lead electrocardiogram ([[ECG]]). Initial data on 4,000 participants was released at the end of 2015 and by mid-2018 over 25,000 participants had been scanned. It is planned to scan 100,000 participants by 2022, and to do additional repeat scans on 10,000 of these 2-3 years later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A subset of 2500 participants are being asked to repeat the Activity Study at quarterly intervals for a year to gauge the size of seasonal affects.

==Future plans==

In 2018 there were several plans, either provisional or underway, for enhancing the resource:

* Primary care data (such as referrals, diagnoses and prescriptions) were planned to be made available in 2018-2019.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Linking data from [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital outpatient records and GP to the main dataset were being investigated in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Linkages to disease-specific registries and screening programs were also being investigated in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Exome sequencing is underway with the first batch of 50,000 sequences due to be released in mid-2019.
* Full genome sequencing was being investigated with a pilot project underway.

==Opinion==

The project has been generally praised for its ambitious scope and unique potential. A [[peer review|scientific review]] panel concluded, the "UK Biobank has the potential, in ways that are not currently available elsewhere, to support a wide range of research".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; [[Colin Blakemore]], chief executive of the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|MRC]], predicted it "will provide scientists with extraordinary information" &lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and "grow into a unique resource for future generations." &lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

There was some early criticism, however. GeneWatch UK, a [[pressure group]] that claims to promote the responsible use of genetic information, asserted that the complexity of the programme could result in the finding of "false links between genes and disease",&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; and expressed concern that the genetic information from patients could be [[patent]]ed for commercial purposes. Biobank's chief executive described such a risk as "extremely low, if it exists at all." &lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

The method of recruiting participants was also initially controversial. Participants were sent letters of invitation based on names, addresses, and dates of birth provided by the NHS to the UK Biobank organisers. Although compliant with UK data protection law,&lt;ref name="DataProtection"&gt;[http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/faqs/contacted.php Why have you contacted me?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329101030/http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/faqs/contacted.php |date=2010-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some people objected to the NHS passing on such data to third parties without explicit consent, and also had concerns about the data security in such a large project.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Funding==
The UK Biobank is funded by the [[Department of Health (UK)|UK Department of Health]], the Medical Research Council, the [[Scottish Executive]], and the [[Wellcome Trust]] medical research charity. The cost of the initial participant recruitment and assessment phase was 62 million [[GBP]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3326762/62m-Biobank-may-not-be-worth-it-says-professor.html Daily Telegraph 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VA VISTA Architecture.png|thumb|The VISTA Architecture is an "Onion" with concentric layers of functions. At its core is a single shared database that all applications use. ]]

The '''Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)''' is the nationwide veterans clinical and business information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. VISTA consists of 180 applications for clinical, financial, and administrative functions all integrated within a single database, providing single, authoritative source of data for all veteran-related care and services. The U.S. Congress mandates the VA keep the veterans health record in a single, authoritative, lifelong database, which is VISTA. 

VISTA supports the clinical, administrative, and financial operations of over 1200 hospitals and clinics of the [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VA Health Care |url=http://www.va.gov/health }}&lt;/ref&gt; The VHA is the largest integrated health delivery network in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nation's Largest Healthcare System Pledges Involvement in Healthy Hospital Initiative |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/8822edaadaba0243852572a000656841/66a4a31db7c1ae178525703d0067d18b!OpenDocument | publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (Sep 2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing care for over 8 million veterans by 180,000 medical professionals throughout the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii on a single, integrated national healthcare information network of VISTA systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Veterans Health Administration – Locations |url=http://www2.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VISTA was developed by physician-developer teams within the U.S. [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA), and as such has high physician user satisfaction.  VISTA received the Computerworld [[Smithsonian Award]] for best use of Information Technology in Medicine in 1995, and continues to receive the highest overall physician satisfaction scores in national Electronic Health Record (EHR) surveys.  In 2014 and again in 2016  national surveys of over 15,000 physician end-users of EHRs rated VISTA/CPRS the highest overall, above all other commercial EHR systems.&lt;ref name="MedscapeSurvey2016"&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Peckham C, Kane L, Rosensteel S|title=Medscape EHR Report 2016: Physicians Rate Top EHRs|url=http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/public/ehr2016|website=[[Medscape]]|accessdate=27 August 2017|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 65% of all physicians trained in the U.S. rotate through the VHA and use VISTA/CPRS, making VISTA the most familiar [[Electronic health record|EHR]] in the U.S. 

==Features==

VISTA is a patient-centric integrated inpatient-outpatient enterprise health information system.  VISTA was originally named the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) because it was implemented prior to the existence of the Internet when all computers were decentralized.  VISTA is an integrated database and application server, and includes [[CPOE|computerized order entry]], [[bar code]] medication administration, [[electronic prescribing]], and [[Guideline (medical)|clinical guidelines]].

Originally, VISTA had a terminal interface accessible only via a keyboard. In 1997 a Windows-based,  mouse-driven [[graphical user interface]] called the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) was added. CPRS provides a [[client–server]] interface that allows health care providers to review and update a patient's electronic medical record.  CPRS provides flexibility in a wide variety of settings so that a consistent [[Window (computing)|Windows]] interface is presented to a broad spectrum of health care workers.

== Achievements ==
For its development of VistA, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) / [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA) was named the recipient of the prestigious Innovations in American Government Award presented by the Ash Institute of the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in July, 2006. The VistA electronic medical records system is estimated to improve efficiency by 6% per year, and the monthly cost of the [[Electronic health record|EHR]] is offset by eliminating the cost of even a few unnecessary tests or admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effect of the implementation of an enterprise-wide Electronic Health Record on productivity in the Veterans Health Administration |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=7C274D08947B0625B3B540BEF2E70367.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=416400 | doi = 10.1017/S1744133105001210 | pmid= 18634688 | volume=1 | issue=Pt 2 |date=April 2006 | journal=Health Econ Policy Law | pages=163–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VistA:Winner of the 2006 Innovations in American Government Award |url=http://www.innovations.va.gov/innovations/docs/InnovationsVistAInfoPackage.pdf |publisher=The Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University's John F.

== Licensing and dissemination ==
The VistA system is [[public domain]] software, available through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom Of Information Act]] directly from the VA website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VistA – VHA Office of Health Information |url=http://www.ehealth.va.gov/VistA.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120183324/http://www.ehealth.va.gov/VistA.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; or through a growing network of distributors, such as [http://code.osehra.org/gitweb/?p=VistA-M.git;a=tree;f=Packages the OSEHRA VistA-M.git tree].

== VistA modules and projects ==

=== Database backend ===
VistA was developed using the M or [[MUMPS]] language/database. The VA currently runs a majority of VistA systems on the proprietary [[InterSystems]] [[Caché (software)|Caché]] version of MUMPS, but an [[open source]] MUMPS database engine, called [[GT.M]], for [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] computers has also been developed. Although initially separate releases, publicly available VistA distributions are now often bundled with the GT.M database in an integrated package. This has considerably eased installation. The free, open source nature of GT.M allows redundant and cost-effective failsafe database implementations, increasing reliability for complex installations of VistA.

=== Database projections ===
An open source project called [http://www.esiobjects.org/ EsiObjects] has also allowed the (ANSI- Standard) MUMPS language and database technology to evolve into a modern object-oriented language (and persistent-object store) that can be integrated into mainstream, state-of-the-art technologies. For the Caché MUMPS database, a similar object-oriented extension to MUMPS called [[Caché ObjectScript]] has been developed. Both of these have allowed development of the MUMPS database environment (by programmers) using modern object-oriented tools.

[http://vistapedia.net/index.php?title=M2Web_Overview M2Web] is an open source web gateway to MUMPS for use with VistA.

A free open source module from [http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/main/index.html M/Gateway] called MGWSI has been developed to act as a gateway between GT.M, Cache, or M21 MUMPS databases and programming tools such as PHP, ASP.NET, or Java, in order to create a web-based interface.

=== Patient Web Portal ===
[http://www.myhealth.va.gov/ MyHealtheVet] is a web portal that allows veterans to access and update their personal health record, refill prescriptions, and schedule appointments. This also allows veterans to port their health records to institutions outside the VA health system or keep a personal copy of their health records, a [[Personal health record|Personal Health Record (PHR)]].

=== VistA Imaging ===

The Veterans Administration has also developed [[VistA imaging|VistA Imaging]], a coordinated system for communicating with [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]] (radiology imaging) systems and for integrating others types of image-based information, such as EKGs, pathology slides, and scanned documents, into the VistA electronic medical records system. This type of integration of information into a medical record is critical to efficient utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Imaging Economics, Skokie, IL (USA) |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.imagingeconomics.com/issues/articles/2002-12_01.asp |title=PACS Lessons Learned at the Baltimore VA |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used independently or integrated into the VistA electronic health record system (as is done in VA health facilities).

== Deployments and uses ==

=== Role in development of a national healthcare network ===

The VistA electronic healthcare record has been widely credited for reforming the VA healthcare system, improving safety and efficiency substantially. The results have spurred a national impetus to adopt electronic medical records similar to VistA nationwide.

[[VistA Web]] collectively describes a set of protocols that in 2007 was being developed and used by the VHA to transfer data (from VistA) between hospitals and clinics within the pilot project. This is the first effort to view a single patient record so that VistA becomes truly interoperable among the more than 128 sites running VistA today.

A Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository ([https://web.archive.org/web/20091024045131/http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=9 CHDR]) allows interoperability between the DoD's Clinical Data Repository (CDR) &amp; the VA's Health Data Repository (HDR). Bidirectional real time exchange of computable pharmacy, allergy, demographic and laboratory data occurred in phase 1. Phase 2 involved additional drug–drug interaction and allergy checking. Initial deployment of the system was completed in March 2007 at the El Paso, Augusta, Pensacola, Puget Sound, Chicago, San Diego, and Las Vegas facilities.

VistA has been interfaced with commercial off-the-shelf products. Standards and protocols used by VA are consistent with current industry standards and include HL7, DICOM, and other protocols.

Tools for [[Continuity of Care Record|CCR]]/[[Continuity of Care Document|CCD]] support have been developed for VistA, allowing VistA to communicate with other [[Electronic health record|EHRs]] using these standardized information exchange protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opensource CCR and CCD support for VistA based systems Project Update (Powerpoint slideshow) |url=http://groups.google.com/group/ccd-ccr-project/web/CCR-CCD-Update-090219.ppt |publisher= WorldVistA.org (Feb 2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[Mirth (software)|Mirth]] open source cross platform HL7 interface and [[Nationwide Health Information Network#CONNECT|NHIN Connect]], the open source health information exchange adaptor.

The VistA EHR has been used by the VA in combination with Telemedicine to provide surgical care to rural areas in Nebraska and Western Iowa over a {{convert |400000 |sqmi |km2 |adj=on}} area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VA Telemedicine Program Expands Access to Bariatric Surgery |url=http://www.generalsurgerynews.com/index.asp?section_id=410&amp;show=dept&amp;issue_id=588&amp;article_id=14411 | publisher=General Surgery News Vol. 36, Number 12 p.40 (Dec 2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage in non-governmental hospitals ===

Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the VistA system, the CPRS graphical interface, and unlimited ongoing updates (500–600 per year) are provided as public domain software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.va.gov/cprsdemo/page.cfm?pg=1 |title=Introduction to VistA software and the FTP site |publisher=US Department of Veterans Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was done by the US government in an effort to make VistA available as a low cost [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) for non-governmental hospitals and other healthcare entities.

With funding from The Pacific Telehealth &amp; Technology Hui, the Hui 7 produced a version of VistA that ran on [[GT.M]] in a [[Linux]] [[operating system]], and that was suitable for use in private settings. VistA has since been adapted by companies such as [http://www.bluecliffinc.com Blue Cliff], [http://www.docstorsys.com DSS, Inc.], [http://www.medsphere.com/ Medsphere], and [http://sequencemanagers.com Sequence Managers Software] to a variety of environments, from individual practices to clinics to hospitals, to regional healthcare co-ordination between far-flung islands. In addition, VistA has been adopted within similar provider environments worldwide. Universities, such as UC Davis and Texas Tech implemented these systems. A non-profit organization, [[WorldVistA]], has also been established to extend and collaboratively improve the VistA electronic health record and health information system for use outside of its original setting.

VistA (and other derivative EMR/EHR systems) can be interfaced with healthcare databases not initially used by the VA system, including billing software, lab databases, and image databases (radiology, for example).

VistA implementations have been deployed (or are currently being deployed) in non-VA healthcare facilities in Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=Knowledge+Center&amp;articleId=9120541&amp;taxonomyId=1&amp;pageNumber=1 |title=Old code proves key to modern IT at Midland Memorial Hospital |publisher=Computerworld (Nov 2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=printfriendly&amp;id=7233 |title=Statement of Matthew King, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Clinica Adelante, Inc, Surprise, Arizona |publisher=US Congress House Committee on Ways and Means (July 2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida, Hawaii,&lt;ref name="VSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vistasoftware.org/why/ss.html |title=VistA has been implemented in a variety of locations worldwide. |publisher=Vista Software Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medsphere.com/news/159-hoboken-university-medical-center-selects-medspheres-openvista-solution-to-improve-patient-care-achieve-meaningful-use |title=Hoboken University Medical Center Selects Medsphere's OpenVista Solution |publisher=Medsphere (Oct 2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma,&lt;ref name="VSA"/&gt; West Virginia,&lt;ref name="bodtke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vistatour.blogspot.com/ |title=VistA Tour Announcement (Oct 2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20090327_6548.php |title=VA's health record system cited as model for a national network |publisher=Nextgov (Mar 2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oroville Hospital to Deploy Medsphere OpenVista Electronic Health Record |url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070116006067&amp;newsLang=en |publisher=Businesswire, (Jan 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kern Medical Center Selects OpenVista |url=http://www.medsphere.com/news/144-kern-medical-center-selects-openvista-system-for-clinical-transformation-and-meaningful-use |publisher=Medsphere, (Dec 2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brooklyn's Lutheran Medical Center Selects Medsphere OpenVista for Electronic Health Record Deployment |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2007_Jan_8/ai_n17096323/ |publisher=BNET, (Jan 2007) | date=January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="VSA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VistAWorld"&gt;{{cite web |title=Implementation of the Veterans Health Administration VistA Clinical Information System around the World |url=http://www.shepherd.edu/surc/cosi/VistA%20around%20the%20world%202008.doc |publisher=ElectronicHealthcare, 7(2) 2008: 83–89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219001349/http://www.shepherd.edu/surc/cosi/VistA%20around%20the%20world%202008.doc |archive-date=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one state, the cost of a multiple hospital VistA-based EHR network was implemented for one tenth the price of a commercial EHR network in another hospital network in the same state ($9 million versus $90 million for 7–8 hospitals each). (Both VistA and the commercial system used the MUMPS database).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.crossoverhealth.com/2009/01/30/ten-fold-10x-is-there-really-an-order-of-magnitude-difference/ |title=Ten Fold (10X): Is There Really an Order of Magnitude Difference? |publisher=CrossOver Health (Jan 2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VistA has even been adapted into a Health Information System (VMACS) at the veterinary medical teaching hospital at [[University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine|UC Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vista.vmth.ucdavis.edu/notebook/index |title=Demonstration of M2Web |publisher=UC Davis VMTH (Veterinary Medical Hospital) (Dec 2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The name "VistA" (Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture) was adopted by the VA in 1994, when the Under Secretary for Health of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Dr. Ken Kizer, renamed what had previously been known as the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP).

Both Dr. Robert Kolodner ([[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology|National Health Information Technology Coordinator]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/healthit/onc/mission/&lt;/ref&gt; and George Timson (an architect of VistA who has been involved with it since the early years) date VistA's actual architecture genesis, then, to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Computerizing Large Integrated Health Networks: The VA Success |author=Robert Kolodner, MD |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of the Hardhats |url=http://www.hardhats.org/history/hardhats.html | publisher=Hardhats.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was launched in 1978 with the deployment of the initial modules in about twenty VA Medical Centers. The program was named the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) in 1981.

In December 1981, Congressman Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi arranged for the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) to be written into law as the medical-information systems development program of the VA. VA Administrator Robert P. Nimmo signed an Executive Order in February 1982 describing how the DHCP was to be organized and managed within the VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery.

In conjunction with the VA's DHCP development, the (IHS) [[Indian Health Service]] deployed a system built on and augmenting DHCP throughout its Federal and Tribal facilities as the Resource and Patient Management System ([http://www.ihs.gov/CIO/EHR/index.cfm RPMS]). This implementation emphasized the integration of outpatient clinics into the system, and many of its elements were soon re-incorporated into the VA system (through a system of technology sharing). Subsequent VistA systems therefore included elements from both RPMS and DHCP. Health IT sharing between VA and IHS continues to the present day.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) then contracted with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for a heavily modified and extended form of the DHCP system for use in DoD healthcare facilities, naming it the [[Composite Health Care System|Composite Health Care System (CHCS)]].

Meanwhile, in the early 1980s, major hospitals in Finland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medical informatics 20/20 (Case Studies of VistA Implementation United States and International) p. 276 |author=Douglas E. Goldstein |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JivKd9gTA5cC&amp;pg=PT312&amp;lpg=PT312&amp;dq=M+database+medical+finland+Musti | isbn=978-0-7637-3925-6 | publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first institutions outside of the United States to adopt and adapt the VistA system to their language and institutional processes, creating a suite of applications called MUSTI and Multilab. (Since then, institutions in Germany, Egypt,&lt;ref name="VSA"/&gt; Nigeria,&lt;ref name="Nigeria"/&gt; and other nations abroad have adopted and adapted this system for their use, as well.)

The four major adopters of VistA – VA (VistA), DoD (CHCS), IHS (RPMS), and the Finnish [http://messi.uku.fi/tike/his/english/musti.html Musti consortium] – each took VistA in a different direction, creating related but distinct "dialects" of VistA. VA VistA and RPMS exchanged ideas and software repeatedly over the years, and RPMS periodically folded back into its code base new versions of the VA VistA packages. These two dialects are therefore the most closely related. The Musti software drifted further away from these two but retained compatibility with the infrastructure of RPMS and VA VistA (while adding additional GUI and web capabilities to improve function). Meanwhile, the CHCS code base diverged from that of the VA's VistA in the mid-eighties and has never been reintegrated. The VA and the DoD had been instructed for years to improve the sharing of medical information between the two systems, but for political reasons made little progress toward bringing the two dialects back together. More recently, CHCS's development was brought to a complete stop by continued political opposition within the DoD, and it has now been supplanted by a related, but different, system called [[Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application|AHLTA]]. While AHLTA is the new system for DoD, the core systems beneath AHLTA (for Computerized Physician Order Entry, appointing, referral management, and creation of new patient registrations) remain those of the underlying [[Composite Health Care System|CHCS]] system. (While some ongoing development has occurred for CHCS, the majority of funds are consumed by the AHLTA project.) Thus, the VistA code base was split four ways.

Many VistA professionals then informally banded together as the "Hardhats" (a name the original VistA programmers used for themselves) to promote that the FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) release of VA VistA (that allows it to be in the public domain) be standardized for universal usage.

[[WorldVistA]] was formed from this group and was incorporated in March 2003 as a non-profit corporation. This allowed the WorldVistA board of directors to pursue certain activities (obtaining grants, creating contracts, and making formal alliances) that they otherwise could not pursue as an informal organization. It is, however, an organization independent of the VA system and its version of VistA therefore differs from that of the VA's. Nevertheless, it maintains as an objective that its public version be compatible (interoperable) with the VA's official version. It has developed [http://sourceforge.net/projects/worldvista/files/ packages of WorldVistA] for multiple operating systems, including Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and Red Hat) -based and Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. Co-operation with the maintainers and vendors of [http://medsphere.com OpenVistA], another widely deployed open source public version of VistA, helps maintain interoperability and a standardized framework.

In 2011 the [[Open Source Electronic Health Record Agent]] (OSEHRA) project was started (in cooperation with the Department of Veterans Affairs) to provide a common code repository for VistA (and other EHR and health IT) software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VistA Community Makes Major Strides Towards Code Unification |url=http://www.openhealthnews.com/hotnews/vista-community-makes-major-strides-towards-code-unification | publisher=OpenHealth News (Jan 2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, it was the joint collaboration of thousands of clinicians and systems experts from the United States and other nations, many of them volunteers, that the VistA system has developed.


== Supporters of VistA ==
&lt;!-- (The paragraph below needs revision and references to meet Wikipedia standards. Please see the discussion.)
A very important champion of VistA, originally called the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP), was Congressman Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi, who served in Congress from 1967 until 1997 died in May 2006. The support Congressman Montgomery provided to the VA has been greatly missed. The first Hardhats were the developers of DHCP, called that because they felt like they were working on an "Underground Railroad" and there are great true stories and myths associated with its beginnings. Because the VA has had VistA they have been able to improve care and become more efficient with their resources and have been able to become one of the premier health providers in the world despite being grossly underfunded by Congress. Some people have suggested that the VA could become the nucleus of a United States national health care system.
--&gt;
There have been many champions of VistA as the electronic healthcare record system for a universal healthcare plan. VistA can act as a standalone system, allowing self-contained management and retention of healthcare data within an institution. Combined with [[BHIE]] (or other data exchange protocol) it can be part of a peer-to-peer model of [[universal healthcare]]. It is also scalable to be used as a centralized system (allowing regional or even national centralization of healthcare records). It is, therefore, the electronic records system most adaptable to a variety of healthcare models.

In addition to the unwavering support of congressional representatives such as Congressman [[Sonny Montgomery]] of Mississippi, numerous IT specialists, physicians, and other healthcare professionals have donated significant amounts of time in adapting the VistA system for use in non-governmental healthcare settings.

The ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee's Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee, Rep. [[Ginny Brown-Waite]] of Florida, recommended that the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) adopt VA's VistA system following accusations of inefficiencies in the DOD healthcare system. The DOD hospitals use [[Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application|Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)]] which has not been as successful as VistA and has not been adapted to non-military environments (as has been done with VistA).&lt;ref name="BHIE"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Government Health IT, Falls Church, VA (USA) |date=May 9, 2007 |url=http://govhealthit.com/article102670-05-09-07-Web |author=Mosquera, Mary |title=Full VA/DOD e-health sharing several years off |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231729/http://govhealthit.com/article102670-05-09-07-Web |archivedate=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the U.S. Senate passed the Wired for Health Care Quality Act, introduced by [[Mike Enzi|Sen. Enzi]] of Wyoming with 38 co-sponsors, that would require the government to use the VA's technology standards as a basis for national standards allowing all health care providers to communicate with each other as part of a nationwide health information exchange. The legislation would also authorize $280 million in grants, which would help persuade reluctant providers to invest in the new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senator Endorses VistA for EHR Standard |publisher=Linux MedNews |url=http://www.linuxmednews.com/1137769193 |date=January 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no action on the bill since December 2005. Two similar House bills were introduced in late 2005 and early 2006; no action has been taken on either of them, either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Library of Congress: Thomas: Bills, resolutions: S.1418 |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.01418: |accessdate=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee Chair Congressman [[Pete Stark]] (D-CA) introduced the Health-e Information Technology Act of 2008 (H.R. 6898) that calls for the creation of a low-cost public IT system for those providers who do not want to invest in a proprietary one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Representative Stark Introduces Health-e Information Technology Act of 2008 |publisher=Medicare Update |url=http://medicareupdate.typepad.com/medicare_update/2008/09/representative.html |date=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Sen. John D. Rockefeller of West Virginia introduced the Health Information Technology Public Utility Act of 2009 calling for the government to create an open source electronic health records solution and offer it at little or no cost to safety-net hospitals and small rural providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Affordable Fix for Modernizing Medical Records |work=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124104350516570503 |date=April 30, 2009 | first=Laura | last=Landro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rockefeller Introduced Legislation Calling For Universal Adoption of Electronic Health Records |publisher=United States Senator Jay Rockefeller |url=http://rockefeller.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=311951 |date=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wishing Well: Water for the World''' is 501(c)(3) public charity, based in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. Wishing Well: Water for the World was founded by college students at [[Pepperdine University]] in spring of 2006, the headquarters then moved to [[Oklahoma Christian University]] in the fall of 2006. Wishing Well: Water for the World empowers communities to transform their world by providing water to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wishing Well: Water for the World|url=http://www.wishingwellafrica.com/|publisher=Wishingwellaferica.com|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'''&lt;big&gt;Pepperdine University&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Students at Pepperdine raised the money for three water wells funded through [[Blood Water Mission]]. Their efforts were noticed by [[Laura Bush]] 2007, she said, "…Clean water, it's so simple. It's something all of us can do, even college students. We can go to a village and build a water well, and we know things are going to be better than they were. So far, students (at Pepperdine University) have raised about $14,000 for Wishing Well. Your efforts have already helped put a clean-water pump in a rural town near Nairobi, and this summer, two more will be installed — another in Kenya, and one in The Gambia, near a World Bible School. Because of your generosity, hundreds of children will have access to clean water — and the hope of good health." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush|first=Laura|title=First Lady|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070428-4.html|publisher=Whitehousegeorgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov.gov|accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Oklahoma Christian University&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
In fall of 2006, the headquarters of Wishing Well moved to Oklahoma Christian University in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Students at Oklahoma Christian University started fundraising by putting on a night of prayer and hosting a student art gallery on campus. Oklahoma Christian students Ryan Groves, Travis Hughes, Taylor Walling, Joshua Burgin, Whitney Parker, and Chase Layman used a portion of the funds raised to fly to Rwanda to film a documentary about the water crisis. Wishing Well grew, and they started chapters at schools and churches around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Talon|url=http://blogs.oc.edu/talon/cat/wishing_well_wishes_for_water_and_workers/|publisher=oc.edu|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;TedXOKC&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;br/&gt;
