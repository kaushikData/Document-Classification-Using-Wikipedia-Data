      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3235">The '''Adult Suffrage Society''' was one of several organisations formed in the United Kingdom during the Manjesh and Edwardian eras, with the objective of campaigning for the extension of voting rights to women. Unlike bodies such as the Pankhursts' [[Women's Social and Political Union]], the Adult Suffrage Society did not find acceptable the extension of the franchise to women on the same restricted terms that it was then given to men—that is, on the basis of a property qualification that excluded the majority of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Papers of Ross Davies [Biography of Margaret Bondfield]|url= http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb106-7rod|publisher= Archives hub|accessdate= 7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wanted full adult suffrage, the unrestricted right to vote, for all adults aged 21 or over. The society's members were often referred to as "adultists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Montefiore|first= Dora|title= Adult Suffrage|url= https://www.marxists.org/archive/montefiore/1917/05/03.htm||journal= The Call|date= 3 May 1917|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 [[Margaret Bondfield]]   became  chair of the society, which  supported the Franchise and Removal of Women'a Disabilities  bill, introduced to parliament by [[Sir Charles Dilke]] on 2 March 1906.&lt;ref name= A225&gt;{{cite book|last= Abrams|first= Fran|title= Freedom's Cause: Lives of the Suffragettes|publisher= Profile Books|location= London|year= 2003|isbn= 1-86197-425-6|pages=225–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, which proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs, was strongly opposed by the WSPU, as a distraction from its feminist agenda. The bill was  "talked out" in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities Bill|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1906/mar/02/franchise-and-removal-of-womens#S4V0152P0_19060302_HOC_85|publisher= Hansard|date=  2 March 1906|volume= 152|pages= col. 1448–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907, in the course of a public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that  the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=  Holton|first=  Sandra Stanley|title= Feminism and Democracy: Women's Suffrage and Reform Politics in Britain, 1900–1918 |publisher=  Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge|year= 1986|isbn= 0-521-32855-1|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wished good luck to those fighting for a "same terms as men" suffrage bill, but "don't let them come and tell me that they are working for my class".&lt;ref name= A225/&gt; 

The Adult Suffrage Society was relaunched in 1909 as the People's Suffrage Federation (PSF), under the leadership of [[Margaret Llewelyn Davies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The People's Suffrage Federation|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1790&amp;dat=19091021&amp;id=35U9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2314,5220205|journal= The Common Cause|date= 21 October 1909|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ali Pasha Mubarak''' ({{lang-ar|على مبارك}}, born 1823 or 1824- died on 14 November 1893) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[public works]] and [[education]] minister during the second half of the nineteenth century. He is often considered one of the most influential and talented of Egypt's 19th century reformers.&lt;ref&gt;William Cleveland. ''A History of the Modern Middle East''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Mubarak is known for his contribution in the reconstruction of [[Cairo]]'s landscape and for founding Egypt's modern educational system.

His most famous work is titled ''al-Khitat al-Tawfiqiyya al-Jadida'' ({{lang-ar|الخطط التوفيقية الجديدة}}; [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfiq]]'s New Plans, referring to Egypt's ruler at the time), which provides a detailed, street-by-street description of Egypt's major cities and villages.

He also contributed to the start of the [[Egyptian National Library and Archives]] around 1870 which is one of the largest and oldest government libraries.

== Early life ==
Ali Mubarak was born in [[Brembel Al Gadidah]] village in the [[Dakahlia Governorate]] in 1823.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 36. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Mubarak did not come from a wealthy family, however, he was a part of the Mashayikh family that was known to produce the local [[Qadi]], [[Imam]], and [[Khatib]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; The situation of his family would indicate that Ali Mubarak would pursue a career as a religious figure for his rural community. During his youth, Ali Mubarak studied at many different schools and worked for different government clerics. He attended a government prep school before being admitted to the Cairo School of Engineering. During his studies in Cairo he was the top student and as a result was chosen to be a member of a student mission sent by Muhammad Ali to France in 1844.&lt;ref name="Cleveland 2004 p 93"&gt;William Cleveland. ''A History of the Modern Middle East''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 2004, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in Paris for two years and directly after that in [[Metz]] at the {{ill|school of application of artillery and engineering|fr|École d'application de l'artillerie et du génie}} ({{lang-fr|École d'application de l'artillerie et du génie}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=0gorDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT84|title=تاريخ البعثات المصرية إلى أوروبا عصر محمد علي|last=قاسم/-/-|first=عبد الحكيم عبد الغنى محمد|date=2010-01-01|publisher=ktab INC.|isbn=9789772088393|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He returned to his homeland in 1849 and was given an instructors position in the artillery school. After this in 1850, he became the first native Egyptian Muslim to be appointed the director of the entire system of government schools. This marked the beginning of his "rich career of public service that spanned nearly four decades and included appointments as head of the ministries of education, [[Egyptian Public Works|public works]], and railways."&lt;ref name="Cleveland 2004 p 93"/&gt;

=== Early Education and Apprenticeships ===
After studying under the instruction of his father during his early childhood, Ali Mubarak spent two years studying with a [[Faqih]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  This schooling experience stayed with him for most of his life. In his later years, Ali Mubarak wrote about his fear of beatings by his teacher. He never attended school without a small gift that he could give to his teacher to avoid beatings. After two years of instruction under the [[Faqih]], Ali Mubarak refused to return to the school because he did not wish to become a Faqih.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  He left the school in the hopes of working under the local [[Katibs]].

Ali Mubarak had two apprenticeships under two different Khatibs. Both apprenticeships ended poorly. He quit his first apprenticeship because he was maltreated and he was dismissed from the second apprenticeship because he spoke out against his master's reception of gifts.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; He then returned home to study under his father for a year before he began a third apprenticeship under a local government clerk. After working under the clerk for three months, Ali Mubarak still had not received his promised salary. After taking his owed salary from funds collected by the local official, Ali Mubarak was imprisoned for theft.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

It was during his short imprisonment (he bribed the prison officer to let him go) that Ali Mubarak first voiced his dissatisfaction with the lack of Egyptians in the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="Kenny, Lorne M 1967"&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 37. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was still very much a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at this point in time. Although Egypt was a fairly autonomous region under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the majority of officials in the Egyptian government continued to be [[Ottoman Turks]] until the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 431. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Mubarak was determined to change the system and then aspired to attend a new modern school in Cairo where students were taught Turkish, arithmetic, and writing.&lt;ref name="Kenny, Lorne M 1967"/&gt;

In 1836, Ali Mubarak finally achieved his goal and enrolled in the [[Qasr al-Ayni School]] where he dreamed about the fine dress of the students and the schools fine academic reputation. He soon realized, however, that the school did not measure up to the standards he had set for it. Ali Mubarak believed the school to be poorly organized with insufficient accommodations for the student body.&lt;ref name="Kenny, Lorne M 1967"/&gt; After attending Qasr al-Ayni for a year, Ali Mubarak and his school mates were moved to [[Abu Zabal]] while their former school was transformed into a medical school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 38. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the new school, Ali Mubarak was able to focus more of his attention on his studies as opposed to the military drills taught at Qasr al-Ayni. Ali Mubarak was still not pleased with the teaching style. He was very critical of the school's emphasis on memorization of material.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== French Education ===
In 1844 Ali Mubarak was chosen to accompany the royal princes as they polished their education in France. Ali Mubarak spent two years studying in [[Paris]], then two years studying at the military academy in Metz, and then spent a year studying with the French Army.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ali Mubarak was summoned back to Egypt in 1848 and was awarded the military title of ''[[Pasha]]'' because of his education with the French military. He was asked to teach at the Tura Artillery School.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator,he was the most know person in egypt and paris." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 39. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government Work ==
Ali Mubarak is highly regarded because he was one of the first native born, Arabic-speaking, Muslim Egyptians to hold a prestigious government position.&lt;ref name="Dykstra, Darrell 1994"&gt;Dykstra, Darrell. "Pyramids, Prophets, and Progress: Ancient Egypt in the Writings of Ali Mubarak." Journal of American Oriental Society. 114.1 (1994): 56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mubarak's career with the Egyptian government began upon his return to Egypt in 1849.&lt;ref name="Dykstra, Darrell 1994"/&gt; The formation of the Egyptian bureaucracy in the 1800s was largely a result of the work of Muhammad Ali. Under his reign, he established many new government departments, a centralized system of government employed by civil servants.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1879"&gt;Hunter , Robert. "Egypt's High Official in Transition from a Turkish to a Modern Administrative Elite, 1849-1879." Middle Eastern Studies. 19.3 (1983): 279. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] established six departments as part of the executive branch during his rule; Department of Marine, Department of War, Department of Finance, Department of Industry, Department of Education, and Department of Foreign Affairs. After his death in 1849, four new departments were created: the Department of Interior, Department of Public Works, Department of Justice, and Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1879"/&gt;

In his government career, Ali Mubarak served as the minister heading the Egyptian government school system, the Egyptian railroads, and design and implementation of ambitious urban construction programs in [[Cairo]], and the design and establishment of major irrigation projects.&lt;ref name="Dykstra, Darrell 1994"/&gt;

=== Department of Education ===
When Ali Mubarak returned to Egypt from his schooling in France in 1849, he was given the task to reorganize the public school system under [[Abbas I of Egypt|Khedive Abbas I]].&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 63. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Ali Mubarak was awarded the position of director of the government education system. He remained in that position for four years and was responsible for introducing many education reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Robert. "Egypt's High Official in Transition from a Turkish to a Modern Administrative Elite, 1849-1879." Middle Eastern Studies. 19.3 (1983): 283. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Abbas, Ali Mubarak and his two friends and colleagues, [[Hammad Abd al-Ati]] and Ali Ibrahim were assigned to assess the competence of the engineers in the Irrigation Department and the teachers in the government schools because Abbas believed them to be unqualified to hold such positions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 40. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt; After their review of the teachers and engineers, Abbas commissioned the three men to create an economic plan for the government education system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Ali Mubarak formulated a budget for the Department of Education that significantly cut spending.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; His proposal was approved in 1850 by Abbas and he was promoted to the position of colonel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 41. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to improving efficiency in the Egyptian education system, Ali Mubarak wanted to create an environment where students were inspired to be a part of the Egyptian nation and to encourage students to pursue education in modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Robert. "Egypt's High Official in Transition from a Turkish to a Modern Administrative Elite, 1849-1879." Middle Eastern Studies. 19.3 (1983): 288. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He used his past experience as a student to identify situations that needed to be addressed. One of Ali Mubarak's major projects was increasing the availability of textbooks to Egyptian students. He helped establish a movable type printing press and started a campaign to translate European textbooks into Arabic and print and distribute the textbooks to Egyptian students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Ali Mubarak also set out to improve the welfare of students by improving their food, clothing, and instruction environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 42. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, teachers should have a fatherly role in the eyes of their students in order for education to be the most effective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

When Ismail ascended to rule Egypt in 1863, Ali Mubarak was one of the first men called to help reorganize the government systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 44. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Mubarak worked for a period of time supervising the construction of building, bridges, and dams before returning to the Department of Education. Under Ismail, the government passed the “Organic Law” for Egyptian education which led Egypt down the road of nationalizing the education system.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Lorne M. "Ali Mubarak: Nineteenth Century Egyptian Educator and Administrator." Middle East Journal. 21 (1967): 44. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4324090.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this law, enrolment in modern Egyptian schools increased from 1,399 to 4,445 students between 1867 and 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Szyliowicz, Joseph S. "Education and Political Development in Turkey, Egypt, and Iran." Comparative Education Review. 13.2 (1969): 152. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a supportive executive branch of government, Ali Mubarak was able to enact a number of education reforms. One of his successful projects was the development of schools for students and military officers to learn European theories and histories of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Szyliowicz, Joseph S. "Education and Political Development in Turkey, Egypt, and Iran." Comparative Education Review. 13.2 (1969): 151. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Egyptian school system was an influential system for teaching students new ideas about modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt Szyliowicz, Joseph S. "Education and Political Development in Turkey, Egypt, and Iran." Comparative Education Review. 13.2 (1969): 154. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Department of Public Works ===
Ali Mubarak's emphasis on modernizing Egypt went beyond education. During the late 1800s, Ali Mubarak played a major role in creating the outlines for the modern city layout of [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 429. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Cairo underwent a major modernization process during the 1800s. In 1847, Egypt was still considered to be a member of the Ottoman Empire. Even though Egypt was fairly autonomous, the elite Turkish minority, ruled the region. By the end of the nineteenth century Egypt was still considered to be a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], however, it was more directly ruled and influenced by the British.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 429-457. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Egypt's relationship with Europe, (mostly Britain and France), was a catalyst for modernization. The [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle in Paris]] in 1867 was a major influence on the development of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 439. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Exposition Universelle laid the foundation for the idea of what constituted a modern city. [[Ismail Pasha|Ismail]] was greatly affected by the Exposition. Shortly after he arrived back in Egypt, Ismail gave Ali Mubarak the head position in the Ministry of Public Works. As head of the ministry, Ali Mubarak was responsible for modernizing Cairo in a European style.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod, Janet 1965"&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 441. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mubarak and his team quickly worked together to create a blueprint for modern Cairo. They quickly identified what they believed to be the main hindrance of the city of Cairo, traffic. The use of carriages was quickly expanding in Cairo and the streets were not wide enough to accommodate so many carriages traveling in opposite directions. Mubarak and his team estimated that there were over nine hundred carriages in Cairo in 1875 and more than eighteen hundred transport cars clogging the streets of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Cairo Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 446. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address the increasing traffic in the city, Mubarak planned to widen roads in Cairo by demolishing buildings on the sides of the roads. In one case, about four hundred large houses, three hundred small homes, as well as shops and mosques were demolished to make room for a two-kilometer highway.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 449. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the streets of Europe, the highway was finished with sidewalks, gaslights, and shrubbery.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 450. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 1900, [[Cairo]] had undergone a vast modernization project, however, some areas of the city were untouched by the modernization attempts. Cairo became divided into an old and a new city. The modern region of the city lay to the west and north and was radically different socially and economically from the old city.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 457. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the elites in Egypt desired to create a European image of their country, Europeans desired to see the exotic when they traveled through Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet. "Tale of Two Cities: The Origins of Modern Cairo." Comparative Studied in Society and History. 7.4 (1965): 449. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ali Mubarak spent a lot of his time working with the [[Ministry of Public Works]], he continued to work with the [[Ministry of Education]]. Outside of his work with the Egyptian government, Ali Mubarak also found time to write extensively on military engineering, educational theory, as well as writing an encyclopedia called, [[al-Khitat al-Tawfiqiyah]].&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod, Janet 1965"/&gt;

== Writings ==
Ali Mubarak is considered by many to be “Pioneer among Egyptian historians” because of his influential writing. He cited new scientific research and draws upon European research in his work which is completely written in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Reimer, Michael J 1997"&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Mubarak is perhaps most well known for his completion of the twenty volume “Al-Khitat al-Tawfiqiyah.” In al khitat, Ali Mubarak gives a historical and topographical description of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod, Janet 1965"/&gt; He gives a very detailed description of the locations of the buildings and streets of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Reimer, Michael J 1997"/&gt; However, in addition to classifying and ordering the locations of Cairo, Ali Mubarak also provides a commentary on institutions in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In organizing al-Khitat, Ali Mubarak organized the history of Cairo into dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the development that Cairo experienced in the second half of the nineteenth century as positive progress while criticizing the state of the city when it was under Ottoman rule. In his opinion, the Ottomans did not take sufficient care of the city when they controlled most of the government. Streets, buildings, and squares were not adequately taken care of resulting in copious amounts of dust and odors overtaking many parts of the city. Mubarak believed this to be a health concern and emphasized the need for modern city throughout his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ali Mubarak's Interest in Ancient Egypt ===
During the late nineteenth century, Egypt experienced a reawakening of interest in the history of [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian intellectuals worked to integrate European sciences with the study of ancient Egyptian history. They hoped that by using science to explain ancient Egyptian civilization a sense of pride and positive understanding could be fostered amongst Egyptian for their unique history. The scholars also hoped to illustrate the progress that Egypt experienced over its long history.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Egyptians viewed the [[pharaohs]] and the physical remnants of their kingdoms as sacrilegious objects. Ali Mubarak encouraged seeking knowledge of Egypt's past. He believed that everyone should be knowledgeable about the history of his or her community.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that ignorance and indifference of the lives of a community's ancestors cannot foster positive growth for the future.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only possible for a country to grow together by sharing and appreciating the past. As more intellectuals studied Egypt's ancient history and wrote and spoke about it, the past became a source for nationalistic sentiments. The work that Ali Mubarak and his colleagues undertook laid the foundations for territorially defined [[Egyptian nationalism]] in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Al-Khitat ===
Ali Mubarak was a major contributor the process of creating sentiments of [[nationalism]] in Egypt through his active role in the public sphere and his many publications in Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Mubarak published work in a number of magazines, journals, and books and covered topics from science, education, justice, translations, and political commentaries. However, his most famous work is Al-Khitat al-tawfiqiyya al-jadida. Al-Khitat is a twenty-volume work that contains information on the [[geography]], [[topography]], and history of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It brought together information on literature, history and science in en encyclopedic format.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Khitat is considered to be Ali Mubarak's biggest achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the twenty volumes, Mubarak illustrates the interconnectedness of history and geography and uses the relationship between the two to create a national identity for Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 61. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In al-Khitat, Ali Mubarak emphasizes his belief that with knowledge comes technical progress and material affluence which in turn produced "self-respect, patriotic pride, and deference to authority."&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that education was the key to advancing Egypt .

=== Ali Mubarak's Criticism of Al-Azhar ===
As the head of the Department of Education, Ali Mubarak wrote extensively on education in Egypt. He was an advocate for European styles of education with a focus on science and enlightenment philosophy and wrote many criticisms of education in Egypt. One of the oldest educational institutions in Egypt is [[al-Azhar]], a center for learning about [[Islam]].

Ali Mubarak viewed [[al-Azhar]] as a significant part of the Egyptian history and identity because of its prominent role in educating Egyptians for centuries. However, Ali Mubarak believed that the time had come for [[al-Azhar]] to modernize. With the reforms undertaken by the Egyptian government during the nineteenth century, Ali Mubarak thought that it was only to be expected that [[al-Azhar]] modernized as well.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 57. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ali Mubarak was very critical of the traditional education system that al-Azhar used. The old traditional system did not require students to take exams and did not have a formal system to determine who graduated from al-Azhar. Students who wished to become teachers at [[al-Azhar]] studied under a teacher until they were thought to be ready to begin teaching to a class.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 58. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no method in place to monitor the academic progress of the students. Learning was entirely dependent on the motivation of the university students.  Ali Mubarak highly regarded the spiritual lessons offered by [[al-Azhar]] but believed that the lack of structure in the university fostered undisciplined behavior, immorality, pride and pettiness and the structure needed to be reformed to recreate and mold the moral identity and personality of the modern state of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Mubarak's primary concern regarding [[al-Azhar]] was its lack of appearance of being a modern educational institution. He did not see al-Azhar as holding an important position in modern Egypt. In order for future generations of Egyptians to be successful, they needed to have the right education. Ali Mubarak encouraged institutions to teach information produced by Europe and give students the opportunity to become productive and important members of Egyptian society.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, Michael J. "Contradiction and Consciousness in Ali Mubarak's Description of al-Azhar." International Journal of Middle East Studies. 29.1 (1997): 62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27186">'''Authentic leadership''' is an approach to [[leadership]] that emphasizes building the leader’s legitimacy through honest relationships with followers which value their input and are built on an ethical foundation. Generally, authentic leaders are positive people with truthful self-concepts who promote openness.  By building trust and generating enthusiastic support from their subordinates, authentic leaders are able to improve individual and team performance. This approach has been fully embraced by many leaders and leadership coaches who view authentic leadership as an alternative to leaders who emphasize profit and share price over people and ethics. Authentic leadership is a growing area of study in academic research on leadership which has recently grown from obscurity to the beginnings of a fully mature concept.&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011"&gt;Gardner, W.L., Cogliser, C.C., Davis, K.M., &amp; Dickens, M.P. (2011). Authentic leadership: A review of the literature and research agenda. ''Leadership Quarterly, 22'', 1120-1145.&lt;/ref&gt;  That said, many foundational papers on this topic have recently been retracted or called into question because of issues surrounding the reporting of data and the inability of the authors to produce their original data.&lt;ref&gt;https://pubpeer.com/search?q=authentic+leadership&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://retractionwatch.com/category/walumbwa/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Background==
The concept of “[[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]” can trace its history back to ancient Greece.  Ancient Greek philosophers stressed authenticity as an important state through an emphasis on being in control of one’s own life and the ubiquitous admonition: “[[Know thyself]]”.&lt;ref name=Parke&gt;Parke, H., &amp; Wormell, D. (1956). ''The Delphic Oracle''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KernisGoldman2006"&gt;Kernis, M. H., &amp; Goldman, B. M. (2006). A multicomponent conceptualization of authenticity: Theory and research. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.), ''Advances in experimental social psychology'', (Vol. 38, pp. 283–357). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic leadership as we know it today evolved from the history of these terms. It originated in the 1960s as a means to describe how an organization reflects itself authentically through [[leadership]].&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011" /&gt;  Some believed that an entire organization could act authentically like a single person through responsibility, reactions to uncertainty, and creativity.&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;Rome, B. K., &amp; Rome, S. C. (1967). Humanistic research on large social organizations. In J. F. T. Bugental (Ed.), ''Challenges of humanistic psychology'' (pp. 181 193). New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;  Others believed that authentic leadership is actually more about how the leaders define their own role within an organization.&lt;ref name="Seemen"&gt;Seeman, M. (1966). Status and identity: The problem of inauthenticity. ''The Pacific Sociological Review, 9'' (2), 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, authentic leadership has garnered more attention among scholars and practitioners because of publications from [[Harvard]] professor and former [[Medtronic]] CEO [[Bill George (academic)|Bill George]] &lt;ref name="George2003"&gt;George, B. (2003). ''Authentic leadership: Rediscovering the secrets to creating lasting value''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="George2007"&gt;George, B., &amp; Sims, P. (2007). ''True north: Discover your authentic leadership''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; and other calls for research.&lt;ref name=" Luthans2003"&gt;Luthans, F., &amp; Avolio, B. J. (2003). Authentic leadership development. In K. S. Cameron, J. E. Dutton, &amp; R. E. Quinn (Eds.), ''Positive organizational scholarship: Foundations of a new discipline'' (pp. 241–261). San Francisco: Barrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt;  The past decade has seen a surge in publications about authentic leadership, producing new models, definitions, and theories.  The emphasis on conceptual development suggest that the concept is still in the initial stages of construct evolution, though as the scholarly research on the topic progresses, the types of publications produced appear to be shifting from mostly conceptual pieces to more and more empirically based articles.  This shift may be indicative of a nascent emergence of the [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] from an introduction and elaboration evolutionary stage to one marked by evaluation and augmentation.&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011" /&gt;

==Definitions==
Because the concept itself is not yet fully mature in a theoretical sense, there are many different definitions of authentic leadership, each with its own nuances.  However, consensus appears to be growing that authentic leadership includes these distinct qualities:
* [[Self-awareness]]:  An ongoing process of reflection and re-examination by the leader of his or her own strength, weaknesses, and values
* Relational Transparency:  Open sharing by the leader of his or her own thoughts and beliefs, balanced by a minimization of inappropriate emotions
* Balanced Processing:  Solicitation by the leader of opposing viewpoints and fair-minded consideration of those viewpoints
* Internalized Moral Perspective:  A positive ethical foundation adhered to by the leader in his or her relationships and decisions that is resistant to outside pressures
There is empirical research that supports a superordinate construct of authentic leadership that includes these four components.&lt;ref name="WalumbwaAvolio2008"&gt;Walumbwa, F. O., Avolio, B. J., Gardner, W. L., Wernsing, T. S., &amp; Peterson, S. J. (2008). Authentic leadership: Development and validation of a theory-based measure. ''Journal of Management, 34'', 89–126.&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted, however, that this evidence has been called into question&lt;ref name="pubpeer.com"&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/1E79BA4AA94EB722491B14AE871B0F&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of reporting statistically impossible results.  Other papers by the same authors have been retracted for similar problems and the inability of the authors to produce evidence of their claims.&lt;ref name="retractionwatch.com"&gt;http://retractionwatch.com/2014/02/07/leadership-journal-to-retract-five-papers-from-fiu-scholar/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://retractionwatch.com/2014/04/30/florida-leadership-researcher-walumbwa-notches-sixth-retraction/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://retractionwatch.com/2014/11/14/univ-no-misconduct-but-poor-research-practice-in-mgt-profs-work-now-subject-to-7-retractions/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authenticity and ethics===
Some have suggested authentic leadership need not include a moral component.  Proponents of this point of view emphasize the word “authentic” in authentic leadership and suggest that one can be true to a corrupt value system and still be an authentic leader.  Faking a set of ethical constraints to which a leader does not personally prescribe would be a sign of inauthenticity.&lt;ref name="ShamirEilam2005"&gt;Shamir, B., &amp; Eilam, G. (2005). “What's your story?”: A life-stories approach to authentic leadership development. ''Leadership Quarterly, 16'', 395–417.&lt;/ref&gt;   Others reject the idea that a leader can truly exhibit the other components of the construct&amp;nbsp;– self-awareness, relational transparency, and balanced processing&amp;nbsp;– without the moral maturity associated with a positive personal value system.&lt;ref name="GardnerAvolio2005"&gt;Gardner, W. L., Avolio, B. J., Luthans, F., May, D. R., &amp; Walumbwa, F. O. (2005). “Can you see the real me?” A self-based model of authentic leader and follower development. ''Leadership Quarterly, 16'', 343–372.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patterns of behavior===
Authentic leadership should be understood as a pattern of [[behavior]]s through which leaders exhibit the components of authentic leadership.  Thus, it is insufficient for the leader to be self-aware, etc. without also conducting him or herself in such a way that others, particularly subordinates, view the leader as authentic.

==Empirical model of authentic leadership==
Although the concept of authentic leadership as an actionable model is relatively new to leadership theory and practice, there has been some initial research regarding the overall effectiveness of the model as well as the [[Nomological network|inner workings of the model]] within [[team]]s and [[organization]]s. This research has been used to explain what precedes the appearance of authentic leadership behaviors, what makes authentic leadership effective, and the consequences of adopting an authentic leadership style. These factors contribute to why authentic leadership works within teams and organizations.

===Antecedents===
Several leader characteristics may be important to the appearance of authentic leadership behaviors by leaders.  For instance, both leader [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and [[self-consistency]] have been shown to act as [[Antecedent variable|antecedents]] for authentic leadership (the former being a static process of understanding one’s own strengths and weaknesses and the latter consistency between their values, beliefs, and actions). This relates to the key components of authentic leadership: leaders first have to be clear about their values and convictions to be perceived as authentic by their followers and they have to demonstrate consistency between their values, beliefs, and actions.&lt;ref name="PeusWesche2011"&gt;Peus, C., Weschem J.S., Streicher, B., Braun, S., &amp; Frey, D. (2012). Authentic leadership: An empirical test of its antecedents, consequences, and mediating mechanisms. ''Journal of Business Ethics, 107'', 331-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional research suggests that leaders who act in accordance to the three components of [[positive psychological capital]] (PsyCap) (hope, optimism, and resiliency) are more likely to become authentic leaders.&lt;ref name="Jensen 2006b"&gt;Jensen, S. M., &amp; Luthans, F. (2006). Relationship between entrepreneurs' psychological capital and their authentic leadership. ''Journal of Managerial Issues, 18'', 254–273.&lt;/ref&gt; This is true for several reasons. First, leaders who can set and explain goals effectively create a more hopeful environment for their followers. Second, optimistic leaders have a greater ability to motivate their followers and help them more easily anticipate future events. Third, resilient leaders are better equipped to function in changing environments in order to support their followers.&lt;ref name="Jensen 2006b" /&gt;

High and low degrees of [[self-monitoring]] in an individual has also been suggested as an antecedent of authentic leadership. Self-monitoring reflect how likely someone is to actively construct a public image that aligns with the expectations of others.&lt;ref name="Gangestad2000"&gt;Gangestad, S. W., &amp; Snyder, M. (2000). Self-monitoring: Appraisal and reappraisal. ''Psychological Bulletin, 126''(4), 530-555.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that low self-monitoring leads to a higher degree of authentic leadership characteristics because low self-monitors and authentic leaders both act in a way that is consistent with what they believe and value. However, empirical research has not supported this theory thus far.&lt;ref name="Tate2008"&gt;Tate, B. (2008). A longitudinal study of the relationships among self-monitoring, authentic leadership, and perceptions of leadership. ''Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies, 15'', 16–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediators===
Among the proponents of authentic leadership, there are many theories regarding [[Mediation (statistics)|why authentic leadership is an effective leadership strategy]].

Authentic leadership has been shown to promote team members’ belief in the team’s ability to succeed, known as team potency,&lt;ref name="RegoVitória2013" /&gt; which has in turn been shown to improve team performance.&lt;ref name="MeglinoLester2002"&gt;Lester, S. W., Meglino, B. M., &amp; Korsgaard, M. A. (2002). The antecedents and consequences of group potency: a longitudinal investigation of newly formed work groups. ''The Academy of Management Journal, 45''(2), 352–368.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CampionMedsker1993"&gt;Campion, M. A., Medsker, G. J., &amp; Higgs, A. C. (1993). Relations between work group characteristics and effectiveness: implications for designing effective work groups. ''Personnel Psychology, 46''(4), 823–847.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because authentic leadership behaviors promote team virtuousness which, in turn, promotes team potency and performance.&lt;ref name="RegoVitória2013" /&gt;

Authentic leadership has also been shown to encourage team performance by promoting [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] in the group or organization, because follower trust in the leader will encourage increased loyalty to the organization, increasing performance as a result.&lt;ref name="Clapp-SmithVogelgesang2008" /&gt;

Other research has shown that the relationship between authentic leadership and both [[organizational citizenship behavior]] and [[empowerment]] is mediated by identification with supervisors. This is because a follower’s interpersonal identification with his or her leader links leader and follower outcomes (in this case, empowerment and OCBs).&lt;ref name="WalumbwaWang2010"&gt;Walumbwa, F. O., Wang, P., Wang, H., Schaubroeck, J., &amp; Avolio, B. J. (2010). Psychological processes linking authentic leadership to follower behaviors. ''Leadership Quarterly, 21'', 901–914.&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted, however, that the article that these claims are based on was retracted amid concerns that the results were not reported accurately and the authors could not produce evidence to verify their claims.&lt;ref&gt;https://pubpeer.com/publications/5D282BE323FD9AA1217CB241512067&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="retractionwatch.com"/&gt;

Research into the mechanisms of authentic leadership is ongoing, but it is becoming clear that authentic leaders engender an emotional and/or psychological response from their followers that leads to an increase in individual and team performance.

===Consequences===
Initial research has shown that leaders who practice authentic leadership normally lead teams that perform better than teams with leaders who do not practice authentic leadership.&lt;ref name="RegoVitória2013"&gt;Rego, A., Vitória, A. Magalhães, A., Ribeiro, N., &amp; e Cunha, M. (2013). Are authentic leaders associated with more virtuous, committed and potent teams? ''Leadership Quarterly, 24''(1), 61-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clapp-SmithVogelgesang2008"&gt;Clapp-Smith, R., Vogelgesang, G. R., &amp; Avey, J. B. (2009). Authentic leadership and positive psychological capital: The mediating role of trust at the group level of analysis. ''Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies, 15'', 227–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetersonWalumbwa2012"&gt;Peterson, S.J., Walumbwa, F.O., Avolio, B.J., &amp; Hannah, S.T. (2012). The relationship between authentic leadership and follower job performance: The mediating role of follower positivity in extreme contexts. ''Leadership Quarterly, 23''(3), 502-516.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not necessarily surprising as the model itself arises from successful leaders who simply described what they did and put the label “authentic leadership” on that description.  The academic model that has been developed over the years since the publishing of [[True North (Bill George book)|True North]]&lt;ref name="George2007" /&gt; has largely resulted from the work of academics to further describe the model so that it can be researched and duplicated.

==Measures==
Both research scientists and practitioners have an interest in measuring the level of authentic leadership exhibited by individual leaders.  Scientists such as [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial-organizational psychologists]] and management researchers measure levels of authentic leadership as a way to study the interaction of authentic leaders with their organization.  Practitioners such as [[Management consulting|management consultants]] and [[Human resource management|human resource professionals]] measure levels of authentic leadership to help assess leader behaviors within an organization.

===Leader Authenticity Scale (LAS)===
The first significant measure specifically gauging levels of authentic leadership was the 32-item Leader Authenticity Scale (LAS). The LAS measures the leader’s tendency to behave genuinely regardless of formal job titles (referred to as salience of self over role), to acknowledge accountability for mistakes, and to avoid manipulation of subordinates.  The LAS was developed by education researchers who identified leader authenticity as an important indicator of [[organizational climate]] in schools.&lt;ref name="HendersonHoy"&gt;Henderson, J. E., &amp; Hoy, W. K. (1983). Leader authenticity: The development and test of an operational measure. ''Educational and Psychological Research, 3''(2), 63–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Later researchers questioned the [[wikt:reliability|reliability]] and [[Generalizability theory|generalizability]] of the LAS due to the small and non-diverse sample used in its development.&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011" /&gt;

===Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ)===
The Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ) is a survey completed by followers to capture the level of authentic leadership behaviors exhibited by supervisors.  A self-assessment version is also available.  The measure, developed specifically with the emerging authentic leadership theory in mind, includes sixteen items grouped into four major subcategories: self-awareness, relational transparency, internalized moral perspective, and balanced processing.&lt;ref name="WalumbwaAvolio2008" /&gt;
Most academic research since the development of the ALQ has used it to measure levels of authentic leadership.&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011" /&gt;  However, the ALQ has been criticized for using a [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] (and therefore subjective) approach to validation rather than a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] approach.  Additionally, the ALQ is a commercially copyrighted measure (only sample measures are freely available), potentially limiting its availability to scientists and practitioners.&lt;ref name="NeiderSchriesheim2011"&gt;Neider, L.L., &amp; Schriesheim, C.A. (2011). The Authentic Leadership Inventory (ALI): Development and empirical tests. ''Leadership Quarterly, 22''(6), 1146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the validity of the claims made in the validation paper for this article have been called into question owing to the reporting of statistically impossible results.&lt;ref name="pubpeer.com"/&gt;  These allegations follow a list of retractions of similar work by the authors of this article.&lt;ref name="retractionwatch.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Authentic Leadership Inventory (ALI)===
The Authentic Leadership Inventory (ALI), developed in 2011, is a survey completed by followers to capture the level of authentic leadership behaviors exhibited by supervisors.  Building on the theoretical research used to develop the ALQ, the ALI provides a more rigorously developed and tested measure of authentic leadership.  In addition, the entire 16 item inventory is freely available.&lt;ref name="NeiderSchriesheim2011" /&gt;

===Authenticity Inventory (AL:3)===
An additional measure related to authentic leadership, the Authenticity Inventory (AL:3), is used to measure individual authenticity.&lt;ref name="KernisGoldman2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KernisGoldman2005"&gt;"&gt;Kernis, M.H., &amp; Goldman, B.M. (2005). From thought and experience to behavior and interpersonal relationships: A multicomponent conceptualization of authenticity. In A. Tesser, J. V. Wood, &amp; D. A. Stapel (Eds.), ''On building, defending, and regulating the self: A psychological perspective'' (pp. 31–52). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though not a leadership measure per se, it is used by some as a measure of the authenticity of a leader.&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011" /&gt;

==Becoming an authentic leader==
The basis of authentic leadership comes from the leader’s personal history, including life-events (often called trigger events) that direct the flow of leadership formation.&lt;ref name="GardnerAvolio2005" /&gt;  How leaders interpret these personal histories and trigger events will inform their self-identity as leaders and influence their moral development and values, two essential components in the development of authentic leaders.&lt;ref name="Eilam2005"&gt;Eliam, G. &amp; Shamir, B. (2005). Organizational change and self-concept threats: A theoretical perspective and a case study. ''Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 4'', 399–421&lt;/ref&gt;
Because authenticity in leadership is rooted in being true to one’s own ideals of leadership and ethical values, authentic leadership is brought about through a lifetime of experiences and is resistant to traditional training programs.  [[Leader development|Development]] of authentic leaders involves guided [[self-reflection]], building self-awareness through the use of a life-stories approach. There is now emerging evidence that group-coaching is an effective approach to Authentic Leadership Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Tony|title=Authentic Leaders are Conscious, Confident, Competent and Congruent. A Grounded Theory of Authentic Leadership Group Coaching.|journal=International Coaching Psychology Review (2015) The British Psychological Society|volume=10, 2. 131-148.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Tony|title=Assessing the Efficacy of Authentic Leadership Group-Coaching.|journal=International Coaching Psychology Review (2016) The British Psychological Society|volume=11,2. 6-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Tony|title=Increasing Leaders Self-Concept-Clarity in the Authentic Leadership Coaching Group.|journal=The Coaching Psychologist (2016) The British Psychological Society|volume=12, 2. 24-32.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be facilitated by the intervention of developmental trigger events coupled with directed self-reflection.&lt;ref name="Eilam2005" /&gt;
Recognizing leadership [[contingency theory]], which suggest that leaders must adapt their styles and behaviors to be effective across different situations, some leadership development theorists have pointed out that only the most expert of leaders can incorporate the needs of varying situations and different or diverse followers into their own underlying value system so as to remain authentic while also being effective across diverse leadership contexts.&lt;ref name="LordHall2005"&gt;Lord, R. &amp; Hall, R. (2005). Identity, deep structure and the development of leadership skill. ''Leadership Quarterly, 16'', 591-615&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other leadership theories==
The end of the twentieth century saw a rise of new theories of leadership that attempt to understand how leaders not only direct and manage, but also inspire their followers in unique ways.  The construct of [[charismatic leadership]] was introduced in [[Max Weber]] in the 1920s but greatly expanded upon by leadership theorists beginning in the 1970s and continuing to today.&lt;ref name="Yukl"&gt;Yukl, G.A. (2010). ''Leadership in Organizations''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charismatic leadership theories attempt to capture the attributes and behaviors of extraordinary leaders in extraordinary situations (including variances of either dimension) in order to understand unusual or unique responses of followers.&lt;ref name="Bass"&gt;Bass, B. M., &amp; Bass, R. (2008). ''The Bass Handbook Of Leadership: Theory, Research, And Managerial Applications.'' New York:Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  A short time later, [[transformational leadership]] theory was developed extensively.  This theory differentiated “transformational” leadership behaviors from “transactional” leadership behaviors; transformational leaders inspire extraordinary action by providing insight to followers regarding the importance of their work and its outcomes, by calling on followers to subordinate their self-interest to that of the organization, and by motivating followers through activation of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|higher-order needs]].&lt;ref name = "Yukl" /&gt;  More recent examples of what have been called neo-charismatic leadership theories include [[servant leadership]], [[ethical leadership]], spiritual leadership, and visionary leadership.

Authentic leadership proponents and scholars suggest that authentic leadership is conceptually distinct from these other approaches to leadership.  There is empirical support for this position, as studies have shown that authentic leadership can explain variance in leadership performance over and above that explained by other leadership theories, such as transformational leadership and ethical leadership.&lt;ref name="WalumbwaAvolio2008" /&gt;  At the same time, some theorists have suggested that authentic leadership is but one (albeit important) aspect of other forms of leadership.&lt;ref name = "van Dierendonck"&gt;van Dierendonck, D. (2011). Servant Leadership: A Review and Synthesis. ''Journal of Management, 37'', 1228-1261.&lt;/ref&gt;  This ambiguous understanding of what distinguishes authentic leadership theory from other leadership theories may be considered a signal that, despite growing research into authentic leadership, the theory remains at the beginning stages of construct development; more research will be required to draw distinctions among these various leadership theories.&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011" /&gt;  It should also be noted, however, that many of these theories are also underdeveloped; thus the differentiation problem cannot be strictly attributed to authentic leadership theory development.&lt;ref name = "AvolioGardner2005"&gt;Avolio, B. J., &amp; Gardner, W. L. (2005). Authentic leadership development: Getting to the root of positive forms of leadership. ''Leadership Quarterly, 16'', 315–338.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future research==
Since authentic leadership is still in its infancy from a research point of view, it is necessary to further develop the theory behind it.  Most articles written on the topic so far have been theoretical, suggesting that the pursuit of more empirical research is an appropriate next step.&lt;ref name="GardnerCogliser2011" /&gt;

[[File:1912 Lawrence Textile Strike 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Massachusetts National Guardsmen with fixed bayonets surround a parade of peaceful strikers.]]
"'''Bread and Roses'''" is a [[political slogan]] as well as the name of an associated poem and song. It originated from a speech given by [[Rose Schneiderman]]; a line in that speech ("The worker must have bread, but she must have roses, too."&lt;ref name="Eisenstein-S_1983"/&gt;) inspired the title of the poem ''Bread and Roses''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chawedrosin.wordpress.com/2008/05/09/bread-and-roses-by-james-oppenheim/|title=Bread and Roses, by James Oppenheim|access-date=Apr 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[James Oppenheim]]. The poem was first published in ''[[The American Magazine]]'' in December 1911, with the attribution line "{{-'}}Bread for all, and Roses, too'—a slogan of the women in the West."&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Zwick-J_2002"/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Zwick-J_2003"/&gt;  The poem has been translated into other languages and has been set to music by at least three composers.

The phrase is commonly associated with the successful [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Massachusetts]], during January–March 1912, now often referred to as the "Bread and Roses strike".  The slogan pairing bread and roses, appealing for both fair wages and dignified conditions, found resonance as transcending "the sometimes tedious struggles for marginal economic advances" in the "light of labor struggles as based on striving for dignity and respect", as Robert J. S. Ross wrote in 2013.&lt;ref name="Ross-R-J-S_2013"/&gt;

==History==
The slogan "Bread and Roses" originated in a speech given by [[Rose Schneiderman]]; a line in that speech ("The worker must have bread, but she must have roses, too."&lt;ref name="Eisenstein-S_1983"/&gt;) inspired the title of the poem.

After its first publication in 1911, the poem was published again in July 1912 in [[The Survey (magazine)]] with the same attribution as in December 1911, and again on October 4, 1912 in  [[The Public (newsweekly)|The Public]], a weekly then published by [[Louis Freeland Post|Louis F. Post]] in Chicago, this time with the slogan being attributed to "Chicago Women Trade Unionists". The first publication in book form was in the 1915 labor anthology, ''The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest'' by [[Upton Sinclair]], this time with a new attribution and rephrased slogan: "In a parade of strikers of Lawrence, Mass, some young girls carried a banner inscribed, 'We want Bread, and Roses too!'".&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Zwick-J_2002"/&gt;--&gt;

==The Lawrence Strike ==
{{main|1912 Lawrence textile strike}}
The 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike, which united dozens of immigrant communities under the leadership of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], was led to a large extent by women. The popular mythology of the strike includes signs being carried by women reading "We want bread, but we want roses, too!", though the image is probably ahistorical.&lt;ref name="Sider-G-M_1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson-B_2006"/&gt;

To circumvent an injunction against loitering in front of the mills, the strikers formed the first moving [[Picketing (protest)|picket line]] in the US.&lt;ref name="Gabaccia-D-R_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moran-W_2004"/&gt;  The strike was settled on March 14, 1912 on terms generally favorable to the workers. The workers won pay increases, time-and-a-quarter pay for overtime, and a promise of no discrimination against strikers.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Zwick-J_2002"/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross-R-J-S_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silber-Irwin_1999-03-10"/&gt;

==Legacy==
After the 1915 publication in Upton Sinclair's anthology, Oppenheim's poem lay dormant until it was rediscovered after the Second World War. It was published again in January 1952 in [[Sing Out!]].&lt;ref name="Silber-Irwin_1999-03-11"/&gt;

The poem has been set to music several times. The oldest version seems to be the one attributed to "Martha Coleman" and "Caroline Kohlsaat", which suggests that both names refer to the same person. It was again set to music in 1974 by [[Mimi Fariña]] and this version has been recorded by various artists, including [[Judy Collins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Judy_Collins:Bread_And_Roses|title=Bread And Roses|access-date=Apr 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Utah Phillips]], and Josh Lucker. [[John Denver]] also set it to music in 1988, using a melody different from the more common [[Mimi Fariña]] version. It was again set to music in Germany by Renate Fresow, using a translation by the ''Hannoveraner Weiberquartett'', but which is sung mostly with the German translation by [[Peter Maiwald]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Adamek: ''Lieder der Arbeiterbewegung'', Büchergilde Gutenberg, Frankfurt am Main 1986 (2. Auflage), {{ISBN|3-763225633}}, S. 246 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1932, the song has been sung by graduating seniors at [[Mount Holyoke College]] during the Laurel Parade ceremony, part of the college's graduation tradition.&lt;ref name="MHC"/&gt;  It is also one of the central songs at [[Bryn Mawr College]], traditionally sung at the College's "Step-Sings."&lt;ref name="BMC"/&gt;

Composer [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]] wrote a piano piece entitled "Bread And Roses" (1976) based on the strike song.{{Citation needed|date = January 2017}}

Mimi Fariña created the [[Mimi Fariña#Bread and Roses|Bread and Roses Benefit Agency]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breadandroses.org/about/history|title=Bread &amp;amp; Roses History|accessdate =4 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logo for the [[Democratic Socialists of America]], formed in 1982, was inspired by the slogan.

In 1989/91, [[Si Kahn]] wrote a song the refrain of which starts with the song's title: "They all sang 'Bread and Roses'".&lt;ref name="Mudcat_77563"/&gt;

A quarterly journal produced by the UK section of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] ('Wobblies') is called "Bread and Roses".&lt;ref name="IWW-UK"/&gt;

The 2014 film ''[[Pride (2014 film)|Pride]]'' depicts the members of a Welsh mining community singing "Bread and Roses" at a [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] lodge during the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pride Soundtrack|url=http://soundtrack.pridemovie.co.uk|publisher=Universal Music Operations Limited|accessdate=17 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008210222/http://soundtrack.pridemovie.co.uk/|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Sisk|title=How Welsh singing starlet Bronwen Lewis turned rejection on The Voice into big screen Pride |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|WalesOnline]]|date=13 September 2014|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/bronwen-lewis-turned-rejection-voice-7762679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the song was used in a video produced by London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign to promote the #HomeToVote movement, which encouraged young Irish people living abroad to return home to vote in the Referendum on the [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018|Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Irish Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/home-to-vote-referendum-8th-amendment-repeal-together-for-yes-london-arc-3973770-Apr2018/|title=The #HomeToVote videos released today will give you goosebumps|work=The Daily Edge|date=23 Apr 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw_ylrOL_70&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote = In any event, I am virtually certain that the song had been dormant for close on to 30 years until I came across sheet music for it while doing some research at the New York Public Library sometime in 1951. That's where the name Martha Coleman appeared. (This is just a guess, but I wouldn't be surprised if Martha Coleman turned out to be a pseudonym for Caroline Kohlsaat.) There is no evidence to indicate that this was particularly known as a song. The poem was somewhat known but not with a musical setting. The tune itself never caught on which is one reason why others have tried writing a new melody for it. I think if it was being sung prior to its publication in Sing Out! (January 1952), I would have known about it.

The '''Car Allowance Rebate System''' ('''CARS'''), colloquially known as "'''cash for clunkers'''", was a $3 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. federal]] [[scrappage program]] intended to provide economic incentives to U.S. residents to purchase a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle when trading in a less fuel-efficient vehicle. The program was promoted as providing stimulus to the economy by boosting auto sales, while putting safer, cleaner, and more fuel-efficient vehicles on the roadways.

The program officially started on July 1, 2009, processing of claims began July 24,&lt;ref name="CARSweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.gov/|title=Car Allowance Rebate System: What is the Car Allowance Rebate System?|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091226080857/http://www.cars.gov/ |archivedate=2009-12-26 |accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the program ended on August 24, 2009, as the appropriated funds were exhausted.&lt;ref name=NYT0820&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/business/21clunkers.html?_r=1&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=cash%20for%20clunkers&amp;st=cse |title=Government Will End Clunker Program Early |first=Nick |last=Bunkley|newspaper=The New York Times |date=2009-08-20|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN0820/&gt; The deadline for dealers to submit applications was August 25.&lt;ref name=NYT0824&gt;{{cite news|url= http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/dealers-get-more-time-on-clunker-rebates/ |title=Dealers Get More Time on 'Clunker' Rebates |first=Andrea |last=Fuller |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to estimates of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], the initial $1 billion appropriated for the system was exhausted by July 30, 2009, well before the anticipated end date of November 1, 2009, due to very high demand.&lt;ref name=NYT0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{cite news|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/autos/2009-07-30-cash-for-clunkers-program-suspended_N.htm |title= House adds cash to 'clunkers' program; Senate vote needed |first1=James R.|last1=Healey |first2=Chris |last2=Woodyard |work=USA Today |date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] approved an additional $2 billion.&lt;ref name=NYT0801&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/01/business/01clunkers.html?pagewanted=1 |title=In Congress, a Jump-Start for Clunkers |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP0801&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2009/aug/01/cash-clunkers-rebates-survive-weekend/ |title=Cash for clunkers' rebates survive - for weekend |newspaper=The Washington Post |last=Thomas |first=Ken |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC0806&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/Business/story?id=8265510&amp;page=1 |title=The Senate Votes, Ensuring Popular But Cash-Strapped Program Will Continue |publisher=ABC News |first=Jonathan |last=Karl |first2=Huma |last2=Khan |first3=Z.

==Legislative history==
Economist [[Alan Blinder]] helped popularize the idea of a scrappage program, and the moniker "cash for clunkers", with his July 2008 op-ed piece in ''[[The New York Times]]''. Blinder argued that a cash-for-clunkers program would have a tripartite purpose of helping the environment, stimulating the economy, and reducing [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blinder |first=Alan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/business/27view.html?ex=1374811200&amp;en=a19470300b516a2f&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |title=A Modest Proposal: Eco-Friendly Stimulus |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2008-07-27 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations advised Congress in developing the program including ACEEE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aceee.org |title=American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy |publisher=ACEEE |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAP Action Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogressactionfund.org |title=Center for American Progress Action Fund |publisher=Americanprogressactionfund.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SmartTransportation.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smarttransportation.org |title=SmartTransportation.org |publisher=SmartTransportation.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Hidary]] of Smart Transportation and Bracken Hendricks of the Center for American Progress co-wrote a paper which was distributed to Congressional offices in November 2008 describing the multiple benefits of a cash-for-clunkers program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2008-11-20 |url= http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/cash_for_clunkers.html |title=Cash for Clunkers |publisher=Americanprogressaction.org |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives|House]] approved the creation of a cash-for-clunkers program with the 298 to 119 passage of the CARS Act ("Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act", H.R. 1550). The House bill, sponsored by Rep. [[Betty Sutton]] (D-[[Ohio]]), allowed consumers to trade in vehicles with a combined fuel economy of 18 or less for new, more efficient vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2751:/ |title=H.R.2751: Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act - U.S. Congress - Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States Senate|Senate]], [[Debbie Stabenow]] (D-[[Michigan]]), and [[Sam Brownback]] (R-[[Kansas]]) sponsored a bill very similar to the House's.

An alternative bill proposed by [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-[[California]]), [[Susan Collins]] (R-[[Maine]]), and [[Charles Schumer]] (D-[[New York (state)|New York]]) would have had a greater focus on increasing fuel economy. Proponents argued that the alternative bill would lead to 32% more efficiency improvements than the House-Stabenow-Brownback version of the program. The alternative bill would have required that the trade-in vehicle have a fuel economy rating of {{convert|17|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} or less and offered a three-tiered voucher system ranging from $2,500 for a new car that is {{convert|7|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} more efficient than a trade-in to $4,500 for one that is {{convert|13|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} more efficient. Mileage improvement requirements would be less for light and heavy duty trucks. Pre-1999 work trucks would be eligible for the $2,500 voucher regardless of mileage improvements. The alternative bill also gave a $1,000 voucher for the purchase of a more efficient used car; the House bill completely excluded used vehicles.&lt;ref name="cashforclunkersnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=18 July 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130718180814/http://cashforclunkersnews.com/news/dianne-feinstein/|url=http://cashforclunkersnews.com/news/dianne-feinstein/ |title=Cash for Clunkers: Bill News and Information |first=Dianne |last=Feinstein |publisher=Cashforclunkersnews.com |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Senate, the cash-for-clunkers legislation was inserted into a larger war supplemental funding bill. Dissenting Senators raised a point of order under Rule 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=RulesOfSenate.View&amp;Rule_id=fd8af2a4-e84b-42b5-a968-15ae11b902e2&amp;CFID=10321366&amp;CFTOKEN=88056232 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081126185840/http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=RulesOfSenate.View&amp;Rule_id=fd8af2a4-e84b-42b5-a968-15ae11b902e2&amp;CFID=50804001&amp;CFTOKEN=68172901 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-26 |title=United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration: Rules of the Senate |publisher=Rules.senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits insertion of provisions not previously passed by either house into conference reports. The rule was overridden with 60 votes, despite some senators, including Sam Brownback, being uncomfortable with a last-minute change that called for the bill's funding to come from "deficit spending" rather than from the stimulus package that was originally agreed upon. The larger funding bill passed by a vote of 91–5 in the Senate.&lt;ref name="cashforclunkersnews.com"/&gt;

The [[Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009]] was signed into law with the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Program (C.A.R.S.) as Title XIII. The program received an initial allocation of $1 billion (out of the $4 billion estimated cost) funded by the U.S. government and the program time length was July&amp;nbsp;1 – November&amp;nbsp;1. It was implemented by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) which had 30&amp;nbsp;days from the approval of the bill to post all program details online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ConsumerAssistanceToRecycleAndSaveProgram.org |title=Cash For Clunkers Information Resource Center; Calculate Your Voucher |publisher=Consumerassistancetorecycleandsaveprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814222130/http://www.consumerassistancetorecycleandsaveprogram.org/ |archivedate=August 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] estimate that the $1 billion appropriated for the system was almost exhausted by July 30, 2009, due to very high demand,&lt;ref name=NYT0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP0801/&gt;&lt;ref name="suspended"/&gt; [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] approved an additional $2 billion for the program with the explicit support of the [[Obama Administration]].&lt;ref name=ABC0806/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNBC&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/32235069 |title=House Votes to Add $2 Billion To Cash-for-Clunkers Program |publisher= CNBC |accessdate=2009-08-01 |date=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2009, the House of Representatives approved the extra $2 billion for the program,&lt;ref name=NYT0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNBC/&gt; and the Senate approved the extension on August 6, defeating all six [[amendments]] presented.&lt;ref name=ABC0806/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0807/&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law on August 7, and the appropriation was exhausted by August 24, 2009.&lt;ref name=NYT0820/&gt;

==Eligibility criteria==
* Vehicle must be less than 25 years old on the trade-in date.
* Only the purchase or 5 year minimum [[lease]] of new vehicles qualify.
* Generally, trade-in vehicles must get a weighted combined average rating of 18 or fewer miles per gallon (some very large [[pickup truck]]s and cargo vans have different requirements).
* Trade-in vehicles must be registered and insured continuously for the full year preceding the trade-in.
* Trade-in vehicles must be in driveable condition.
* The program requires the scrapping of the eligible trade-in vehicle and that the dealer disclose to the customer an estimate of the scrap value of the trade-in. The scrap value, however minimal, will be in addition to the rebate, and not in place of the rebate.
* The new car bought under the plan must have a suggested retail price of no more than $45,000, and for passenger automobiles, the new vehicle must have a combined fuel economy value of at least {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cars.gov/faq#category-10 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090727202449/http://www.cars.gov/faq#category-10 |archivedate=2009-07-27 |title=Car Allowance Rebate System - Helpful Q&amp;As for Consumers - Formerly Referred to as "Cash for Clunkers" |publisher=CARS.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last-minute car ineligibility===
According to ''[[USA Today]]'', the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) revised its mileage estimate list just before the start of the Car Allowance Rebate System program.&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt;

For example, the 1991 Dodge Grand Caravan is listed below as ineligible because the 1991 Dodge Grand Caravan with a 4&amp;nbsp;cylinder engine has an EPA combined mileage of 19 and is not eligible; however, the V6&amp;nbsp;3.3&amp;nbsp;L and 3.8&amp;nbsp;L engines in these vehicles have EPA combined mileage of 18 and thus are eligible. The changes made some of the following cars with certain engine configurations ineligible:&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news|url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2009/07/68495610/1 |title=Here's a list of the 78 vehicles that EPA just declared ineligible for 'Cash for Clunkers' |publisher=usatoday.com |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA "gave no reason its ratings were inaccurate or why some went up", according to ''USA Today''.&lt;ref name=2ndGlitch&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-07-28 |url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/090728-EPA-Mileage-Changes-Wreck-Some-Cash-for-Clunkers-Deals/ |title=EPA Mileage Changes Wreck Some Cash for Clunkers Deals |publisher=Usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Brauer, editor in chief of Edmunds.com, said, "It's unfortunate that consumers who had been researching and planning to trade in their vehicle ... are now left in the dust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woodyard |first=Chris |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2009-07-27-cash-for-clunkers-list-changes_N.htm?poe=HFMostPopular |title=Cash-for-clunkers auto eligibility list changed |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Consumers acting in good faith should not be penalized for undisclosed and last-minute changes made by the

The U.S. Department of Transportation ruled that deals involving cash-for-clunkers trade-ins based on old EPA mileage numbers and consummated before July&amp;nbsp;24 would be honored, but that deals consummated after July&amp;nbsp;24 on vehicles that became ineligible as clunkers due to mileage ratings changes would not be honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.autoobserver.com/2009/07/some-clunker-deals-based-on-old-epa-numbers-will-be-honored-dot-rules.html#more |title=Some Clunker Deals Based On Old EPA Numbers Will Be Honored, DOT Rules |publisher=Autoobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Credit ==

To ensure that vehicles traded-in under "cash for clunkers" will not be resold by dealers, the program outlines a procedure for destructively disabling the engine (and thus also precluding the possibility that any mechanical engine components might be salvaged to be used in the repair of any other vehicles): The [[motor oil]] is drained and replaced with a [[sodium silicate]] solution, then the engine is started and run until the solution, becoming glass-like when heated, causes engine internals to abrade and ultimately seize.&lt;ref name="helliker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Helliker |first=Kevin |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124934376942503053#mod=loomia?loomia_si=t0:a16:g2:r5:c0.077553:b26935024 |title=The Killer App for Clunkers Breathes Fresh Life Into 'Liquid Glass' |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the salvage or scrap facility which acquires the vehicle cannot sell the engine, cylinder heads or a "rolling chassis" from the scrap vehicle. The salvage or scrap facility can sell any other component (including the transmission and axles) from the scrap vehicle separately and may dismantle and warehouse the parts. The "hull" of the vehicle must be crushed within 180 days. Cut off or unbolt front end assemblies may be saved and sold at a later date, as well as the "top and back" of pickup cabs.

The outlined procedure says that running the engine at 2,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] "should disable the engine within a few minutes"; if not, then allow the engine to cool off before repeating the procedure. Hazards associated with the intentional overheating and destruction of the engine include rupturing radiator and hot water/steam, motor oil ejection, toxic fumes, and fire.

By completely disabling the engine, the CARS program avoids recycling schemes such as the one discovered in Germany, where authorities found that an estimated 50,000 scrapped vehicles have been exported to Africa and Eastern Europe, where newer, safer cars of the type being destroyed in the West are prohibitively expensive,&lt;ref name=NYTGer&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/europe/08germany.html?hpw |title=Driving Out of Germany, to Pollute Another Day |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Carter |last=Dougherty |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the U.S. program, the German program only requires dealers to drop off the scrapped vehicles at junkyards, thus allowing the illegal exports.&lt;ref name=NYTGer/&gt;

[[Vehicle recycling|Auto recyclers]] and [[Wrecking yard|dismantlers]] have criticized the program due to requirements that the engine is to be disabled to prevent re-use of the car. To auto recyclers, a car's engine is considered to be the most valuable part of a junked car. Some recyclers have refused to participate in the program as well due to the limited profit potential of junking a car brought in under CARS.&lt;ref name="Scrappers"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/2009/08/05/111561543/clunkers-pile-up-on-auto-dealers-death-row?ps=rs |title=Clunkers' Pile Up On Auto Dealer's 'Death Row |first=Elizabeth |last=Shogren |publisher=National Public Radio (NPR) Morning Edition |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Motor Vehicle Title Information System ==
After [[Hurricane Katrina]], vehicles that were declared as total losses in one state were transferred to other states and resold to unsuspecting consumers with clean titles. To avoid clunkers declared under the CARS program that could also find their way back onto the used-car market through surreptitious means, the federal government set up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) to track totaled vehicles and prevent their resale. By October 2009, 28 state motor-vehicle agencies participated or contributed to NMVTIS, and 11 others were working toward participation. All states were required to be fully participating by January 1, 2010.&lt;ref name=Autoweek102609&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20091015/CARNEWS/910159997 |title=Federal database tracks totaled vehicles, clunkers |first=Angie |last=Favot |date=2009-10-15 |publisher=Auto Week |accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CARS program required that recyclers report the [[Vehicle Identification Numbers]] (VINs) and the status of clunker to the NMVTIS within seven days of acquiring the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer assistance to recycle and save program: most transactions met program requirements, but program completion activities continue |url= https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/dot/files/CARS%20FINAL%204.29.10%20508.pdf |website=OIG.DOT.gov |publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |accessdate=16 June 2014}}{{Dead link |date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The searchable database (for a fee) contains information on vehicles from insurance companies, junkyards, and salvage yards.&lt;ref name=Autoweek102609 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Motor Vehicle Title Information System: Research Vehicle History |url= https://www.vehiclehistory.gov/nmvtis_vehiclehistory.html |website=www.vehiclehistory.gov |accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program results==
Auto Observer said there was one major technological glitch in the program. "Government officials said the public site for customers and the site for dealer sign-ups were on the same server, which [[Denial-of-service attack#Unintentional denial of service|became overloaded]]. The site was taken down [the night of July&amp;nbsp;24, 2009] while the two functions supposedly were separated and put on two different servers", Auto Observer reported.&lt;ref name=2ndGlitch /&gt; Dealers also had difficulty getting paperwork processed. Given the uncertainty of being paid, dealers decided to wait on destroying the old cars.&lt;ref name=2b&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-5201809.html |title=Extra $2B approved for 'cash for clunkers' |publisher=CBS news |agency=Associated Press |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 29, $150 million of the $1 billion had already gone to new purchases. Dealers have had a higher volume of potential customers, partly because of other incentives offered by the manufacturers and the sellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archivedate=2 August 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802103653/http://www.kansascity.com/340/story/1353725.html |url= http://www.kansascity.com/340/story/1353725.html |title=Cash for Clunkers is an effective driver of greener car sales |newspaper=Kansas City Star |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dealers believed the increase was only temporary. However, many people who visited car dealers found out their cars were not eligible, but they bought cars anyway. A lot of people who were able to participate were buying anyway, but their trade-in value jumped significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124874213704185413 |title='Clunker' Rebates Stir Car Buyers |first1=Alex P. |last1=Kellogg |first2=Josh |last2=Mitchell |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]], the cars purchased had higher gas mileage than what the bill required.&lt;ref name=2b/&gt;

The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] reported 23,000 participating dealers. Stabenow said 40,000 cars had been sold and another 200,000 sales had yet to be completed. Sutton chief of staff Nichole Francis Reynolds said, "The program has spent $150 million and has another $800 million to $850 million in (pending) obligations. ... This is one of those programs you can really see working". Rep. [[Candice Miller]] (R-Mich.) said, "It has exceeded everyone's expectations". Miller and Sutton wanted to spend a total of $4 billion on the program. Bailey Wood, legislative director of the [[National Auto Dealers Association]], said, "Obviously the program has been an immense success in stimulating automotive sales".&lt;ref name=suspended/&gt;

On July 30, Wood announced the suspension of the program. [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]] Press Secretary Robert Gibbs denied this was happening, saying the administration is "evaluating all options". Dealers that have been aggressively advertising the program cannot simply stop the ads, so there were concerns about whether the program would continue.&lt;ref name=suspended/&gt; According to estimates of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], the $1 billion appropriated for the system was exhausted by July 30, 2009, well before the anticipated end date of November 1, 2009, due to very high demand.&lt;ref name=NYT0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=suspended/&gt; The House of Representatives appropriated another $2 billion to the program on July 31,&lt;ref name=NYT0801/&gt;&lt;ref name=2b/&gt; with the Senate adding its approval a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.automotiveworld.com/news/environment/77925-us-senate-approves-us-2bn-cars-extension |title=US: Senate approves US$2bn CARS extension|work=Automotive World|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law on August 7, and government officials expect that the additional funds will be exhausted by [[Labor Day]].&lt;ref name=NYT0807/&gt;

Former [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] said on [[ABC News|ABC's]] ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' that the success of the program resulted from waiting for the economy to improve. He said, "If ... the clunker program had been put in place six months ago, it would have probably been a dud". Greenspan did not believe the program had stimulated the economy.&lt;ref name=greenspan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/08/02/greenspan-clunkers-cash-effect-economic-rebound-cause/ |title=Greenspan: Clunkers Cash An Effect of Economic Rebound, Not Cause|work=Fox News|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, the DoT reported from a sample of 120,000 rebate applications already processed, that "the average gas mileage of cars being bought was 28.3 miles per gallon, for SUVs 21.9 miles per gallon, and for trucks, 16.3 miles per gallon, all significantly higher than required to get a rebate".&lt;ref name=NYT0803&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/business/04auto.html?_r=1&amp;scp=13&amp;sq=Ford%20cash%20for%20clunkers&amp;st=cse |title=As ' lunker' Rebates Help Ford, Aid May Be Extended |newspaper=The New York Times|first=Nick |last=Bunkley |first2=Derrick |last2=Henry|date=2009-08-03|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Susan M.

The DoT also reported that "Ford, G.M. and Chrysler supplied 47 percent of the new vehicles, slightly more than their overall share of the market, which is 45 percent". [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Detroit's Big Three]] automakers said the demand peak that occurred in the final week of July left their inventories of unsold vehicles at the lowest levels in many years, but such windfall could hurt sales of some popular models in August.&lt;ref name=NYT0803/&gt; Ford sales went up in the United States for the first time since 2007, while GM and Chrysler at least improved by slowing their decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32269548/ns/business-autos/t/cash-clunkers-boosts-auto-sales-july/#.UHy6P445iYs |title=Cash for clunkers boosts auto sales in July|publisher=msnbc.msn.com |agency=Associated Press |date=2009-08-03|accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A September 2010 open access [[Social Science Research Network]] study concluded that the program simply pulled purchases from the future: it produced a short-lived effect (360,000 additional cars sold in two months), but that the effect was almost completely reversed in the seven following months due to fewer cars sold, and found no evidence of effect on employment, house prices, or household default rates in cities with higher exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mian|first1=Atif R.| first2=Amir |last2=Sufi|title=The Effects of Fiscal Stimulus: Evidence from the 2009 'Cash for Clunkers' Program |journal=| date=2010-09-01|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1670759|ssrn=1670759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/09/02/129608251/cash-for-clunkers |title=Study: Cash For Clunkers Was A Wash |first=David |last=Kestenbaum |publisher=National Public Radio |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An article in ''[[The Economist]]'' argued that the program is the kind of policy required to avoid the [[liquidity trap]] in times of [[economic depression]], as defined by [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref name=Economist0408/&gt; The article states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the boost in demand that the rebates have brought about is exactly the sort of stimulus that is urgently needed to escape what John Maynard Keynes called a "liquidity trap". According to his theory, consumers may become so worried about the economy that they cling to as much liquid wealth as possible, cutting their spending sharply and thereby triggering precisely the slump they feared. Moreover, as stimulus policies go, cash-for-clunkers looks to be unusually effective. Admittedly, that is not an especially demanding measure, given that Keynes favoured, if need be, burying money in bottles for people to dig up and spend. Cash-for-clunkers has many benefits beyond simply getting more money passing through the hands of consumers and into aggregate demand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* John Irons, research and policy director for the [[Economic Policy Institute]], said that in improving the economy, "in terms of bang for the buck, this is up there pretty high up there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url= http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/06/news/companies/clunkers_economic_impact/?postversion=2009080612 |title=Cash for Clunkers: Real stimulus |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacksonville State University]] economist and [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] scholar Christopher Westley said that the program "sticks it" to the poor and lower-middle classes by raising the price of the remaining cars in the secondary market, as well as by raising the general price level resulting from the [[monetary inflation]] required to finance it. Westley called CARS the "I Hate the Poor Act of 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Westley |first=Christopher |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-i-hate-the-poor-act-of-2009 |title=The "I Hate the Poor" Act of 2009: Who Really Benefits from Cash for Clunkers Program |publisher=Foundation for Economic Education |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Despite [[United States Department of Transportation|Transportation]] [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary]] [[Ray LaHood]]'s claims that the program would benefit scrapyards,&lt;ref name="LiveDeskFox"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/video/index.html?playerId=011008&amp;streamingFormat=FLASH&amp;referralObject=7849014&amp;referralPlaylistId=playlist Auto Industry 'Lifeline'] Fox News LiveDesk broadcast on August 5, 2009 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; auto recyclers and scrapyards lamented the cost of transporting and removing toxic waste (such as [[motor oil]], [[coolant]], [[refrigerants]], [[gasoline]], unrecoverable [[plastics]], and other items)&lt;ref name="MyFox"&gt;[http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/dpgo_cash_for_clunkers_bad_for_environment_lwf_080409_2831587 Cash For Clunkers: Bad For Environment?]{{Dead link|date=October 2012}} By Lily Fu ''My Fox Chicago'' Tuesday, 4 Aug 2009; accessed August 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; from the car before processing, which can amount to $700–1,200 per car. Some recyclers refuse to participate in the program due to this.&lt;ref

*Early reports showed that the program, though promoted as bolstering Detroit's embattled carmakers, have actually increased market share for Japanese and Korean automakers. According to data published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Americans have used the scrappage incentives to buy more vehicles from Toyota than any of the three Detroit carmakers. Only Ford did not drop in market share after the program was introduced.&lt;ref name="japkor"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Autos/idUSTRE57P5C220090826 |title=Japanese, Koreans gain most from cash for clunkers |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to an [[Edmunds.com]] study released October 28, the program actually cost Americans nearly $20,000 more per car than the maximum rebate. Only 125,000 of the 690,000 purchases would not have been made without the incentives, the company said, and with $3 billion spent, that works out to $24,000 per car.&lt;ref name=trumbull&gt;{{cite news|last=Trumbull |first=Mark |url= http://features.csmonitor.com/economyrebuild/2009/10/28/report-cash-for-clunkers-was-a-lemon |title=Report: Cash for Clunkers was a lemon |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the White House disputes this claim on the grounds that Edmunds relies on two faulty assumptions: it assumes "that the market for cars that didn't qualify for cash for clunkers was completely unaffected by this program" and "ignores the beneficial impact that the program will have on 4th Quarter GDP because automakers have ramped up their production to rebuild their depleted inventories."&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/10/29/busy-covering-car-sales-mars-edmundscom-gets-it-wrong-again-cash-clunkers |title=Busy Covering Car Sales on Mars, Edmunds.com Gets It Wrong (Again) on Cash for Clunkers |first=Macon |last=Phillips |date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A study published by the [[Center for Business and Economic Research]] at Ball State University estimated the actual CARS-induced automobile sales increase as roughly 685,000 for July and August 2009. The author used an econometric model of monthly automobile sales, treating the CARS period of July and August in two different ways to account for the inconsistent time periods in each. Noting several concerns with the legislation, this author noted that: "one criticism of the program – that cash for clunkers actually led to few additional automobiles sold – does not survive the scrutiny of empirics ... the program must be viewed as a success"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CentersandInstitutes/BBR/~/media/DF360CADE9424CA0AB9B8CDA68AAA952.ashx |last=Hicks |first=Michael J. |date=November 2009 |title=Some Preliminary Evaluation of the Cash for Clunkers Program |work=Center for Business and Economic Research, Ball State University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527142231/http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CentersandInstitutes/BBR/~/media/DF360CADE9424CA0AB9B8CDA68AAA952.ashx |archivedate=27 May 2010 |accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charities===
[[Charitable organization]]s bemoaned the program, noting the lack of repairable cars for charity purposes, and a source of revenue to fund programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106612934&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1017 |title=Charities Lament 'Cash For Clunkers' Program |first=Elizabeth |last=Shogren |publisher=NPR - All Things Considered |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of charities, under the umbrella of [[Harvard "Pete" Palmer, Jr.|Pete Palmer]]'s Vehicle Donation Processing Center, reported a 7.5% decline in car donations in the month the Car Allowance Rebate System debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payne |first=Paul |title=Charities happy to see end of clunkers program.

===Environmental effects===
Critics argued that people trading in cars would use such funds to mostly buy trucks, with a minimal benefit on gas mileage.&lt;ref name="CNNMoney"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Liberto |first2=Ben |last2=Rooney |url= http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/06/autos/clunkers_vote |title=Senate OK's $2 billion more for Cash for Clunkers |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the average fuel economy of a clunker was 15.8 mpg, compared to 25.4 mpg for the car that replaced it—a 61% improvement (37% improvement if using gallons per 1,000 miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hybridcars.com/news/cash-clunkers-fuel-economy-boost-25956.html |title=Clunkers Nets Big Fuel Economy Boost |publisher=Hybridcars.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; New federal data analyzed by The Associated Press finds that the single most common swap, at an occurrence rate of more than 8,200 times, involved Ford F-150 pickup owners. The fuel economy for the new trucks ranges from 15 to 17 miles per gallon, which equates to a mere 1 to 3 mpg improvement over the clunkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carallowancerebatesystem.tumblr.com/ | title= Car Allowance Rebate System! }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]], in using Edmunds data, noted that many not-so-green cars have also been bought under CARS, notably [[SUV]]s, [[Truck]]s, [[luxury vehicle|Luxury]], and [[Crossover (automobile)|Crossover]] vehicles. Some buyers have been noted to have bought the [[Cadillac SRX]], while other vehicles such as the [[Hummer H3T]], [[Lexus RX 350]], [[Lincoln MKX]], and [[BMW X3]] are qualified under the program, despite being rated under 20 mpg, some considerably less than the average 25.3 mpg for cars purchased under CARS. The models also fall under the $45,000 threshold outlined in CARS.&lt;ref name="APSpin"&gt;{{cite news|title=$3 billion buys not-so-green vehicles |url= https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/08/13/3-billion-buys-not-so-green-vehicles/ |newspaper=The Mercury News |date=13 August 2009 |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Declan McCullagh]], from [[CBS News|CBSNews.com]], argued that "as fuel efficiency has increased since the early 1980s, cars get driven more. Plus, there's the environmental cost of building the new vehicles in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/08/05/business/econwatch/entry5217824.shtml |title="Cash For Clunkers" Does Little To Help The Environment |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2009-08-22 |first=Declan |last=McCullagh}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Chameides]], dean of the [[Nicholas School of the Environment]] at [[Duke University]], argued that between 3 and 12 tons of carbon dioxide are emitted for each new car, due to such factors as shipping the car and the electricity consumed in manufacturing it. In addition, in order to offset the carbon footprint of the new car from a clunker (using the ratio of 18 mpg for the "clunker" and the minimum 22 mpg for a qualifying vehicle), the average driver would need to drive the car about five and a half years; with trucks, the figure jumps to eight or
nine years of typical driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111511131 |title=Critics Say 'Clunkers' Program Isn't Very Green |first=Christopher |last=Joyce |publisher=National Public Radio (NPR) All Things Considered |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard economics professor [[Edward Glaeser]] argues that subsidizing fuel-efficient vehicles encourages more driving, as the [[marginal cost]] per mile driven is less, which causes total fuel consumption to decrease less than expected. He proposes that a more effective policy would be to raise taxes on carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/08/08/program_has_clunky_reasoning |title=Program has clunky reasoning (op-ed) |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=8 August 2009 | format=fee required }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Belzowski, a scientist at the [[University of Michigan]]'s Transportation Research Institute, notes that the number of vehicles involved in the CARS program (~250 thousand) is a small fraction of the number of vehicles currently on U.S. roads (~260 million) and thus is not expected to have an appreciable effect on pollution savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/08/04/us/AP-US-Cash-for-Clunkers-Pollution.html |title="Cash for Clunkers" effect on Pollution? a blip |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2009-08-04|accessdate=2009-08-16}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] evaluated the effects of the program on the average [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] considering a baseline without the existence of the program, since there was already a trend for buying vehicles with higher fuel economy due to the [[2008 Oil Crisis|high gasoline prices of 2007 and 2008]], and the [[economic crisis of 2008]]. The study found that the program improved the average fuel economy of all vehicles purchased by 0.6 mpg in July 2009 and by 0.7 mpg in August 2009, as summarized in the following table:&lt;ref name="UoM"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/64025/1/102323.pdf |title=The Effect of the "Cash for Clunkers" Program on the Overall Fuel Economy of Purchased New Vehicles Report No. UMTRI-2009-34 |first=Michael |last=Sivak |first2=Brandon |last2=Schoettle |publisher=Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan |date=September 2009|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rationale for removing the most inefficient vehicles====
Saving one gallon of gasoline per 100 miles saves 20 pounds of carbon dioxide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/420f05001.htm#calculating |title=Emission Facts: Average Carbon Dioxide Emissions Resulting from Gasoline and Diesel Fuel |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510200548/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/420f05001.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately one ton of carbon dioxide every 10,000 miles of driving. An improvement from 14 mpg to 25 mpg saves 3 gallons of gas per 100 miles, or 3 tons of carbon dioxide in 10,000 miles of driving. The replacement of older vehicles also reduces other non-greenhouse pollutants. "Gas consumption" calculators that translate "miles per gallon" to a measure of "[[gallons per mile]]" can help car buyers see the gas savings from their trade ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gpmcalculator.com/ |title=GPM calculator |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090722202035/http://www.gpmcalculator.com/ |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] spokesman Eric Bolton pointed out the newer cars purchased under the program are also "considerably safer than the old clunkers they are replacing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090804/ap_on_re_us/us_cash_for_clunkers_pollution |title='Cash for clunkers' effect on pollution?

===Scrap value===
Part of the Car Allowance Rebate System bill made buyers eligible for the scrap value of the car along with the rebate, with the dealers taking in $50 of the value and to share the rest of the value to the buyer. While some dealers and Car Dealer Associations have argued that buyers were not entitled to the scrap value of the car, advocacy groups and State Attorney's General argued that the law made the issue clear that buyers were entitled to the scrap value of the car. Some dealers have claimed that they did pass on the scrap value of the car to buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/01/02/seeking_more_cash_for_their_clunkers/?page=full |title=Seeking more cash for their clunkers |publisher=Boston.com |date= January 2, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-06 |first=Lyle |last=Moran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic cars crushed under the program===
[[Jalopnik]] reviewed the lists published by the NHTSA and found numerous cars crushed under the program that had book values far exceeding the rebates offered by the government. Among some of the cars whose book value was worth more than government rebates included models ranging from the [[GMC Typhoon]] to the [[Bentley Continental R]].&lt;ref name="JalopnikExoticClunkers1"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://jalopnik.com/5365954/ten-most-exotic-cars-destroyed-by-cash-for-clunkers/gallery/# |title=Ten Most Exotic Cars Destroyed By Cash For Clunkers |publisher=Jalopnik |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a further review noted that many cars that were thought of as being crushed under the program were improperly recorded and/or swapped for other car models or trims.&lt;ref name="JalopnikExoticClunkers2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jalopnik.com/5454090/exclusive-jalopnik-audit-of-clunked-exotics-finds-initial-news-reports-false|title=Exclusive Jalopnik Audit Of Clunked Exotics Finds Initial News Reports False |publisher=Jalopnik |date= Jan 22, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some exotic/collectible vehicles were scrapped under the program included a [[Maserati Biturbo]] with 18,140 miles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley |first=Duncan |title=Colorado man turns in a Maserati BiTurbo for the Cash for Clunkers Program |url= https://www.inquisitr.com/33524/colorado-man-turns-in-a-maserati-biturbo-for-the-cash-for-clunkers-program/ |work=The Inquisitr |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[GMC Syclone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jalopnik.com/5462441/morons-clunkerize-rare-gmc-syclone-super-truck|title=Morons Clunkerize Rare GMC Syclone Super Truck|publisher=Jalopnik |date= Feb 2, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was removed from scrappage in the program by a group of car enthusiasts &lt;ref name="gmcpedia.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.gmcpedia.org/save-a-syclone-from-cash-for-clunkers |title=Save a Syclone from Cash for Clunkers |work=GMCpedia.org |date=2016-03-04 |access-date=2017-05-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084621/http://www.gmcpedia.org/save-a-syclone-from-cash-for-clunkers |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[GMC Typhoon]],&lt;ref name="gmcpedia.org"/&gt; An [[Isuzu Vehicross]], a [[La Forza]] [[SUV]],&lt;ref name="JalopnikExoticClunkers2"/&gt; a [[TVR 280i]],&lt;ref name="JalopnikExoticClunkers2"/&gt; and various [[Ford Mustang]], [[Ford Taurus SHO]], [[Chevrolet Camaro]], and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] models, among other cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://jalopnik.com/5337431/make-the-pain-stop-corvette-gets-clunked |title=Make The Pain Stop!

== Ending the program ==
On August 20, 2009, [[United States Department of Transportation|Transportation]] [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary]] [[Ray LaHood]] announced that the program would end at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Monday, August 24.&lt;ref name=NYT0820/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN0820&gt;{{cite news|last=Valdes |first=Peter |url= http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/20/autos/cash_for_clunkers_end/index.htm?postversion=2009082016 |title=Cash for clunkers program to end Monday |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2009-08-20|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement, several dealers decided to stop participating in the program after Saturday, August 22, due to the difficulties in processing their reimbursements through the government web site where the paperwork must be filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/us/22dealers.html |title=Last-Minute ' lunker' Car Traders May Be Too Late |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Shaila |last=Dewan |date=2009-08-21|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary Ray LaHood also commented that "it [had] been a thrill to be part of the best economic news story in America", in a news conference regarding the announcement on August 20.&lt;ref name=DoT0820&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26304.html |title=Secretary LaHood Announces Wind Down to Hugely Popular CARS Program |publisher=Dot.gov |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early August 25, the DoT reported 665,000 dealer transactions corresponding to $2.77 billion in rebates.&lt;ref name=WP0825&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=143930 |title=Dealers hope for payment as Clunkers program ends|publisher=firstcoastnews.com |agency=Associated Press |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2012-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, former [[Obama administration]] economic advisor [[Austan Goolsbee]] stated that, "the administration misjudged how quickly the country could recover from the economic damage of the 2008 economic collapse" and now knowing that it has "proved a longer, tougher ride than we thought at the time", he would not have created this short-run program to stimulate the economy, but "he supports the overall stimulus program, which he claims warded off a depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Politico |url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/66447.html |title=Austan Goolsbee flunks 'cash for clunkers' |first=Tim |last=Mac |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Kyrgyzstan}}

The '''Central Asian revolt of 1916''', also known as the '''Semirechye Revolt'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 0:52)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as '''Urkun''' ({{lang-ky|үркүн}}, ''exodus'', {{IPA-all|yrˈkyn}}) in [[Kyrgyzstan]], was an anti-Russian uprising by the Muslim inhabitants of [[Russian Turkestan]]. Its direct cause was the conscription of Muslims who were formally exempted into a military service on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front of World War I]]. Underlying issues also included tensions between different ethnic groups under Russian rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fergananews.com/article.php?id=7003&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt led to the exodus of thousands of [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Kazakhs]] into China, while the suppression of the revolt by the Russian army led to thousands of deaths. However, the Russian state was not able to restore complete order until the outbreak of the [[October Revolution]]. Russian liberals like [[Alexander Kerensky]] and some Russian historians were the first to bring an international attention to these events.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Richard: Alexander Kerensky. The first love of the Revolution, London 1987. p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==
By 1916, the [[Turkestan]] and [[Governor-Generalship of the Steppes]] had accumulated many social, land and inter-ethnic contradictions caused by the resettlement of Russian settlers, which began in the second half of the 19th century, after the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] which abolished serfdom. A wave of resettlement was introduced by a number of lands and legislative reforms.

On June 2, 1886, and March 25, 1891, several acts were adopted which were "Regulations on the management of the Turkestan Krai" and "Regulations on the management of Akmola, Semipalatinsk, Semirechye, Ural and Turgai regions" that allowed most of the lands of these regions to be transferred to the ownership of the Russian Empire. Each family from the local population were allowed to own a plot of land of 15 acres for a perpetual use.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130504125742/turkestan.ucoz.ru/index/0-59|url=http://turkestan.ucoz.ru/index/0-59#selection-639.0-639.18|dead-url=yes|trans-title=History of Turkestan|language=ru|title=История Туркестана|archive-date=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1906 to 1912, as a result of [[Stolypin reform]]'s in Kazakhstan and the rest Central Asia, up to 500,000 peasant households were transported from central regions of Russia,&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; which divided about 17 tithes of developed lands.

==The Revolt==
[[File:Map of the Central Asian revolt of 1916.png|left|thumb|Approximate extent of the revolt]]

===Institution of Conscription===
After Emperor Nicholas II adopted on the "requisition of foreigners" at the age of 19 to 43 years inclusive, for rear work in the front-line areas of the First World War. The discontent of people fueled the unfair distribution of land, as well as the calls of Muslim leaders for a holy war against the Russian gaoura.

On 25 June 1916 (8 July 1916, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 10:18)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the start of the rebellion, [[Tsar Nicholas II]] adopted a draft of conscripting Central Asian men from the age of 19 to 43 into labor battalions for the service in the ongoing in support of the ongoing [[Brusilov Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 7:55)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regional Russian officers were bribed to exempt certain people from conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 11:03)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the uprising was also due to the transfer of lands by the Tsarist Government to Russian settlers, Cossack's, and poor settlers. Political and religious extremism played a role too{{cn|date=November 2018}}, as well as the fear of being used as [[Human shields]] during the Russo-German trench warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 12:26)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the uprising===

The first causalities of the revolt erupted in July 3-4, 1916 (16-17 July 1916, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}) in [[Khujand]], present-day [[Tajikistan]], when an outraged mob assaulted Russian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 13:29)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all 10 million people living in Turkestan were willing to participate. Such as the Tekeans living in the Transcaspian region, who were willing themselves to be conscripted. On July 7th (July 20th, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}), the civil unrest spread to [[Tashkent]], in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 13:38)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
The Rebels had several demands, including Transparency in how the lists of citizens due for conscription were compiled, to delay the draft until the end of the harvest, and for one man of each family to stay at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 14:15)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
83 Russian settlers died and 70 were captured following riots in [[Jizzakh]]. Subsequently, Russian troops entered the city and captured it, causing many civilian causalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 15:13)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
On July 17, 1916 (July 30th, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}), a martial law was declared over [[Turkestan Military District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 15:35)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurrection began spontaneously, but it was unorganized without a single leadership; nevertheless, the rebellion took a long time to suppress.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}   
  
On 31 July (13 August, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}), [[Aleksey Kuropatkin]], The Governor-General of Russian Turkestan, conducted a purge of the local hierarchy and convinced [[Nicholas II of Russia]] to postpone the conscription until mid-September. However, this effort proved too late to reverse the uprising. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 15:47)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
On August 10th (23 August, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}), Rebels numbering in the thousands attacked the city of Prebechakenska, While wielding White Banners. It was only defended by a local garrison of Russian Soldiers who were on leave from the front, who swiftly constructed two wooden cannons to try and beat back the attack. The First blew up, while the second was lost in a Kyrgyz attack. Undeterred, The defenders created 4 new cannons, which still work today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 17:34)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By August 11 (24 August, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}), a cavalry force of the Kyrgyz rebels disrupted a telegraph line between Verniy, Bishkek, Tashkent and European Russia. A wave of inter-ethnic violence also swept through Semirechye. Dungan detachments destroyed several Russian settlements of Ivanitskoe and Koltsovka in the region of Przhevalsk.  
  
A Kyrgyz attack on the Russian settlers in Sazanovka, Near lake [[Issyk-Kul]] was repelled after local women shot on the Khan leading the attack, causing the offensive to disintegrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 21:50)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebel weaponry===
  
The Rebels, Including those under the control of [[Ibrahim Tulayaf]], suffered weapon shortages throughout the course of the Rebellion. Weapons used by the rebels included iron-tipped spears and horse-whips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 25:00)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
At one point in the rebellion, Ibrahim had discovered that several cart munitions would soon pass through the mountain road that followed the [[Chu River]]. Subsequently, he organized an ambush in Bomgorch. After a brief cavalry skirmish and exchange of fire, the Rebels managed to capture 7 carts, with 9 crates of guns and 12 ammunition boxes.  The Rebel troops were delighted to be able to fight the Russian Army with their own tools. A rebel leader was quoted as saying "God has given us guns that Nicholas meant to use against the Kyrgyz - His cruelty will befall his own head.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 25:43)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Massacres by the rebels===
Other villages full of Russian immigrants, Cossacks, and workers were burnt down by the insurgents. Because the majority of men got drafted and were at the home front, the settlers could not organize a resistance. Some settlers fled, Some fought, while others were helped by friendly Kyrgyz neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 19:51)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the uprising, the majority of the relocated population who were mostly women, old people, and children died. Responses In a telegram to the Minister of War August 16 (29 August, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}), Turkestan Governor-General and Commander of the Turkestan Military District Alexei Kuropatkin reported: "In one Przewalski Uyezd 6024 families of Russian settlers suffered from property damage, of which the majority lost all movable property. 3478 people lost and died. 

In some places, especially in the Ferghana Valley, the uprising was led by dervish preachers who were calling for a jihad. One of the first people who announced the beginning of a "holy war" against the "infidels" was Kasim-Khoja, an [[Imam]] in the main mosque of [[Zaamin, Uzbekistan|Zaamin]] village. He proclaimed Zaaminsky Bek and organized the murder of A local police officer Sobolev, in which after that he then appointed his own ministers and announced a military campaign to capture the railway stations of Obruchevo and Ursatievskaya. Along the way, his force killed any Russian person that was encountered. 

The Governor-General of the Steppe Region Nikolai Sukhomlinov postponed the draft service until September 15, 1916 (28 September, {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}); however, it had no effect onto stopping the uprising in the province. Even the requests by [[Alikhan Bukeikhanov]] and [[Akhmet Baitursynov]] who were the leaders of a Kazakh nationalist movement which later became known as the [[Alash Party]] did not calm the population in an attempt to prevent brutal repressions towards unarmed civilians. The leaders repeatedly tried to convince the administration not to hurry with mobilization, conduct preparatory measures, and they also as well demanded a freedom of conscience, improving the environment of academic work, organizing the training of Kyrgyz and Kazakh children in their native language by establishing boarding schools for them and allowing local press.    

===Suppression of the revolt===
As a response, around 30,000 soldiers, including [[Cossacks]], armed with machine guns and artillery were diverted from the [[Eastern Front of World War I]] and sent in to crush the rebels, and arrived 2 weeks later via trains. The town of Novayrsiskya, which had resisted the Rebels for 12 days, was finally relieved thanks to the reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 26:47)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Local Cossacks and settler militias played an additional role too. By the end of the summer, the insurrection was put down in the Samarkand, Syrdarya, Fergana and in the other number of regions as well, forcing the rebels into the mountains. In the mountains, the Rebels suffered from the cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 34:04)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September and early October, the revolt was suppressed in Semirechye and the last remnants of resistance were crushed in late January 1917 at the Transcaspian region.  
  
By the end of Summer 1916, The Rebellion had started to wane. [[Aleksey Kuropatkin]] issued an order, explaining who was exempt from the draft, what kind of service the Kyrgyz would serve, and that conscripts would receive 1 ruble per day and free food and lodging. However, With no reliable lines of communication this message took over a month to reach the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 31:32)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As the uprising was being put down, there were often instances of executions including the ones committed by the settlers, which suffered brutally from the insurgents. For the murder of their parents, wives, and children; militiamen sometimes took revenge on innocent civilians or imprisoned people in those atrocities.

By order of the Turkestan governor-general, military courts were established in district cities and imposed death sentences towards all the rebels who took part in the uprising.  
  
In the eastern part of [[Russian Turkestan]], tens of thousands of surviving Kyrgyz and [[Kazakh people|Kazakhs]] fled toward China. In the [[Tien-Shan Mountains]] they died by the thousands in mountain passes over 3,000 meters high.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite news

On December 13, 1916 (December 26th, 1916 {{abbrlink|N.S.|New Style}}), [[Alexander Kerensky]] convened in the Russian Parliament to propose the [[Racial segregation|Segregation]] of the Russian settlers and the local settlers. He was quoted as saying "How can we possibly blame a backward, uneducated and suppressed aboriginal people so dissimilar to us, for having lost patience and committing acts of revolt for which they immediately felt remorse and regret?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rtd.rt.com/films/semirechye-on-fire/|title=Semirechye on Fire (Timestamp 39:55)|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
During the Soviet Union, leaders of the rebellion such as Amangeldy Imanov and Alibi Jangildin were seen as revolutionary heroes against the Tsarist regime, by having many streets and settlements in Kazakhstan named after them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Urkun was not covered by Soviet textbooks, and monographs on the subject were removed from Soviet printing houses.  As the [[Soviet Union]] was disintegrating in 1991, interest in Urkun grew.  Some survivors have begun to label the events a "massacre" or "genocide."&lt;ref name="rferl"/&gt; In August 2016, a public commission in Kyrgyzstan concluded that the 1916 mass crackdown was labelled as "genocide."&lt;ref name="rferl2"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyzstan-to-rename-extend-october-revolution-holiday/28831234.html|title =  Kyrgyzstan Renames Soviet-Era October Revolution Day, Lengthens Holiday|publisher = [[RFE/RL]]|date= 2 November 2017|accessdate = 2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Climate and Development Knowledge Network''' ('''CDKN''') is a £72 million (US$100 million) initiative, formed in 2010, that links developing countries with experts on [[climate change]]. Funded by the UK's [[Department for International Development]] and the Directorate-General for International Cooperation, its aim is to help [[developing nations]] adapt to the consequences of climate change and build capacity for a [[low-carbon economy]].

CDKN does this by combining research, advisory services and knowledge management in support of locally owned and managed policy processes. It works in partnership with decision-makers in the public, private and non-governmental sectors nationally, regionally and globally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weadapt.org/organisation/cdkn The Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN)], WeAdapt, accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

CDKN is run by an alliance of organisations, headed by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] and including the [[Overseas Development Institute]], a think tank on development and humanitarian issues; Fundación Futuro Latinoamericano, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) for [[sustainable development]] based in Ecuador; LEAD Pakistan (an NGO that aims to inspire leadership in developing Asian countries); and SouthSouthNorth, (an NGO that aims to reduce poverty in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]).&lt;ref name=hotline&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/news/policymakers-to-get-hotline-to-climate-experts.html Policymakers to get hotline to climate experts], SciDev Net, 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

CDKN works across [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America and the Caribbean]], with a focus on 12 priority countries: Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, India, Indonesia, Colombia, Peru and El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odi.org/projects/2202-climate-and-development-knowledge-network-cdkn CDKN Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN)], Overseas Development Institute, accessdate 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future Climate For Africa ===

CDKN hosts the Future Climate for Africa programme's Capacity Development and Knowledge Exchange Unit. Future Climate for Africa (FCFA) aims to generate fundamentally new climate science focused on Africa, and to ensure that this science has an impact on human development across the continent. FCFA's goal is to reduce disruption and damage from climate change and to safeguard economic development and poverty eradication efforts over the long-term. In this way, FCFA aims to make new African infrastructure and urban and rural plans and investments more climate-resilient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preventionweb.net/organizations/20706 Future Climate for Africa], PreventionWeb, accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A climate change curriculum for Southern Africa ===

CDKN also supported seven universities from five southern African countries in a project led by the [[University of Cape Town]], to develop a master's curriculum on climate change and sustainable development for the [[Southern African Regional Universities Association]] (SARUA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140910113736177 A climate change curriculum for Southern Africa], Michelle Paterson, ''University World News'', accessdate 25 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building Rwanda's capacity for climate compatible development ===

CDKN has been involved in capacity building in Rwanda through the national environment and climate change fund, FONERWA – the largest climate fund of its kind in Africa. By building capacity at national and district level to scope, develop and implement successful climate compatible development projects, the work will help support implementation of Rwanda's Green Growth &amp; Climate Resilience Strategy and build momentum for low carbon, climate resilient economic growth in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southsouthnorth.org/climate-and-development-knowledge-network-cdkn/ Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN)], South South North, accessdate 3 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of continued work in Rwanda through the project, "Building resilience in Rwanda through business collaboration," a CDKN-funded research study showed that small businesses around Nyabugogo River, Gatsata and other water catchment areas in [[Kigali]] could face further losses due to flooding if no urgent actions are taken to address the problem. A survey, carried out as part of the project, looked at how small businesses in Kigali are being affected by recurrent flooding, and found that the areas experienced losses estimated at Rwf178.2 million in direct and indirect damages caused by floods.&lt;ref name=nyabugogo&gt;[http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/Printer/2016-03-17/198071/ Nyabugogo businesses lose Rwf178m to flooding annually, shows survey], The New Times, accessdate 3 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister for Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs, Seraphine Mukantabana, said the findings are part of the needed continued efforts to sustain all actions for reducing disaster risks and building disaster-resilient communities: "We have the second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy to sustain the development momentum but we know potential obstacles that could impede achievement of these goals due to increasing disaster risks and impact of climate change."&lt;ref name=nyabugogo /&gt;

=== The impacts of climate change in Uganda ===
In 2016, CDKN produced the report, an [https://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UGANDA_Economic-assessment-of-climate-change_WEB.pdf Economic assessment of the impacts of climate change in Uganda], which was commissioned by the Government of [[Uganda]]. It aimed to provide the Government with economic evidence on the current and future costs associated with climate variability and predicted climate change, and the necessary adaptation measures for different sectors at both national and local scales. This evidence is intended to help policy-makers mainstream climate change and resilience into national and sectoral policies and develop the case for investing in adaptation.&lt;ref name=uganda20&gt;[https://www.weadapt.org/knowledge-base/national-adaptation-planning/inaction-on-climate-change-will-cost-uganda-20-times-more-than-adaptation Inaction on climate change will cost Uganda 20 times more than adaptation], WeAdapt, accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from the study has already informed Uganda's [[Intended Nationally Determined Contribution]] (INDC) to the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in Paris, France, in late 2015.&lt;ref name=uganda20 /&gt;

=== The Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan ===

After a heat wave hit [[Ahmedabad]], a western city of 5.5 million people, in May 2010, killing over 1,300 people, local authorities mapped areas with "high-risk" populations including slums, as part of an extreme heat action plan.&lt;ref name=nita&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/india-heatwave-disasters-idINKBN0OD2GT20150529 Ahmedabad offers way to beat the heat as 1,786 killed in heat wave], Nita Bhalla, Reuters, accessdate 3 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; CDKN supported the creation and roll-out of the action plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/healthcare/casestudies/heat-health-action-plan-in-India.html Beat the heat: Heat health action plan in India], PwC, accessdate 3 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The project built up public awareness of the risks of high temperatures and set up "cooling spaces" in temples, public buildings and malls in the summer months.&lt;ref name=nita /&gt;

The plan also involved community outreach initiatives, putting an early warning system in place that provides a seven-day advance forecast about high temperatures and impending heat waves, and capacity-building of health-case professionals to treat people with heat-related complications.&lt;ref name=langa &gt;[http://www.pressreader.com/india/the-hindu/20170402/283072709125329 How Ahmedabad beat the heat], Mahesh Langa, The Hindu, accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Hindu]], the city's Heat Action Plan, unveiled in 2013, has brought down heatwave-linked deaths by up to 25%.&lt;ref name=langa /&gt;

Women and young people at the forefront of climate adaptation action. The Ahmedabad heat wave project shows that women hawkers and street vendors are natural and easy brokers of learning around how to deal with heat wave. They pick up measures to respond as well as pass on the message to other women and children in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/report/india/feature-severe-heat-wave-grips-india-authorities-can-draw-insights-ahmedabad-experience Severe heat wave grips India – Authorities can draw on insights from Ahmedabad experience], ReliefWeb, accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scaling up climate smart agriculture ===
 
In Nepal, the CDKN project "Scaling Up Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) in Nepal", is developing portfolios of targeted climate-smart agricultural technologies and practices for benefitting women and marginalised farmers of the three agro-ecological zones of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libird.org/app/projects/view.aspx?record_id=61 Scaling Up Climate Smart Agriculture in Nepal (CSA)], LI-BIRD, accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan's renewable energy potential ===

Another CDKN project found that the use of photovoltaic panels in an industrial sector in Sialkot, Pakistan, could mitigate up to 377,000 tons of carbon dioxide and gain average savings of US$27,400 per year on electricity costs. The project, conducted alongside Ecofys, assessed a Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) as a policy tool to provide renewable energy to the city's industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecofys.com/en/news/sialkot-in-pakistan-nama-could-provide-industry-with-access-to-renewables-a/ NAMA could provide industry with access to renewables and trigger significant emissions reductions], Ecofys, accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin America and the Caribbean ==

=== Cities Footprint Project ===

In Latin America and the Caribbean, CDKN is working alongside municipal governments to orientate the growth of their cities towards low carbon and climate resilient development through the Cities Footprint Project. In its first phase, Cities Footprints has been implemented in three cities: La Paz in Bolivia, Quito in Ecuador and Lima in Perú.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citiesfootprint.com/index.html Cities Footprint Project], accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The project focuses on assessing the carbon and water footprints of each municipal government and of each participating city, and on promoting [greenhouse gas emissions] reductions and water management measures that contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ella.practicalaction.org/knowledge-new-post/introducing-the-cities-footprint-project/ Introducing the Cities Footprint], ELLA Network accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resilient Cities Initiative on Climate Change in Latin America and the Caribbean ===

A joint initiative between the [[International Development Research Centre]] (IDRC)  and CDKN, the Resilient Cities Initiative, helps strengthen decision-making and scale-up effective action on climate resilient development to improve the livelihoods of those most affected by climate change in Latin America.&lt;ref name=idrc&gt;[https://www.idrc.ca/en/project/resilient-cities-initiative-climate-change-latin-america-and-caribbean Resilient Cities Initiative on Climate Change in Latin America and the Caribbean], International Development Research Centre (IDRC) accessdate 2 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
According to IDRC, the projects are:

* "Home" as a catalyst for resilience: relocation in the Amazon Rainforest. This project investigates how new settlements can be designed to be resilient to climate change, create social cohesion, and promote alternative livelihood opportunities, with a focus on Nuevo Belen in Iquitos, Peru.
* A participatory decision-making approach towards climate-resilient and inclusive urban development in Latin America. This project will develop and apply a practical, innovative, and participatory methodology and toolbox to support climate resilient, inclusive urban development in the rapidly growing cities of Latin America, with a focus on Santa Ana, El Salvador, Dos Quebradas, Colombia, and Santo Tome, Argentina.
* Triangle city cooperation: building joint climate resilient development in the Panama basin. This project investigates how city authorities and communities can work together to tackle climate related impacts at the meeting point of three countries: Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina.
* Building urban-rural linkages for food-secure and climate-resilient medium-sized cities in the Andes. This project will examine the contribution of alternative food systems to improving food security and responding to climate change in the cities of Pasto and Popayan, Colombia.
* Strengthening climate-resilient development in urban-rural landscapes using a Water-Energy-Food Nexus approach. This project will focus on the Amazonian city of Tarapoto and the surrounding region and will generate evidence on the interdependencies and trade-offs between natural resource availability and demands on water, energy, and food across different users.
* Effects of booms and busts and climate disturbances on livelihoods and resilience of small Amazon delta cities. This project will chart the history of economic misfortunes and climate variability and change in small Amazon delta cities.&lt;ref name=idrc /&gt;

== Negotiations Support ==

CDKN's Negotiations Support programme provides legal and technical support to negotiators from the most climate vulnerable countries. These countries have the most to lose from climate change but are often unable to fully represent their interests in international climate negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/supporting-international-climate-negotiators-a-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework Supporting international climate negotiators – a monitoring and evaluation framework], www.gov.uk, accessdate 16 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Combatants_for_Peace_logo.png|thumb|right|300px| Combatants for Peace logo]]
'''Combatants for Peace''' ({{lang-he|לוחמים לשלום}}; {{lang-ar|مقاتلون من أجل آلسلام}}) is an Israeli-Palestinian [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] and an egalitarian, bi-national, grassroots movement committed to non-violent action against the “[[Military occupation#Examples of military occupations|Israeli occupation]] and all forms of [[violence]]” in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://cfpeace.org/about-us/our-vision/ About us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was formed in 2006 by Palestinians and Israelis who had taken an active role in the cycle of violence,&lt;ref name="HaaretzC4P2006"&gt;{{cite news|title=120 former Israeli, Palestinian combatants in new peace drive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411172726/http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/704675.html|accessdate=17 October 2017|agency=Reuters|publisher=Haaretz|date=10 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YnetC4P2006"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ynet|title=New movement: IDF soldiers and Fatah prisoners|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3238373,00.html|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=Yedioth Internet.|date=10 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to work together to promote a peaceful solution through non-violent action.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; Originally, the activists were solely ex-combatants: the Israeli soldiers and refuseniks of the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] and Palestinian fighters.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/502489&lt;/ref&gt; Today, members of the movement include also men and women who have never played a violent role in the conflict. Combatants for Peace is the only peace group worldwide, ''ever'' that was founded and run by ex-combatants on both sides of an active conflict. Other all other joint veteran-based peace initiatives have been co-founded only after peaceful resolution to their conflict has been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afcfp.org/about-us/vision-and-mission/|title=Vision and Mission - Combatants For Peace|work=Combatants For Peace|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary film “[http://disturbingthepeacefilm.com/ Disturbing The Peace]” was made in 2016 about the work of Combatants For Peace. The movie is being screened throughout Israel, Palestine, the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="C4Pfilm2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=DISTURBING THE PEACE A FILM BY RECONSIDER|url=http://cfpeace.org/disturbing-the-peace/|publisher=Combatants for Peace|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie has won numerous awards internationally including the first ever [[Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival#Awards|Ebert Humanitarian Award]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/ebertfest-2016-disturbing-the-peace-wins-first-ebert-humanitarian-award&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rogerebert.com/chazs-blog/disturbing-the-peace-stephen-apkon-talks-to-chaz-ebert&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision, Mission and Goals==

'''"In 2006, Palestinian and Israeli former combatants laid down their weapons and established Combatants for Peace (CfP). Committed to joint nonviolence since its foundation, CfP works to end the Israeli occupation and all forms of violence to build a peaceful future. For over a decade we have led social action based on shared values of freedom, democracy,  security and dignity for all. Combatants for Peace is a strong, significant, influential binational community that exemplifies viable cooperation: co-resistance to the occupation and violence. Through joint nonviolence in the present, we lay the foundations for a nonviolent future. In keeping with our values, we work towards a two state solution, or any other mutually agreed upon solution that will allow Israelis and Palestinians to live based freedom, security, democracy and dignity in their homeland."'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfpeace.org/about-us/our-vision/|title=Combatants for Peace {{!}}   Our vision|website=cfpeace.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combatants for Peace describes its main goals: 
* Building an ever-expanding Palestinian-Israeli joint activist community based upon CfP’s bi-national regional groups that embody our vision and serve as a model for both societies and their future.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;
* Motivating broad and effective bi-national, non-violent activity promoting freedom and security for both peoples in their homeland.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;
* Changing attitudes on a wide scale, both within the Israeli and Palestinian public, as well as with governmental decision makers.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Activities==
Combatants for Peace has organized a series of meetings between veterans from both sides, most taking place in [[East Jerusalem]] in the early years, but have expanded now into ten local bi-national groups operating between Tulkarm-Tel Aviv, Nablus-Tel Aviv, Ramallah-Tel Aviv, Jerusalem-Jericho, Jerusalem-Bethlehem, Beersheva-Hebron and in the North. Additionally, Combatants for Peace now organizes two region-wide Israeli-Palestinian bi-national groups, a [[Theatre of the Oppressed|Theater of the Oppressed]] group and women's group. They also participate in humanitarian aid work, including rebuilding demolished playgrounds, homes, schools and orchards in the West Bank.

Other activities include:
*Holding ex-combatants' meetings, allowing each side to tell their own story and understand the other's narrative. 
*Holding in-house meetings and educational lectures in public forums on both sides (including at universities, youth groups, schools on both sides, etc.). 
*Direct actions and protests against the policy of occupation and its outcomes such as road blockings, house demolitions, limitations on Palestinian farmers and confiscation of land by Israeli settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bostonreview.net/BR34.4/shulman.php bostonreview.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
*Organizing joint daytrips and educational tours for Israelis to see the situation in the occupied West Bank.&lt;ref name="Donate - Combatants For Peace"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afcfp.org/donate|title=Donate - Combatants For Peace|work=Combatants For Peace|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Solidarity actions such as joint olive harvests and agricultural work, to help Palestinian farmers who have difficulties in working their lands near army posts and Jewish settlements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afcfp.org/about-us/activities/|title=Activities - Combatants For Peace|work=Combatants For Peace|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Building playgrounds and schools for Palestinian communities, allowing children who live lives mired in violence and fear to also have hope.&lt;ref name="Donate - Combatants For Peace"/&gt;
*Producing special events such as the joint Memorial Day ceremony, allowing both sides to mourn together for the victims of the conflict and to call for an end of the violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Providing information and raising public awareness globally through media and international lecture tours.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2009/03/combatant_for_peace.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Building coalitions with other activist groups on the ground in order to have a greater impact and aid those in need. Two notable coalitions have been Sumud Freedom Camp and the Jordan Valley Coalition. Summed Freedom Camp helped to resettle two Palestinian families back on their own land,&lt;ref name="afcfp.org"&gt;http://www.afcfp.org/blog&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jordan Valley Coalition seeks to protect Bedouin shepherd and their communities from violence.&lt;ref name="afcfp.org"/&gt;
*Non-Violence Communication Trainings and Non-Violence Activist Trainings for Combatants activists&lt;ref name="http://www.afcfp.org/activities"&gt;http://www.afcfp.org/activities&lt;/ref&gt; These trainings serve to teach CFP activists how to engage nonviolently when encountering both immediate violent situations and in general, a violent society - and to help transform these interactions into effective nonviolent activism.&lt;ref name="http://www.afcfp.org/activities"/&gt;&lt;ref name="afcfp.org"/&gt;

There is no cross-border [[flag]] universally accepted as representing both jurisdictions on the island of [[Ireland]]. This can be a problem in contexts where a body organised on an all-island basis needs to be represented by a flag in an international context. 

The island is politically divided into the [[Republic of Ireland]] (a sovereign state comprising 26 of Ireland's 32 traditional counties) and [[Northern Ireland]] (comprising the remaining 6 counties in the north-east of Ireland, and a part of the [[United Kingdom]]), but all-island organisations are common. Examples include the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic Church in Ireland]], the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and the [[Church of Ireland]], the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]].

==Saint Patrick's Saltire==
{{Main|Saint Patrick's Saltire}}
{{Weasel|section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:St Patrick's saltire.svg|thumb|right|upright|Saint Patrick's Saltire]]
The Saint Patrick's [[Saltire]] was incorporated into the [[Union Flag]] in 1801 by way of the [[Act of Union 1800]] to represent Ireland within the new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Today, those who regard the [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] as specific to the Republic of Ireland, or excluding unionists, may advocate it as a neutral symbol of the whole island.

The [[Church of Ireland]] orders that, apart from the [[flag of the Anglican Communion]], only this saltire may be flown on its church grounds—as opposed to the tricolour, the Union Flag or the [[Ulster banner|former flag of Northern Ireland]]. This follows the practice of other Anglican churches in England, Scotland, and Wales, which fly the flags of their respective patron saints instead of the Union Flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ireland.anglican.org/index.php?do=information&amp;id=49|title= Church Of Ireland General Synod Sub Committee On Sectarianism Report|date=April 1999|author=Church of Ireland|authorlink=Church of Ireland}}: ''Resolution One: The General Synod of the Church of Ireland recognises that from time to time confusion and controversy have attended the flying of flags on church buildings or within the grounds of church buildings. This Synod therefore resolves that the only flags specifically authorised to be flown on church buildings or within the church grounds of the Church of Ireland are the cross of St Patrick or, alternatively, the [[Flag of the Anglican Communion|flag of the Anglican Communion bearing the emblem of the Compassrose]]. Such flags are authorised to be flown only on Holy Days and during the Octaves of Christmas, Easter, the Ascension of Our Lord and Pentecost, and on any other such day as may be recognised locally as the Dedication Day of the particular church building. Any other flag flown at any other time is not specifically authorised by this Church.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The saltire is also flown by [[St. Patrick's College, Maynooth]], on graduation days, and so it can be argued that St. Patrick's Saltire is used by the main Protestant church on the island and the Roman Catholic Church.

Modified versions have been used formerly by the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], and currently by the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dillon |first=Jim |year=1995 |title=The Evolution of Maritime Uniform |journal=Beam |publisher=Commissioners of Irish Lights |volume=24 |quote=In the Lighthouse Service the cap badge originally was a St George's Cross surrounded by a wreath of laurel leaves but from 1970 the St Patrick's Cross has been used. |url=http://www.commissionersofirishlights.com/cil/publications/beam-magazines/volume-24/the-evolution-of-maritime-uniform.aspx |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013111549/http://www.commissionersofirishlights.com/cil/publications/beam-magazines/volume-24/the-evolution-of-maritime-uniform.aspx |archivedate=13 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish tricolour==
{{main|Flag of Ireland}}
[[File:Flag of Ireland.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of the State of Ireland]]
The tricolour of green, white and orange, the official flag of the state of Ireland, is considered by [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]], to represent the entire island as well. [[Gerry Adams]] said in [[Dáil Éireann]] in 2011:&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/03/09/00008.asp#N167 Dáil debates Vol.728 No.1 p.8 c.52]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Above this Chamber flies the flag of this nation — all Thirty-Two Counties — the flag of green, white and orange.}}

However, this symbolism is rejected by [[Ulster unionism|Ulster unionist]]s, as illustrated by an exchange in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] in 1951:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=35&amp;pageno=2093&amp;searchTerm=tricolour#bak-35-2073 |date=21 August 1951 |volume=35 |house=Commons N.I. |column=2073}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[James McSparran]] (''[[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]]''): The tricolour is admitted by all nations within the comity of nations to be the national flag of Ireland.
*Honorable members: No.
*McSparran: We are having interruptions already. It is the national flag of the Irish Republic.
*[[William May (politician)|William May]] (''[[Ulster Unionist Party]]''): That is better.

The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) flies this flag at matches regardless of whether either or both teams are from Northern Ireland. It is also used for the [[Ireland international rules football team]], selected by the GAA on an all-island basis.
	 
The [[Golfing Union of Ireland]] covers the whole island and competes under the tricolour in international events such as the [[World Cup (men's golf)|World Cup]], [[Alfred Dunhill Cup]] and the [[Eisenhower Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/golf/mcdowell-and-mcginley-fly-the-flag-for-ireland-1520061.html|title=McDowell and McGinley fly the flag for Ireland|last=MacGinty |first=Karl|date=November 4, 2008|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four Provinces flag==
{{multiple image |total_width=330 |image1=Four Provinces Flag.svg |width1=1320 |height1=680 |caption1=The Four Provinces flag is composed of the flags of (clockwise from top left) [[Flag of Munster|Munster]], [[Flag and coat of arms of Connacht|Connacht]], [[Flag and coat of arms of Leinster|Leinster]], and [[Flag of Ulster|Ulster]]. |image2=ShannonErne.svg |width2=900 |height2=600 |caption2=The Erne flag}}
{{main|Four Provinces Flag of Ireland}}
The four provinces flag is a [[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]] of the arms of the four [[provinces of Ireland]]. The order of the provinces varies.

==Erne flag==
This flag was initially used on the [[Shannon–Erne Waterway]], which is bisected by the border. Rather than flying a national flag, boats fly this green, white and blue flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lough Erne Flag &amp; IWAI Pennants|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119141529/http://erne.iwai.ie/flagpennant.html |archivedate=19 November 2007 |url=http://erne.iwai.ie/flagpennant.html|work=Lough Erne Flag|publisher=IWAI|accessdate=12 August 2010}}{{failed verification|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is endorsed by the [[Inland Waterways Association of Ireland]], an all-island organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.iwai.ie/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=23&amp;products_id=101|title=Erne Flag|publisher=Inland Waterways Association of Ireland|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[harp]] (or ''{{lang|ga|[[clàrsach|cláirseach]]}}'') has long been a symbol of Ireland.  It first featured on [[Irish coins]] in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] around 1534.&lt;ref name="morris12"&gt;
{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Ewan |title=Our own devices: National symbols and polititcal conflict in Twentieth-Century Ireland |publisher=Irish Academic Press |year=2005 |pages=12 |isbn=0-7165-2663-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the harp became adorned with progressively more decoration, ultimately becoming a "winged maiden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ie-green.html|title=Ireland: Green Flag |last=Burgers |first=Andries |date=21 May 2006 |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] |accessdate=1 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230034339/http://www.fotw.us/flags/ie-green.html |archivedate=30 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boydell |first=Barra |title=Irish Musical Studies |editor=Patrick F. Devine &amp; Harry White |publisher=Four Courts Press |year=1996 |volume=5 |chapter=The Iconography of the Irish Harp as a National Symbol |isbn=1-85182-261-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the nineteenth century, the ''Maid of Erin'', a [[national personification|personification]] of Ireland, was a woman holding a more realistic harp than the "winged maiden". This style of harp was then also used in Irish flags.  The harp on the modern coat of arms of Ireland is modelled on the "[[Brian Boru]]" harp in the library of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], as it appeared after an 1840s restoration.

===Blue harp flag===
The lower left quadrant of the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]] has featured a harp on a blue field, representing Ireland since 1603.&lt;ref name="morris12"/&gt;  The current version, designed in 1953, uses a winged-maiden harp and consists of a golden ''{{lang|ga|[[clàrsach|cláirseach]]}}'' with silver strings on a blue background. The shade of blue in the field was known as [[Saint Patrick's Blue]] when used in 1783 for the regalia of the [[Order of Saint Patrick]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Green harp flag===
{{multiple image |total_width=330 |image1=Naval_jack_of_Ireland.svg |caption1=Naval Jack of Ireland |image2=Green harp flag of Ireland.svg |caption2=Flag of the United Irishmen }}
The change from blue to green is associated with the [[United Irishmen]], an [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] movement associated with both Catholic and Protestant Irish — its leader [[Wolfe Tone]] was Protestant; green was a colour of [[rebellion]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.ie/naval/uniform/flags/ Naval Service - Flags and Pennants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323015606/http://www.military.ie/naval/uniform/flags/ |date=23 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a common flag used to represent Ireland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It consisted of a gold ''{{lang|ga|cláirseach}}'' on a green background. It was associated with moderate nationalism at a time when the tricolour was confined to more radical movements. It is the same as the modern [[Flag of Leinster]].

==Sporting flags==

Several all-island sporting organisations send representative teams to compete internationally.  In some cases, a flag unique to that organisation is used in lieu of a national flag.  Typically such flags include one of the traditional [[:Category:National symbols of Ireland|symbols of Ireland]].

The [[Ireland cricket team]] uses a blue flag depicting [[shamrock]]s.

The [[Ireland men's national field hockey team|Ireland national field hockey team]] uses a bespoke flag with a shield quartered with the symbols of the four provinces.

[[File:IRFU flag.svg|thumb|left|upright|Ireland rugby team flag]]
The [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland rugby team]]'s flag is a green flag containing the shields of the four provinces and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]]'s logo.  At matches outside Ireland, this is the only flag displayed. At matches in Northern Ireland (typically at [[Ravenhill Stadium|Ravenhill]]) the [[Flag of Ulster]] (yellow background) is also displayed.  This is the flag of the nine-county province (including the three Ulster counties in the Republic of Ireland), similar to but distinct from the [[Ulster Banner]] (white background), the former flag of the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] government.  At matches in the Republic of Ireland (typically at [[Lansdowne Road]]), the Irish tricolour is flown along with the preceding two.

[[Eddie Irvine]], a [[Formula One]] driver from [[Conlig]] in Northern Ireland, asked for a white flag with a shamrock to be used if he secured a [[Podium#Usage in motorsport|podium finish]].&lt;ref name="it-irvine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2009/0623/1224249332136.html  |title=Sporting political gestures |date=23 June 2009|work=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=2009-06-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt; There had been controversy when an Irish tricolour had been used incorrectly for him [[1997 Argentine Grand Prix|in 1997]].&lt;ref name="it-irvine"/&gt; The [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] insisted the Union Flag be used in conformance with its regulations.&lt;ref name="it-irvine"/&gt;

The Show Jumping Association of Ireland (SJAI; subsequently renamed [[Showjumping Ireland]]) used a green flag with its crest based on the four provinces when competing internationally, from its formation after the Second World War. In [[FEI Nations Cup]] events, Ireland was represented by the [[Irish Army Equitation School]] under the tricolour. From the late 1960s,  the SJAI joined forces with the army in  [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] competitions and competed under the tricolour, although it retained its own flag in other competitions until the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Slavin1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slavin|first=Michael|title=Showjumping Legends: Ireland, 1868-1998|year=1998|publisher=Wolfhound Press|isbn=9780863276576|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Forest Reserve Act of 1891''' is a law that allowed the [[President of the United States]] to set aside forest reserves from the land in the [[public domain]].  This act passed by the [[United States Congress]] under [[Benjamin Harrison]]'s administration. Harrison issued proclamations establishing  {{convert|13|e6acre|km2}} of land a Forest Reserves; [[Grover Cleveland]] proclaimed {{convert|25|e6acre|km2}} and [[William McKinley]] proclaimed {{convert|7|e6acre|km2}}.  In 1907 a law was passed limiting the President's authority to proclaim Forest Reserves in certain states and renamed the existing "Forest Reserves" as "[[United States National Forest|National Forests]]."  A further provision to the act was added in 1939, when President Roosevelt added new standards to the preservation of "Forest Reserves" and "National Forests". Senator Andrew Dignum, of Massachusetts, and ambassador Bret Rodrigues of the United Nations, contributed to the act by enforcing regulation requirements for clear cutting.

[[File:Frankfurter Zeitung -1906-08-26.jpg|thumb|Frankfurter Zeitung, 1906]]
The '''''Frankfurter Zeitung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁaŋkfʊɐ̯tɐ ˈt͡saɪtʊŋ|lang}}) was a [[German language]] [[newspaper]] that appeared from 1856 to 1943. It emerged from a market letter that was published in [[Frankfurt]]. In [[Nazi Germany]] it was considered the only mass publication not completely controlled by the [[Propagandaministerium]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]].

==History==
In 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Welch|title=Germany and Propaganda in World War I: Pacifism, Mobilization and Total War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9B7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=9 February 2015|date=30 July 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78076-827-4|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; German writer and politician [[Leopold Sonnemann]] purchased a struggling market publication in Germany; the  ''Frankfurter Geschäftsbericht'' (also known as ''Frankfurter Handelszeitung'').  Sonnemann changed its name to ''Neue Frankfurter Zeitung'' (later simply ''Frankfurter Zeitung'') and assumed the duties of publisher, editor, and contributing writer.&lt;ref name=Tuttle197&gt;{{Cite book |title=German political leaders |last=Tuttle |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Tuttle |year=1876 |publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons |location=New York |oclc=1536166 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrI9AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new title incorporated political news and commentary, and by the time of the foundation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871, the ''Frankfurter Zeitung'' had become an important mouthpiece of the liberal bourgeois extra-parliamentary opposition. It advocated peace in Europe before 1914 and during [[World War I]]. In Constantinople, Paul Weitz, a strong critic of German militarism and secret collaboration with the [[Armenian Genocide|genocidal politics]] of the [[Young Turks]], was the head of the bureau. His close associates included; [[Max Rudolf Kaufmann]], a Swiss born journalist, who was arrested and deported in 1916 for his criticism of German militarism and letters by him to Berlin which reported the deplorable state of the Turkish army in the Caucasus, and Dr. [[Friedrich Schrader]], a journalist with (in 1914) more than two decades of experience in Constantinople who commanded all major languages of Southeastern Europe and the Middle East, and contributed much about modern Turkish culture and literature. 

During the period of the [[Weimar Republic]], the paper was treated with hostility and derision by nationalist circles, due to its pronounced favour of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919. At this time, it no longer stood in opposition to the government, and supported [[Gustav Stresemann]]'s policy of reconciliation.

The ''Frankfurter Zeitung'' was one of the few [[Democracy|democratic]] papers of the time. It was known in particular for its ''[[Feuilleton]]'' section, edited by [[Benno Reifenberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Fothergill [http://versita.metapress.com/content/cr432338478g1494/fulltext.pdf Reading Conrad: Melancholy in the shadow of the swastika]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Yearbook of Conrad Studies (Poland)'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in which works of most of the great minds of the Weimar Republic were published.

===Nazi era===
After the 1933 [[Machtergreifung|assumption of power]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], several [[Jew]]ish contributors had to leave the ''Frankfurter Zeitung'', including [[Siegfried Kracauer]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]. The paper was finally sold in June 1934 to the chemical corporation [[IG Farben]]. The company's directors, particularly [[Carl Bosch]],  were well-disposed toward the paper because of its place in traditional German life, and believed it could be useful in promoting favourable publicity for the company.&lt;ref name=Evans142&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Third Reich in Power|author=Richard Evans|year=2006|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781440649301 |page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3j-Aq1hAgJEC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Leopold%20Sonnemann&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nazi's early time in power, the paper was initially protected by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] primarily for its convenient public relations appeal abroad, and retained more editorial independence than the rest of the press in the Third Reich.&lt;ref name=Evans142/&gt; However, within a few years IG Farben gave up on the newspaper; inexorably, it had become compromised by the increasing oversight of the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Nazi Ministry of Propaganda]] and was quickly losing its journalistic reputation abroad. The company's directors realised it no longer needed to influence domestic public opinion, "since there was effectively no public opinion left in Germany".&lt;ref name=Evans143&gt;Evans, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was quietly sold and subsumed by a subsidiary of the Nazi publishing organ, [[Eher Verlag]], in 1938.&lt;ref name=Evans143&gt;Evans, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modernizing Tradition: Gender and Consumerism in Interwar France and Germany|author=Adam C. Stanley|year=2008|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=0807133620|page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEzoY_yv2OEC&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with declining readership throughout the Second World War, it was closed down entirely in August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=E. Noelle|title=Die letzte Kerze. Das Verbot der Frankfurter Zeitung im August 1943|newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=27 June 2002|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' does not consider itself a successor organisation to the original ''Zeitung'', even though many former journalists of the earlier paper helped launch it in 1949.

On January 9, 1854 (a day after the anniversary of the [[Battle of New Orleans]]), a group of over 1,500 War of 1812 veterans from across the United States met in convention at the [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], having responded to a call issued by [[Joel Barlow Sutherland|Joel B. Sutherland]] (1792-1861), a War of 1812 veteran and former Congressman from Philadelphia. Ostensibly called to draft resolutions pertaining to bounty land benefit legislation, the veterans assembled in Philadelphia acknowledged the need for an organization for mutual support and to perpetuate the history of the War of 1812. From this convention, the Society of the War of 1812 was founded and Sutherland was elected its first President. The Society met again in convention a year later in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they were received by President [[Franklin Pierce]] at the [[White House]] and lobbied members of [[34th United States Congress|Congress]] to secure the [[Land grant|bounty land]] legislation, which was passed later in 1855. Sutherland’s goal was to form a division of the Society of the War of 1812 in each state in the [[United States|union]]. His vision for the organization was not completed at the time of his death in 1861. Shortly thereafter, the General Society of the War of 1812 began accepting sons and grandsons of Veteran members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gswar1812.org/our-history/ |title=Our History |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=General Society of the War of 1812 |access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject Matter==

Parliamentary and Political Law means the field of law, legal scholarship and legal practice relating to the functions and operations of parliamentary, governmental and judicial institutions and their respective officials.

Parliamentary Law means the body of law dealing with the establishment and functioning of parliamentary institutions, and includes the law of parliamentary privilege.

Political Law means the body of law dealing with the structure of the State and the processes of governing, with the application of legal, public policy and political instruments of governing, and with the impact of law on democratic governing.

Within the overall domain of public law, Parliamentary and Political Law is complementary to constitutional law and administrative law.  As an interdisciplinary study, it is distinct from, yet linked to, political science, and public policy and administration.

The Institute (and through its Journal) specializes in the interdisciplinary, comprehensive and comparative analysis of these topics.

==Publications and Programs==

The Institute publishes [http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/journal.aspx?section=36 The Journal of Parliamentary and Political Law] three times a year, which is available through [[Carswell (publishers)|Carswell Thomson]].

It also hosts a bi-annual conference, and The Third ''Law and Parliament'' Conference was held
November 2009 at the [[University of Toronto]].

The '''International Children’s Peace Prize''' is awarded annually to a child who has made a significant contribution to advocating children's rights and improving the situation of vulnerable children such as orphans, child labourers and children with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].

The prize is an initiative of the [[KidsRights Foundation]], an international children's aid and advocacy organisation based in [[Amsterdam]], [[the Netherlands]]. KidsRights should not be confused with the group which grants the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

The first Children's Peace Prize was launched in November 2005 during the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in [[Rome]], an annual meeting of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winners and international organisations such as [[UNICEF]] and [[Amnesty International]]. "We welcome the launch of Children’s Peace Prize during our summit," the summit's closing statement said.

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] presented the 2005 prize, which was posthumously awarded to [[Nkosi Johnson]], a [[South Africa]]n boy who brought international attention to children with HIV/AIDS and founded the [[Nkosi's Haven]] home for HIV-positive mothers and children. The winner receives a 100,000 euro donation to benefit a charitable project for children, as well as a [[statuette]] which has been named the Nkosi in Nkosi Johnson's honour.

The 2006 award was handed out by Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] in a ceremony at the [[Binnenhof]], the seat of the Dutch parliament in [[The Hague]]. The 2007 was presented at the Binnenhof by [[Bob Geldof]] and Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]]. The 2008 prize was presented by [[Desmond Tutu]].

[[Image:Al Khiam.jpg|thumb|Al Khiam detention camp. Southern Lebanon, 2004.]]
[[Image:Khiam UN.jpg|thumb|Remains of the detention center after the 2006 war, behind UN tents]]

The '''Khiam Detention Center''', located near [[Khiam]], [[Lebanon]], was a [[French army]] [[barracks]] complex originally built in the 1930s. It became a base for the [[Lebanese army]] before falling under control of the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA), an Israeli-backed breakaway group of soldiers formed during the [[Lebanese civil war]].  In 1985 the base was converted into a [[prisoner-of-war camp|prison camp]] that was used for torture and remained in use until Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000, and the subsequent collapse of the SLA. After the withdrawal, the prison camp was preserved in the condition it was abandoned and converted into a museum by the Lebanese government.

[[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/.../mde020052000en.pdf  Letter from an Amnesty International delegation visiting the prison]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/1999/10/28/israb12795.htm Human Rights Watch article on Khiam]&lt;/ref&gt; reported the use of [[torture]] and other serious [[human rights]] abuses in the facility.

[[Robert Fisk]], the British journalist who has spent 25 years reporting from Lebanon,  said about this prison:&lt;blockquote&gt;“The sadists of Khiam used to electrocute the penises of their prisoners and throw water over their bodies before plunging electrodes into their chests and kept them in pitch-black, solitary confinement for months. For many years, the Israelis even banned the [[Red Cross]] from visiting their foul prison. All the torturers fled across the border into Israel when the Israeli army retreated under fire from Lebanon almost seven years ago.”&lt;ref name="fisk"&gt;[http://www.robert-fisk.com/articles2.htm Inside a torturers' den, manacles lie abandoned]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“There was the whipping pole and the window grilles where prisoners were tied naked for days, freezing water thrown over them at night.  Then there were the electric leads for the little dynamo — the machine mercifully taken off to Israel by the interrogators — which had the inmates shrieking with pain when the electrodes touched their fingers or penises.  And there were the handcuffs which an ex-prisoner handed to me yesterday afternoon. They were used over years to bind the arms of prisoners before interrogation.  And they wore them, day and night, as they were kicked — kicked so badly in Sulieman Ramadan's case that they later had to amputate his arm. Another prisoner was so badly beaten, he lost the use of a leg. I found his crutch in Khiam prison yesterday, along with piles of [[Red Cross]] letters from prisoners — letters which the guards from Israel's now-defunct "[[South Lebanon Army]]" militia never bothered to forward”. [http://www.robert-fisk.com/articles2.htm]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://willzuzak.ca/lp/fisk02.html|title=Robert Fisk: Inside a torturers' den|website=willzuzak.ca|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In some prison cells, there were small metal cages, torturers used to make the prisoners sit inside of them and then start hitting the cage from the outside, sometimes for hours, as a form of mental torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/234072|title=معتقل الخيام: ذاكرة فوق     الأنقاض|website=الأخبار|language=Arabic|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has denied any involvement in Khiam, allegedly claiming to have delegated operation of the detention camp to the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA) as early as 1988. The Israeli Defense Ministry acknowledged that personnel from [[Shin Bet|Israel's General Security service]] "hold meetings several times annually with SLA interrogators" and cooperate with members of the SLA, and even assist them by means of professional guidance and training." It also admitted that Israel and the SLA "consult each other regarding the arrest and release of people in the Khiam facility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/1999/10/27/israel-responsible-abuses-khiam-prison|title=Israel Responsible for Abuses in Khiam Prison|date=1999-10-28|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a court case brought by Israeli human rights lawyers, the Israeli Defense Ministry admitted paying staff at Khiam, training the interrogators and guards, and providing assistance with lie detector tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/correspondent/1002463.stm|title=Israel accused|date=2000-11-03|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], the [[Israeli Air Force]] bombed and destroyed the museum.  According to locals, it was to hide the evidence of torture and mistreatment used there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/08/legacy-torture-lebanon-khiam-jail-170813125414823.html A legacy of torture: Inside Lebanon's Khiam jail.

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' persons in  '''Brunei''' face legal challenges not experienced by non-[[LGBT]] residents. [[Homosexuality]] is illegal in [[Brunei]] and can be punished with up to death.

[[OutRight Action International]] has described Brunei as "the country that has the most worrisome state of rights for LGBT people in Southeast Asia." LGBT Bruneians feel the need to remain very discreet about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="huffington"/&gt;

[https://www.thebruneiproject.com/about.html The Brunei Project], established in 2015, seeks to promote human rights, including religious freedom, free speech and LGBT rights, in Brunei through social media. The group organised a private community event in 2016, celebrating Brunei's first International Day Against Homophobia event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dayagainsthomophobia.org/welcome-to-idahot-newbies/ Welcome to IDAHOT Newbies !]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
Prior to 2014, homosexuality was illegal and punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment, regardless of whether the act was done in private and consensual. In 2014, Brunei announced it will begin imposing [[Sharia]] law. Homosexuality is punishable with death by stoning under Sharia law.&lt;ref name="huffington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailybeast"/&gt;

The United Nations has urged Brunei to review its law, which has been described by many media outlets as "medieval", "uncivilized" and "a return to the Stone Age".&lt;ref name="huffington"&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-brunei_us_561501f9e4b0fad1591a1167 Brunei’s LGBT Community Faces Terrifying Future], ''The Huffington Post'', 15 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailybeast"&gt;[https://www.thedailybeast.com/brunei-returns-to-the-stoning-age Brunei Returns to the Stoning Age], ''Daily Beast'', 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBT people, as well as the Christian and Buddhist minorities, have been advised by international human rights activists to remain discreet in the country. Anyone caught "tarnishing the image of Islam" is heavily punished.&lt;ref name="dailybeast"/&gt;

On 11 March 2015, a civil servant was fined $1000 [[Brunei dollar]]s under the Syariah Penal Code Order for cross-dressing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humandignitytrust.org/uploaded/Map/Country_Reports/Brunei.pdf Criminalisation of Homosexuality: Brunei]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living conditions==
The LGBT community in Brunei is very hidden and secret. Bruneian society tends to associate homosexuality with "effeminate men".&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

In 2011, academics at the University of Brunei made a formal study of gay people in Brunei. The study illustrated how gay people in Brunei chose to remain silent and discreet about their sexual orientation. The researchers were only able to find 29 LGBT respondents, some of whom were foreigners.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[https://www.globalgayz.com/gay-life-in-brunei/ Gay Life in Brunei]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, American reporter Patrick Brzeski reported on the "underground gay scene" in Brunei, with one gay Bruneian man telling him:
{{quote|Mostly we are discreet and we need to hide our gay identity. We use Grindr, it's very popular. Inside Grindr, Bruneians are careful and choosy. Sometimes people make private parties, mostly gay artists and celebrities in Brunei do that… We just have to follow one rule: Don't put it out there."}}

== Human rights reports ==
===2017 United States Department of State report===
In 2017, the United States Department of State reported the following, concerning the status of LGBT rights in Brunei:
*Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity&lt;br /&gt;"Secular law criminalizes “carnal intercourse against the order of nature.” In July Chapter 22 of the Penal Code Order was amended to increase the minimum sentence for such carnal intercourse to between 20 and 50 years’ incarceration. The amendment was primarily applied in cases of rape or child abuse wherein both attacker and victim are male, because existing law covers only assault of a woman by a man. The SPC bans “liwat” (anal intercourse) between men or between a man and a woman who is not his wife. If implemented, this law would impose death by stoning. The SPC also prohibits men from dressing as women or women dressing as men “without reasonable excuse” or “for immoral purposes.” There were no known convictions during the year.&lt;br/&gt; Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) community reported unofficial and societal discrimination in public and private employment, housing, recreation, and in obtaining services including education from state entities. LGBTI individuals reported intimidation by police, including threats to make public their sexuality, to hamper their ability to obtain a government job, or to bar graduation from government academic institutions. Members of the LGBTI community reported the government monitored their activities and communications. Events on LGBTI topics were subject to restrictions on assembly and expression. The LGBTI community reported that the government would not issue permits for such events."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277311.pdf BRUNEI 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ]{{PD-notice}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28119">The '''manosphere''' is an informal network of [[blog]]s, forums&lt;ref name="Dewey 2014"/&gt; and [[website]]s where commentators focus on issues relating to [[men]] and [[masculinity]], as a male counterpart to [[feminism]] or in opposition to it. Many of these are [[men's spaces]].

==Lexicology==
The term is a [[neologism]], a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[man]]'' and ''[[sphere]]''. Another term that has the same meaning is '''androsphere'''&lt;ref name="androsphere"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Jason|title=The 'man-o-sphere' is outraged about Mad Max? Hand me my popcorn!|work=The Guardian| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/the-man-o-sphere-is-outraged-about-mad-max-hand-me-my-popcorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from {{lang-grc|ἀνήρ}}, ''an&amp;#x1E17;r'', [[genitive]] {{lang|grc|ἀνδρός}}, ''andros'', "man"). A person who frequents online communities associated with the manosphere is sometimes called a ''manospherian''.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Matthew N. "Ctrl-Alt-Delete: The Origins and Ideology of the Alternative Right." Somerville, MA: Political Research Associates, January 20 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a red piller (or redpiller) is someone who has shifted from previously held mainstream or feminist persuasions, towards those that are widely held within the manosphere. They sometimes pejoratively refer to their detractors as ''blue pillers''.&lt;ref&gt;Sculos, Bryant W. "Who’s Afraid of ‘Toxic Masculinity’?." Class, Race and Corporate Power 5.3 (2017): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Caitlin Dewey of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has described the manosphere as "a vast, diverse network of blogs and forums".&lt;ref name="Dewey 2014"/&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' columnist Eva Wiseman, the manosphere is "a mix of men – pick-up artists, male victims of abuse, father's rights proponents – who come together online".&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; Notable examples of manosphere sites include the Red Pill Room, [[A Voice for Men]] and [[Roosh V]]'s website Return Of Kings, as well as his personal blog and forum.&lt;ref name="Dewey 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/01/mens-rights-internet-forums-distance-from-misogynist-mass-murder |title=The everyday fear of violence every woman has to cope with |last=Wiseman |first=Eva |work=The Guardian |date=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Arin|date=12 March 2012|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/10/roosh-v-splc-misogyny-report_n_1335174.html|title=Southern Poverty Law Center Lists 'Roosh V' On Misogyny Report|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharlet|first1=Jeff|authorlink1=Jeff Sharlet (writer)|title=Are You Man Enough for the Men's Rights Movement?|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=GQ|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manosphere has its own distinct jargon. Manosphere websites commonly use [[red pill and blue pill]] imagery as an analogy; accepting the manosphere's ideology is equated with "taking the red pill", and those who disagree with their philosophy are seen as "blue pilled" or as having "taken the blue pill". The terms "[[alpha male]]" and "[[beta male]]" are also commonly used.&lt;ref name="Dewey 2014"/&gt; Due to what some manospherians view as an apathy within society towards issues faced by men and boys, some prefer to use the term [[reverse sexism]] over the term [[misandry]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lucy, and Christine Agius.

Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, 2018. 61–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the manosphere attempt to highlight health issues that are emblematic to contemporary men, such as a successively decreasing sperm count.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/style/sperm-count.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reddit]] is a popular gathering place for manosphere supporters. Several forums on the site are geared toward its ideas. One of these, the Red Pill [[subreddit]], has more than 200,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Love|first1=Dylan|title=Inside Red Pill, The Cult For Men Who Don't Understand Women|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-red-pill-reddit-2013-8|accessdate=18 August 2015|work=Business Insider Australia|date=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Controversial Reddit communities#Incels |incel]] community also frequent the manosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n06/amia-srinivasan/does-anyone-have-the-right-to-sex&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have described the manosphere as an [[online]] version of the [[man cave]].&lt;ref&gt;DeKeseredy, Walter S., Alexis Fabricius, and Amanda Hall-Sanchez.

==Ideology==
[[File:Grafico attività sessuale.png|thumb|A common perception of the shift in heterosexual relationships after the sexual revolution in the manosphere]]
According to Caitlin Dewey of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the manosphere's "core philosophy basically boils down to this: (1) feminism has overrun/corrupted modern culture, in violation of nature/biology/inherent gender differences, and (2) men can best seduce women (slash, save society in general) by embracing a super-dominant, uber-masculine gender role, forcing ladies to fall into step behind them."&lt;ref name="Dewey 2014"/&gt; Eva Wiseman of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that "Advocates of the men's rights movement are united by their belief that feminism is the enemy."&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; They are strongly opposed to [[circumcision]] and believe that a double standard exists in society in how circumcision is viewed relative to [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref name="splitsburgh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Geddes|first=Adam|date=27 March 2012|url=http://splitsburgh.com/circumcised-or-intact-screw-her-preference/|title="Circumcised or Intact?!"

"Real Victims, Real Men, Real Feminists, Real Sluts. The Persistent Masculinist Collapse of Gender-based Violence Discourses". ''The Persistence of Global Masculinism''. Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, 2018. 61–87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Zuckerberg]] points out that "Red Pill represents a new phase in online misogyny. Its members not only mock and belittle women; they also believe that in our society, men are oppressed by women." She adds that as of 2016, the growth of the movement and the more political tone adopted by some of its leaders is leading to an adversarial relationship between some of the components (notably between pick-up artists and Men's Human Rights Advocates).&lt;ref name=NADWM&gt;{{Cite book|title=Not all Dead White Men: Classics and Misogyny in the Digital Age|last=Zuckerberg|first=Donna|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780674975552|location=Cambridge|pages=15-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites==
===''Return of Kings''===
''Return of Kings'' (RoK) is a white supremacist, alt-right blog written by self-described [[pick-up artist]] Daryush Valizadeh, known online as [[Roosh V]].&lt;ref name="Dewey 2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/02/04/how-roosh-won/ |title=How a radical misogynist fooled millions of people and hundreds of journalists |date=4 February 2016 |author=Dewey, Caitlin |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has hosted articles critical of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalresearch.org/2017/01/20/ctrl-alt-delete-report-on-the-alternative-right/|author=Lyons, Matthew N.|date=20 January 2017|title=Ctrl-Alt-Delete: The origins and ideology of the Alternative Right|publisher=Political Research Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2017}} The actual size of the site's following is difficult to measure, but has been estimated to comprise a scattered readership throughout North America and Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Dewey 2016"/&gt;

RoK is distinct from men's rights forums such as PUAHate in that it promotes seduction techniques, known as "game", that those sites criticize. RoK writers also criticize the profeminism men's movement and [[The Good Men Project]], arguing that they lead to feminized, passive, weak men who are content to remain on the lowest rungs of the social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Social Sciences |date=12 May 2016 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=18–... |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/5/2/18/pdf |title=Masculinities in Cyberspace: An Analysis of Portrayals of Manhood in Men's Rights Activist Websites |author=Rachel M. Schmitz 1 and Emily Kazyak |doi=10.3390/socsci5020018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as a male supremacy hate group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2018/02/21/year-hate-trump-buoyed-white-supremacists-2017-sparking-backlash-among-black-nationalist|title=The Year in Hate: Trump buoyed white supremacists in 2017, sparking backlash among black nationalist groups|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chateau Heartiste===
''Chateau Heartiste'', a blog written by James C. Weidmann, known as "Roissy in DC",&lt;ref name="Nagle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt; was an early manosphere/pickup artist website.&lt;ref name="Dewey 2014"/&gt; The blog advises readers to replicate the traits of [[narcissist]]s and [[sociopath]]s in order to attract women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfishness of Others: An Essay on the Fear of Narcissism |author=Dombek, Kristin |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |date=2016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LX1zCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22chateau+heartiste%22 |isbn=978-0-86-547823-7 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weidmann argues that women's economic freedom, combined with racial [[miscegenation]], immigration, and declining [[birth rate]]s among white women threatens [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name="Nagle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nagle |first1=Angela |title=Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars From 4Chan And Tumblr To Trump And The Alt-Right |date=2017 |publisher=Zero Books |location=Alresford, UK |isbn=978-1-78535-543-1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-MlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87 |language=en |chapter=Entering the manosphere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weidmann has written a popular online list of rules, "The 16 Commandments of Poon", described by pornographic film director [[Anna Arrowsmith]] as reading "like an adolescent list of desires and fears, as though representing two sides of the same coin, spoken by somebody with little or no dating experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rethinking Misogyny: Men's Perceptions of Female Power in Dating Relationships |author=Arrowsmith, Anna |publisher=Routledge |date=2016 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RU-rCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22chateau+heartiste%22 |isbn=978-1-47-246351-7 |pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme in ''Chateau Heartiste'' is that "chicks dig jerks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tyrants of Matriarchy: Debunking Feminism and the Myth of Patriarchal Oppression |author=Jarosek, Stephen |publisher=Lulu Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-30-442913-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PUAHate===
PUAHate was a website for men who felt they had been tricked by members of the [[pick-up artist]] or [[seduction community]] who had promised to teach them for money how to get attractive women to have sex with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/manosphere-mens-rights-movement-terms|title=Welcome to the manosphere: A brief guide to the controversial men's rights movement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PUAHate criticized "the scams, deception, and misleading marketing techniques used by dating gurus and the seduction community to deceive men and profit from them". The site complained that the seduction gurus' techniques did not work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/05/24/elliot_rodger_the_pick_up_artist_community_s_predictable_horrible_response.html|title=The Pick-Up Artist Community’s Predictable, Horrible Response to a Mass Murder|first=Amanda|last=Hess|date=24 May 2014|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PUAHate user Tom remarked, "The moderation policy was very laissez-faire. There was racism; definitely a lot of [[misogyny]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/30/elliot-rodger-puahate-forever-alone-reddit-forums|title='PUAhate' and 'ForeverAlone': inside Elliot Rodger's online life|first=Nicky|last=Woolf|date=30 May 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Patrick Kearns noted that the site had threads such as "Are ugly women completely useless to society?"&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Users would also ask each questions such as "what's your rape count"?&lt;ref name=newrepublic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118036/sexist-pseudoscience-alpha-male-pick-artists|title=The Sexist Pseudoscience of Pick-Up Artists: The Dangers of "Alpha Male" Thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elliot Rodger]], perpetrator of the [[2014 Isla Vista killings|23 May 2014 Isla Vista killings]], was active on PUAHate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministcurrent.com/2014/05/30/podcast-soraya-chemaly-on-elliot-rodger-puahate-and-yesallwomen/|title=PODCAST: Soraya Chemaly on Elliot Rodger, PUAHate, and #YesAllWomen|date=30 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he expressed confusion about how women could resist him.&lt;ref&gt;http://genderstudies.nd.edu/assets/162635/website_construction_and_destruction_masculinity_and_violence_in_america.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "One day incels will realize their true strength and numbers, and will overthrow this oppressive feminist system.

Some of PUAHate's users argued that the shootings were the fault of the women who declined to have sex with Rodger.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-27640474|title=The extreme misogyny of 'pick-up artist' hate|date=31 May 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newrepublic/&gt;

==Media analysis==
[[Rod Dreher]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' has said that the manosphere "dehumanizes both men and women".&lt;ref name="dreher"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dreher|first=Rod|authorlink=Rod Dreher|date=29 May 2014|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/women-who-love-men-who-hate-women/|title=Women Who Love Men Who Hate Women|work=[[The American Conservative]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caitlin Dewey accuses it of excluding gay, lesbian, and transgender people.&lt;ref name="Dewey 2014"/&gt;

Mark Potok, a spokesman of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), said that the forums are filled with "pure unvarnished women hatred" and compares the manosphere to [[white supremacist]] websites.&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paulson|first=Amanda|date=28 May 2014|url=https://news.yahoo.com/santa-barbara-killings-did-misogynist-hate-groups-play-233026107.html|title=Santa Barbara killings: Did misogynist hate groups play a role?|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]/[[Yahoo! News]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SPLC later added a caveat, saying, "It should be mentioned that the SPLC did not label [[Men's rights activist|MRA]]s as members of a hate movement; nor did our article claim that the grievances they air on their websites – false rape accusations, ruinous divorce settlements and the like – are all without merit. But we ''did'' call out specific examples of misogyny and the threat, overt or implicit, of violence."&lt;ref name="SPLC2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldwag|first=Arthur|date=15 May 2012|url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2012/05/15/intelligence-report-article-provokes-outrage-among-mens-rights-activists/|title=Intelligence Report Article Provokes Fury Among Men’s Rights Activists|work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Brendan Dougherty of ''[[Business Insider]]'' criticized the SPLC for including manosphere sites on its list of "hate-groups" and for providing pejorative personal details on the sites' authors.&lt;ref name="Dougherty"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dougherty|first=Michael Brendan|date=9 March 2012|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/civil-rights-group-is-now-criticizing-random-jerks-for-not-calling-women-back-after-sex-2012-3|title=A civil rights group is now criticizing random jerks for not calling women back after sex|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate= 3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mike Riggs of [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' also criticized the SPLC for defining manosphere sites as "hate-groups".  Said Riggs, "Take note, America: Having consensual sex with someone you don't actually like and then never calling her/him again will land you in a reputation-ruining SPLC report."&lt;ref name="Riggs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Riggs|first=Mike|date=9 March 2012|url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/03/09/the-southern-poverty-law-center-is-now-w|title=The Southern Poverty Law Center Is Now Writing About Pickup Artists as Hate Groups|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eva Wiseman has written that commenters on manosphere blogs often make statements to the effect that "women are designed solely for sex and sandwich-making".&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; She has suggested that the tone of these websites creates a culture that contributes to violence against women.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt;

Following the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]] in California, many mainstream news sources reported links between the killer [[Elliot Rodger]] and posts to a manosphere forum about the [[Seduction community|pick-up artist community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{

Because it's somewhere he could come to vent, and be angry, and not have his pain be dismissed, ridiculed or ignored." &lt;ref name="Wiseman"/&gt; Professor [[Michael Kimmel]] similarly opined "it would be facile to argue the manosphere ... urged [Rodger] to do this. I think those places are kind of a solace ... They provide a kind of locker room, a place where guys can gripe about all the bad things that are being done to them by women".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Nelson, Libby|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/29/5754786/the-santa-barbara-shootings-and-angry-white-men|title='It's a way to retrieve your manhood': a cultural explanation of the Santa Barbara shooting|date=2014-05-29|publisher=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days immediately following the shooting, other manosphere sites, such as A Voice For Men, saw a huge increase in traffic.&lt;ref name="gq"/&gt;

Nicholas James Pell of [[paleoconservative]] site ''[[Taki's Magazine]]'' said that the manosphere "asks difficult questions and poses uncomfortable truths".  Pell criticized a report by ''[[ABC News]]'' on the manosphere for not giving the topic "a fair shake" and concluded that "the men's-rights wing of the manosphere is distinguished by a class and refinement totally missing from the shrieking hysteria of modern feminist blogging".&lt;ref name="Pell"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pell|first=Nicholas James|date=26 October 2013|url=http://takimag.com/article/we_have_nothing_to_fear_but_the_manosphere_itself_nicholas_james_pell/print#axzz33DEV4pjM|title=We Have Nothing to Fear but the Manosphere Itself|work=[[Taki's Magazine]]|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mayflower Compact}}
The [[Mayflower Compact]] was the iconic document in the earliest history of [[Americans|America]]. It was ratified by forty-one men on board the [[Pilgrim]] ship ''[[Mayflower]]'' on November 11, 1620 while anchored at [[Cape Cod]], now [[Provincetown Harbor]] in [[Massachusetts]].  The Compact was originally drafted as an instrument to maintain unity and discipline in this new land called [[Plymouth Colony]] but, over time, it has become one of the most historic documents in American History.

It was later published in [[London]] in ''[[Mourt's Relation]]'' in 1622, and the authors had added a [[preamble]] to clarify its meaning: "it was thought good there should be an association and agreement, that we should combine together in one body, and to submit to such government and governors as we should by common consent agree to make and choose."

On November 11, it was the intention of the Pilgrim leadership that each man must sign the Compact before anyone set foot on land—or mark with an X if he could not write.

The passengers probably assembled in the ship’s great cabin, about thirteen by seventeen feet, with two windows on the stern and one window on either side.  Forty-one men signed the Compact, beginning with Governor [[John Carver (Plymouth Colony governor)|John Carver]] and ending with Edward Lester. Nine adult males on board did not sign the document; some had been hired as seamen only for one year and others were probably too ill to write. No women signed it, in accordance with cultural and legal custom of the times.&lt;ref name="Philbrick p. 43"&gt;Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War'' (New York:Viking, 2006), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunker p. 281"&gt;Nick Bunker, ''Making Haste from Babylon: The ''Mayflower'' Pilgrims and their New World a History'' (New York: Knopf 2010), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

What is known today of the wording of the Mayflower Compact comes from [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]]’s [[manuscript]], apparently copied from the original document. The original of the Mayflower Compact has long been lost, possibly stolen during [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775-1783) looting. The text was first published in 1622 and then in Bradford’s journal from about 1630. But Bradford did not have a list or even gave a suggestion of the names of the signers. [[Plymouth Colony]] secretary [[Nathaniel Morton]] provides both the Compact and a list of signers in his 1669 ''New Englands Memoriall'', and many persons have thought that this list was an actual transcript of the names of all the signers and in the sequence of their signing.

The list of signers was published at least twice in the 18th century, but each time based apparently on Morton’s 1669 list and not the original. Consequently, there has been confusion for many years about the actual list of signers, with some suggesting that there would be names besides those Morton had provided if all adult male passengers had signed the compact=. Morton apparently copied from Bradford, and not from the original written and signed compact.

The Morton signer list from 1669 is what most ''Mayflower'' scholars have used when compiling a list of those who signed the Mayflower Compact. That list, basically, is used in the Stratton book on page 413 and is what is used here. There are variations in the spelling of some names between Stratton’s list and Morton’s 1669 list, and those 13 instances are also noted here.&lt;ref name="Stratton pp. 411-413"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) pp. 411-413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayflower Compact"&gt;[http://mayflowerhistory.com/mayflower-compact/ Caleb Johnson, ''Mayflower Compact'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signatories ==
[[John Carver (Plymouth Colony governor)|John Carver]] - An early associate of Bradford and Brewster who became a prominent member of the English Separatist church in [[Leiden]], [[Holland]] where he was a [[deacon]] in the church. With Robert Cushman, he was an agent for the Leideners in 1620, organizing for the ''Mayflower'' voyage. He was a prosperous man who invested a large portion of his personal wealth in the voyage. He came on the ''Mayflower'' with his wife and five servants, one of whom was Roger Wilder who died early, along with a 7-year boy in his care named [[Richard More (Mayflower passenger)|Jasper More]]. (Jasper was one of the four More children on board and one of the earliest to die.) Carver was the first governor of Plymouth Colony and died suddenly at age 56, in April or May 1621, with his wife dying shortly thereafter. His legacy was overshadowed by his failure to provide a return to ''Mayflower''’s London investors, much to their vexation against him. The Fortune in November 1621 carried angry Merchant Adventurer letters addressed to him but by then he was already long deceased.&lt;ref name="Banks p. 44"&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratton p. 259"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=107-114}}

[[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]] - An early convert to the [[Separatism|Separatist]] Church in [[Nottinghamshire]] England who came to Leiden, Holland about 1608 and became prominent in the church there. He came on the ''Mayflower'' with his wife Dorothy, leaving a young son in Leiden; Dorothy drowned while the ship was at anchor in [[Cape Cod]] Harbor. He became colony [[Governor]] after the death of John Carver, and was prominent in the Plymouth Church. His writings of early Plymouth Colony are important historic documents.&lt;ref name="Stratton p. 249"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=79–100}}

[[Edward Winslow]] - A gentleman from a well-off family who was prominent in the Separatist church in Leiden and involved with Brewster in printing anti-Anglican church religious tracts.  He boarded the ''Mayflower'' with his wife and two servants, one of whom was Elias Story, who died early along with 8-year-old [[Katherine More|Ellen More]], who was in his care. His wife died in March 1621. In May 1621, he married the widow of William White as the first wedding in Plymouth Colony. He was quite prominent in colony governmental, religious, and Indian affairs. In 1646, he returned to [[England]] to join the anti-royalist Commonwealth government of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and died of fever in 1654 while on a military expedition in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref name="Banks pp. 98-99"&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks p. 373"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=251–260}}

[[William Brewster (Mayflower passenger)|William Brewster]] - In the 1580s, he was an assistant to William Davison, secretary to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]; Davison was a party to the 1587 execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Queen of Scots]]. About twenty years later, Brewster was among those prominent in the early English Separatist church, emigrating to [[Holland]] in 1608 where he became Ruling Elder of the Leiden church. While in Leiden, he was hunted by English authorities in England and Holland for printing [[sedition|seditious]] tracts against the [[Anglican]] church ([[Church of England]]), forcing him to go into hiding until the ''Mayflower'' departure. He boarded the ''Mayflower'' with his wife, two sons, and two of the four More children who were on the ship: Mary, age 4, who died early, and Richard, age 6, who survived. In [[Plymouth Colony]], Brewster was Ruling Elder of the Plymouth Church until his death in 1644 at age 80.&lt;ref name="Banks pp. 35-39"&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the 'Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James' in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratton pp. 251-252"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) pp. 251-252&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=91–100}}

[[Isaac Allerton]] - A Leiden Separatist and Merchant Adventurer originally from London who boarded the ''Mayflower'' with his wife and three children. During his life, he was a ship owner involved in [[New England]] and trans-Atlantic trading. In Plymouth Colony, he was second in authority to Governor Bradford in the colony’s early years. Later, Bradford felt that Allerton had abused the colonists' trust over many years, and he was forced to leave the colony in the 1630s.&lt;ref name="Banks pp. 28-30"&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stratton p. 234"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|59–70}}

[[Myles Standish]] - (Name per Morton, 1669: Miles Standish) - Standish had been a soldier of fortune, possibly from [[London, England|London]] but serving in the [[Low Countries]] in [[Europe]] prior to joining the Leiden contingent. There is evidence that he was not a member of the Leiden church but was associated with it. He came on the ''Mayflower'' with his wife Rose, who died early. He was the colony’s chief military officer and served well in that capacity until his death in 1656.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=210–231}}

He died in the first winter, sometime before the ''Mayflower'' departed on its return to England in April 1621.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune' in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eugene Aubrey Stratton 1986 p. 289"&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=132–137}}

[[Edward Doty (Mayflower passenger)|Edward Doty]] - (Name per Morton, 1669: Edward Doten) He was from London and came as a servant of Stephen Hopkins, also from London. Per author Caleb Johnson, his quick temper was the primary cause of numerous civil disturbances recorded against him in the more-than 30 years he lived in the colony. One of the first recorded was in June 1621 when he was in a sword and dagger fight with fellow Hopkins servant Edward Leister, where both were lightly wounded and sentenced to public punishment.&lt;ref name="Eugene Aubrey Stratton 1986 p. 289"/&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=132–137}}&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Lester - (Name per Morton, 1669: Edward Liester) Banks credited him with various names such as Lester, Litster, Lister, and Lyster.  Bradford gave his name as "Leister" ("Liester" in the 1669 version), which seems more correct per authors Caleb Johnson and Eugene Stratton. He came from London as a servant of Stephen Hopkins, completed his apprenticeship, and then moved to Virginia Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edward Banks, ''The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623'' (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691'' (Salt Lake City:Ancestry Publishing 1986) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=180–181}}

Japanese '''military operations other than war''' (MOOTW) focus on deterring war, resolving conflict, promoting peace, and supporting civil authorities in response to domestic crises.

The military in Japan is affected by Japan's pacifist post-war constitution.  The initial decision to participate in UN peacekeeping missions was not uncontroversial, and its continuing role in international affairs continues to be qualified.&lt;ref&gt;UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs: [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2004/02/mil-040225-irin01.htm  "Japan looks towards peacekeeping role,"] February 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3814">The '''NHS Low Income Scheme''' is intended to reduce the cost of NHS [[Prescription charges]], [[NHS dentistry]], [[Eye care in the United Kingdom|Sight tests]], Glasses and contact lenses, [[Hospital Travel Costs|necessary costs of travel to receive NHS treatment]], NHS [[Hair prosthesis|wigs]] and [[Truss (medicine)|fabric supports]], i.e. spinal or abdominal supports or surgical brassieres supplied through a hospital.  It is administered by the [[NHS Business Services Authority]]. It is not necessary to be in receipt of any benefits in order to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Low Income Scheme|url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/livinghere/benefitsgrantsandallowances/nhs-low-income-scheme.htm|publisher=Highland Council|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax Credits==

People entitled to most [[Means-tested benefit]]s do not need to use the scheme as they are exempt from these charges.  People who get [[Working Tax Credit]] or [[Child Tax Credit]] are automatically assessed and, if entitled, issued with an NHS Tax Credit Exemption Certificate. Tax credit beneficiaries with an income less than £15,276 (2013 figure), people who get [[Working Tax Credit]] and [[Child Tax Credit]] and those who get Working Tax Credit with a disability element are entitled to a certificate.

==Universal Credit==
The introduction of [[Universal Credit]] has led to complications.  People entitled to Universal Credit who had net earning of less than £435 in a month should get free prescriptions on the same basis as other people in receipt of other means tested benefits.  However, as of December 2017, at which point the introduction of Universal Credit (which started in April 2013) was well under way, the prescription form did not mention it.  Claimants were officially advised by NHS England to tick the box for income-based Jobseeker's Allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS in England: help with health costs|url=https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/universal-credit.aspx#criteria|accessdate=20 December 2017|publisher=NHS England|date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside England==

Charges are not made for prescriptions, wigs, or fabric supports in Scotland, or Wales.

==Financial assessment==

The assessment of means uses similar principles to those of [[Income Support]].  Weekly income is compared to assessed requirements but includes housing costs and [[Council Tax]] which Income Support does not. There is a capital limit of £23,250 for those permanently in a care home and £16,000 for everyone else.

==Certificates==

The HC2 certificate for full help (which includes free NHS prescriptions), is issued if weekly income is less than or equal to  requirements, or  income is greater than requirements by no more than half the current English prescription charge. The  HC3 certificate for partial help is issued if  income is greater than requirements by more than half the current English prescription charge. This shows the payment liability for health costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help with health costs|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/healthcare_e/healthcare_help_with_health_costs_e/help_with_health_costs.htm|work=Adviceguide|publisher=Citizens Advice|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible to apply for a refund of charges already paid when an application for a certificate is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Low Income Scheme under 60s|url=http://www.entitledto.co.uk/help/nhslowincomeschemeunder60s.aspx|publisher=Entitled to|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nawaphon was set up by [[Wattana Kiewvimol]] in 1974. Wattana had been the head of the ''Thai Students Association in the United States'', when he studied at [[Seton Hall University]].&lt;ref name="Leifer"/&gt; Nawaphon was supported by the [[Internal Security Operations Command]] of the Thai military&lt;ref name="Puey11"&gt;{{Citation |author=Puey Ungphakorn |title=Violence and the Military Coup in Thailand |journal=Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars |volume=9 |number=3 |year=1977 |page=11 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/35147971/Bulletin-of-Concerned-Asians-Scholars |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The group was said to have links to wealthy businessmen, politicians, the National Security Council, and Thai military intelligence.&lt;ref name="Terrorism"/&gt; Nawaphon rallied merchants, businessmen, and monks who were opposed to social change and democracy, fearing for their wealth.&lt;ref name="Puey11"/&gt; A notable supporter of the organization was the popular monk [[Kittiwuttho Bhikkhu]], who infamously said that killing communists was not a sin.&lt;ref name="Puey11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |agency=Reuters |title=Politics and Religion Mix for Asia's Activist Monks |publisher=USC Annenberg School for Communications |date=11 September 2007 |url=http://uscmediareligion.org/theGet/115/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The movement was opposed to [[parliamentary democracy]] and campaigned for the three principles of nation, religion, monarchy.&lt;ref name="Leifer"/&gt; Nawaphon attracted considerable support due to the common feeling that these national principles were threatened by left-wing forces.&lt;ref name="Leifer"/&gt; In the mid-1970s the movement was reported to have 500,000 followers. Nawaphon played a key role in the anti-leftist agitation that led to the [[Thammasat University massacre]] on 6 October 1976,&lt;ref name="Leifer"/&gt; in which members of the organization were involved.&lt;ref name="Terrorism"/&gt; 

After the coup re-establishing the military rule following the massacre, Nawaphon's popularity diminished.&lt;ref name="Leifer"/&gt;

On 17 October 2016, NPF announced their intentions to participate in the planned offensive in the [[Nineveh Plain]] alongside the [[Iraqi Army]], [[Peshmerga]] and [[Iraqi Federal Police]]. The NPF plans to liberate all Chaldean-Syriac-Assyrian villages in the [[Nineveh Plain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriacsnews.com/npf-declaring-participation-mosul-offensive/|title=NPF declaring their participation to Mosul offensive - Syriac International News Agency|date=18 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chaldean Syriac Assyrian political organizations held a meeting on 29 October 2016 to continue discussions from their previous meeting that was held on 21 October 2016. The meeting was hosted by Bishop Mar Yokhana Putrus Moshe with the presence of representative of His Holiness Patriarch Mar Georgis Third Saliwa at the headquarters of the [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] Diocese.

In 1949, shortly before he died, the English author [[George Orwell]] prepared a list of notable writers and other persons he considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the [[anti-communist]] counter-propaganda activities of the United Kingdom's [[Information Research Department]]. A copy of the list was published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2002, and the original document was released by the [[Foreign Office]] soon after.&lt;ref name= "The New York Review of Books"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garton Ash |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Garton Ash |title=Orwell's List |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=25 September 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305071504/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/09/25/orwells-list/|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2003/09/25/orwells-list/ |archivedate=5 March 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2016 |volume=50 |issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Information Research Department]] (IRD) was a propaganda unit set up by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in 1948 at the [[Foreign Office]], after the start of the [[Cold War]].

[[Celia Kirwan]], a close friend of Orwell who had just started working as [[Robert Conquest]]'s assistant at the IRD, visited Orwell at a sanatorium where he was being treated for [[tuberculosis]] in March 1949.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/06/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries |title=Obituary: Celia Goodman |first=D. J. |last=Taylor |date=6 November 2002 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell wrote a list of names of persons he considered sympathetic to Stalinism and therefore unsuitable as writers for the Department, and enclosed it in a letter to Kirwan.&lt;ref name="The New York Review of Books"/&gt; The list became public in 2003.&lt;ref name="Ezard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities |first=John |last=Ezard |title=Blair's Babe – Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge? |date=21 June 2003 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having worked for [[Cyril Connolly]]'s ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' magazine, and briefly as an editorial assistant for [[Humphrey Slater]]'s ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]'', Kirwan was [[Arthur Koestler]]'s sister-in-law and one of the four women to whom Orwell proposed after the death of his wife [[Eileen O'Shaughnessy]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="In Front of Your Nose"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Orwell |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Angus |editor2-first=Ian |title=The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 4: In Front of Your Nose (1945–1950) |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-14003-154-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Koestler had supported such a match, Kirwan turned him down.&lt;ref&gt;Celia [Goodman] in {{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Wadhams |title=Remembering Orwell ||publisher=Penguin Books |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-14007-458-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notebook==
Orwell based his list on a strictly private notebook he had maintained since the mid-1940s of possible "cryptos", "F.T." (his abbreviation for [[Fellow traveler|fellow travellers]]), outright members of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], agents and sentimental sympathisers. The notebook, now at the [[Orwell Archive]] at [[University College London]], contains 135 names in all, including US writers and politicians.&lt;ref name="naftali"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/ctc/docs/list.htm |title=George Orwell's List |first=Timothy |last=Naftali |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 July 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017231726/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/ctc/docs/list.htm |archivedate=17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten names had been crossed out, either because the person had died or because Orwell had decided that they were neither [[Crypto-communism|crypto-communists]] nor fellow travellers.&lt;ref name="The New York Review of Books"/&gt; The people named were a mélange: "some famous, some obscure, some he knew personally and others he did not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Shelden |title=Orwell: The Authorised Biography |publisher=William Heinemann |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-43469-517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell commented in ''[[New Leader]]'' in 1947:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The important thing to do with these people – and it is extremely difficult, since one has only inferential evidence – is to sort them out and determine which of them is honest and which is not. There is, for instance, a whole group of M.P.s in the British Parliament ([[Denis Nowell Pritt|[Denis Nowell] Pritt]], [[Konni Zilliacus|[Konni] Zilliacus]], etc.) who are commonly nicknamed "the cryptos". They have undoubtedly done a great deal of mischief, especially in confusing public opinion about the nature of the puppet regimes in Eastern Europe; but one ought not hurriedly to assume that they all hold the same opinions. Probably some of them are [[wikt:actuate|actuated]] by nothing worse than stupidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Orwell |chapter=Burnham's View of the Contemporary World Struggle |title=Collected Essays |volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The notebook contained columns with names, comments and various markings. Typical comments were: [[Stephen Spender]] – "Sentimental sympathiser... Tendency towards homosexuality"; [[Richard Crossman]] – "Too dishonest to be outright F. T."; [[Kingsley Martin]] –"Decayed liberal. Very dishonest";&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George, ''Unpublished Notebook'', 1948&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Robeson]] – "very anti-white. [[Henry A. Wallace|[Henry] Wallace]] supporter".&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;{{cite journal |title=St. George's List |first=Alexander |last=Cockburn |authorlink=Alexander Cockburn |journal=[[The Nation]] |date=7 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]] considered Orwell's remarks "perceptive and sometimes even generous", going on to say that "DN Pritt is described as an 'almost certainly underground' Communist but also a "Good MP (i.e. locally). Very able and courageous'".&lt;ref name="Wheatcroft"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/big-brother-with-a-high-moral-sense-1168073.html |title=Big Brother with a High Moral Sense |first=Geoffrey |last=Wheatcroft |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=28 June 1998 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the names, Orwell selected 38 which he forwarded to Kirwan.&lt;ref name="The New York Review of Books"/&gt;

[[Richard Rees]] discussed the names with Orwell, later commenting that it was "a sort of game we played – discussing who was a paid agent of what and estimating to what lengths of treachery our favourite bêtes noires would be prepared to go."&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Richard, ''Letter to Ian Angus'', 10 June 1967&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} Orwell asked Rees to fetch the notebook from Orwell's former residence on the Scottish island of [[Jura, Scotland]] in early 1949, thanking him in a letter of 17 April.&lt;ref name= "The New York Review of Books"/&gt;

One of Orwell's biographers, [[Bernard Crick]], thought there were 86 names in the list and that some of the names were written in the hand of Koestler, who also co-operated with the IRD in producing anti-Communist propaganda.&lt;ref name="utley"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Orwell is revealed in role of state informer |first=Tom |last=Utley |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 July 1996  |url=http://www.arlindo-correia.org/101103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orwell was an ex-colonial policeman in Burma and according to [[Timothy Garton Ash]], he liked making lists: 'In a "[[London Letters|London Letter]]" to ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1942 he wrote, "I think I could make out at least a preliminary list of the people who would go over to the Nazi side if the Germans occupied England."'&lt;ref name= "The New York Review of Books"/&gt;

==Reactions to the list==
The British press had known about the list for some years before it was officially made public in 2003. In 1996 ''[[The Independent]]'' discussed the list and who was named on it in an article headlined, "Orwell's little list leaves the left gasping for more".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/orwells-little-list-leaves-the-left-gasping-for-more-1328633.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' "broke" the story with the headline "Socialist Icon Who Became an Informer".&lt;ref name="hoover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3475771.html |title=Why Orwell Matters |first=Timothy |last=Garton Ash |website=The Hoover Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706011317/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3475771.html |archivedate=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Foot]], the former leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and a friend of Orwell in the 1930s and 1940s, was "amazed" by the revelation. [[Richard Gott]], who in 1994 had resigned as literary editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'' after admitting that he had accepted travel expenses from the [[KGB]] in an unrelated case, referred to Orwell's list as only a "small surprise".&lt;ref name="utley"/&gt;

The journalist and activist [[Norman Ian MacKenzie]], who was on the list, noted "Tubercular people often could get very strange towards the end. I'm an Orwell man, I agreed with him on the Soviet Union, but he went partly ga-ga I think. He let his dislike of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' crowd, of what he saw as leftish, dilettante, sentimental socialists who covered up for the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] in Spain [after it became communist-controlled] get the better of him."&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;

Bernard Crick justified Orwell wanting to help the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]]. "He did it because he thought the Communist Party was a totalitarian menace," he said. "He wasn't denouncing these people as subversives. He was denouncing them as unsuitable for a counter-intelligence operation."&lt;ref name="utley"/&gt;

Professor [[Peter Davison (professor)|Peter Davison]], editor of Orwell's ''Complete Works'', said the really disappointed people will be those who claimed to have been on the list but were not.&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/24/highereducation.books |title=Blacklisted writer says illness clouded Orwell's judgement |first=Fiachra |last=Gibbons |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[John Newsinger]] considered it "a terrible mistake on his part, deriving in equal measure from his hostility to Stalinism and his illusions in the Labour government. What it certainly does not amount to, however, is an abandonment of the socialist cause or transformation into a footsoldier in the Cold War. Indeed, Orwell made clear on a number of occasions his opposition to any British [[McCarthyism]], to any bans and proscriptions on Communist Party members (they certainly did not reciprocate this) and any notion of a preventive war. If he had lived long enough to realise what the IRD was actually about there can be no doubt that he would have broken with it".&lt;ref name="newsinger"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr276/newsinger.htm |title=Biographies |first=John |last=Newsinger |authorlink=John Newsinger |journal=[[Socialist Review]] |number=276 |edition=July/August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Neal Ascherson]] was critical of Orwell's decision to give the information to the IRD, claiming "there is a difference between being determined to expose the stupidity of Stalinism and the scale of the purges and throwing yourself into the business of denouncing people you know."&lt;ref name="rwj"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/orwells-little-list-leaves-the-left-gasping-for-more-1328633.html |title=Orwell's little list leaves the left gasping for more |first=Ros |last=Wynne-Jones |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 July 1996 |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist and activist [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]] said the revelations would not detract from Orwell's reputation as a great writer, noting "I am a great admirer of Orwell, but we have to accept that he did take a McCarthyite position towards the end of his life."&lt;ref name="rwj" /&gt;

The journalist and writer [[Alexander Cockburn]] was strongly critical of Orwell's actions, referring to the notebook as "a snitch list". Cockburn attacked Orwell's description of Paul Robeson as "anti-white", pointing out Robeson had campaigned to help Welsh coal miners. Cockburn also said the list revealed Orwell as a bigot: "There seems to be general agreement by Orwell's fans, left and right, to skate gently over Orwell's suspicions of Jews, homosexuals and blacks".&lt;ref name="ac" /&gt;

Celia Kirwan said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I think George was quite right to do it. ... And, of course, everybody thinks that these people were going to be shot at dawn. The only thing that was going to happen to them was that they wouldn't be asked to write for the Information Research Department.&lt;ref name="The New York Review of Books"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">The '''Peasant Party of Russia''' (Russian: Крестьянская партия России) was a minor pro-reform party active in Russia during the 1990s. It was led by Yuri Chernichenko. It eventually merged with like-minded groups to form the [[Republican Party of Russia – People's Freedom Party]]

The party was founded in 1990, with the aim of resurrecting peasants-proprietors. From 1992 to 93, two Peasant Party members (Anatoliy Mostovoy and Viktor Shinkaretsky) were people's deputies of the Russian Federation. The party participated in the [[Democratic Russia]] coalition and took part in the 1993 election within the list [[Choice of Russia (electoral bloc)|Choice of Russia]]. In 1995, it participated in the parliamentary election within the Democratic Russia-United Democrats list, which failed to cross the 5 per cent barrier. It supported Boris Yeltsin's candidature for presidency in 1996. In 1998, the Peasant Party of Russia participated of the [[Right Cause (political party)|Right Cause]] coalition; thereafter on informal basis in the Union of Right Forces.

'''People's Party–Reformists''' ({{lang-hr|Narodna stranka–Reformisti}}) is a [[liberalism in Croatia|liberal]] [[list of political parties in Croatia|political party in Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt;

==History==
The civil initiative for the establishment of the party was launched by former [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats]] (HNS) chief [[Radimir Čačić]] and his associates Natalija Martinčević and Petar Baranović. More than two-thirds of the party members are former members of the [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats|HNS]] which left the party because of disagreements with its leadership over the exclusion of [[Radimir Čačić]] from the party while he was serving a prison sentence for unintentionally causing a traffic accident with two fatalities. 

According to the parties former acting president Natalija Martinčević, about 200 members from [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats|HNS]] [[Zagreb]] and [[Varaždin]] branches each have left the party in order to join the People's party - Reformists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformisti.hr/dokumenti/statut |title=Narodna stranka - REFORMISTI - Statut |website=Reformisti.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's founding congress was held on September 28, 2014 in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vijesti.hrt.hr/narodna-stranka-reformisti-osniva-se-28-rujna |title=HRT: Narodna stranka reformisti osniva se 28. rujna |language=hr |website=Vijesti.hrt.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radimir Čačić]] was unanimously elected for the first party president.&lt;ref name="index1"/&gt;

==Election history==
Ahead of the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 parliamentary election]] the party formed a coalition, "Successful Croatia", with the centre-left [[Forward Croatia-Progressive Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/cacic-i-josipovic-potpisali-sporazum-nazvali-se-uspjesna-hrvatska-1019906 |title=Čačić i Josipović potpisali sporazum, nazvali se Uspješna Hrvatska - Večernji.hr |website=Vecernji.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 election, the party won one seat in the [[Croatian Parliament]] in the III [[Croatian Parliament electoral districts|electoral district]], held by Radimir Čačić. Čačić voted in favor of approving [[Cabinet of Tihomir Orešković]]. Party participated at the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 extraordinary parliamentary election]] as part of the ''For Prime Minister Coalition'' led by Mayor of Zagreb [[Milan Bandić]], and eventually won 1 seat. NS-R voted in favor of approving [[Cabinet of Andrej Plenković]]. At the [[Croatian local elections, 2017|2017 local elections]], Radimir Čačić was elected prefect of the [[Varaždin County]] and Darinko Dumbović mayor of [[Petrinja]]. NS-R also entered many county, city and municipal councils, mostly in [[Northern Croatia]].

'''Polarized pluralism''' is a [[two-party system|two-party]] or [[multi-party]] political system which is seen as overly polarized and therefore as dysfunctional. It was originally described by political philosopher [[Giovanni Sartori]] to define a system where moderate views are replaced by polarized views. The phrase was used by analyst Roger Cohen writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' to describe American politics about energy,&lt;ref name=twsNovHaa&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Roger Cohen
 |title= Energy lessons
 |publisher= ''The New York Times''
 |quote= Perhaps there's something to treadmill wisdom. We're all so narrow-band these days, using the vast resources of broadband to direct ourselves into a chosen ideological and news tunnel. Polarized pluralism defines us.
 |date= 2010-11-08
 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/opinion/04iht-edcohen.1.13460814.html
 |accessdate= 2010-11-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the phrase is not widely used in mainstream newspapers.

In a typical [[two-party system|two-party]] or [[multi-party system|multi-party]] system, the distribution of party power looks like a [[normal curve]] with a slight skew. In such a condition, most of the country is moderate or moderate-leaning left-wing or right-wing. If the country becomes polarized, then the curve becomes one with two main humps and looks like a [[bimodal distribution]], with the power at the far [[political left]] and [[political right|right]] ends, and a severe dip in the middle; one side will have more influence than the other, creating a strong trend to follow them. There is speculation that a nation with such a distribution, effectively having two highly separate approaches with no compromise positions in the middle, becomes difficult to govern.

An example of polarized pluralism was politics in [[Germany]] before the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era in 1933. The nation had two power centers, highly split apart: [[communism|communists]] and [[Nazism|national socialists or Nazis]]. The Nazis were the stronger of the two parties and won total control of the government, and led to a condition of [[fascism]].

The '''Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000''' (c. 41) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that sets out how [[political parties]], [[elections]] and [[referendum]]s are to be regulated in the United Kingdom. It formed an important part of the constitutional reform programme implemented by the 1997 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government, building on the [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] (c. 48) which was passed two years earlier.

==Background==

The Act was introduced after consultation with major political parties, and largely followed the recommendations of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] (known at the time as the "Neill Committee" after its chairman), an independent body set-up by former Prime Minister [[John Major]] to consider ways of making politics more transparent. The committee set out its proposals in its report, ''The Funding of Political Parties in the United Kingdom''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4057/volume-1/volume-1.pdf Fifth Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628070451/http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4057/volume-1/volume-1.pdf |date=2004-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act created an independent [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] to regulate political parties and their funding arrangements. It also required parties to submit statements of their accounts on a regular basis, and prohibited the receipt of funds from foreign or anonymous donors. Restrictions on campaign expenditure were also put in place, dictating the maximum amount that parties were able to spend.

==Details==

===Registration of parties===

The law gave the newly formed Electoral Commission a role in controlling the registration of political parties.

The requirement for parties to register with an official body, if they wished to be named on ballot papers, was the result of a fairly wide acceptance that the finances of political groups should be regulated to reduce the perception of underhand dealings.

In addition, political groups or individuals failing to register with the Commission would only be able to describe themselves as "Independent" on ballot papers, or else have a blank space instead of a description after their names—with the single exception of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (UK)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] who is entitled to be described as: "The Speaker seeking re-election".

This built on the provisions of the [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]], passed amid concern about voters being fooled by misleading ballot descriptions.

There is an annual fee for the registration of a political party.

===Donations===

Under the terms of the law, registered political parties are only allowed to accept donations in excess of £500 from "permissible donors", defined as either individuals on an electoral register in the United Kingdom, or political parties, companies, trade unions, or similar organisations that are registered in the country.

The provision of non-financial support to a registered party – such as subsidies or free materials – is counted as a donation. Each party is required to submit details of all donations received, whether by party headquarters or their subsidiary parts. Each report must provide sufficient information to show that a donor counts as a "permissible source".

Political parties on the separate register for [[Northern Ireland]] are exempt from the controls on accepting and reporting donations.

===Expenditure===

The Act places strict limits on the amount each party may spend in the run-up to the election (how that time period is defined depends on the type of election). The current{{When|date = September 2015}} limit for elections to the UK Parliament in Westminster stands at £30,000 per constituency contested within 365 days of a General Election, up to a maximum of £18.84 million.

===Referendums===
{{seealso|Referendums in the United Kingdom}}

The Act provides a basic framework to the running of all future referendums that are to be held under the jurisdiction of the Electoral Commission in pursuance of any provision made by a subsequent [[Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] in the following areas:

*[[United Kingdom]] 
**[[England]]
**[[Northern Ireland]]
**[[Scotland]]
**[[Wales]]

The Act also makes the provision that in any future UK-wide referendum the chairperson of the Electroal Commission is appointed “Chief Counting Officer” for the United Kingdom or gives the power for the chairperson to appoint a Chief Counting Officer.

==Controversy==

In December 2006 [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and politicians of other parties were questioned by police as part of their investigation into the [[Cash for Honours]] affair. Part of their time was said to be spent looking at whether the Act had been breached by parties taking loans from supporters in return for nominations to the [[House of Lords]]. Unlike donations, loans did not have to be made public as long as they were made on "commercial terms".

The Government later changed the law to require the declaration of all forms of loan, and asked a  former [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery]], Sir [[Hayden Phillips]], to undertake a fundamental review of party funding arrangements. He reported in 2008&lt;ref name="whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Party Finance and Expenditure in the United Kingdom Report  | publisher = [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]  | date = 16 June 2008 | url = http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm73/7329/7329.pdf | accessdate = 1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In November 2007 the provisions of the Act were again the subject of scrutiny in the cases of Labour party donor [[David Abrahams (Labour party donor)|David Abrahams]] and Scottish Labour leader [[Wendy Alexander]].

In 2016, several UK police forces started investigations into alligations of election fraud, in the 2015 general election, specifically on the Conservatives breaching the spend limits permitted. The majority of alligations focus on the mis-representation of the "battle-bus" finances.

The '''presidency of Andrés Manuel López Obrador''' began on 1 December 2018, when he became the 65th [[President of Mexico]]. [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] overcame [[Ricardo Anaya]], [[José Antonio Meade]], and [[Jaime Rodriguez Calderon]] in a landslide [[Mexican general election, 2018|election]] on 1 July 2018. His election was the first since 1988 that a president-elect's political party has also won the outright majority in both the [[Senate of the Republic (Mexico)|Senate]] and [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conteo rápido del INE da victoria a Andrés Manuel López Obrador |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/conteo-rapido-del-ine-da-victoria-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador |accessdate=1 July 2018 |publisher=''[[El Universal (Mexico City)]]'' |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the oldest man to become President of Mexico at inauguration at age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Por su edad o militancia, gane quien gane la Presidencia hará historia|url=http://www.nacion321.com/elecciones/por-su-edad-genero-o-militancia-gane-quien-gane-la-presidencia-hara-historia1|first=Ángel|last=Nakamura|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events prior to presidency==
López Obrador participated in the [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006]] and [[Mexican general election, 2012|2012]] elections, losing to [[Felipe Calderon]] (by a 1% margin) and [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], respectively. After the loss in 2012, he left the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] to found the [[National Regeneration Movement]] (MORENA) which would later become into a political party in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/09/20129102361062341.html |title=Ex-candidate quits Mexico leftist party |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2016-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220093257/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/09/20129102361062341.html |archivedate=December 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
López Obrador's political party MORENA would form the coalition ''[[Juntos Haremos Historia]]'' with left-wing [[Labor Party (Mexico)|Labor Party]] and [[socially conservative]] [[right-wing]] [[Social Encounter Party]] – attracting controversy with the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animalpolitico.com/2017/12/morena-encuentro-social-alianza-congreso/|title=Morena y Encuentro Social, aliados en 2018 pero adversarios en el Congreso - Animal Político|website=www.animalpolitico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to face [[Ricardo Anaya]], [[José Antonio Meade]], and [[Jaime Rodriguez Calderon]]. On 1 July 2018, López Obrador won in a landslide defeat against all other candidates, managing to secure 53% of the popular vote against Anaya's 22%, Meade's 16%, and Rodriguez Calderon's 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://computos2018.ine.mx/#/presidencia/nacional/1/1/1/1|title=Cómputos 2018|website=computos2018.ine.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Congressional elections, the coalition managed to win the majority of seats in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. The coalition also managed to win 5 governorships, among them [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|Mexico City's]].

Following López Obrador's victory, he would go on to meet current President Enrique Peña Nieto at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]]. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics-security/mexicos-president-elect-shuns-guards-asks-people-for-protection-idUSKBN1JU04E|title=Mexico's president-elect shuns guards, asks 'people' for protection|first=Daina Beth|last=Solomon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting he said that he would not travel with armed people in a break with what the Mexican presidency usually does.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==International reaction==
López Obrador's victory was met by various reactions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International reactions following Andrés Manuel López Obrador's overwhelming victory|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/international-reactions-following-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-overwhelming-victory|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
===Campaign team===
At the helm of López Obrador's campaign team was [[Tatiana Clouthier]], [[Alfonso Romo]], and [[Yeidckol Polevnsky Gurwitz]]. The regional coordinators throughout the nation were [[Marcelo Ebrard]], [[Bertha Luján]] ([[:es:Bertha Luján Uranga|es]]), [[Ricardo Monreal]], [[Julio Scherer Ibarra]], and [[Rabindranath Salazar Solorio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Tatiana Clouthier a Marcelo Ebrard: este es el organigrama del equipo de campaña de AMLO|url=https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/04/amlo-organigrama-elecciones-2018/|work=Animal Politico|first=Manu|last=Ureste|first2= Agustín|last2=Salgado|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition team===
Most of the people in López Obrador's campaign team joined his transition team in order to prepare for the inauguration and the subsequent [[sexenio (Mexico)|6-year presidential term]] that will last from 1 December 2018 to 30 September 2024.&lt;ref&gt;

===Proposed cabinet===

In December 2017, López Obrador released his cabinet listing, composed of 8 men and 8 women. He proposed dispersing the [[cabinet of Mexico|cabinet]] throughout the [[List of states of Mexico|country's states]], with the objective of “promoting development throughout the national territory,” while the Presidency, the [[Secretariat of National Defense]], [[Secretariat of the Navy]], the [[Secretariat of the Interior]], [[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs]], and the [[Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit]] remain in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://panampost.com/elena-toledo/2017/12/13/leftist-lopez-obrador-mexico-presidency/?cn-reloaded=1|title=López Obrador Officially Launches Third Bid for Mexico's Presidency|date=December 13, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/ten-proposals-amlos-pre-campaign|title=The ten proposals of AMLO's pre-campaign|date=December 14, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Replacements'''

Héctor Vasconcelos was replaced by [[Marcelo Ebrard]] on 5 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico's president-elect Lopez Obrador picks Marcelo Ebrard as foreign minister|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-politics/mexicos-president-elect-lopez-obrador-picks-marcelo-ebrard-as-foreign-minister-idUSKBN1JV2TO|work=Reuters|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency==
===Before inaguration===

He declared that he will take a 60% salary pay cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico's president-elect Amlo to take 60% pay cut in austerity push|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/16/mexicos-president-elect-to-take-60-per-centpay-cut|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 22 October to 25 October, he held a nationwide referendum on whether or not the [[New International Airport for Mexico City]] was to be scrapped, citing that the project was rife with graft and a waste of taxpayer money. About 70% of the results voted against the continuation of the project. López Obrador insists on expanding the [[Santa Lucía Air Force Base Num 1|Santa Lucía Air Force Base]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico's AMLO Scraps $13 Billion Airport Project; Peso Plunges|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/mexico-votes-to-scrap-13-billion-airport-in-amlo-s-first-test|work=Bloomberg|first=Andrea|last=Navarro|first2=Eric|last2=Martin|first3=Justin|last3=Villamil|date=28 October 2018|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25003">'''Projekt-26''', best known as '''P-26''', was a [[stay-behind]] [[army]] in [[Switzerland]] charged with countering a possible invasion of the country. The existence of P-26 (along with [[Projekt-27|P-27]]) as secret intelligence agencies dissimulated in the [[military intelligence]] agency ([[Untertruppe Nachrichtensdienst und Abwehr|UNA]]) was revealed in November 1990 by the PUK EMD Parliamentary Commission headed by senator [[Carlo Schmid (Swiss politician)|Carlo Schmid]]. The commission, whose initial aim was to investigate the alleged presence of secret files on citizens constituted in the [[Swiss Ministry of Defence]], was created in March 1990 in the wake of the ''[[Fichenaffäre]]'' or Secret Files Scandal, during which it had been discovered that the federal police, BUPO, had maintained files on 900,000 persons (out of a population of 7 million).&lt;ref name=Ganser&gt;[http://www.danieleganser.ch/e/fachzeitschriften/british/index.htm The British Secret Service in neutral Switzerland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430120549/http://www.danieleganser.ch/e/fachzeitschriften/british/index.htm |date=2007-04-30 }}, Daniele Ganser, in ''[[Intelligence and National Security]]'', Vol.20, n°4, December 2005, pp.553-580&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the existence of P-26 was revealed a month after similar revelations made in [[History of the Italian Republic|Italy]] by the premier [[Giulio Andreotti]], who disclosed to the Italian Parliament the existence, throughout the [[Cold War]], of a [[Gladio]] [[stay-behind]] [[anti-communist]] [[paramilitary]] network headed by [[NATO]] and present in most European countries, Switzerland formed a parliamentary commission charged of investigating alleged links between P-26 and similar stay-behind organizations. It was one of the three countries, along with [[Stay-behind network in Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Gladio in Italy|Italy]], to create a parliamentary commission on these stay-behind armies.

On November 21, 1990 Swiss authorities declared the dissolving of P-26, since the clandestine organization operated outside of parliamentary and even governmental control, being an autonomous structure hidden inside the [[Swiss intelligence agencies|secret military services]].&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;Daniel Ganser: [http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2005/Ganser.pdf  The Secret Side of International Relations: An approach to NATO’s stay-behind armies in Western Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228004051/http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2005/Ganser.pdf |date=2008-02-28 }}, Published in the ''Steton Hall Journal of Diplomacy'', pages 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stay-behind plans during World War II ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
As the United Kingdom, which had [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|prepared itself for a Nazi invasion]] during [[World War II]], which led to the creation of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] and of stay-behind [[Auxiliary Units]], Switzerland also prepared for such an eventuality, as its [[Neutral country|neutrality]] by itself did not constitute a sufficient guarantee against a military offensive of [[Nazi Germany]] or [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] (see 1940 [[Battle of Belgium]]). Thus, General [[Henri Guisan]] put in place the "[[Reduit]] Concept," according to which the best strategy for the [[Military of Switzerland|military]] was to retreat in the highest parts of the [[Alps]] and abandon the plains to the enemy. From there, a guerrilla warfare would be launched against the invader.

== Stay-behind in the Territorial Service ==

With the end of World War II and the official beginning of the [[Cold War]], plans were made to prepare for an invasion by the [[Soviet Union]]. The PUK EMD Commission headed by [[Carlo Schmid (Swiss politician)|Carlo Schmid]] discovered that a first stay-behind branch was created within the Swiss army in the ''[[Territorialdienst]]'' (Territorial Service). This military branch was considered best suited for this mission, as it was not trained to fight in the front but to carry out domestic [[police]] operations among the civilian population. However, the PUK EMD Commission was confronted by the destruction of many documents pertaining to these early stay-behind organisations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The historical record is fragmentary, because almost all documents of the resistance organization of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were destroyed around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.560&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first commander of this secret unit was Divisionär [[Franz Wey]] (1896–1963), who was succeeded by Burger, Amstutz and de Pury. The latter was promoted to Brigadier-General and Chief of the Territorial Service.

In December 1956, following the [[Suez Crisis]] and the crushing of the [[Budapest insurrection]], [[Erwin Jaeckle]] asked in Parliament what "preparations can be taken in the fields of organisation and training in order to take up and secure total popular resistance, if necessary also outside the framework of the army."&lt;ref name="Ganser p.560"&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.560&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in September 1957, Defence Minister [[Paul Chaudet]], successor to [[Karl Kobelt]] (both members of the liberal [[Free-thinking Democratic Party of Switzerland|FDP]]), replied that "The events in Hungary &amp;mdash; seen from a military perspective only &amp;mdash; have shown that the battle of a resistance movement alone can not be successful." He added that "This battle poses problems of a political and military nature, as well as juridical concerns in the context of [[international law]] and the conventions that we have signed." Finally, Claudet declared that "Although certain measures have been envisaged by the Territorial Service in this area, the possibilities in this field are limited."&lt;ref name="Ganser p.560"/&gt;

Swiss Major [[Hans von Dach]] published in 1958 ''Der totale Widerstand, Kleinkriegsanleitung für jedermann'' ("Total Resistance," Bienne, 1958) concerning guerrilla warfare, a book of 180 pages about passive and active resistance to a foreign invasion, including detailed instructions on sabotage, clandestinity, methods to dissimulate weapons, struggle against police moles, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Major [[Hans von Dach]], 1958. ''Der totale Widerstand...''; ''Total Resistance'' reed. [[Paladin Press]], 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-87364-021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former, unnamed, Chief of Staff, declared in 1990 to the Swiss deputies that senior officers of the Swiss military, then led by Chief of Staff [[Louis de Montmollion]], had taken Jaeckle's declined request as the legal basis for the organization of the stay-behind&lt;ref name="Ganser p.561"&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.561&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stay-behind in the UNA ==

The stay-behind army was moved in 1967 from the Territorial Service to the [[Untertruppe Nachrichtensdienst und Abwehr|UNA]], the military intelligence agency, directed by Divisionär [[Richard Ochsner]].&lt;br&gt;
It changed its codename to "Special Service," which was made up of three hierarchical levels:
# The top level consisted of members of the regular military. 
# The second level was made up of "trusted persons" who recruited activists. 
# These activists formed the third level.
According to the PUK EMD Commission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The persons recruited by the trusted men could themselves recruit a number of new members to join the resistance organisation; therefore, the exact number of members of the organisation is not known&amp;nbsp;... They are said to have been 1.000 at maximum, divided among 30 to 50 centres.&lt;ref name="Ganser p.561"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, the [[Swiss Federal Council]] formulated the [[national security]] strategy of the country, which included the need for resistance in occupied territory. It reported that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The occupation of the country must not mean that all resistance has ended. Even in this case, an enemy shall meet not only with aversion, but also active resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also highlighted that:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;Guerrilla war and non-violent resistance in occupied areas are being prepared within the limits of international law, and will, if necessary, be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a similar manner, the introduction of ''Der Totale Widerstand'' (Total Resistance) by [[Hans von Dach]] (1958) stated that "of course," the guerrilla methods (which involved various [[Covert operation|covert actions]]) were to respect the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions on Laws and Customs of War on Land]] (1899) as well as the four [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949.

At the time, Colonel Heinrich Amstutz commanded the stay-behind. He was replaced in 1976 by Colonel [[Albert Bachmann]]. The next year, [[Hans Senn]] became Chief of Staff of the Swiss armed forces, and reported on 5 September 1979 to the united seven Swiss Federal councilors on the activities of UNA and of the stay-behind units. He informed them that the stay-behind cost one million [[Swiss Francs]] a year, which were secretly invested. The councilors listened in silence, and their absence of objection was interpreted by Hans Senn as an implicit approval of the operation, in which they conserved the possibility of [[plausible denial]].&lt;ref name="Ganser p.562"&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.562&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNA was discovered in the midst of the Bachmann-Schilling affair in November 1979, when Special Service commander Albert Bachmann sent UNA agent Kurt Schilling to [[Austria]] to observe military manoeuvres. There, he was arrested and sentenced for espionage by Austrian authorities,&lt;ref name="telebach"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colonel Albert Bachmann|work=The Telegraph|date=4 May 2011|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8493181/Colonel-Albert-Bachmann.html|accessdate=16 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sent back to Switzerland, and sentenced again for having revealed classified information. A parliamentary commission was formed to investigate UNA, and reported in 1981:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the security policy of the federation, the Special Service has the task of creating favourable conditions for active resistance in Switzerland against an occupying force.&lt;ref name="Ganser p.563"&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report concluded that the task was legitimate, although "''the internal control of these two services was insufficient.''"&lt;ref name="Ganser p.563"/&gt;

== Stay-behind as P-26 ==
[[File:Efrem Cattelan.jpg|thumb|Efrem Cattelan (1990)]]
Following this event, which led to the resignation of Colonel Bachmann, the stay-behind was recreated, under the code-name P-26. Defence Minister [[Georges-André Chevallaz]] gave his approval to Chief of Staff [[Hans Senn]] and UNA director [[Richard Ochsner]]. Bachmann was replaced by Colonel Efrem Cattelan, who headed the paramilitary organization starting in October 1979. The code-name alluded to paragraph 426 of the Security and Defence concept of the Federal Council of 27 June 1973, which stated the needs of "active resistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8493181/Colonel-Albert-Bachmann.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Colonel Albert Bachmann | date=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Projekt-26#Stay-behind in the UNA|See above]]'').

== Murder of Herbert Alboth ==

During the investigations concerning the [[Secret files scandal (Switzerland)|secret files scandal]] and P-26, Herbert Alboth, a former member of staff of the Spezialdienst (special service) until 1976, was assassinated on April 18, 1990, in his flat in [[Liebefeld]] near [[Bern]]. A short time before, he had written to the MP [[Kaspar Villiger]], on March 1, proposing to reveal all that he knew on the stay-behind.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; The press reported that Alboth had been "killed with his own military [[bayonet]]" with "several stabs to the stomach," while "on the chest of the victim the medical examiners have found a set of characters which were written in [[Marker pen|felt pen]] and puzzle the investigators."&lt;ref name="Ganser p.562"/&gt; His death was never resolved, while the Swiss deputies discovered in his flat pictures of senior P-26 members, old documents on training and courses, exercise plans of a conspiratorial character and address list of former members of the "Special Service."&lt;ref name="Ganser p.562"/&gt;

== The Cornu Report ==

Following the November 1990 report by the Parliamentary Commission, the [[Swiss Socialist Party]] and the [[Greens (Switzerland)|Greens]] requested further investigations concerning alleged ties between P-26 and other Gladio stay-behind organizations. Judge [[Pierre Cornu]] was charged with the investigation, and delivered a 100-page report known as the "Cornu Report." He met Italian and Belgian MPs, as well as P-26 members, but London declined to comment (the existence of [[MI6]] was still un-confirmed by Britain).

The Cornu Report stated that P-26 was without "''political or legal legitimacy''", and described the group's collaboration with British secret services as "''intense''":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unknown to the Swiss government, British officials signed agreements with the organisation, called P26, to provide training in combat, communications, and sabotage. The latest agreement was signed in 1987… P26 cadres participated regularly in training exercises in Britain… British advisers — possibly from the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] — visited secret training establishments in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/swiss.subversion_graun_20sep1991.html UK trained secret Swiss force] in ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 20, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the account of the report from [[Richard Norton-Taylor]], from ''[[The Guardian]]'', "''The activities of P-26, its codes, and the name of the leader of the group, Efrem Cattelan, were known to British intelligence, but the Swiss government was kept in the dark."&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

Despite a parliamentary motion deposed by MP [[Josef Lang]], which requested the full, non-[[censorship|censored]], publication of the Cornu Report, large sections of the latter remained classified and will remain so for the next thirty years.&lt;ref name ="ref1"&gt;[http://www.parlament.ch/d/cv-geschaefte?gesch_id=20053096 Parliamentary motion] deposed by [[Josef Lang]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Gladio stay-behind organizations were coordinated by secret organizations of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] and ultimately responded to [[SACEUR]], head of NATO in Europe, any relationship between P-26 and SACEUR would be an obvious breach of Swiss [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. Thus, the matter remains controversial and confidential. A 17-page summary, titled "P-26 not part of an international network," was published on 19 September 1991.

Confronted by a question from [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Socialist]] deputy [[Paul Rechsteiner]] on 30 September 1991, concerning the non-publication of the Cornu Report, Defence Minister [[Kaspar Villiger]] declared that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Cornu Report contains numerous pieces of information on foreign secret services and resistance organisations, as well as their structures, hierarchies, and connections&amp;nbsp;... The Cornu Report will not be released and published because it is not the business of the Federal Council to reveal the secret affairs of foreign states.&lt;ref name="Ganser p.572"&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," quoted p.572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To that, Socialist MP [[Susanne Leutenegger-Oberholzer]] replied: "''is the Council not of the opinion that it is deplorable if foreign secret services receive more information than, for instance, Swiss parliamentarians?''"&lt;ref&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," quoted p.573&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actions of the P-26 and alleged international contacts ==

However, according to an [[ETH Zurich|ETH university study]] by [[Daniele Ganser]], "P26 was not directly involved in the network of NATO's secret armies but it had close contact to [[MI6]]," the British secret service which worked closely with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] during the Cold War and trained Gladio paramilitaries in Italy.&lt;ref name="ethlife.ethz.ch"&gt;[http://www.ethlife.ethz.ch/e/articles/sciencelife/NatoGeheimarmee.html  Conference "Nato Secret Armies and P26" - The Dark Side of the West] by the [[ETH Zurich|ETH Zurich Institute]], by Felix Wursten, published on 10 February 2005 {{en icon}}/{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While responding to a question in Parliament concerning the assassination of Herbert Alboth (related to the discovery of P-26), National counsellor [[Remo Gysin]] has described the relations between the Swiss stay-behind, MI6 and NATO as "notorious".&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[http://search.parlament.ch/f/homepage/cv-geschaefte.htm?gesch_id=20053374 Parliamentary question] of MP [[Remo Gysin]] concerning the assassination of Herbert Alboth&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other stay-behind organizations in Europe, P-26 had weapons caches in Switzerland, while some of its members took paramilitary and [[guerrilla warfare]] training courses with the MI6 in Great Britain.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt; Foreign instructors also followed courses in Switzerland with P-26.&lt;ref name="Ganser p.566"&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.566&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss military instructor Alois Hürlimann revealed that he had taken part in secret military training in England, which he said included a real assault on an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) arms depot, in which at least one IRA terrorist was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.568&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Colonel Bachmann, head of the Special Service, allegedly reached a mutual cooperation agreement with the British [[Special Air Service|SAS]].&lt;ref&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.570&lt;/ref&gt;

British Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]], Deputy Supreme Commander of NATO forces in Europe from 1951 to 1958, was in the [[Bernese Oberland]] each February from 1946 to 1962, for military affairs. He met in 1946 Swiss Defence Minister [[Karl Kobelt]], Foreign Minister [[Max Petitpierre]] and Chief of Staff [[Louis de Montmollin]] to discuss Swiss neutrality and strategy in the post-war period.&lt;ref&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland,"  p.571&lt;/ref&gt; According to researches by Swiss historian Mauro Mantovani, Montgomery met again Montmollin in February 1952 to discuss plans in case of a Soviet invasion. They agreed that in case of an emergency, Switzerland would need help from NATO, leading Mantovani to conclude that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Switzerland during the Cold War was so obviously part of the western camp that western leaders could only wish that all neutrals would take Switzerland as an example.&lt;ref name="Ganser p.572"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Italian magistrate [[Felice Casson]], who first discovered [[Gladio in Italy]], declared: "''I am sure that I also saw documents on Gladio contacts with Switzerland"'' in the ''[[Palazzo Braschi]]'' in Rome, headquarters of the [[SISMI]] military intelligence agency.&lt;ref&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," quoted p.574&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, P-26 used Harpoon radios, a powerful encrypted communication system, which was used by the [[Belgian stay-behind network]] as discovered by the Belgian Parliamentary Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.be/lexdocs/S0523/S05231297.pdf Belgian parliamentary report concerning the stay-behind network], named "''Enquête parlementaire sur l'existence en Belgique d'un réseau de renseignements clandestin international''" or "''Parlementair onderzoek met betrekking tot het bestaan in België van een clandestien internationaal inlichtingenetwerk''" (Parliamentary investigation on the existence in Belgium of an international clandestine intelligence network)&lt;/ref&gt; The Harpoon system, bought by NATO from the German firm [[AEG Telefunken]] in the beginning of the 1980s, permitted stay-behind members to send encrypted radio messages across 6.000&amp;nbsp;km, thus enabling them to maintain relations between themselves. This system is not compatible with the standard communication system used by the Swiss army. However, magistrate Pierre Cornu found that in 1987, P-26 had connected foreign stations of the Harpoon system for around 15 million Swiss francs. Historian Daniele Ganser observed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The purchase of the Harpoon equipment linked to NATO command centres in Brussels, the CIA in the US, and MI6 in Great Britain realised the integration of the Swiss stay-behind in the European stay-behind network at a very basic, hardware level.&lt;ref&gt;Ganser, "The British Secret Service in Neutral Switzerland," p.575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 13 March 1991, Socialist MP [[Esther Bührer]] asked in a parliamentary request to the Federal Council if members of P-26 had been involved in the "[[Kaiseraugst]]" sabotage operations, which had occurred in 1975 during [[anti-nuclear]] protests against the establishment of a [[nuclear plant]] in Kaiseraugst, near [[Basel]]. Between 1974 and 1984, more than 30 sabotage operations had been carried out there, and investigations were abandoned without results, although they pointed that they had been "professional" operations. Defence Minister [[Kaspar Villiger]] denied any involvement. The left-wing weekly ''[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]]'' also declared the request unlikely, as some violent anti-nuclear protesters had allegedly taken credit for the sabotage operations.&lt;ref name="Ganser p.566"/&gt;

Former MP [[Helmut Hubacher]], president of the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland]] from 1975 to 1990, declared that the existence of P-26 was more disturbing than what professional soldiers alleged it was, since it was not only to counter a possible Soviet invasion, but also had a mandate to become active should the left win the elections and gain parliamentary majority.&lt;ref name="ethlife.ethz.ch"/&gt;

== P-27 Files ==

Beside P-26, the military intelligence agency also dissimulated P-27, charged with domestic surveillance. According to [[Richard Norton-Taylor]] from ''[[The Guardian]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;P26 was backed by P27, a private foreign intelligence agency funded partly by the government, and by a special unit of Swiss army intelligence which had built up files on nearly 8,000 "suspect persons" including "leftists", "bill stickers", "[[Jehovah's witnesses]]", people with "abnormal tendencies" and [[anti-nuclear]] demonstrators. 

On November 14, the Swiss government hurriedly dissolved P26 — the head of which, it emerged, had been paid £100,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/gladio_graun_5dec1990.html "The Gladio File: did fear of communism throw West into the arms of terrorists?"], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Protests &amp; campaigns==

In January 2008, the RRQ accused the organizers of  [[Quebec City]]’s 400th anniversary celebrations of being [[Historical revisionism|revisionists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.canoe.ca/infos/quebeccanada/archives/2009/05/20090511-144448.html Canoe – Infos – Québec-Canada: «Où sont nos milliards?»&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2008, the RRQ marched at the [[St. Patrick’s Day]] parade in [[Montreal]]. Members of the RRQ waved Quebec, Patriote and Irish flags. The RRQ also planned to distribute leaflets commemorating links between Irish Canadians and Quebecers, including the involvement of [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants in the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Patriote movement]] of 1837 in [[Lower Canada]], as Quebec was known at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?k=19816&amp;id=7ffd5a94-5a07-45c8-97ba-5eee95b8597e St. Patrick's Day parade too English, says sovereignist group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the [[Mouvement Québec français]] and the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]] of Montreal, two larger Québec nationalist groups, distanced themselves from the RRQ's march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?k=19784&amp;id=9563d5b5-456d-40cc-b97a-90e3c58bf3fd|title=Revellers paint the town green|date=2009-03-17|publisher=[[Canada.com]]|accessdate=2009-09-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107045131/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?k=19784&amp;id=9563d5b5-456d-40cc-b97a-90e3c58bf3fd|archivedate=2012-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the RRQ campaigned against the [[combat reenactment]] of the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].  [[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'s Quebec affairs columnist [[Don Macpherson (journalist)|Don Macpherson]] wrote that the RRQ used [[propaganda of the deed]] combined with threats of violence&lt;ref name="Vigile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vigile.net/Better-late-than-never-Marois-cuts|title=Better late than never : Marois cuts ties with violent groups |last=MacPherson|first=Don|date=2009-02-24|publisher=[[Vigile.net]]|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NationalPost1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/02/17/graeme-hamilton-waving-a-white-flag-over-the-plains.aspx|title=Graeme Hamilton: Waving a white flag over the Plains|last=Nurwisah|first=Ron|date=2009-02-17|newspaper=[[National Post]]|accessdate=2009-09-15}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that played a major role in the cancellation of the reenactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13185508|title=Fighting Old Battles:A 250-year-old Defeat Still Rankles|work=[[The Economist]]|date=Feb 26, 2009|accessdate =Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the group, retired Quebec filmmaker [[Pierre Falardeau]] stated that if the reenactment took place, "some people will get their asses kicked".&lt;ref name="gazette2" /&gt; The RRQ said that for visiting spectators the reenactment would offer "a trip they won't soon forget".&lt;ref name="gazette2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/story_print.html?id=1296374&amp;sponsor= |title=Retreat!

On June 23, 2009, Lake of Stew, an [[English-speaking Quebecker|anglophone]] music group playing at the L'Autre St. Jean concert for the [[National Holiday (Quebec)|St. Jean Baptiste festivities]] at Pelican Park in [[Rosemont, Quebec]], was heckled by members of the RRQ, but the heckling was met mostly with disdain by those in the audience and the band played on to cheers.&lt;ref name="The Gazette3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/story_print.html?id=1725629&amp;sponsor= |title=Sovereignists heckle Lake of Stew at L'Autre St. Jean |date=2009-06-23 |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume Duchesneau, a member of the RRQ, stated, "I don't think there should be two anglophone bands here.

'''Special Groups''' ('''SGs''') is a designation given by the American military to the cell-based [[Shi'a]] paramilitary organizations operating within [[Iraq]], backed by [[Iran]]. According to the Americans these groups are funded, trained, and armed by the Iranian [[Quds Force]], part of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]].

According to American General Kevin J. Bergner, the Special Groups receive between 750,000 and 3,000,000 dollars funding per month from the Quds Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usf-iraq.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12653&amp;Itemid=128|title=The Official Website - United States Forces – Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are separate from but allied with the [[Mahdi Army]] of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. The distinction between these groups and the Mahdi Army became more clear when al-Sadr called for a ceasefire at the end of August 2007 following Mahdi Army [[Battle of Karbala (2007)|clashes]] with [[Iraqi Security Forces]] in [[Karbala, Iraq|Karbala]] but the Special Groups continued fighting. After the Mahdi Army's disbandment in 2008, the [[Promised Day Brigades]] emerged as its successor; however, the largest special group to emerge after the [[Iraq spring fighting of 2008]] was [[Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq]] (also known as the Qazali Network). According to the Guardian newspaper in March 2014, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq is controlled by Iran under Quds Force General [[Qasem Soleimani]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/iraq-battle-dead-valley-peace-syria Controlled by Iran, the deadly militia recruiting Iraq's men to die in Syria], The Guardian, 12 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Another large special group is [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]] (or Hezbollah Brigades) which started to operate independently from the Mahdi Army and the other Special Groups. Suspected leaders include [[Qais al-Khazali]], [[Laith al-Khazali]], [[Ali al-Lami]], [[Azhar al Dulaimi]], [[Akram al-Kabi]], [[Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani]], [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]] and [[Abu Deraa]].

==History==
Ever since the [[1979 Iranian revolution|Islamic Revolution]], Iran has sought to back Shia Islamist paramilitary organizations across the Middle East. Many have been very close to the Iranian state, particularly the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]], like the Movement of Vanguard Missionaries and the [[Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq]] (SCIRI). During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] many of these groups fought for Iran, with SCIRI's [[Badr Organization|Badr Brigade]] being led by Iranian officers. After the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein, these Iranian-led militia men returned to Iraq where they retained their autonomy and Iran continued to support Shia Islamist paramilitaries.

In February 2010, Asaib Ahl al-Haq kidnapped U.S. contractor Issa T. Salomi, a naturalized American from Iraq. They released a video of him where he read their demands, calling for the release of all the group's members, including several of the group's leaders who are currently imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=118051&amp;sectionid=351020201 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531064657/http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=118051&amp;sectionid=351020201 |archivedate=May 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran is supporting three Shiite extremist groups in Iraq that have been attempting to attack American bases, General Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, said on July 21, 2010. The Iranians have "gone to a more sophisticated program with a smaller set of extremists" and are now focusing on three groups, which he identified as Kataib Hezbollah, Asaib Ahl al-Haq (League of the Righteous), and the Promised Day Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jCA6iGhsEI3i-z4hAG8Z2Cu4kV3Q] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724040950/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jCA6iGhsEI3i-z4hAG8Z2Cu4kV3Q |date=July 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, according to American officials, the Promised Day Brigades is the largest, with over 5,000 fighters, and pose the biggest long-term security threat to Iraq. Kata'ib Hezbollah is said to have around 1,000 fighters and is the most exclusively reliant on Iranian support. Asa'ib al-Haq is said to have less than 1,000 fighters as of 2011 and receives a reported 5 million per month in Iranian funding. The Promised Day Brigades is said to receive the least amount of Iranian funding and is the most independent of the three.&lt;ref name="strength"/&gt;

Since the beginning of the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi war against ISIS]], the Special Groups have joined the [[Popular Mobilization Forces (Iraq)|Popular Mobilization Forces]] to fight against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

This is a timeline of the '''territorial evolution of the Caribbean''' and nearby areas of [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]], listing each change to the internal and external borders of the various countries that make up the region.

The region covered is the Caribbean, its islands (most of which enclose the sea), and the surrounding coasts, as well as the southern part of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Florida]], [[Central America]], and the northern region of South America.

The political evolution of the land surrounding the Caribbean reveals the significant role the region played in the colonial struggles of the European powers since [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in 1492. In the 20th century the Caribbean was again important during World War II, in the [[decolonization]] wave in the post-war period, and in the tension between [[Communist]] [[Cuba]] and the United States (U.S.).  Genocide, slavery, immigration and rivalry between world powers have given Caribbean history an impact disproportionate to the size of this small region.

At the time of the [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] discovery of most of the islands of the Caribbean, three major [[Amerindian]] [[indigenous peoples]] lived on the islands: the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] in the [[Greater Antilles]], [[Bahamas|The Bahamas]] and the Leeward Islands; the [[Island Caribs]] and [[Galibi]] in the [[Windward Islands]]; and the [[Ciboney]] in western [[Cuba]]. The Taínos are subdivided into Classic Taínos, who occupied Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, Western Taínos, who occupied Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamian archipelago, and the Eastern Taínos, who occupied the Leeward Islands.&lt;ref name="Taínos"&gt;{{cite book | last = Irving Rouse| title = The Tainos: Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus|edition= July 28, 1993|pages= 224 | publisher = Yale University Press| isbn= 0-300-05696-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinidad]] was inhabited by both [[Carib language|Carib speaking]] and [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] groups.

In 1700 Spain ruled what is now North America, Central America, South America and the major islands of the Caribbean.  Other players were the:

;Kingdom of England
who controlled:
*[[Mosquito Coast]] - The Mosquito Coast or eastern portion of what is now [[Nicaragua]] was declared to be under the protection of the English crown in 1687.&lt;ref name="Mosquito"&gt;{{cite web |quote=Data as of December 1993|url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/nitoc.html|title = Colonial Rule|publisher = Library of Congress Call Number F1523 .N569 1994| accessdate = 2009-05-07 | last=[[USA.gov]] }}''In 1687 the English governor of Jamaica named a Miskito who was one of his prisoners, "King of the Mosquitia Nation", and declared the region to be under the protection of the English crown.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Anguilla]] - In 1650, English settlers arrived from [[St Kitts]] and colonized Anguilla. In 1656 Indians from a neighboring island came and destroyed the settlement.

*[[Antigua and Barbuda]] - As part of the Treaty of Breda France formally ends its claim of Antigua in  1667 giving control to the British.

*[[Bahamas]] - In 1670 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the islands to the [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608–1697)|Earl of Craven]] a [[Lord Proprietor]] of the Carolinas, who rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governor]]s, and administering the country.&lt;ref name="Anglican"&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php|title = Diocesan History|publisher = © Copyright 2009 Anglican Communications Department| accessdate = 2009-05-07 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Barbados]] - British sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day [[Holetown]].

*[[Belize|British Honduras (Belize)]]" English [[buccaneer]]s began cutting logwood (''[[Haematoxylum campechianum]]''), which was used in the production of a textile [[dye]]. English buccaneers began using the coastline as a base from which to attack Spanish ships. Buccaneers stopped plundering Spanish logwood ships and started cutting their own wood in the 1650s and 1660s. Logwood extraction then became the main reason for the English settlement for more than a century. A 1667 treaty, in which the European powers agreed to suppress piracy, encouraged the shift from buccaneering to cutting logwood and led to more permanent settlement.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Bolland, Nigel.

English retaliation by General Codrington defeated the French forces and deported them to Martinique. The Treaty of Rijswijk in 1697 restored pre-war conditions.  [[Nevis]] was ruled by the British
*[[Saint Lucia]] - In 1664, Thomas Warner (son of the governor of St Kitts) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men there to defend it from the French, but after two years there were only 89 left, mostly due to disease.
*[[Turks and Caicos Islands]] - Bermudians claimed the islands for Britain and came to Turks &amp; Caicos to rake the salt and take it back to Bermuda.

==Origins==
The theory of the great replacement can be traced back to the 1973 novel ''[[Le Camp des Saints]]'' by [[Jean Raspail]] which depicts the collapse of Western culture owing to an overwhelming "tidal wave" of Third World immigration. The novel, along with the theory of [[Eurabia]] developed by the Swiss-Israeli writer [[Bat Ye'or]] in 2005, set the ground then for [[Renaud Camus]] to develop and present his book entitled ''The Great Replacement'' in 2012.&lt;ref name="Abdeslam"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ait Abdeslam |first1=Abderrahim |title=The vilification of Muslim diaspora in French fictional novels: 'Soumission' (2015) and 'Petit Frère' (2008) as case studies |journal=Journal of Multicultural Discourses |volume=13 |issue=3 |date=28 August 2018 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1080/17447143.2018.1511717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credited as the "progenitor of the Great Replacement doctrine" by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/07/05/hate-europe-june-2018 |title=Hate in Europe: June 2018 |work=Hatewatch |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camus has stated that "the great replacement is very simple.

'''Torna atrás''' ({{IPA-es|toɾnaˈtɾas}}) or '''Tornatrás''' is a term once used in [[Spain]] and its former [[Spanish colonial empire|overseas colonies]] to describe a mixed race person ([[mestizaje|mestizo]]) that showed [[phenotypic]] characteristics of only one of the "original races",&lt;ref name="RAE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dle.rae.es/?id=a64p6qK| title=Definición de tornatrás | publisher=Real Academia Española | accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, white, black, Amerindian or Asian. The term was also used to describe an individual whose parentage was half white and half "[[octoroon|albino]]".&lt;ref name="RAE"/&gt;

[[File:IX. From Spaniard and Albino, Return Backwards (De espanol y albina, torna atras) LACMA M.2011.20.2 (5 of 5).jpg|thumbnail|[[Casta#Casta paintings in 18th-century Mexico|Casta painting]] of a Spanish father, albino mother and torna atrás child. [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]] (Mexico, circa 1760)]]
==Colonial Spanish America==
Under the [[casta]] system of colonial [[Spanish America]], the torna atrás (in English, similar in meaning to throwback, hark back to) could also make reference to the appearance of racial characteristics not present in the parents. Such as in the [[colored]] child of a white person and albino. The albino casta refers to the seemingly white offspring of a white and black-descended parent (afromestizo).

==Philippines==
It was also used in the [[Philippines]] during the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonial era]] from the 16th to 19th century, to describe persons of mixed indigenous [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] (referred to as ''[[Spanish East Indies|Indio]]''), [[Sangley|Chinese]] (referred to as ''Sangley''), and [[Peninsulares|Spanish]] ancestry (referred to as ''Filipinos''/''Insulares'' or ''Peninsulares'').

It is likely that a majority of [[Filipino people]] today would have been classified as ''Tornatrás'' under this system due to centuries of intermarriage among various foreign and indigenous ethnic groups throughout the islands.

==History==
Although Tornatrás was originally used to describe a descendant of [[mestizos]], albinos and Europeans, in the Philippines they were commonly known as those born from a Spanish father ('Filipino' or 'peninsular') and a Malay-Chinese (mestiza de [[sangley]]) mother.

Most people of the Tornatrás caste in the Philippines used [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as their primary language and in many cases converted to the Catholic faith.


There are no official statistics on the number of people of Tornatrás ancestry around the world, although it is believed that most are to be found in South America and the Philippines.

The '''Treaty of Nymphaeum''' ({{lang-el|Συνθήκη του Νυμφαίου}}) was a [[peace treaty]] signed in December 1214 between the [[Nicaean Empire]], successor state of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the [[Latin Empire]], which was established in the aftermath of the [[Fourth Crusade]] of 1204.

==Background==
Following the Fourth Crusade, [[Baldwin IX of Flanders]] was elected emperor of the Latin Empire and was recognized to have not only a portion of [[Constantinople]] (the remainder was given to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]), but also the north-west region of [[Asia Minor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|p=425}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although recognition of sovereignty did not mean actual control of the territory. It was up to the emperor to exercise that control, by force of arms if necessary. Following the Fourth Crusade, Baldwin was occupied with events in [[Thrace]] and was later taken prisoner by the [[Bulgarians]] in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] in April 1205.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|p=427}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Asia Minor was ignored by the Latins for the time being, thus giving a breathing space for [[Theodore I Lascaris|Theodore Lascaris]], who had declared himself emperor and was based at [[Nicaea]], to consolidate his power and focus his attention on the [[Sultanate of Rûm]] during this time.

Baldwin's brother, [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]], took over the Latin Empire and started operations against the Nicaean Empire at the end of 1206, but these were only minor engagements until Henry focused his attention in 1211.&lt;ref name="Ostrogorsky1211"&gt;{{harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|pp=429–430}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15 of that year, Henry won a major victory at the [[Battle of the Rhyndacus (1211)|Rhyndacus River]] and pushed forward onto [[Pergamum]] and Nymphaeum, but guerrilla warfare on Theodore's part limited Henry's further advances.&lt;ref name="Ostrogorsky1211"/&gt; Due to both sides being exhausted, the Treaty of Nymphaeum was signed between the two emperors, halting the Latin advance into Asia Minor. The Latin holdings were confined to the north-western part of Anatolia, comprising the coasts of [[Bithynia]] and most of [[Mysia]].

==Aftermath==
Although both sides would continue to fight for years to come, there were some important consequences of this peace agreement. First, the peace treaty effectively recognized both parties, as neither one was strong enough to destroy the other. The second consequence of the treaty was that [[David Komnenos]], who had been a vassal of Henry and who had been carrying out his own war against Nicaea with the support of the Latin Empire, now effectively lost that support. Theodore was thus able to annex all of David's lands west of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in late 1214, gaining access to the [[Black Sea]]. The third consequence was that Theodore was now free to wage war against the [[Seljuqs]] without the distraction of the Latins for the time being. Nicaea was able to consolidate their eastern frontier for the remainder of the century. Hostilities broke out again in 1224, and a crushing Nicaean victory at the Second [[Battle of Poemanenum]] reduced Latin territories in Asia effectively only to the [[Nicomedia]]n peninsula. This treaty allowed the Nicaeans to go on the offensive in [[Europe]] years later, culminating in the [[Alexios Strategopoulos#Recapture of Constantinople|reconquest of Constantinople]] in 1261.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostrogorsky|1969|p=431}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7919">'''Whole of Government Accounts''' ('''WGA''') is the annual publication by the [[United Kingdom]] [[UK Government|Government]] of the Consolidated [[financial statement]]s of over 5,500 organisations across the public sector.&lt;ref name="UKWOGA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/whole-of-government-accounts |title=Whole of Government Accounts |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to provide more complete data for fiscal planning by producing consolidated financial statements which are produced in accordance with the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), the system of accounts used internationally by the private sector.

The accounts are [[Auditor independence|independently audited]] by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General]]&lt;ref name="guidance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/wga_200910_guidance.pdf |title=Guidance to the Whole of Government Accounts y/e 31/03/10 (''vid.'' p.4) |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and get scrutinized by the [[Public Accounts Committee]] each year.

==Background==
The Treasury first published a scoping study for WGA in July 1998. The first set of accounts to be published will be for the [[Fiscal year|year ended]] 31 March 2010. WGA are prepared under Sections [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/20/crossheading/whole-of-government-accounts 9 to 11] of the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000. WGA are prepared for the whole of the UK [[public sector]] ([[Government of the United Kingdom|central government]], [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]], [[National Health Service|health]], and [[Government-owned corporation|public corporations]]).&lt;ref name="guidance"/&gt; WGA are prepared under [[International Financial Reporting Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/wga_200910_guidance.pdf |title=Guidance to the Whole of Government Accounts y/e 31/03/10 (''vid.'' p.21) |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Structure of the document is the same as you'd get for any private sector organisation using [[IFRS]].
In particular the following consolidated statements are included: 
*Consolidated [[Income statement|Statement of Revenue and Expenditure]] with the [[other comprehensive income]] part shown as a seporate statement;
*Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
*consolidated [[Balance sheet|Statement of Financial Position]], showing public sector assets and liabilities; 
*Consolidated [[Statement of changes in equity|Statement of Changes in Taxpayers’ Equity]]
*consolidated [[Cash flow statement|Cash Flow Statement]]; and  
*[[Notes to the financial statements|Notes to the Accounts]]
It also includes a Statement on Internal Control as well as detailing the [[Accounting Officer]]’s responsibilities and a [[Remuneration Report]]

==Results for FY 2010==
The Whole of Governments Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2010 was published on 29 November 2011.  It was the first ever set of audited financial statements for the UK public sector. The 2009-10 WGA brings together, for the first time, audited financial information from the UK’s central government, local government, the National Health Service (NHS) and public corporations. It makes clear a number of metrics that previously had been difficult to calculate, such as the net public service pension liability, the Government’s commitments under [[private finance initiative]] (PFI) contracts, total provisions, and contingent liabilities.

As this is the first year in which WGA is published, there is no historical data for comparison. Over time, annual publications of WGA will allow the user to build up a clear and consistent picture of trends and changes in the Government’s fiscal position. WGA also allows for international comparisons of fiscal balance sheets to be made, provided that other countries’ accounts are produced on a comparable basis.

The accounts are available on the UK's Treasury website: http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/wga.

==Audit Report==
The Whole of Government Accounts are subject to audit by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General (United Kingdom)|Comptroller &amp; Auditor General]] (C&amp;AG).

The C&amp;AG audited the 2009-10 WGA and concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraphs above:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*&lt;blockquote&gt;the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Whole of Government as at 31 March 2010 and of its net deficit, changes in taxpayers’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended; and&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*&lt;blockquote&gt;the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The C&amp;AG report on the 2009-10 WGA is [http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/1012/wga_2009-10.aspx available on the National Audit Office's website].

The '''Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace''' was the name given for a conference convened by the United Nations during 4–15 September 1995 in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref name=UKcommis&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth United Nation's Conference on Women in Beijing 1995|url=http://wnc.equalities.gov.uk/work-of-the-wnc/international-articles/beijing-platform/162-beijing-platform-for-action.html|publisher=Women's National Commission (UK)|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:UN charter logo.png|thumb|alt=|UN charter logo]]
The [[United Nations Charter|founding United Nations charter (1945)]] included a provision for equality between men and women ([[Chapter III of the United Nations Charter#Article 8|chapter III, article 8]]). Subsequently, from 1945 to 1975 various female officials within the United Nations and leaders of women's movements on the global stage attempted to turn these principles into action. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution ([[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3010|resolution 3010]]) that 1975 should be [[International Women's Year]]. In December 1975, the UN General Assembly passed a further resolution ([[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/136|resolution 31/136]]) that 1976–1985 should be the "Decade of Women".&lt;ref name="O'Barr"&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Barr | first = Jean F. | contribution = United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, China (1995) – "Global Framework" of the Platform for Action | editor1-last = DeLamotte | editor1-first = Eugenia | editor2-last = Meeker| editor2-first = Natania | editor3-last = O'Barr | editor3-first = Jean F. | pages = 502–510 | title = Women imagine change: a global anthology of women's resistance from 600 B.C.E. to present | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415915311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article| World Conference on Women, 1975}}
In conjunction with [[International Women's Year]], the first world conference on women was held in Mexico City in 1975.&lt;ref name=UKcommis /&gt; It resulted in the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]].&lt;ref name=MexicoDec&gt;{{cite web|title=World Conference of the International Women's Year|url=http://www.un-documents.net/mex-dec.htm |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article| World Conference on Women, 1980}}
The second world conference on women was held in Copenhagen in 1980.&lt;ref name=UKcommis /&gt; The conference agreed that the 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] was an important milestone. The Copenhagen conference also acknowledged the gap between rights being secured for women and women's ability to exercise those rights. It was also agreed that it was action on the three areas of: equal access to education; employment opportunities; and adequate health care services are essential to achieve the goals set out in Mexico.&lt;ref name=Copenhagen&gt;{{cite web|title=1980 World Conference on Women|url=http://www.5wwc.org/conference_background/1980_WCW.html|publisher=5th Women's World Conference|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article| World Conference on Women, 1985}}
The third world conference on women was held in Nairobi in 1985.&lt;ref name=UKcommis /&gt; The Nairobi conference set out areas by which progress in women's equality could be measured: constitutional and legal measures; equality in social participation; equality in political participation; and decision-making. The conference also acknowledged that women need to participate in all areas of human activity, not just those areas that relate to gender.&lt;ref name=Nairobi&gt;{{cite web|title=1985 World Conference on Women|url=http://www.5wwc.org/conference_background/1985_WCW.html|publisher=5th Women's World Conference|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preceding the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 1995 ===

Delegates had prepared a Declaration and Platform for Action aimed at achieving greater equality and opportunity for women.

In fallout from pre-conference meetings, the [[Holy See]] publicly disagreed with positions outlined by the United States and other nations concerning abortion, [[reproductive rights]], and other sensitive issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Tagliabue | first = John| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/09/world/vatican-attacks-population-stand-supported-by-us.html | work =[[The New York Times]] |title=Vatican Attacks U.S.-Backed Draft for Women's Conference | date=26 August 1995 |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|

==== Mission statement ====
1. The Platform for Action is an agenda for women's [[empowerment]]. It aims at accelerating the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and at removing all the obstacles to women's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic, social, cultural and political [[decision-making]]. This means that the principle of shared power and responsibility should be established between women and men at home, in the workplace and in the wider national and international communities. [[gender equality|Equality between women and men]] is a matter of human rights and a condition for social justice and is also a necessary and fundamental prerequisite for equality, development and peace. A transformed partnership based on equality between women and men is a condition for people-centred sustainable development. A sustained and long-term commitment is essential, so that women and men can work together for themselves, for their children and for society to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

2. The Platform for Action reaffirms the fundamental principle set forth in the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], adopted by the [[World Conference on Human Rights]], that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. As an agenda for action, the Platform seeks to promote and protect the full enjoyment of all human rights and the fundamental freedoms of all women throughout their life cycle.

3. The Platform for Action emphasizes that women share common concerns that can be addressed only by working together and in partnership with men towards the common goal of gender&lt;ref group=note&gt;For the commonly understood meaning of the term "gender", see annex IV below.&lt;/ref&gt; equality around the world. It respects and values the full diversity of women's situations and conditions and recognizes that some women face particular barriers to their empowerment.

4. The Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful, just and humane world based on human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life, and to this end, recognizes that broad- based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice.

5. The success of the Platform for Action will require a strong commitment on the part of Governments, international organizations and institutions at all levels. It will also require adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries from all available funding mechanisms, including multilateral, bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women; financial resources to strengthen the capacity of national, subregional, regional and international institutions; a commitment to equal rights, equal responsibilities and equal opportunities and to the equal participation of women and men in all national, regional and international bodies and policy- making processes; and the establishment or strengthening of mechanisms at all levels for accountability to the world's women.

'''''Statement by the president of the conference on the commonly understood meaning of the term "gender".'''''

''1.   During the 19th meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women, acting as preparatory body for the Fourth World Conference on Women, an issue arose concerning the meaning of the word "gender" in the context of the Platform for Action of the Conference.  In order to examine the matter, the Commission decided to form a contact group in New York, with the Commission's Rapporteur, Ms. Selma Ashipala (Namibia), as Chairperson.  The Commission mandated the informal contact group to seek agreement on the commonly understood meaning of "gender" in the context of the Platform for Action and to report directly to the Conference in Beijing.''

''2.   Having considered the issue thoroughly, the contact group noted that:''
:(1) ''the word "gender" had been commonly used and understood in its ordinary, generally accepted usage in numerous other United Nations forums and conferences;''
:(2) ''there was no indication that any new meaning or connotation of the term, different from accepted prior usage, was intended in the Platform for Action.''

''3.   Accordingly, the contact group reaffirmed that the word "gender" as used in the Platform for Action was intended to be interpreted and understood as it was in ordinary, generally accepted usage.  The contact group also agreed that the present report should be read by the President of the Conference as a president's statement and that the statement should be part of the final report of the Conference.''

==== Critical areas of concern ====
41. The advancement of women and the achievement of equality between women and men are a matter of human rights and a condition for social justice and should not be seen in isolation as a women's issue. They are the only way to build a sustainable, just and developed society. Empowerment of women and equality between women and men are prerequisites for achieving political, social, economic, cultural and environmental security among all peoples.

42. Most of the goals set out in the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women have not been achieved. Barriers to women's empowerment remain, despite the efforts of Governments, as well as non-governmental organizations and women and men everywhere. Vast political, economic and ecological crises persist in many parts of the world. Among them are wars of aggression, armed conflicts, colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, civil wars and terrorism. These situations, combined with systematic or de facto discrimination, violations of and failure to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women, and their civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, including the right to development and ingrained prejudicial attitudes towards women and girls are but a few of the impediments encountered since the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development and Peace, in 1985.

43. A review of progress since the Nairobi Conference highlights special concerns – areas of particular urgency that stand out as priorities for action. All actors should focus action and resources on the strategic objectives relating to the critical areas of concern which are, necessarily, interrelated, interdependent and of high priority. There is a need for these actors to develop and implement mechanisms of accountability for all the areas of concern.

44. To this end, Governments, the international community and civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern:
* The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women
* Inequalities and inadequacies in and unequal access to education and training
* Inequalities and inadequacies in and unequal access to health care and related services
* Violence against women
* The effects of armed or other kinds of conflict on women, including those living under foreign occupation
* Inequality in economic structures and policies, in all forms of productive activities and in access to resources
* Inequality between men and women in the sharing of power and decision-making at all levels
* Insufficient mechanisms at all levels to promote the advancement of women
* Lack of respect for and inadequate promotion and protection of the human rights of women
* Stereotyping of women and inequality in women's access to and participation in all communication systems, especially in the media
* Gender inequalities in the management of natural resources and in the safeguarding of the environment
* Persistent discrimination against and violation of the rights of the girl child

==== Strategic objectives and actions ====
45. In each critical area of concern, the problem is diagnosed and strategic objectives are proposed with concrete actions to be taken by various actors in order to achieve those objectives. The strategic objectives are derived from the critical areas of concern and specific actions to be taken to achieve them cut across the boundaries of equality, development and peace – the goals of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women – and reflect their interdependence. The objectives and actions are interlinked, of high priority and mutually reinforcing. The Platform for Action is intended to improve the situation of all women, without exception, who often face similar barriers, while special attention should be given to groups that are the most disadvantaged.

46. The Platform for Action recognizes that women face barriers to full equality and advancement because of such factors as their race, age, language, ethnicity, culture, religion or disability, because they are indigenous women or because of other status. Many women encounter specific obstacles related to their family status, particularly as single parents; and to their socio- economic status, including their living conditions in rural, isolated or impoverished areas. Additional barriers also exist for refugee women, other displaced women, including internally displaced women as well as for immigrant women and migrant women, including women migrant workers. Many women are also particularly affected by environmental disasters, serious and infectious diseases and various forms of violence against women.

=== Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women ===
A major result of the conference was the Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women, signed at the NGO Forum in the Indigenous Women's Tent.&lt;ref name="ipcb.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women|url=http://www.ipcb.org/resolutions/htmls/dec_beijing.html|publisher=Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document seeks, in part, to reconcile the tension felt by Aboriginal women activists between (primarily white) feminism and Aboriginal movements dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Joyce|title=Balancing Strategies: Aboriginal Women and Constitutional Rights in Canada|journal=Making Space for Indigenous Feminism|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a significant step forward towards Indigenous women's rights and a significant victory for [[Indigenous feminism]] practice.

The 50-point declaration provides rationale and a clear call to action for governments navigating Aboriginal issues across the globe. The demands in the document are "that all governments and international non-governmental and governmental organizations recognize the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination, and enshrine the historical, political, social, cultural, economic, and religious rights of the Indigenous peoples in their constitutions and legal systems."&lt;ref name="ipcb.org"/&gt; From that premise, the declaration goes on to specify areas for action including self-determination; development, education and health; human rights violations and violence against Indigenous women; intellectual and cultural heritage; and political participation.

The document addresses the unique problems Aboriginal women suffer in addition to those suffered by Aboriginal men, which include erosion of culture (and gender roles therein), loss of traditional land, and compromised identity and status in the spaces they inhabit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sayers|first=Judith F.|author2=Kelly A. MacDonald|title=A Strong and Meaningful Role for First Nations Women in Governance|journal=First Nations Women, Governance and the Indian Act: A Collection of Policy Research Reports|year=2001|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its bases, the declaration cites the "UN Declaration of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous peoples, the Draft Declaration of the Rights of the Indigenous peoples, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women, [[Agenda 21]] and the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]], and the Copenhagen Social Summit Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women|url=http://twnside.org.sg/title/dec-ch.htm|publisher=Third World Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[UN Women]] began its commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women with the ''Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture It!'' campaign, also called the Beijing+20 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.looktothestars.org/news/12227-gloria-steinem-helps-un-women-unveil-beijing-20-campaign |title=Gloria Steinem Helps UN Women Unveil Beijing+20 Campaign |publisher=Look to the Stars |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaforfreedom.com/readarticle.php?AID=18455 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202335/http://www.mediaforfreedom.com/readarticle.php?AID=18455 |date=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers''' is one of the ancient [[Livery Company|livery companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The organisation, which engaged not only in [[tallow]] [[candle]] making but also in the trade of [[oil]]s, first received a [[Royal Charter]] in 1462.  

Traditionally tallow chandlers operated separately from [[Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers|wax chandlers]]: beeswax candles customarily being used in churches and noble houses, while tallow (animal fat) candles were generally used in other homes. As is the case with most other livery companies, the Tallow Chandlers' Company is no longer a trade association of [[candlemaker]]s, its decline precipitated by the advent of [[electricity|electric]] lighting. The company now exists as a charitable institution and supports education in oil-related fields.

The company ranks 21st in the [[Livery_Company#Precedence|Precedence of Livery Companies in the City of London]]. Its [[motto]] is ''Ecce Agnus Dei, Ecce Qui Tollit Peccata Mundi'': [[Latin]] for "Behold the Lamb of God, Who Takes Away the Sins of the World", words of [[St John the Baptist]] (Patron Saint of the Company) in reference to [[Jesus]].
