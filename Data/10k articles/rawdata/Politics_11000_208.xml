{{History of Indonesia}}
The '''acting presidency of Suharto''' followed the [[transition to the New Order]] in which Army General [[Suharto]] assumed presidential powers to "restore" law and order following the now-disputed [[30 September Movement|attempted coup]] which led to [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|anti-communist purge]]. The term lasted from 12 March 1967 until 27 March 1968, when Suharto was officially inaugurated as the definitive [[President of Indonesia]].

==Election to the acting presidency==
By February 1967, President [[Sukarno]] realized that his political career was at an end and he became concerned at cutting his losses. On 7 February, he sent a letter to Suharto saying that he was willing to hand over the running of the government to the General but also added that he would like to continue on as head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography |year= 2001 |publisher= The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge |location= UK |language= |isbn=0-521-77326-1 |pages= 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time between the arrival of that letter and the formulation of the reply, the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) passed a resolution which called for a Special Session of the Provisional [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPRS). Suharto, accompanied by the commanders of the Navy, Air Force, and Police, met with Sukarno on 11 February to reject his offer and to wait instead for the result of the MPRS Special Session.&lt;ref name="tempo.co.id"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 20 February 1967, Sukarno chose to relinquish all executive power to Suharto whilst still retaining his position as president.&lt;ref name="tempo.co.id"/&gt; Sukarno's decision did not stop the DPR from insisting that the MPRS Special Session go ahead. Originally calling for an MPRS Special Session to be held for the purpose of reviewing Sukarno’s performance as well as reaching a final decision on whether or not he was involved with the [[30 September Movement]] (G30S), the DPR now asked that the MPRS Special Session add Suharto's election as acting president to the agenda.

The Special Session was opened on 7 March 1967. On that day, Suharto delivered a speech absolving Sukarno of any involvement with the G30S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hughes |first= John |title= The End of Sukarno: A Coup That Misfired: A Purge That Ran Wild |origyear= 1967 |edition= 3rd |year= 2002 |publisher= Archipelago Press |location= Singapore |isbn=981-4068-65-9 |pages= 290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Session now turned on the matter of the presidency. Such was the intensive debate surrounding this matter that the Special Session did not finish on 11 March 1967 as intended but had to go for another extra day. But when the decision was finally made, it was unanimous. On 12 March 1967, the MPRS agreed to withdrew its mandate from Sukarno and remove him as president. Replacing Sukarno, in the capacity of acting president(''Pejabat Presiden'') would be Suharto.

==Cabinet==
Suharto retained the [[Ampera Cabinet]] which had been formed by him in July 1966. He reshuffled this Cabinet in October 1967 and created the [[Revised Ampera Cabinet]].

==Home affairs==

===Legislative elections===
The 1966 MPRS General Session passed a resolution calling for legislative elections to be held no later than 5 July 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography   |year= 2001 |pages= 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this became one of the first matters that Suharto attempted to address during his acting presidency. In doing this, he would have to deal with political parties.&lt;ref&gt;The political parties were the Indonesian National Party (PNI), NU, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII), the Islamic Educational Movement (Perti), the Indonesian Christian Party (Parkindo), the Catholic Party, the Indonesian Independence Supporters’ Union (IPKI), [[Murba Party]], and the Joint Secretariat of the Functional Groups (Sekber Golkar)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the political parties, the main point of contention was whether the Legislative Election would use the [[Single-member constituency|district system]] or [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Notosusanto |first= Nugroho |authorlink=Nugroho Notosusanto|title= Tercapainya Konsensus Nasional: 1966-1969 |year= 1985 |publisher= [[Balai Pustaka]] |location= Jakarta |language= Indonesian |pages= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous year, [[Military of Indonesia|ABRI]] had expressed interest in the district system and as such handed to the DPR an election bill which favors the district system. The bill was successfully blocked in the DPR as the list of parties not wanting change to the district system included the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI) and [[Nadhlatul Ulama]] (NU). With time running out until the 1968 Legislative Elections, Suharto needed to hammer out a compromise.

Suharto held a series of meetings during the first three months of his acting presidency with the leadership of the political parties. To accommodate the political parties, Suharto backed out of the notion of a district system and began supporting proportional representation; the trade-off being that the Government would be able to appoint some of the DPR members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Notosusanto |first= Nugroho  |title= Tercapainya Konsensus Nasional: 1966-1969  |year= 1985 |pages= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakthrough was made on 25 July 1967 when the political parties agreed that the Legislative Elections will be held using proportional representation, that the Government will appoint 100 Mps out of the 460 in the DPR, and that the Government will appoint 1/3 of the members of the new People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).

Despite the breakthrough it quickly became clear that it would be difficult to meet the deadline set by the MPRS. The bill would have to be rewritten and would have to go through the proper procedures before it could be passed. The bill was resubmitted to the DPR on 16 December 1967 but by January 1968, Suharto reported to the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the MPRS that it would be impossible to hold a Legislative Election in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dealing with Sukarno===
The MPRS Resolution which appointed Suharto to the acting presidency also gave him the power to take legal action against Sukarno. Suharto chose not to take any legal action and instead, Sukarno was still allowed to reside at the Presidential Palace and enjoy his freedom. Suharto also continued to insist that Sukarno was still the Head of State. Speaking on 13 March 1967, Suharto insisted that Sukarno was still President and Head of State, although without the political power that came with the office. This state of affairs did not last long. By May, Suharto decided that Sukarno was no longer allowed to use the title of President of the Republic of Indonesia and placed the former President under house arrest at [[Bogor]] Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
During the course of 1967, Suharto confirmed that [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] would be given a [[plebiscite]] concerning the matter of integration with Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 1967, he signed a bill into a law which approved the formation of [[Bengkulu]] Province&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Foreign Affairs==
The idea of pooling together the nations of [[South-East Asia]] into one organization came from [[Thanat Khoman]] the [[Thailand|Thai]] Minister of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested the idea to Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Adam Malik]] who promised to bring it up with Suharto. Suharto was interested in the idea and sent Malik to a conference in Thailand in August 1967. The conference was also attended by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Philippines]]. On 8 August 1967, the five Ministers signed the [[ASEAN Declaration|Bangkok Declaration]] which marked the formation of the [[Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). The declaration called among other things for the cooperation to help accelerate economic growth and promote stability in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The reversal of Sukarno's policy of Confrontation with Malaysia was completed with the establishment of diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Malaysia in early September 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, diplomatic relations were also established with Singapore with the opening of an Indonesian Embassy there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |title = Embassy's History
 |publisher = Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in Singapore
 |accessdate = 2007-11-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Running contrary to these two diplomatic successes was the deterioration of Indonesia's relationship with the [[People's Republic of China]]. The perception of the Indonesian Government was that China had backed the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI). The deterioration was not helped by the fact that the response to Indonesia's suspicion was the ideological zeal of China's [[Cultural Revolution]]. In October 1967, Indonesia announced that it was freezing diplomatic relations with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of Suharto as acting president was well received by the [[West]], who was keen to not only invest but give aid. Relationship with the [[Soviet Bloc]] cooled down but nevertheless, Suharto would work towards repaying the debt incurred during the Sukarno Government. More details can be seen later in this article.

==Defense and Security==
The first order of business for Suharto was to give official recognition to the non-military mission and roles of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (ABRI)]] as Commander in Chief and Minister of Defense. Measures had been taken to create a doctrinal justification for the ABRI's interference in non-military matters and this had culminated in August 1966 with the formulation of the Four Duties, One Function (Indonesian: ''Catur Dharma Eka Karya'' Acronym: Cadek) Doctrine. The doctrine stated that in addition to its defense and security role, the ABRI will also take part and would serve in other fields outside of the aforementioned functions of defense and security, including politics, culture, education and economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Moertopo |first= Ali |title= Strategi Pembangunan Nasional |year= 1981 |publisher= CSIS |location= Jakarta |language= Indonesian |pages= 249}}&lt;/ref&gt; 31 March 1967, Suharto called on the ABRI to adopt and implement the Cadek Doctrine.

The next step was to continue purging the armed forces and police of PKI and Sukarnoist elements. With the Army, most intense purges happened in [[Central Java]], [[East Java]], and [[North Sumatra]] with the Commanders of the 1st, 4th and 5th Regional Military Commands (Kodam) supervising the areas in question leading the purge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crouch |first= Harold |authorlink=Harold Crouch|title= The Army and Politics in Indonesia |year= 1978 |publisher= Cornell University Press |location= London |pages= 233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the Army, the Air Force had been weakened enough by its alleged involvement with G30S. The National Police tried to resist but political pressure became too strong for them to overcome.  Only the Navy resisted, criticizing the purges as practice reminiscent of the Old Order.

Suharto also began reorganizing the Command Structure of the ABRI. The first step was taken by stripping the Commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police of their Cabinet rank and Ministries (the Army, Navy, Air and Police Ministeries, which fused into the Ministry of Defense and Public Security) in August 1967, leaving only the Minister of Defense and Security and the Commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic with Cabinet memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto's acting presidency also saw the establishment of the State Intelligence Coordinating Agency (BAKIN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; another agency to ensure state security in addition to the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order ([[Kopkamtib]]), whose commander was also a part of the cabinet. In addition to all this,  Suharto issued a regulation regarding pay for all ABRI active serving personnel. The regulation provided provisions for pay, conditions for pay rise and the various types of allowances for military personnel in active service and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Beginning in July, Indonesia faced a security problem in the form of the North Kalimatan People's Forces (Paraku) and the People of Sarawak's Guerilla Forces (PGRS), two guerilla armies consisting of people of Chinese ethnicity, with communist leanings, and backed by [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1967, ABRI troops, working together with troops of Malaysia, had made progress but it was unknown as to when the conflict could have been decisively ended.

==Justice==
In an effort to help the Government form policy in this field, law enforcement agencies (The Supreme Court, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Attorney General, and the National Police) held a conference in [[Cibogo]], [[West Java]]. The agencies issued a joint communique which called for: elongating working days for legal procedures, increasing the amount of facilities for legal procedures, maximizing the amount of manpower for legal procedures, improving facilities, and improving coordination between the courts, the attorneys, and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the months leading up to Suharto’s assumption of the acting presidency, the trials of Old Order figures revealed that they had been very corrupt. To address this problem and to return any money that belonged to the state, Suharto formed the State Finance Supervision (Pekuneg) in April 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography   |year= 2001 |pages= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would not be long before accusations of corruption were thrown at the new Government. Suharto responded to this by forming the Abolition of Corruption Team (TPK) on 2 December 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Economics and Finance==

===General Economic Conditions===
By the end of 1967, the Suharto Government had been able to reduce inflation from 650% at the end of the previous year to 120%.&lt;ref name="bappenas.go.id"&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate = 2007-11-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal Policy===
With regards to the budget, Suharto undertook a policy of a [[balanced budget]] and the Sukarno-era practice of printing extra money to raise funds when the budget runs short was discontinued. Technically speaking, however, Suharto’s budgets ran [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s because foreign aid and external borrowing are not supposed to be counted as revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hill |first= Hall |title= The Indonesian Economy Since 1966 |year= 1996 |publisher= University of Cambridge Press|location= Melbourne |pages= 59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new Government also undertook a reform of the [[tax]] system. On 26 August 1967, the DPR passed the Amendment and Revision of Collection Methods for Income, Wealth, and Corporate Taxes Law  with Suharto smoothing out the details through a Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Under the new tax system, the taxpayer has two methods by which they can pay tax. The first method is the individual tax counting (''menghitung pajak sendiri'') method. Using this method it was up for the individual to count the amount of tax they are to pay and to hand the tax in to tax offices. The second method is the non-individual tax counting (''menghitung pajak orang lain'') method. In this method an individual was appointed by the Head of the Tax Inspection to count and pay the taxes of other individuals. If the individual counting the tax abused their position, they could be subject to a fine of paying 100% tax . Under this system, the roles of a tax officials are reduced to giving information and making sure that the amount of tax that has been paid is accurate.

===Monetary Policy===

===Agriculture===
With agricultural production still not functioning at maximum capacity, Suharto had to make do with ensuring that the supply of [[rice]] and the stability of price was guaranteed. On 10 May 1967, Suharto formed the Logistics Affairs Agency (Bulog), to look after these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
 |url = http://www.bulog.co.id/sejarah.php
 |title =  Sejarah: Bulog Sebelum Menjadi Perum
 |publisher = Bulog
 |accessdate = 2007-11-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its position was further strengthened when Suharto named it as the single purchasing agency for rice with Bank Indonesia as the single financing agency. Bulog immediately set a target of purchasing 597,000 tonnes of rice for the year but would delay when it comes to purchasing rice, preferring instead to wait until harvest season to make their purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crouch |first= Harold |title= The Army and Politics in Indonesia  |year= 1978 |pages= 279}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the year’s harvest was bad and from September 1967 onwards there was a shortage of rice. Although the bad harvest meant that Bulog was unable to fulfill its target purchase, it had 280,000 tonnes of rice under its control. Nevertheless, instead of sending its supply of rice to the market, Bulog focused instead on distributing rice to members of ABRI and the [[civil service]]. With high demand and no step being taken on the supply side, the price of rice had nowhere to go but up, its high price causing discontent within the population towards the end of the year.

On 8 July 1967, the DPR passed the Guidelines for [[Animal Husbandry]] and Health Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the year 1967, Indonesia was able to earn $770 million from its exports although it would spend $805 million from its imports and thus, running a trade deficit.

In earning $770 million from exports, $244 million was earned from exporting [[petroleum]] whilst $526 million was earned from non-petroleum exports.  These non-petroleum exports included [[timber]], [[rubber]], [[coffee]], [[tin]], [[palm oil]], [[tea]], [[tobacco]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[copra]], and [[palm oil|palm seeds]]. Timber was the highest non-petroleum export, raking in $227.8 million. In spending $805 million on imports, $68 million was spent on petroleum whilst $737 million was spent on non-petroleum imports. Some of the non-petroleum imports included rice, [[flour]], [[fertilizers]], [[cement]], [[paper]], [[iron]], [[steel]], [[tractors]], and [[aircraft]]. For the most part, the imports were raw materials which constituted 36.6% of the imports followed by consumption goods on 35.8% and capital goods on 27.6%.

===Natural Resources===

====Mining====
Mining, both for oil and mineral resources alike, received legal recognition under the Guidelines of Mining Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Under this law, the private enterprises are to pay fees for the contract, exploration, and exploitation to the Government who in turn will hand it over to the Provincial and Regency Governments to be used for development. The importance of petroleum quickly become apparent by the fact that it was Indonesia's top export earner for the year 1967, bringing in $770 million's worth of revenue.

====Forestry====
In the field of forestry, the DPR passed the Guidelines of Forestry Law on 24 May 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto set down the conditions for the private enterprises; first was that they would have to pay license fees and secondly, they would have to pay royalties to the Government based on the amount of forest that they intended to make a profit from. As part of the policy, Suharto regulated that the region from which the forest was exploited will have first priority in receiving the money made from the two fees for the purpose of regional development.

===Investment and Foreign Aid===
At the beginning of 1967, the Government passed the Foreign Investment Law. By the end of 1967, 23 projects with the backing of foreign capital was approved: 14 direct investments, 8 joint ventures, and 1 working contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another investment law, this time directed towards domestic investors, was also in the process of being formulated.

Starting from February 1967, the Government began receiving aid from a group of donor nations and or organizations called the Inter Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI). IGGI consisted of [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United States]], [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[United Nations Development Program]], and the [[World Bank]]. In 1967, the Government received $675.4 million in aid; comprising credit, food aid, infrastructural aid, and technical aid.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;
With regards to the Communist Bloc, the nations from which Sukarno had already borrowed heavily during his presidency, Suharto wanted Indonesia to settle all of its debts plus interest although debts would still be rescheduled. Starting from mid September to early October 1967, protocols on debt rescheduling were agreed upon and signed between Indonesia and the Governments of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the previous Government already had its own Cooperatives Law which was passed in 1965, the Suharto Government viewed it as a law that politicized cooperatives. By requirement of the Sukarno-era legislation, a cooperative had to represent nationalist, religious, and communist elements in the adoption of Sukarno’s Nationalism, Religion, and Communism ([[Nasakom]]) concept and cooperatives was required to view itself as an equipment of the revolution. The new law placed cooperatives back as a purely economic institution and to undo the previous cooperatives law, does not approve of discrimination based on political beliefs amongst its leadership. The new law also called for the Government to guide, assist, supervise and protect cooperatives in its policies. This in effect, gives the Government authority over cooperatives although considerable autonomy was still given to the cooperatives.

==Social issues==

===Health===
As acting president, Suharto had already begun to take steps to show that he wanted to adopt [[family planning]] as Government policy on a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;The policy having originally being adopted by Governor Ali Sadikin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he signed the UN Declaration on Population and had already taken steps to implement [[family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography |year= 2001  |pages= 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1967, 6,456 people had participated in the family planning program (KB) with the infrastructural backing of 116 KB clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Veterans affairs===
On 7 August 1967, the DPR passed the Veterans of the Republic of Indonesia Law. The law outlines not only the criteria for being a veteran but also their privileges; including receiving preference should a veteran apply to be a [[civil service|civil servant]] in government, being allowed to go back to their old civilian jobs after they finished their service, and to receive skills education from the Government before they return to full civilian life. The law also called on the Government to ensure the veterans’ social security through grants. The law granted the [[Veterans’ Legion of Indonesia]], the national organization for veterans' affairs established in 1957, its own charter and a revised organization and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Chinese Indonesians===
By the end of the acting presidency, the Suharto Government had taken measures to suppress the cultural life of its [[Chinese Indonesian]] citizens. The policies that were adopted include the non-recognition of Confucianism as a religion, banning Chinese holidays such as the [[Chinese New Year]], banning Chinese newspapers, banning Chinese schools, and banning the usage and teaching of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Press Council was an institution designed to assist the Government in developing and fostering the Indonesian media. The Press Council was to be chaired by the Minister of Information.

Towards the end of 1967, the Government also moved to regulate amateur radio broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Telecommunication Law of 1964 had promised punishment to anyone who was illegally owning radio transmitters, amateur radio stations had begun forming after G30S as a form of political dissent against the then Sukarno Government and had become quite popular as a hobby. The Government regulated that amateur radio stations would be allowed to continue provided that the broadcasters get a permit from the Government (thru the Ministry of Information) before broadcasting and that they join a national amateur radio organization.

==Bureaucracy==
As acting president, Suharto began taking steps to reform the bureaucracy by forming a taskforce called the Team Assisting the President for the Ordering of Government Apparatus and Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Election to the presidency==
The failure to hold a legislative election by 5 July 1968 meant that a new People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) would not be able to form which also meant that a new President and Vice President could not be elected through an MPR General Session. For Suharto, this meant that the length of his term as acting president was in doubt. Wishing to solidify his position, Suharto used the DPR to lobby the MPRS to hold a General Session.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 165"&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography |year= 2001  |pages= 165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPRS Leadership agreed and scheduled a General Session to be held in late March. The General Session was opened on 21 March 1968 and the first matter that it turned to was the Legislative Election. The MPRS quickly passed a resolution, setting 5 July 1971 as the new deadline for the Legislative Election.

When the MPRS turned its attention to the presidency, Suharto faced an obstacle in the form of MPRS Chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution]]. Nasution was of the opinion that Suharto should deliver an accountability speech before going on to run for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion did not gain momentum and Nasution was forced to let the matter go. On 27 March 1968, Suharto was officially elected to a full five-year term; in the process officially becoming President of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 165"/&gt; Nasution's advice, however, would only be materialized almost at the end of his first term, when he gave such an address on the 1971 General Session of the MPR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">In computer hardware, '''active hard-drive protection''' refers to technology that attempts to avoid or reduce mechanical damage to [[hard disk drive]]s by preparing the disk prior to impact. This approach is mainly used in [[laptop computer]]s that are frequently carried around and more prone to impacts than [[desktop computer]]s.

== Implementation ==
Usually the system consists of [[accelerometer]]s that alert the system when excess acceleration or vibration is detected. The software then tells the hard disk to unload its [[read-write head|heads]] to prevent them from coming in contact with the [[hard-disk platter|platter]], thus potentially preventing [[head crash]].&lt;ref name="anandtech-hdaps"&gt;{{cite news |date=2003-10-07 |first=Andrew |last=Ku |title=IBM ThinkVantage Technologies: Hard Drive Active Protection |publisher=[[AnandTech]] |url=http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.aspx?i=1893&amp;p=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many laptop vendors have implemented this technology under different names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Just Add Wheels: Leveraging Commodity Laptop Hardware for Robotics and AI Education |date=2008 |url=http://robotics.usc.edu/~jonathsk/research/publications/2008_Kelly_Wheels.pdf |quote=At least three different manufacturers now offer models with built-in accelerometers: The Apple Sudden Motion Sensor, IBM HD Active Protection System and Acer GraviSense }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hard-disk drives also include this technology, needing no cooperation from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Free Fall Sensor and WD Drives Includes This Feature|url=http://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6544/~/what-is-a-free-fall-sensor-and-which-wd-drives-include-this-feature%3F|website=WDC.CustHelp.com|publisher=[[Western Digital]]|date=2012-01-19|accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adiante - Galician Revolutionary Youth''' (''Adiante-Mocidade Revolucionaria Galega'', in [[Galician language]]) was a youth organization in [[Galicia (Spain)]] with a [[Galician nationalism|Galician independentist]] and [[communist]] ideology. According to themselves Adiante was "an autonomous youth assembliary organization, that embraced the diversity of the [[Galician people|Galician]] youth problems from the perspective of national and social liberation, with the strategic horizon the construction of an [[Independence|independent]], [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20131111152354/http://www.adiantegz.org/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=27&lt;/ref&gt;"

==History==
Adiante starts to set in open assemblies meetings that took place on the eve of July 25, 2003, date on which is celebrated annually on "National Day of Galicia" ([[Día Nacional de Galicia]]). After a series of time converging in several movements (as combating LOU, [[Nunca Máis|Prestige]], against the [[war in Iraq]]...), young people who had the project in mind Adiante called for October 9, 2004 the Constituent Assembly, which took place in [[Santiago de Compostela]].

Since then, Adiante participated in many social causes: [[feminism]] (mobilized annually on 8 March and 25 November), solidarity with other nations ([[Cuba]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Venezuela]], [[Euskal Herria]], etc.) and, most recently, participating in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Spain)|European elections in 2009]] in the candidacy [[Iniciativa Internacionalista]] (II-SP), along with other [[Galician nationalism|galician nationalist]] organizations.

On November 11, 2013, in a statement posted on its website and related virtual media of the [[Galician nationalism|nationalist]] [[Left-wing politics|left]], announced its self-dissolution. Some members of Adiante would later found [[Xeira]], as the new [[Youth wing|youth]] of the [[Galician People's Front|FPG]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galiciaconfidencial.com/nova/16992.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other militants of Adiante chose not to join [[Xeira]] and in late 2014 formed a new youth group with independents and exmilitants of the [[Assembleia da Mocidade Independentista]], with the name [[Terra (youth organization)|Terra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diarioliberdade.org/galiza/resenhas/53278-rabia,-firmeza-e-ilusi%C3%B3n-transformadora-nace-terra,-organizaci%C3%B3n-aut%C3%B3noma-da-mocidade-galega.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6264">'''''Anthypatos''''' ({{lang-gr|ἀνθύπατος}}) is the translation in [[Greek language|Greek]] of the Latin ''[[proconsul]]''. In the [[Greek East and Latin West|Greek-speaking East]], it was used to denote this office in Roman and early Byzantine times, surviving as an administrative office until the 9th century. Thereafter, and until the 11th century, it became a senior [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|court dignity]]. 

==History and functions==
===Gubernatorial title===
The title of ''anthypatos'' was the traditional Greek translation for the [[Latin]] title of ''[[proconsul]]''.{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=68}} Under the [[Principate]], the title of ''anthypatos''/''proconsul'' had been borne by all governors of a [[senatorial province]], irrespective of whether they had previously been [[Roman consul|consuls]], but after the reforms of [[Diocletian]] ({{reign|284–305}}), there were only two: the governors of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], [[Africa Proconsularis|Africa]]. The ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' of {{circa|400}}, on the other hand, mentions three, with the proconsuls of Africa (''Pars Occ''. XVIII) and Asia (''Pars Or.'' XX) being joined by the proconsul of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea or Hellas]] (''Pars Or.'' XXI).{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=68}} To them was added [[Constantinople]] after it became the imperial capital in 330, and until 359, when the post was replaced by an [[urban prefect]], similar and equal to [[Rome]].{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=68}} 

Following the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], only the proconsuls of Achaea and Asia remained, until the reforms of [[Justinian I]] ({{reign|527–565}}) in the 530s: Justinian merged provinces together and reunited civil and military authority in them under the same person, to whom he gave the rank of ''anthypatos''/''proconsul'', or the title of ''[[praetor]]'' with a proconsular rank. Such provinces were [[Armenia Prima]], [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], and [[Palaestina Prima]].{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=68}} According to the contemporary official and writer [[Peter the Patrician]], the ''anthypatoi'' are equated the augustal governors of [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], and equal of rank with the ''[[comites consistoriales]]''.{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=68}} When Africa was recovered in the [[Vandalic War]] (533–534), the proconsular governor was not restored; instead a ''[[consularis]]'' was appointed.{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=69}}

After the establishment of the ''[[Theme (country subdivision)|themata]]'' in the 7th century, the title was used within the context of the thematic structure: thematic ''[[eparch|eparchoi]] kai anthypatoi'' ("eparchs and proconsuls") are still in evidence in Asia Minor until the early 9th century, functioning as civil governors, possibly under the authority of the (much reduced in power) [[praetorian prefect]] in Constantinople.{{sfn|Haldon|1997|pp=202–203}} However, with the progressive unification of civil and military power in the hands of the thematic ''[[strategos]]'', by the reign of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829–842}}) the title of ''anthypatos'' had become a simple court dignity.{{sfn|Guilland|1967|pp=69–71}}

===Court dignity===
[[Theophanes the Confessor]] records that Emperor Theophilos honoured [[Alexios Mosele (Caesar)|Alexios Mousele]], the husband of his daughter Maria, by naming him "''[[patrikios]]'' and ''anthypatos''", raising him above the ordinary patricians.{{sfn|Bury|1911|pp=28–29}} This change coincided with the abolition of the last vestiges of the old Roman system, as the provincial ''anthypatoi'' as civil governors were abolished, and replaced by the ''[[strategos|stratēgos]]'' of the ''thema'', and in their role as overseers of army provisioning and financial matters, by the much less prestigious ''[[protonotarios|prōtonotarioi]]''.{{sfn|Haldon|1997|p=204}}

Thus, from the latter part of [[Michael III]]'s reign (842–867), the term became a regular dignity intended for "bearded men" (i.e. non-[[eunuch]]s), constituting a class above the ''patrikioi''.{{sfn|Bury|1911|pp=28–29}} The full title ''anthypatos kai patrikios'' was henceforth conferred upon several high-ranking administrative and military officials throughout the 10th and 11th centuries. In the 11th century, there is also evidence of a '''''prōtanthypatos''''' (πρωτανθύπατος, "first ''anthypatos''"), and a single occurrence of a '''''disanthypatos''''' (δισανθύπατος, "twice ''anthypatos''"). All these dignities disappeared, however, in the early 12th century.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=111}}

According to the ''[[Kletorologion|Klētorologion]]'' of Philotheos, written in 899, the insignia of office of the ''anthypatos'' were purple inscribed [[clay tablet|tablets]]. Their award by the Byzantine emperor signified the elevation of the recipient to the office.{{sfn|Bury|1911|p=22}}

The '''2009 [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] protests''' were a series of protests which occurred on 27 December 2009 in [[Iran]] against the outcome of the June [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]], which demonstrators claim was [[electoral fraud|rigged]]. The demonstrations were part of the [[2009 Iranian election protests]] and were the largest since June. In December 2009, the protests saw an escalation in violence.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,669317,00.html | author=Ulrike Putz| title= Violence in Tehran; Iranian Demonstrators Put Regime on the Defensive |publisher=Spiegel International |date=29 December 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/december-18-marked-the-beginning.html |title=Ashura 101 – Tehran Bureau &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/ashura-videos.html |title=Ashura videos [Graphic&amp;#93; – Tehran Bureau &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this protest, [[December 30, 2009 pro-government rally in Iran|pro-government protesters hold a rally]] in a "show of force" three days later on December 30 (9 [[Dey (month)|Dey]]) to condemn Green Movement protester.&lt;ref name="Al-monitor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karami|first1=Arash|title=Iran marks anniversary of anti-Green Movement protests|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/12/iran-anti-green-movement-protest-anniversary.html|accessdate=January 12, 2017|agency=Al-Monitor|date=December 30, 2014|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Irregularities during the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential election]] caused resentment among many Iranians. While post-election protests were mostly peaceful, some violence erupted, leading to clashes between security forces and protesters, while some outspoken political dissenters were detained.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, Opposition leaders detained in Iran, 19 June 2009 [https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/opposition-leaders-detained-in-iran-20090619]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dissenters continued to speak out against the Government, leading to further protests in December 2009. On 19 December 2009, the Grand Ayatollah [[Hossein Ali Montazeri]], who had become a "spiritual leader" of the opposition, died. Montazeri's funeral, held on 21 December in the city of [[Qom]], was attended by a large gathering of people&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; and clashes ensued between security forces and mourners,&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; leading on to further demonstrations in Qom and [[Isfahan]].&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; On 26 December, a paramilitary [[Basij]] force subordinate to the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] stormed a mosque in [[Tehran]] where scholar and former [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mohammad Khatami]] was speaking.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; This was followed by continued clashes in Tehran in which ''Jaras'', a news media of the critics, estimated eight to ten people had died.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;

Prior to [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], Mohsen Kadivar said he could not "rule out the possibility" of state intervention in the planned protests.&lt;ref name=spiegel-2/&gt;

===Protests===

On 27 December, demonstrations in several cities continued into the holy day of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] the climax of [[Muharram]], the month of mourning. Protesters in Tehran gathered "From Imam Hussain Square to Freedom Square", "from east to west along Revolution Street", and it was on this day that "the political and religious symbology of Iran's Islamic regime was turned on its head".&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt;  The protesters made another symbolic move- a "symbolic journey from a square named after its most revered hero toward a monument dedicated to freedom, along a street called Revolution."&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt;

[[Death of Seyed Ali Mousavi|Seyed Ali Mousavi]], the 35-year-old nephew of [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], was among those killed in the violence.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=time.com/&gt; Later, it was reported that his body had disappeared, precluding the possibility of a quick burial, while state sources indicated that an autopsy was being performed.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8432297.stm | author=BBC| title=Iran opposition figures arrested after protests|publisher=BBC| date=28 December 2009|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mousavi was buried on 30 December.&lt;ref name=aad/&gt;

Similar protests took place in other Iranian cities including [[Isfahan]], [[Najafabad]], [[Shiraz]], [[Mashhad]], [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], [[Tabriz]], [[Babol]], [[Ardabil]] and [[Orumieh]].&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-government protests turn deadly in Tehran|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6562649.ece|last=Erdbrink|first=Thomas|work=Washington Post|location=Washington D.C., US |date=27 December 2009|accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; Four people were reportedly killed in [[Tabriz]], in north western Iran on 27 December, and one in Shiraz in the south of Iran.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protesters killed, including Mousavi's nephew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8431523.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=27 December 2009|accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|title= Police Are Said to Have Killed 10 in Iran Protests  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/world/middleeast/28iran.html|last= Robert F.

==Analysis==
{{POV-section|date=June 2017}}
According to Ibrahim Moussawi, associate professor of [[Lebanese University]] and head of [[Hizbullah]]'s media relations, the incident damaged "public relations" of the Green Movement with Iranian citizenry more than all events as the acts of the protesters on that day including "applauding, whistling, and engaging in other cheerful displays," was "widely" seen as violation of a "red line" and targeting [[Husayn ibn Ali]] and [[Day of Ashura|Ashura commemoration]] itself.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"/&gt; Various society groups including "[[Marja'|marej-'e taqlid]], the society of Iranian doctors, university student groups, the Iranian Parliament, Oil Industry Workers, the Iranian Women's Culture and Education Society, the Society of Iranian Teachers, the Iranian Professors Society, provincial governors and municipalities and [[bazaar]]s" expressed their condemnation and many of them publicly asked for the "prosecution of the opposition leaders".&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moussawi|first1=Ibrahim|title=Shi&amp;‘ism and the Democratisation Process in Iran: With a focus on Wilayat al-Faqih|publisher=Saqi|isbn=9780863568312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kAhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=Desecration+of+Ashura+2009+protest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n50eaC439t&amp;sig=Ohsem0SVCFkGQXFkH_x5B7ACrfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG2KHG0r3RAhWGYJoKHVrxDCEQ6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Desecration%20of%20Ashura%202009%20protest&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
Many people are set to stand trial for taking part in the protests. At least one person arrested in connection with the protest, a university lecturer [[Abdolreza Ghanbari]] living in [[Pakdasht]], has been accused of "[[moharebeh]]," (an Islamic term meaning "warring against God") and sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.labourstart.org/cgi-bin/solidarityforever/show_campaign.cgi?c=1299 |title=Iran: Stop the execution of Abdolreza Ghanbari |publisher=labourstart.org |year=2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011500705.html|title=Iran to try 16 people soon over December unrest: report|work=Washington Post|accessdate=16 January 2010}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
The governments of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States are among those who have condemned the violence.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; [[POTUS|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] openly criticized the Iranian government's violent crackdown on the protests in a speech and declared "The decision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not continue."&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;  Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concern at the violence. It encouraged "a compromise on the basis of the law, and also to take political efforts to prevent a further escalation of the confrontation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091228/157405302.html |title=Russia voices concern over Tehran unrest &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela condemned what it called Western governments' interference in Iran's internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/31/content_12732931.htm |title=Venezuela blames U.S. for destabilizing Iran_English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogans==
Since the protest coincided with [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], the commemoration observed by Shi'as for the death of [[Imam Hussein]], the third Imam of Shia's who were killed by the order of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Yazid I]], protesters deliberately blended their political message with the Ashura's religious one in this protest. They alternated anti-government slogans with ancient cries of mourning for [[Imam Hussein]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

*"This is a month of blood. The dictator will fall"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Protesters equated [[Ayatollah Khamenei]] with [[Yazid I]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] who ordered Imam Hussein's killing.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;
*"Death to the dictator"&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;
* "Death to Khamenei"&lt;ref name=time.com&gt;{{cite news|title=On a Holy Day, Protest and Carnage in Tehran|author=TIME Staff |date=28 December 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1950176,00.html|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Dutch Municipalities''' ({{lang-nl|Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten}} or '''VNG''') was established in 1912 by 28 Dutch cities, at a time when the number of tasks delegated to municipalities saw a rapid increase. As a result of this increase, there was a greater need for information, exchange of experiences, and for an organisation that could represent the interests of its members at a central government level.

The Association of Dutch Municipalities is located in [[The Hague]] and it represents the interests of all 403&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/methoden/classificaties/overzicht/gemeentelijke-indeling/2014/default.htm |title = Gemeentelijke indeling op 1 januari 2014 |trans-title=Municipalities on 1 January 2014 |language = Dutch |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 1 January 2014 |work = CBS Classifications |publisher = [[Statistics Netherlands|CBS]] |accessdate = 7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|Dutch municipalities]] vis-a-vis central government.

The '''Soviet Union''' enforced the '''collectivization''' ({{lang-ru|Коллективизация}}) of its [[agricultural sector]] between 1928 and 1940 (in West - between 1948 and 1952) during the ascendancy of [[Joseph Stalin]]. It began during and was part of the [[first five-year plan]]. The policy aimed to consolidate individual landholdings and labour into [[collective farms]]: mainly ''[[kolkhoz]]y'' and ''[[sovkhoz]]y''. The Soviet [[leadership]] confidently expected that the replacement of individual peasant farms by collective ones would immediately increase the food supply for the urban population, the supply of raw materials for processing industry, and agricultural exports. Planners regarded collectivization as the solution to the crisis of agricultural distribution (mainly in grain deliveries) that had developed from 1927.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, Martin, ''Stalin and Stalinism'', p.25, Longman Group, England, {{ISBN|0-582-27658-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This problem became more acute as the [[Soviet Union]] pressed ahead with its [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|ambitious industrialization program]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, R.W., ''The Soviet Collective Farms, 1929–1930,'' Macmillan, London (1980), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s over 91% of agricultural land became "collectivized" as rural households entered collective farms with their land, livestock, and other assets. The sweeping collectivization often involved tremendous human and social costs. Recent historians have estimated the death toll in the range of six to 13 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constantin Iordachi|author2=Arnd Bauerkamper|title=The Collectivization of Agriculture in Communist Eastern Europe: Comparison and Entanglements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84Z2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=2014|publisher=Central European University Press|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}

==Background==
After the [[emancipation of the serfs in 1861]], peasants gained control of about half of the land they had previously cultivated, and began to ask for the redistribution of all land.&lt;ref name = "kenez"&gt;A History of the Soviet Union from  Beginning to End. Kenez, Peter. Cambridge University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Stolypin reform|Stolypin agricultural reforms]] between 1905 and 1914 gave incentives for the creation of large farms, but these ended during [[World War I]]. The [[Russian Provisional Government]] accomplished little during the difficult [[World War I]] months, though Russian leaders continued to promise redistribution. Peasants began to turn against the Provisional Government and organized themselves into land committees, which together with the traditional [[Mir (social)|peasant communes]] became a powerful force of opposition. When [[Vladimir Lenin]] returned to Russia on April 16, 1917, he promised the people "Peace, Land and Bread," the latter two appearing as a promise to the peasants for the redistribution of confiscated land and a fair share of food for every worker respectively.

During the period of [[war communism]], however, the policy of ''[[Prodrazvyorstka]]'' meant that the peasantry was obligated to surrender the surpluses of almost any kind of agricultural produce for a fixed price. When the [[Russian Civil War]] ended, the economy changed with the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) and specifically, the policy of ''[[prodnalog]]'' or "food tax." This new policy was designed to re-build morale among embittered farmers and lead to increased production.

The pre-existing communes, which periodically redistributed land, did little to encourage improvement in technique, and formed a source of power beyond the control of the Soviet government. Although the income gap between wealthy and poor farmers did grow under the NEP, it remained quite small, but the [[Bolsheviks]] began to take aim at the wealthy ''[[kulak]]s.'' Clearly identifying this group was difficult, though, since only about 1% of the peasantry employed laborers (the basic [[Marxism|Marxist]] definition of a [[Capitalism|capitalist]]), and 82% of the country's population were peasants.&lt;ref name = "kenez"/&gt;
[[File:Three broad categories of the peasants.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration to the Soviet categories of peasants: bednyaks, or poor peasants; serednyaks, or mid-income peasants; and [[kulak]]s, the higher-income farmers who had larger farms than most Russian peasants. Published Projector May 1926. ]]
The small shares of most of the peasants resulted in food shortages in the cities. Although grain had nearly returned to pre-war production levels, the large estates which had produced it for urban markets had been divided up.&lt;ref name = "kenez"/&gt; Not interested in acquiring money to purchase overpriced manufactured goods, the peasants chose to consume their produce rather than sell it. As a result, city dwellers only saw half the grain that had been available before the war.&lt;ref name = "kenez"/&gt; Before the revolution, peasants controlled only 2,100,000&amp;nbsp;km² divided into 16 million holdings, producing 50% of the food grown in Russia and consuming 60% of total food production. After the revolution, the peasants controlled 3,140,000&amp;nbsp;km² divided into 25 million holdings, producing 85% of the food, but consuming 80% of what they grew (meaning that they ate 68% of the total).&lt;ref&gt;page 87, Harvest of Sorrow {{ISBN|0-19-504054-6}}, Conquest cites Lewin pages 36–37 and 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] had never been happy with private agriculture and saw collectivization as the best remedy for the problem. Lenin claimed "Small-scale production gives birth to capitalism and the bourgeoisie constantly, daily, hourly, with elemental force, and in vast proportions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Fainsod | first =Merle | title =How Russia is Ruled | publisher =Harvard University Press | edition =revised | year =1970 | location =Cambridge, Mass. | pages =526}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from ideological goals, [[Joseph Stalin]] also wished to embark on a program of rapid heavy industrialization which required larger surpluses to be extracted from the agricultural sector in order to feed a growing industrial work force and to pay for imports of machinery (by exporting grain).{{sfnp|Fainsod|1970|p=529}} Social and ideological goals would also be served through mobilization of the peasants in a co-operative economic enterprise which would produce higher returns for the State and could serve a secondary purpose of providing social services to the people.

==Crisis of 1928==
{{main|Soviet grain procurement crisis of 1928}}

This demand for more grain resulted in the reintroduction of requisitioning which was resisted in rural areas. In 1928 there was a 2-million-ton shortfall in grains purchased by the Soviet Union from neighbouring markets. Stalin claimed the grain had been produced but was being hoarded by "kulaks." Instead of raising the price, the [[Politburo]] adopted an emergency measure to requisition 2.5 million tons of grain.

The seizures of grain discouraged the peasants and less grain was produced during 1928, and again the government resorted to requisitions, much of the grain being requisitioned from middle peasants as sufficient quantities were not in the hands of the "[[kulak]]s." In 1929, especially after the introduction of the [[Ural-Siberian Method]] of grain procurement, resistance to grain seizures became widespread with some violent incidents of resistance. Also,  massive hoarding (burial was the common method) and illegal transfers of grain took place. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Faced with the refusal to hand grain over, a decision was made at a plenary session of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] in November 1929 to embark on a nationwide program of collectivization.

Several forms of [[collective farming]] were suggested by the [[Sovnarkom|People's Commissariat for Agriculture (Narkomzem)]], distinguished according to the extent to which property was held in common:&lt;ref&gt;James W. Heinzen, "Inventing a Soviet Countryside: State Power and the Transformation of Rural Russia, 1917–1929", University of Pittsburgh Press (2004) {{ISBN|0-8229-4215-1}}, Chapter 1, "A False Start: The Birth and Early Activities of the People's Commissariat of Agriculture, 1917–1920"&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Association for Joint Cultivation of Land]] (Товарищество по совместной обработке земли, '''ТОЗ'''/'''TOZ'''), where only land was in common use;
*agricultural ''[[artel]]'' (initially in a loose meaning, later formalized to become an organizational basis of kolkhozes, via ''The Standard Statute of an Agricultural Artel'' adopted by [[Sovnarkom]] in March 1930);
*[[agricultural commune]], with the highest level of common use of resources.
Also, various cooperatives for processing of agricultural products were installed.

In November 1929, the [[Central Committee]] decided to implement accelerated collectivization in the form of [[kolkhoz]]es and [[sovkhoz]]es. This marked the end of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which had allowed peasants to sell their surpluses on the open market.  Stalin had many so-called "[[kulaks]]" transported to collective farms in distant places to work in agricultural labor camps. In response to this, many peasants began to resist, often arming themselves against the activists sent from the towns. As a form of protest, many peasants preferred to slaughter their animals for food rather than give them over to collective farms, which produced a major reduction in livestock.

Collectivization had been encouraged since the revolution, but in 1928, only about one percent of farm land was collectivized, and despite efforts to encourage and coerce collectivization, the rather optimistic [[first five-year plan]] only forecast 15 percent of farms to be run collectively.&lt;ref name = "kenez"/&gt;

==All-out drive, winter 1929–30==
[[File:Yakov Yakovlev. People's Commissar for Agriculture. USSR 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Yakov Yakovlev]], People's Commissar for Agriculture appointed in 1929|215x215px]]
The situation changed incredibly quickly in the fall of 1929 and winter of 1930. Between September and December 1929, collectivization increased from 7.4% to 15%, but in the first two months of 1930, 11 million households joined collectivized farms, pushing the total to nearly 60% almost overnight.

To assist collectivization, the Party decided to send 25,000 "socially conscious" industry workers to the countryside. This was accomplished during 1929–1933, and these workers have become known as [[twenty-five-thousander]]s ("dvadtsat'pyat'tysyachniki"). [[Shock brigade]]s were used to force reluctant peasants into joining the collective farms and remove those who were declared [[kulak]]s and their "agents".

Collectivization sought to modernize Soviet agriculture, consolidating the land into parcels that could be farmed by modern equipment using the latest scientific methods of agriculture. It was often claimed that an American [[Fordson tractor]] (called "Фордзон" in Russian) was the best propaganda in favor of collectivization. The Communist Party, which adopted the plan in 1929, predicted an increase of 330% in industrial production, and an increase of 50% in agricultural production.

The [[means of production]] (land, equipment, livestock) were to be totally "socialized", i.e. removed from the control of individual peasant households.  Not even private [[Household plot|household garden plots]] were allowed.

Agricultural work was envisioned on a mass scale.  Huge glamorous columns of machines were to work the fields, in total contrast to peasant small-scale work.

The peasants traditionally mostly held their land in the form of large numbers of strips scattered throughout the fields of the village community.  By an order of 7 January 1930, "all boundary lines separating the land allotments of the members of the artel are to be eliminated and all fields are to be combined in a single land mass."  The basic rule governing the rearrangement of the fields was that the process would have to be completed before the spring planting.&lt;ref&gt;James R Millar, ed., ''The Soviet Rural Community'' (University of Illinois Press, 1971), pp.27–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[kolkhoz]]y were initially envisioned as giant organizations unrelated to the preceding village communities.  Kolkhozy of tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of hectares were envisioned in schemes which were later to become known as [[gigantomania]].  They were planned to be "divided into 'economies (''ekonomii'')' of 5,000 – 10,000 hectares which were in turn divided into fields and sections (''uchastki'') without regard to the existing villages – the aim was to achieve a 'fully depersonalized optimum land area'..."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Parallel with this were plans to transfer the peasants to centralized '[[agrotown]]s' offering modern amenities.

In the prevailing socio-economic conditions, little could become of such [[Utopia|utopian schemes]].  The giant [[kolkhozy]] were always exceptional, existing mainly on paper, and in any case they were mostly soon to disappear.  The peasants chose to remain in their traditional, primitive, villages.&lt;ref&gt;[[R W Davies]], ''The Soviet Collective Farm 1929 – 1930'' (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1980), pp.ix, 42–50, 60; cf. p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Dizzy with Success"==
The price of collectivization was so high that the March 2, 1930 issue of ''[[Pravda]]'' contained Stalin's article ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1930/03/02.htm Dizzy with success]'', in which he called for a temporary halt to the process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a fact that by February 20 of this year 50 percent of the peasant farms throughout the U.S.S.R. had been collectivized. That means that by February 20, 1930, we had ''overfulfilled'' the five-year plan of collectivization by more than 100 per cent.... some of our comrades have become dizzy with success and for the moment have lost clearness of mind and sobriety of vision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the publication of the article, the pressure for collectivization temporarily abated and peasants started leaving collective farms. According to [[Martin Kitchen]], the number of members of collective farms dropped by 50% in 1930. But soon collectivisation was intensified again, and by 1936, about 90% of Soviet agriculture was collectivized.

==Peasant resistance==
Theoretically, landless peasants were to be the biggest beneficiaries from collectivization, because it promised them an opportunity to take an equal share in labor and its rewards{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}. In fact, however, rural areas did not have many landless peasants, given the wholesale redistribution of land following the Revolution. Alternatively, for those with property, collectivization meant forfeiting land up to the collective farms and selling most of the harvest to the state at minimal prices set by the state itself. This, in turn, engendered opposition to the idea. Furthermore, collectivization involved significant changes in the traditional village life of Russian peasants within a very short time frame, despite the long Russian rural tradition of collectivism in the village ''[[obshchina]]'' or ''[[Mir (commune)|mir]]''. The changes were even more dramatic in other places, such as in Ukraine, with its tradition of individual farming, in the Soviet republics of [[Central Asia]], and in the [[trans-Volga]] [[steppe]]s, where for a family to have a herd of livestock was not only a matter of sustenance, but of pride as well.[[File:RIAN archive 79113 Seizing grain from kulaks.jpg|thumb|[[Komsomol|YCL]]ers seizing grain from "[[kulak]]s" which was hidden in the graveyard, Ukraine]]Peasants viewed collectivization as the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Viola, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin: Collectivization and the Culture of Peasant Resistance'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), 3–12.&lt;/ref&gt; By no means was joining the collective farm (also known as the [[kolkhoz]]) voluntary. The drive to collectivize came without peasant support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Fitzpatrick | first =Sheila | title =Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization | publisher =Oxford University Press | year =1994 | pages =3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to increase state grain procurements without giving the peasants the opportunity to withhold grain from the market. Collectivization would increase the total crop and food supply but the locals knew that they were not likely to benefit from it.{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=4}} Peasants tried to protest through peaceful means by speaking out at collectivization meetings and writing letters to the central authorities. When their strategies failed, villagers turned to violence: committing arson, and lynching and murdering local authorities, kolkhoz leaders, and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=234}} Others responded with acts of sabotage, including the burning of crops and the slaughter of [[draught animal]]s. According to Party sources, there were also some cases of destruction of property, and attacks on officials and members of the collectives. Isaac Mazepa, prime minister of the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] (UNR) in 1919–1920, claimed "[t]he catastrophe of 1932" was the result of "passive resistance … which aimed at the systematic frustration of the Bolsheviks' plans for the sowing and gathering of the harvest". In his words, "[w]hole tracts were left unsown,... [and as much as] 50 per cent [of the crop] was left in the fields, and was either not collected at all or was ruined in the threshing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Mazepa  | first = Isaac  | title = Ukrainia Under Bolshevist Rule  | booktitle = Slavonic Review | volume=12 |pages=342–343  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5wkJi1jvL3UC&amp;pg=PA94  | accessdate = September 15, 2010  | isbn = 9780919396517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fueled by fear and anxiety, rumors spread throughout the villages leading to these acts.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Viola. "The Peasant Nightmare: Visions of Apocalypse in the Soviet Countryside." The Journal of Modern History 62, no. 4 (1990): 751.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors associated the Soviet government with the Antichrist (godless and evil), threatened an end to traditional ways of peasant life, and worked to unite the peasants to protest against collectivization.

===Collectivization as a "second serfdom"===

Rumours circulated in the villages warning the rural residents that collectivization would bring disorder, hunger, famine, and the destruction of crops and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Readings and reinterpretations of Soviet newspapers labeled collectivization as a second [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]].{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;Viola, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Villagers were afraid the old landowners/serf owners were coming back and that the villagers joining the collective farm would face starvation and famine.{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=6}} More reason for peasants to believe collectivization was a second serfdom was that entry into the kolkhoz had been forced. Farmers did not have the right to leave the collective without permission. The level of state procurements and prices on crops also enforced the serfdom analogy. The government would take a majority of the crops and pay extremely low prices. The serfs during the 1860s were paid nothing but collectivization still reminded the peasants of serfdom.{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=129}} To them, this "second serfdom" became code for the Communist betrayal of the revolution. To the peasants, the revolution was about giving more freedom and land to the peasants, but instead they had to give up their land and livestock to the collective farm which to some extent promoted communist policies.

===Women's role in resistance===
Women were the primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "The Peasant Nightmare," 760.&lt;/ref&gt; Fears that collectivization would result in the socialization of children, the export of women's hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Viola, "Bab'i bunti and peasant women's protest during collectivization," in The Stalinist Dictatorship, ed. Chris Ward. (London; New York: Arnold, 1998), 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt; After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "The Peasant Nightmare," 765.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm "under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest."&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "Bab'i bunti," 218-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "Bab'i bunti," 224-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peasant women were rarely held accountable for their actions because of the officials' perceptions of their protests. They "physically blocked the entrances to huts of peasants scheduled to be exiled as [[kulak]]s, forcibly took back socialized seed and livestock, and led assaults on officials." Officials ran away and hid to let the riots run their course. When women came to trial, they were given less harsh punishments as the men because women, to officials, were seen as illiterate and the most backward part of the peasantry. One particular case of this was a riot in a Russian village of Belovka where protestors were beating members of the local [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] and setting fire to their homes. The men were held exclusively responsible as the main culprits. Women were given sentences to serve as a warning, not as a punishment. Because of how they were perceived, women were able to play an essential role in the resistance to collectivization.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "Bab'i bunti," 220-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious persecution===
[[File:The removal of 5000 kg bell from St Volodymyr's Cathedral Kiev USSR 1930.jpg|left|thumb|The removal of the bell from [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] Central Kiev USSR 1930|239x239px]]
Collectivization did not just entail the acquisition of land from farmers but also the closing of churches, burning of icons, and the arrests of priests. {{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=6}} Associating the church with the tsarist regime,{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=33}} the Soviet state continued to undermine the church through expropriations and repression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Viola, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; They cut off state financial support to the church and secularized church schools.{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=33}} Peasants began to associate Communists with atheists because the attack on the church was so devastating.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Communist assault on religion and the church angered many peasants, giving them more reason to revolt. Riots exploded after the closing of churches as early as 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, ''Peasant Rebels under Stalin'', 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of Soviet power with the [[Antichrist]] also decreased peasant support for the Soviet regime. Rumors about religious persecution spread mostly by word of mouth, but also through leaflets and proclamations.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "The Peasant nightmare," 762.&lt;/ref&gt; Priests preached that the Antichrist had come to place "the Devil's mark" on the peasants.{{sfnp|Fitzpatrick|1994|p=45}} and that the Soviet state was promising the peasants a better life but was actually signing them up for Hell. Peasants feared that if they joined the collective farm they would be marked with the stamp of the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin'', 63.&lt;/ref&gt; They faced a choice between God and the Soviet collective farm. Choosing between salvation and damnation, peasants had no choice but to resist policies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "The Peasant nightmare," 767.&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors of the Soviet state as the Antichrist functioned to keep peasants from succumbing to the government. The attacks on religion and the Church affected women the most because they were upholders of religion within the villages.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, "Bab'i bunti", 217-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Dovzhenko|Dovzhenko]]'s film, [[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]], gives example of peasants' skepticism with collectivization on the basis that it was an attack on the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dovzhenko|first=Aleksandr|title=Earth|date=1930-10-17|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021571/|others=Stepan Shkurat, Semyon Svashenko, Yuliya Solntseva|accessdate=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

===Resistance to collectivization and consequences===
[[File:Famine en URSS 1933.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soviet famine of 1932–33]]. Areas of most disastrous famine marked with black.]]
Due to high government [[production quota]]s, peasants received, as a rule, less for their labor than they did before collectivization, and some refused to work. [[Merle Fainsod]] estimated that, in 1952, collective farm earnings were only one fourth of the cash income from private plots on Soviet collective farms.{{sfnp|Fainsod|1970|p=542}} In many cases, the immediate effect of collectivization was to reduce output and cut the number of livestock in half. The subsequent recovery of the agricultural production was also impeded by the losses suffered by the Soviet Union during [[World War II]] and the [[Famines in Russia and USSR|severe drought of 1946]]. However the largest loss of livestock was caused by collectivization for all animals except pigs.{{sfnp|Fainsod|1970|p=541}} The numbers of cows in the USSR fell from 33.2 million in 1928 to 27.8 million in 1941 and to 24.6 million in 1950. The number of pigs fell from 27.7 million in 1928 to 27.5 million in 1941 and then to 22.2 million in 1950. The number of sheep fell from 114.6 million in 1928 to 91.6 million in 1941 and to 93.6 million in 1950. The number of horses fell from 36.1 million in 1928 to 21.0 million in 1941 and to 12.7 million in 1950. Only by the late 1950s did Soviet farm animal stocks begin to approach 1928 levels.{{sfnp|Fainsod|1970|p=541}}

Despite the initial plans, collectivization, accompanied by the bad harvest of 1932–1933, did not live up to expectations. Between 1929 and 1932 there was a massive fall in agricultural production resulting in famine in the countryside. Stalin and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] blamed the prosperous peasants, referred to as '[[kulaks]]' (Russian: ''fist''), who were organizing resistance to collectivization. Allegedly, many kulaks had been hoarding grain in order to speculate on higher prices, thereby sabotaging grain collection. Stalin resolved to eliminate them as a class.

The Soviet government responded to these acts by cutting off food rations to peasants and areas where there was opposition to collectivization, especially in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]]. Many peasant families were forcibly resettled in [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] into [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|exile settlements]], and most of them died on the way. Estimates suggest that about a million so-called '[[kulak]]' families, or perhaps some 5 million people, were sent to [[Gulag|forced labor camps]].{{sfnp|Fainsod|1970|p=526}}&lt;ref name="hubbard"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hubbard | first =Leonard E. | title =The Economics of Soviet Agriculture | publisher =Macmillan and Co. | year =1939 | pages =117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1932, the ''Decree about the Protection of Socialist Property'' proclaimed that the punishment for theft of [[kolkhoz]] or cooperative property was the death sentence, which "under extenuating circumstances" could be replaced by at least ten years of incarceration. With what some called the ''[[Law of Spikelets]]'' ("Закон о колосках"), peasants (including children) who hand-collected or [[gleaned]] grain in the collective fields after the harvest were arrested for damaging the state grain production. [[Martin Amis]] writes in ''[[Koba the Dread]]'' that 125,000 sentences were passed for this particular offense in the bad harvest period from August 1932 to December 1933.

During the [[Soviet famine of 1932-33|Famine of 1932-33]] it's estimated that 7.8-8.1 million people died from starvation.&lt;ref name="McCauley"&gt;{{cite book | last =McCauley | first =Martin | title =Stalin and Stalinism | publisher =Routledge | year =2013 | page =43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is that the total death toll (both direct and indirect) for Stalin's collectivization program was on the order of 12 million people.&lt;ref name="hubbard" /&gt; It is said that in 1945, [[Joseph Stalin]] confided to [[Winston Churchill]] [[Yalta Conference|at Yalta]] that 10 million people died in the course of collectivization.&lt;ref&gt;''Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion'' by [[Helen Rappaport]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siberia===
{{main|History of Siberia}}
Since the second half of the 19th century, [[Siberia]] had been a major agricultural region within Russia, espеcially its southern territories (nowadays [[Altai Krai]], [[Omsk Oblast]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast]], [[Kemerovo Oblast]], [[Khakassia]], [[Irkutsk Oblast]]). [[Stolypin reform|Stolypin's program]] of resettlement granted a lot of land for immigrants from elsewhere in the empire, creating a large portion of well-off peasants and stimulating rapid agricultural development in 1910s. Local merchants exported large quantities of labeled grain, flour and butter into central Russia and Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berdsk.ru/history5.shtml Commerce in the Siberian town of Berdsk, early 20th century.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041224204110/http://www.berdsk.ru/history5.shtml |date=2004-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 1931, a special resolution of the Western-Siberian Regional Executive Committee (classified "top secret") ordered the expropriation of property and the deportation of 40,000 [[kulak]]s to "sparsely populated and unpopulated" areas in [[Tomsk Oblast]] in the northern part of the Western-Siberian region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrono.info/dokum/193_dok/19310505kolh.html Western-Siberian resolution of deportation of 40,000 kulaks to northern Siberia, May 5, 1931.]&lt;!--auditorium.ru does not seem to exist as of June 2008!

It has since been perceived by historians such as [[Lynne Viola]] as a Civil War of peasant against Bolshevik Government and the attempted colonisation of the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, Lynne, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin: Collectivization and the Culture of Peasant Resistance,'' Oxford University Press, Oxford (1996), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Asia and Kazakhstan===

In areas where the major agricultural activity was nomadic herding, collectivization met with massive resistance and major losses and confiscation of livestock. Livestock in [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] fell from 7 million cattle to 1.6 million and from 22 million sheep to 1.7 million. Restrictions on migration proved ineffective and half a million migrated to other regions of Central Asia and 1.5 million to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last= Courtois| editor-first = Stéphane | title=[[The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression]]| publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1999| isbn=0-674-07608-7 | page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who remained, as many as a million died in the resulting famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Pannier | first =Bruce | title =Kazakhstan: The Forgotten Famine | publisher =Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty | date =28 December 2007 | url =http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/12/c58914de-953d-4dec-ab7c-16d7d9fb9a00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], a so-called 'Soviet dependency', attempted collectivization was abandoned in 1932 after the loss of 8 million head of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Conquest | first =Robert | title =Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine | chapter =Central Asia and the Kazakh Tragedy |pages =189–198| publisher =Oxford University Press | date =9 October 1986 | isbn =0-19-504054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
{{See also|Holodomor|Collectivization in the Ukrainian SSR}}

Most historians agree that the disruption caused by collectivization and the resistance of the peasants significantly contributed to the Great Famine of 1932–1933, especially in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], a region famous for its rich soil ([[black earth region|chernozem]]). This particular period is called "[[Holodomor]]" in Ukrainian. During the similar famines of 1921–1923, numerous campaigns – inside the country, as well as internationally – were held to raise money and food in support of the population of the affected regions. Nothing similar was done during the drought of 1932–1933, mainly because the information about the disaster was suppressed by Stalin.{{sfnp|The Black Book of Communism|1995|p=159}} Stalin also undertook a purge of the Ukrainian communists and intelligentsia, with devastating long-term effects on the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Ukrainian Famine | work =Excerpts from the Original Electronic Text at the web site of Revelations from the Russian Archives (Library of Congress) | publisher =Hanover College | url =http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111famine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Ukrainian villages were blacklisted and penalized by government decree for perceived sabotage of food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Grain Problem | work =Addendum to the minutes of Politburo [meeting] No. 93 | publisher =Library of Congress  | date =6 December 1932 | url =https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/k2grain.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, migration of population from the affected areas was restricted.{{sfnp|The Black Book of Communism|1995|p=164}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Revelations from the Russian Archives: Ukrainian Famine | publisher = Library of Congress | url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/ukra.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stalin in his conversation with the prize-winning writer [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], the famine was caused by the excesses of local party workers and sabotage,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I've thanked you for the letters, as they expose a sore in our Party-Soviet work and show how our workers, wishing to curb the enemy, sometimes unwittingly hit friends and descend to sadism. ... the esteemed grain-growers of your district (and not only of your district alone) carried on an 'Italian strike' (sabotage!) and were not loath to leave the workers and the Red Army without bread. That the sabotage was quiet and outwardly harmless (without blood) does not change the fact that the esteemed grain-growers waged what was in fact a 'quiet' war against Soviet power. A war of starvation, dear com[rade] Sholokhov. This, of course, can in no way justify the outrages, which, as you assure me, have been committed by our workers. ... And those guilty of those outrages must be duly punished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vlastitel.com.ru/stalin/reform/perepisk.html Correspondence between Joseph Stalin and Mikhail Sholokhov published in ''Вопросы истории'', 1994, № 3, с. 9–24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtois, Stéphane, Werth Nicolas , Panné Jean-Louis , Paczkowski Andrzej , Bartošek Karel , Margolin Jean-Louis  Czarna księga komunizmu.

[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|Starved peasants on a street in [[Kharkiv]], 1933]]
About 40 million people were affected by the food shortages including areas near Moscow where mortality rates increased by 50%.{{sfnp|The Black Book of Communism|1995|p=167}} The center of the famine, however, was Ukraine and surrounding regions, including the [[River Don, Russia|Don]], the [[Kuban]], the [[Northern Caucasus]] and [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] where the toll was one million dead. The countryside was affected more than cities, but 120,000 died in [[Kharkiv]], 40,000 in [[Krasnodar]] and 20,000 in [[Stavropol]].{{sfnp|The Black Book of Communism|1995|p=167}}

The declassified Soviet archives show that there were 1.54 million officially registered deaths in Ukraine from famine.&lt;ref name="davies and wheatcroft"&gt;{{cite book | last =Wheatcroft  | first =Stephen  | last2 =Davies | first2 =RW  | title =The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931–1933 | publisher =Palgrave MacMillan | year =2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alec Nove]] claims that registration of deaths largely ceased in many areas during the famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nove | first =Alec | chapter =Victims of Stalinism: How Many? | title =Stalinist Terror: New Perspectives | editor-last =Getty | editor-first =J.

The older version of the data showed 600,000 fewer deaths in Ukraine than the current, revised statistics.&lt;ref name="davies and wheatcroft" /&gt; In ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', the authors claim the number of dead was at least 4 million, and characterize the Great Famine as "a genocide of the Ukrainian people".{{sfnp|The Black Book of Communism|1995|p=168}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Merl | first =S. | title =Otechestvennaya istoriya | chapter =Golod 1932–1933—Genotsid Ukraintsev dlya osushchestvleniya politiki russifikatsii?

===Latvia===
After the [[Occupation of Latvia 1940-1945|Soviet Occupation of Latvia]] in June 1940, the country's new rulers were faced with a problem: the agricultural reforms of the inter-war period had expanded individual holdings. The property of "[[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]" and [[refugee]]s, as well as those above 30 hectares, was nationalised in 1940–44, but those who were still landless were then given plots of 15 hectares each. Thus, Latvian agriculture remained essentially dependent on personal smallholdings, making central planning difficult. In 1940–41 the Communist Party repeatedly said that collectivization would not occur forcibly, but rather voluntarily and by example. To encourage collectivization high taxes were enforced and new farms given no government support. But after 1945 the Party dropped its restrained approach as the voluntary approach was not yielding results. Latvians were accustomed to individual holdings (''viensētas''), which had existed even during serfdom, and for many farmers the plots awarded to them by the interwar reforms were the first their families had ever owned. Furthermore, the countryside was filled with rumours regarding the harshness of collective farm life.

Pressure from [[Moscow]] to collectivize continued and the authorities in [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] sought to reduce the number of individual farmers (increasingly labelled ''[[kulak]]i'' or ''budži'') through higher taxes and requisitioning of agricultural products for state use. The first kolkhoz was established only in November 1946 and by 1948, just 617 [[kolkhoz]]es had been established, integrating 13,814 individual farmsteads (12.6% of the total). The process was still judged too slow, and in March 1949 just under 13,000 kulak families as well as a large number of individuals were identified. Between March 24 and March 30, 1949, about 40,000&lt;!-- ±2000 --&gt; people were deported and resettled at various points throughout the USSR.

After these deportations, the pace of collectivization increased as a flood of farmers rushed into kolkhozes. Within two weeks 1740 new kolkhozes were established and by the end of 1950, just 4.5% of Latvian farmsteads remained outside the collectivized units; about 226,900 farmsteads belonged to collectives, of which there were now around 14,700. Rural life changed as farmers' daily movements were dictated to by plans, decisions and quotas formulated elsewhere and delivered through an intermediate non-farming hierarchy. The new kolkhozes, especially smaller ones, were ill-equipped and poor – at first farmers were paid once a year [[in kind]] and then in cash, but salaries were very small and at times farmers went unpaid or even ended up owing money to the kholhoz. Farmers still had small pieces of land (not larger than 0.5 ha) around their houses where they grew food for themselves. Along with collectivization, the government tried to uproot the custom of living in individual farmsteads by resettling people in villages. However this process failed due to lack of money since the Soviets planned to move houses as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Plakans | first =Andrejs | title =The Latvians: A Short History | publisher =Hoover Institution Press | year =1995 | location =Stanford | pages =155–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freibergs J."&gt;{{cite book | last =Freibergs  | first =J. | title =Jaunako laiku vesture 20. gadsimts | publisher =Zvaigzne ABC  | origyear =1998| year =2001 | isbn =9984-17-049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official numbers for collectivized area (the column with percent of sown area in collective use in the table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of sown area in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total sown area (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935–1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of kolkhoz members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) are included in the land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of sown areas.

==Decollectivization under German occupation==
During [[World War II]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], in his capacity as the Reich Minister for the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories|Occupied Eastern Territories]], issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms in areas of the USSR under German occupation.  He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming, restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers.  But decollectivization conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann Göring]] demanded that the ''kolkhoz'' be retained, save for a change of name.

German propaganda described this as a preparatory step toward ultimate dissolution of the kolkhozes into private farms, which would be granted to peasants who had loyally delivered compulsory quotas of farm produce to the Germans. By 1943, the German occupation authorities had converted 30% of the kolkhozes into German-sponsored "agricultural cooperatives", but as yet had made no conversions to private farms.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph L.

'''[[Constitutionalism]] in the United States''' is a basic value espoused by political parties, activist groups and individuals across a wide range of the political spectrum, that the powers of federal, state and local governments are limited by the [[Constitution of the United States]] and that the [[civil and political rights]] of citizens should not be violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constitutionalism/| title=Constitutionalism| publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''data validation''' is the process of ensuring [[data]] have undergone [[data cleansing]] to ensure they have [[data quality]], that is, that they are both correct and useful. It uses routines, often called "[[validation rule]]s" "validation constraints" or "check routines", that check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system. The rules may be implemented through the automated facilities of a [[data dictionary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Data dictionary|last=|first=|authorlink=|last2=|authorlink2=|date=|website=|publisher=video  18+|others=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by the inclusion of explicit [[application program]] validation logic.

==Overview==
Data validation is intended to provide certain well-defined guarantees for fitness, accuracy, and consistency for any of various kinds of user input into an application or automated system. Data validation rules can be defined and designed using any of various methodologies, and be deployed in any of various contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/methodology_for_data_validation_v1.0_rev-2016-06_final.pdf Methodology for data validation 1.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

Data validation rules may be defined, designed and deployed, for example:

'''Definition and design contexts:'''
* as a part of requirements-gathering phase in a [[software engineering]] or [[Specification (technical standard)|designing a software specification]]
* as part of an operations modeling phase [[business process modeling|BPM]]

'''Depts''':
* 
* as a set of programs or business-logic routines in a [[programming language]]
* as a set of [[Stored procedure|stored-procedures]] in a [[database management system]]

For business applications, data validation can be defined through [[declarative programming|declarative]] [[data integrity]] rules, or [[imperative programming|procedure-based]] [[business rules]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa291820(VS.71).aspx Data Validation, Data Integrity, Designing Distributed Applications with Visual Studio .NET]&lt;/ref&gt; Data that does not conform to these rules will negatively affect business process execution. Therefore, data validation should start with business process definition and set of business rules within this process. Rules can be collected through the requirements capture exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Arkady Maydanchik (2007), "Data Quality Assessment", Technics Publications, LLC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different kinds of validation==
In evaluating the basics of data validation, generalizations can be made regarding the different types of validation, according to the scope, complexity, and purpose of the various validation operations to be carried out.

For example:
* Data type validation;
* Range and constraint validation;
* Code and Cross-reference validation; and
* Structured validation

===Data-type validation===
Data type validation is customarily carried out on one or more simple data fields.

The simplest kind of data type validation verifies that the individual characters provided through user input are consistent with the expected characters of one or more known primitive data types; as defined in a programming language or data storage and retrieval mechanism as well as the specification of the following primitive data types: 1) integer; 2) float (decimal); or 3) string.

For example, many database systems allow the specification of the following l&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; (plus, minus, and parentheses). A more sophisticated data validation routine would check to see the user had entered a valid country code, i.e., that the number of digits entered matched the convention for the country or area specified.

A validation process involves two distinct steps: (a) Validation Check and (b) Post-Check action. The check step uses one or more computational rules (see section below) to determine if the data is valid. The Post-validation action sends feedback to help enforce validation.

===Simple range and constraint validation===
Simple range and constraint validation may examine user input for consistency with a minimum/maximum range, or consistency with a test for evaluating a sequence of characters, such as one or more tests against regular expressions. For example, a US phone number should have 10 digits and no letters or special characters.

===Code and cross-reference validation===
Code and cross-reference validation includes tests for data type validation, combined with one or more operations to verify that the user-supplied data is consistent with one or more external rules, requirements, or validity constraints relevant to a particular organization, context or set of underlying assumptions. These additional validity constraints may involve cross-referencing supplied data with a known look-up table or directory information service such as [[LDAP]].

For example, an experienced user may enter a well-formed string that matches the specification for a valid e-mail address, as defined in RFC 5322 &lt;ref&gt;(sections 3.2.3 and 3.4.1) and RFC 5321 – with a more readable form given in the informational RFC 3696&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Written by J. Klensin, the author of RFC 5321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;and the [http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=3696 associated errata]&lt;/ref&gt; but that well-formed string might not actually correspond to a resolvable domain connected to an active e-mail account.

===Structured validation===
Structured validation allows for the combination of any of various basic data type validation steps, along with more complex processing. Such complex processing may include the testing of conditional constraints for an entire complex data object or set of process operations within a system.

A Validation rule is a criterion or constraint used in the process of data validation, carried out after the data has been encoded onto an input medium and involves a data vet or validation program. This is distinct from [[formal verification]], where the operation of a program is determined to be that which was  intended, and that meets the purpose. The Validation rule or check system still used by many major software manufacturers was designed by an employee at Microsoft some time between 1997 and 1999.

The method is to check that data falls the appropriate parameters defined by the systems analyst. A judgement as to whether data is valid is made possible by the validation program, but it cannot ensure complete accuracy. This can only be achieved through the use of all the clerical and computer controls built into the system at the design stage. The difference between data  validity and accuracy can be illustrated with a trivial example. A company has established a Personnel file and each record contains a field for the Job Grade. The permitted values are A, B, C, or D. An entry in a record may be valid and accepted by the system if it is one of these characters, but it may not be the correct grade for the individual worker concerned. Whether a grade is correct can only be established by clerical checks or by reference to other files. During systems design, therefore, data definitions are established which place limits on what constitutes valid data. Using these data definitions, a range of software validation checks can be carried out.

===Criteria?===
An example of a validation check is the procedure used to verify an [[ISBN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm ''Frequently Asked Questions about the new ISBN standard'']  [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Size. The number of characters in a data item value is checked; for example, an ISBN must consist of 10 characters only (in the previous version—the standard for 1997 and later has been changed to 13 characters.)
* Format checks. Data must conform to a specified format. Thus, the first 9 characters must be the digits 0 through 9' the 10th must be either those digits or an ''X''
* Consistency.  Codes in the data items which are related in some way can thus be checked for the consistency of their relationship. The first number of the ISBN designates the language of publication. for example, books published in French-speaking countries carry the digit "2". This must match the address of the publisher, as given elsewhere in the record.
* Range. Does not apply to ISBN, but typically data must lie within maximum and minimum preset values. For example, customer account numbers may be restricted within the values 10000 to 20000, if this is the arbitrary range of the numbers used for the system.
* [[Check digit]]. An extra digit calculated on, for example, an account number, can be used as a self-checking device. When the number is input to the computer, the validation program carries out a calculation similar to that used to generate the check digit originally and thus checks its validity. This kind of check will highlight transcription errors where two or more digits have been transposed or put in the wrong order.  The 10th character of the 10-character [[ISBN]] is the check digit.

==Validation methods==
;Allowed character checks
:Checks to ascertain that only expected characters are present in a field. For example a numeric field may only allow the digits 0–9, the decimal point and perhaps a minus sign or commas. A text field such as a personal name might disallow characters such a markup-based security attack. An e-mail address might require at least one @ sign and various other structural details. Regular expressions are effective ways of implementing such checks. (See also data type checks below)

;Batch totals
:Checks for missing records. Numerical fields may be added together for all records in a batch. The batch total is entered and the computer checks that the total is correct, e.g., add the 'Total Cost' field of a number of transactions together.

;Cardinality check
:Checks that record has a valid number of related records. For example if Contact record classified as a Customer it must have at least one associated Order (Cardinality &gt; 0). If order does not exist for a "customer" record then it must be either changed to "seed" or the order must be created. This type of rule can be complicated by additional conditions. For example if contact record in Payroll database is marked as "former employee", then this record must not have any associated salary payments after the date on which employee left organization (Cardinality = 0).

;Check digits
:Used for numerical data. An extra digit is added to a number which is calculated from the digits. The computer checks this calculation when data are entered. For example the last digit of an ISBN for a book is a check digit calculated modulus 10.[3]

;Consistency checks
:Checks fields to ensure data in these fields corresponds, e.g., If Title = "Mr.", then Gender = "M".

;Control totals
:This is a total done on one or more numeric fields which appears in every record. This is a meaningful total, e.g., add the total payment for a number of Customers.

;Cross-system consistency checks
:Compares data in different systems to ensure it is consistent, e.g., The address for the customer with the same id is the same in both systems. The data may be represented differently in different systems and may need to be transformed to a common format to be compared, e.g., one system may store customer name in a single Name field as 'Doe, John Q', while another in three different fields: First_Name (John), Last_Name (Doe) and Middle_Name (Quality); to compare the two, the validation engine would have to transform data from the second system to match the data from the first, for example, using SQL: Last_Name || ', ' || First_Name || substr(Middle_Name, 1, 1) would convert the data from the second system to look like the data from the first 'Doe, John Q'

;Data type checks
:Checks the data type of the input and give an error message if the input data does not match with the chosen data type, e.g., In an input box accepting numeric data, if the letter 'O' was typed instead of the number zero, an error message would appear.

;File existence check
:Checks that a file with a specified name exists. This check is essential for programs that use file handling.

;Format or picture check
:Checks that the data is in a specified format (template), e.g., dates have to be in the format DD/MM/YYYY. Regular expressions should be considered for this type of validation.

;Hash totals
:This is just a batch total done on one or more numeric fields which appears in every record. This is a meaningless total, e.g., add the Telephone Numbers together for a number of Customers.

;Limit check
:Unlike range checks, data are checked for one limit only, upper OR lower, e.g., data should not be greater than 2 (&lt;=2).

;Logic check
:Checks that an input does not yield a logical error, e.g., an input value should not be 0 when it will divide some other number somewhere in a program.

;Presence check
:Checks that important data is actually present and have not been missed out, e.g., customers may be required to have their telephone numbers listed.

;Range check
:Checks that the data is within a specified range of values, e.g., the month of a person's date of birth should lie between 1 and 12.

;Referential integrity
:In modern Relational database values in two tables can be linked through foreign key and primary key. If values in the primary key field are not constrained by database internal mechanism,[4] then they should be validated. Validation of the foreign key field checks that referencing table must always refer to a valid row in the referenced table.[5]

;Spelling and grammar check
:Looks for spelling and grammatical errors.

;Uniqueness check
:Checks that each value is unique. This can be applied to several fields (i.e. Address, First Name, Last Name).

;Table look up check
:A table look up check takes the entered data item and compares it to a valid list of entries that are stored in a database table.

===Post-validation actions===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
;Enforcement Action
:Enforcement action typically rejects the data entry request and requires the input actor to make a change that brings the data into compliance. This is most suitable for interactive use, where a real person is sitting on the computer and making entry. It also works well for batch upload, where a file input may be rejected and a set of messages sent back to the input source for why the data is rejected.
:Another form of enforcement action involves automatically changing the data and saving a conformant version instead of the original version. This is most suitable for cosmetic change. For example, converting an [all-caps] entry to a [Pascal case] entry does not need user input. An inappropriate use of automatic enforcement would be in situations where the enforcement leads to loss of business information. For example, saving a truncated comment if the length is longer than expected. This is not typically a good thing since it may result in loss of significant data.

;Advisory Action
:Advisory actions typically allow data to be entered unchanged but sends a message to the source actor indicating those validation issues that were encountered. This is most suitable for non-interactive system, for systems where the change is not business critical, for cleansing steps of existing data and for verification steps of an entry process.

;Verification Action
:Verification actions are special cases of advisory actions. In this case, the source actor is asked to verify that this data is what they would really want to enter, in the light of a suggestion to the contrary. Here, the check step suggests an alternative (e.g. a check of your mailing address returns a different way of formatting that address or suggests a different address altogether). You would want in this case, to give the user the option of accepting the recommendation or keeping their version. This is not a strict validation process, by design and is useful for capturing addresses to a new location or to a location that is not yet supported by the validation databases.

;Log of validation
:Even in cases where data validation did not find any issues, providing a log of validations that were conducted and their results is important. This is helpful to identify any missing data validation checks in light of data issues and in improving the validation.

==Validation and security==
Failures or omissions in data validation can lead to [[data corruption]] or a [[software security vulnerability|security vulnerability]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgisecurity.com/owasp/html/ch10.html Chapter10.

'''Economic conversion''', '''defence conversion''', or '''arms conversion''', is a [[Technology|technical]], [[economic]] and [[political]] process for moving from [[military]] to [[civilian]] markets. Economic conversion takes place on several levels and can be applied to different organizations. In terms of levels (roughly corresponding to [[geographic]] scales), conversion can take place at the level of new innovation projects, divisions within multi-divisional firms, companies, and national economies. In terms of objects, conversion can govern [[workers]] (i.e. retraining), [[business|firms]] (in terms of workers, capital, facilities and real estate) and land (in terms of [[real estate]]). Some of these scales obviously overlap. Organizations that can be converted include defense firms, military bases, and defense laboratories.

Conversion should be distinguished from [[economic diversification]] although the two processes overlap. Conversion involves the maximum [[reuse]] of military committed [[Human resources|resources]], with the emphasis on reuse of existing [[personnel]]. The key personnel within defense firms are [[engineers]] and factory workers, and [[managers]] skilled in managing [[innovations]]. Another key emphasis in conversion is in the area of new product development. Diversification can involve financial manipulation, e.g. in purchasing new firms, which leaves in place existing commitments to military production. Sometimes however, economic conversion requires purchase of another firm to supply "complementary capacities." Generally, conversion can be supported by various factors that help defense firms overcome [[Departmentalization|specialization]].

Among the key periods associated with economic conversion have been the postwar conversion after [[World War II]], numerous experiments in diversification (with conversion of defense engineers' skills) in the period after the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1970s, and similar efforts after the [[Cold War]]. Various militarist and corporate critics battled labor and peace advocates during these conversion openings, with the former usually winning the day.

In modern times, a key figure in promoting the idea of economic conversion was the late [[Seymour Melman]] (1917–2004), a [[professor]] at [[Columbia University]] in the [[United States]]. In recent times, the idea has also been promoted by various scholars and activists, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, in [[Europe]], the United States, [[Israel]] and [[South Africa]]. Following the end of the Cold War, great attention was placed on the prospects for economic conversion.

Regarding differences in the 1970s and the postwar era, [[Seymour Melman]] noted that: "The problem of conversion from military to civilian work is fundamentally different now from the problem that existed after World War II. At that time, the issue was reconversion; the firms could and did go back to doing the work they had been involved in before the war. They could literally draw the olds sets of [[blueprints]] and tools from the shelf and go to work on the old products. At the present time, the bulk of military production is concentrated in industries, firms, or plants that have been specialized for this work, and frequently have no prior history of civilian work" (The Defense Economy, 1970: 7).

Detailed [[empirical]] studies conducted by Seymour Melman, [[John Ullmann]], [[Lloyd J. Dumas]], [[Catherine Hill]], [[Greg Bischak]], [[Ann Markusen]], [[Michael Oden]], [[Jonathan Michael Feldman]], and others have shown the technical or economic viability of economic conversion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and concentrated political power directed towards military-serving interests, the obstacles to conversion have been considerable. Extensive political barriers suggest that conversion promotion requires various forms of institutional transformation and social movement mobilization.

To be successful, conversion must be part of a larger political program involving, military [[budget]] reductions, [[reindustrialization]], and [[infrastructure]] renewal. For example, if a given defense firm should convert, its production could be easily replaced by output from another firm. [[Marcus Raskin]] at the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] has developed such a [[Wikt:Draft|draft]] [[treaty]] for comprehensive disarmament.

In the contemporary period, from the late 1990s to the present day (circa 2010) the prospects for conversion have been constrained by regional conflicts, the so-called "war on terror," and consolidation within the defense industry through mergers, acquisitions and regional production networks. These barriers have decreased the incentives to shift into civilian markets for various firms, except for those more on the periphery of defense acquisition.  Nevertheless, the potential debate over mega military systems like specific jet fighter programs or Trident (in the U.K.) as well as an overall climate of fiscal austerity might pressure or encourage some military firms to go civilian.  Arms control agreements related to nuclear weapons might also lower the projected demand for some military suppliers.  Ultimately, the extension of civilian markets for defense firms might be encouraged by building up the demand for civilian industrial markets like mass transit, alternative energy and sustainable, civilian infrastructure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7404">In the United States, '''federal grants''' are economic [[aid]] issued by the [[United States government]] out of the general federal revenue.  A federal grant is an [[award]] of financial assistance from a federal agency to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States.

Grants are [[federal assistance]] to individuals, [[Welfare|benefit]]s or [[entitlement]]s. A grant is  not used to acquire property or services for the federal government's direct benefit.

[[Grant (money)|Grants]] may also be issued by private [[non-profit organization]]s such as [[foundation (charity)|foundations]], [[not-for-profit corporation]]s or [[charitable trust]]s  which are all collectively referred to as [[charities]].

Outside the United States grants, subventions or subsidies are used to in similar fashion by government or private charities to subsidize programs and projects that fit within the funding criteria of the grant-giving entity or donor.  Grants can be unrestricted, to be used by the recipient in any fashion within the perimeter of the recipient organization's activities or they may be restricted to a specific purpose by the [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]].

==American definition==
Federal grants are defined and governed by the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, as incorporated in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/6304- Title 31 Section 6304 of the U.S. Code].  A Federal grant is a:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...legal instrument reflecting the relationship between the United States Government and a State, a local government, or other entity when 1) the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the State or local government or other recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States instead of acquiring (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government; and 2) substantial involvement is not expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When an awarding agency expects to be substantially involved in a project (beyond routine monitoring and technical assistance), the law requires use of a cooperative agreement instead.  When the government is procuring goods or services for its own direct benefit, and not for a broader public purpose, the law requires use of a federal contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/6305-|title=31 U.S. Code § 6305 - Using cooperative agreements|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of grants==

*'''[[Categorical grant]]s''' may be spent only for narrowly defined purposes and recipients often must match a portion of the federal funds. 33% of categorical grants are considered to be formula grants. About 90% of federal aid dollars are spent for categorical grants.
**'''Project grants''' are grants given by the government to fund research projects, such as a research project for medical purposes. An individual must acquire certain qualifications before applying for such a grant and the normal duration for project grants is three years.
**'''[[Formula grant]]s''' provide funds as dictated by a law.
*'''[[Block grant]]s''' are large grants provided from the federal government to state or local governments for use in a general purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalgrants.com/block-grants.html] - FederalGrants.com; definition of "block grant"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Earmark (politics)|Earmark grants]]''' are explicitly specified in [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]]s of the U.S. [[United States Congress|Congress]]. They are not competitively awarded and have become highly controversial because of the heavy involvement of paid [[Lobbying|political lobbyists]] used in securing them. In FY1996 appropriations, the [[Congressional Research Service]] found 3,023 earmarks totaling $19.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], while in FY2006 it found 12,852 earmarks totaling $64 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jonathan Weisman |title=Proposals Call For Disclosure of Ties to Lobbyists | publisher=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/26/AR2006032600884.html | date=2006-03-27 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information provided in grant applications==
[[Award]] information in grants generally includes:
* Estimated funding
* Expected number of awards
* Anticipated award size
* Period of performance

Eligibility information includes:
*  Eligible applicants
*  Cost sharing

==Criticism==
Federal and state grants frequently receive criticism due to what are perceived to be excessive regulations and not include opportunities for [[small business]], as well as for often giving more money per person to smaller states regardless of population or need. These criticisms include problems of overlap, duplication, excessive categorization, insufficient information, varying requirements, arbitrary federal decision-making, and grantsmanship (a funding bias toward entities most familiar with how to exploit the system, rather than to those most in need).

The '''Football War''' ({{lang-es|La guerra del fútbol}}; [[colloquial]]: '''Soccer War''' or the '''100 Hours War''') was a brief [[war]] fought between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]] in 1969. Existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during a [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. The war began on 14 July 1969, when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August.

==Context==
Although the nickname "Football War" implies that the conflict was due to a football match, the causes of the war go much deeper. The roots were issues over land reform in [[Honduras]] and immigration and demographic problems in [[El Salvador]]. Honduras is more than five times the size of neighboring El Salvador, but in 1969 the population of El Salvador (3.7 million) was some 40% higher than that of Honduras (2.6 million). At the beginning of the 20th century, Salvadorans had begun migrating to Honduras in large numbers. By 1969 more than 300,000 Salvadorans were living in Honduras. These Salvadorans made up 20% of the present population of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, Allison. ''Honduras: The Making of a Banana Republic''. Toronto: Between the Lines, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Honduras, as in much of Central America, a large majority of the land was owned by large landowners or big corporations. The [[United Fruit Company]] owned 10% of the land, making it hard for the average landowner to compete. In 1966  United Fruit banded together with many other large companies to create la Federación Nacional de Agricultores y Ganaderos de Honduras (FENAGH; the National Federation of Farmers and Livestock-Farmers of Honduras). FENAGH was anti-peasantry (against the [[Tenant farmer|campesino]]) as well as anti-Salvadoran. This group put pressure on the Honduran president, Gen. [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], to protect the property rights of wealthy landowners.&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981&gt;Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|64-75}}

In 1962 Honduras successfully enacted a new [[land reform]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/Honduras/pdfs/155709-206648.pdf|title=La Gaceta Dec. 5, 1962 (Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |date= |accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully enforced by 1967, this law gave the central government and municipalities much of the land occupied illegally by Salvadoran immigrants and redistributed it to native-born Hondurans as specified by the Land Reform Law. The land was taken from both immigrant farmers and squatters regardless of their claims to ownership or immigration status. This created problems for Salvadorans and Hondurans who were married. Thousands of Salvadoran laborers were expelled from Honduras, including both migrant workers and longer-term settlers. This general rise in tensions ultimately led to a military conflict.

==Buildup==
In June 1969, [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in a two-leg [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier]]. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won {{nowrap|1–0}}. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816-1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 1969, the day the play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&amp;dat=19690628&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en| "Soccer 'War' Won By El Salvador, 3-2]; Troops Still Alerted", ''Pittsburgh Press'', June 28, 1969, p1&lt;/ref&gt;, El Salvador dissolved all diplomatic ties with Honduras, stating that in the ten days since the game in El Salvador 11,700 Salvadorans had been forced to flee Honduras. It said that as Honduras had "done nothing to prevent murder, oppression, rape, plundering and the mass expulsion of Salvadoreans", there was little point in maintaining relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's diplomatic penalty|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 June 1969|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further claimed that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981/&gt;{{RP|105}} El Salvador won the decisive third game 3–2 after [[extra time]].

Late in the afternoon of 14 July 1969, the concerted military action began. El Salvador was put on a blackout and the [[Salvadoran Air Force]], using passenger airplanes with explosives strapped to their sides as bombers, attacked targets inside Honduras. Salvadoran air-raid targets included [[Toncontín International Airport]], which left the [[Honduran Air Force]] unable to react quickly. The larger [[Salvadoran Army]] launched major offensives along the two main roads connecting the two nations and invaded Honduras. The invasion phase was perpetrated by three main contingents: the Chalatenago Theater, the North Theater, and the East Theater. The Chalatenango Theater was based on the northwest side of El Salvador, including the departments of [[Santa Ana Department|Santa Ana]] and [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]], across the mountain range close to the border, and the [[Sumpul River]]. This was a strategic region due to its rich soil and climate; however, this Theater would not see any fighting as it was to deploy only in case of Honduran penetration into El Salvador. The North Theater was composed of a small unit of armored vehicles and a large amount of manpower. The East Theater was to deploy in the departments of [[La Unión Department|La Unión]] and [[Morazán Department|Morazán]]. This Theater was composed of a large mechanized division, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s such as the [[M3 Stuart]] and a large amount of artillery such as the [[105mm M101]].

Nicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] helped Honduras by providing weapons and ammunition{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Initially, rapid progress was made by the Salvadoran army. By the evening of 15 July, the [[Military of Honduras|Honduran army]] had been pushed back over eight kilometers. The departmental capital of [[Nueva Ocotepeque]] fell shortly after along with eight other cities, placing the Salvadoran army within striking distance of the Honduran capital [[Tegucigalpa]]. The momentum of the advance did not last, however.

The Honduran air force reacted by striking the Salvadoran [[Ilopango International Airport|Ilopango airbase]]. Honduran bombers attacked for the first time in the morning of 16 July. When the bombs began to fall, Salvadoran anti-air artillery started firing, repelling some of the bombers. The bombers had orders to attack the [[Acajutla]] Port, where the main oil facilities of El Salvador were based. Honduran air-raid targets also included minor oil facilities such as the ones in {{illm|Cutuco|es|Puerto Cutuco|ceb|Puerto Cutuco}}. By the evening of 16 July, huge pillars of smoke arose in the Salvadoran coastline from the burning oil depots that had been bombed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Both sides deployed [[World War II]] era design aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Spencer C. |editor-last=Tucker |title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2009 |page=2463}}&lt;/ref&gt; All planes in the engagement were of U.S. origin.  [[North American P-51|Cavalier P-51D Mustangs]], [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U-1, -4 and -5 Corsairs]], [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28A Trojans]], [[North American T-6 Texan|AT-6C Texans]] and even [[Douglas C-47|C-47 Skytrains]] converted into bombers saw action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Overall |first=Mario |title=The Hundred Hour War: Honduras versus El Salvador |journal=[[Air Enthusiast]] |issue=118 |date=July–August 2005 |pages=8–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, Honduran Vought F4U Corsairs engaged a flight of Salvadorian Goodyear FG-1D Corsairs and Cavalier Mustangs — militarized versions of civilian air racing P-51s. During the duel, a Honduran pilot named Fernando Soto shot down three of the Salvadorian planes. El Salvador continued to fly its surviving Corsairs into 1975; Honduras didn’t retire its fleet until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/10/16/the-last-gunfighters-historys-final-piston-engine-interceptors/|title=The Last Gunfighters – History’s Final Piston-Engine Interceptors|website=Military History Now|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war was the last conflict in which piston-engined fighters fought each other.

==Cease-fire==
The Honduran government called on the OAS to intervene, fearing that the nearing Salvadoran Army would invade the capital Tegucigalpa. The OAS met in an urgent session on 15 July and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged on the night of 18 July; it took full effect only on 20 July. El Salvador continued until 29 July to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would take more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.

==Withdrawal==
[[File:Lynn Garrison F4U-7 Corsair 133693 N693M.png|thumb| F4U Corsair, one of the piston types flown in the war]] 
[[El Salvador]] finally withdrew its troops on 2 August 1969. On that date, [[Honduras]] guaranteed Salvadoran President [[Fidel Sánchez Hernández]] that the Honduran government would provide adequate safety for the Salvadorans still living in Honduras. Sánchez had also asked that reparations be paid to the Salvadoran citizens as well, but that was never accepted by Hondurans. There were also heavy pressures from the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] and the debilitating repercussions that would take place if El Salvador continued to resist withdrawing their troops from Honduras.

==Consequences==
Both sides of the Football War suffered extensive casualties. Some 300,000 Salvadorans were displaced, many had been forcibly exiled or had fled from war-torn Honduras, only to enter an El Salvador in which the government was not welcoming. Most of these refugees were forced to provide for themselves with very little assistance. Over the next few years, more Salvadorans returned to their native land, where they encountered overpopulation and extreme poverty.&lt;ref name=Anderson-1981/&gt;{{RP|145-155}}

El Salvador suffered about 900 mostly civilian dead. Honduras lost 250 combat troops, and over 2,000 civilians during the four-day war. Most of the war was fought on Honduran soil and thousands more were made homeless. Trade between Honduras and El Salvador had been greatly disrupted, and the border officially closed. This damaged the economies of these nations tremendously and threatened the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM).
*The war resulted in a 22-year suspension of the CACM, a regional integration project that had been set up by the United States largely as a means of counteracting the effects of the [[Cuban Revolution]].
*The political power of the military in both countries was reinforced. In the Salvadoran legislative elections that followed, candidates of the governing [[National Conciliation Party]] (''Partido de Conciliación Nacional'', PCN), were largely drawn from the ranks of the military. Having apologized for their role in the conflict, they proved very successful in elections at the national and local levels. In contrast to the gradual democratization process that had characterized the 1960s, the military establishment would exercise increasing control
*The social situation in El Salvador worsened, as the government proved unable to satisfy the economic needs of its citizens deported from Honduras. The resulting social unrest was one of the causes of the [[El Salvador Civil War]], which followed approximately a decade later

==Aftermath==
Eleven years after the war the two nations signed a peace treaty on 30 October 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb5.loc.gov/glin/jurisdictions/El_Salvador/pdfs/12624-26952.pdf |title=Diario Oficial Nov. 13, 1980(Library of Congress) |publisher=Content.glin.gov |date= |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to resolve the border dispute over the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] and five sections of land boundary through the [[International Court of Justice]]. In 1992, the Court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras, and in 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty to implement the terms of the ICJ decree. The total disputed land area given to Honduras after the court's ruling was around {{convert|374.5|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. In the Gulf of Fonseca the court found that Honduras held sovereignty over the island of [[Tiger Island|El Tigre]], and El Salvador over the islands of [[Meanguera del Golfo|Meanguera]] and Meanguerita.&lt;ref name="Kawas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kawas, Jorge|title=El Salvador: Sovereignty issues over Gulf of Fonseca|date=18 March 2013|work=Pulsa Merica|url=http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2013/03/18/el-salvador-sovereignty-issues-over-gulf-of-fonseca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute continued despite the ICJ ruling. At a meeting in March 2012 President [[Porfirio Lobo]] of Honduras, President [[Otto Pérez]] of Guatemala, and President [[Daniel Ortega]] of Nicaragua all agreed that the Gulf of Fonseca would be designated as a peace zone. El Salvador was not at the meeting.  However, in December 2012, El Salvador agreed to a tripartite commission of government representatives from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua that was to take care of territorial disputes through peaceful means and come up with a solution by 1 March 2013. The commission did not meet after December, and in March 2013 stiff letters threatening military action were exchanged between Honduras and El Salvador.&lt;ref name="Kawas" /&gt;

'''Garden Networks''' is a not-for-profit organization registered in Canada, that specializes in providing Internet anti-censorship/Internet privacy products for free. The full name of Garden Networks is '''Garden Networks for Freedom of Information'''.

==History==
Garden Networks was started in 2001 by a group of computer software and network engineers. In the same year, the first version of their software tool "Garden" was released, aiming at providing Internet access to web sites blocked by the Chinese government, including web sites of news agencies such as BBC, VOA, and spiritual groups such as Falun Dafa. Along the years, Garden Networks has continued this effort and released product upgrades and new products, combating the escalating Internet blockade of the Chinese government.

The products of Garden Networks provide English and Chinese user interface and are also used by people in other countries to circumvent national Internet censorship or to improve Internet privacy and protect themselves from Internet identify theft.

==Products==

===Garden===
Garden is the first product release by Garden Networks. It works by providing an HTTP proxy server running on the user's local PC. The software then connects to one of the servers provided by Garden Networks to bypass firewalls at China's national gateway.

Garden provides an Internet Explorer Browser Helper Object (BHO) to enable a browser window to direct its traffic to the local proxy server. Activated by a blocked URL, Internet Explorer enters into a proxied mode automatically.

===G2===
A year after Garden was released, Garden Networks releases a new product called Garden G2. This software tool provides a different way of accessing the back-end servers, and a different way of engaging proxying. Unlike Garden, in G2, proxying is triggered by DNS resolution in order to provide support for a wider range of applications.

===GTunnel===
{{Main|GTunnel}}
GTunnel is the latest product released in October 2007. It features a new transport protocol which enables GTunnel to provide local SOCKS proxy support, and new working modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gheorghe |first1=A. V. |last2=Tatar |first2=U. |last3=Gokce |first3=Y. |title=Strategic Cyber Defense: A Multidisciplinary Perspective |date=July 20, 2017 |publisher=IOS Press |isbn=1614997713 |page=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GTunnel version 1.1 provides a standard mode, which is the main working mode and provides the best data transfer performance by connecting to the back-end servers directly, a Skype mode, and a Tor mode that go through computers in these P2P network. GTunnel also has an improved user interface which features real-time traffic graphs.

GTunnel replaces the earlier Garden and G2 client software and becomes the main client software of Garden Networks.

GTunnel works on Linux through Wine support.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1905">The '''Georgia Constitutional Convention of 1861''' was held for the purpose of constructing a [[constitution]] to respond to the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]]. It prohibited the legislature from making any law that would free slaves (Article II, Section VII).

The convention enshrined the concept that the state should be sovereign in many matters. It met sporadically from January 16 to March 23, 1861 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]]. It voted to secede from the Union. It created the first new constitution since 1798. Secession helped precipitate the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] thus significantly altering the history of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3250 |title=Georgia Secession Convention of 1861 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= The New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional conventions in Georgia were held after the Civil War in 1865 and 1867-1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/constitutional-conventions|title=Constitutional Conventions|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intelligence-Security Agency of BiH, commonly known by its acronym '''OSA-OBA BiH''', is the primary intelligence agency of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was created in 2004 by the Bosnian House of Representatives and House of People in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=OSA-OBA|first1=Bosnia and Herzegovina|title=Intelligence-Security Agency|url=http://www.osa-oba.gov.ba/|website=http://www.osa-oba.gov.ba/|publisher=osa-oba-gov.ba|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and function==
The State Intelligence Service has the following duties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rules and tasks|title=OSA-OBA BIH|website=http://www.osa-oba.gov.ba/indexeng.htm|publisher=www.osa-oba.gov.ba|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* collect information from abroad for the purpose of national security;
* undertake intelligence activities for the purpose of the protection of integrity, independence and constitutional order;
* collect information regarding terrorist activity, the production and trafficking of narcotics, the production of weapons of mass destruction and crimes against the environment;
* collect information regarding organized crime that endangers national security.

==Relationship with other state entities==
Institutional Position of the State Intelligence Service and relationship with other state bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Relation with foreign agencies|first1=OSA-OBA BIH|title=PLACE AND ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY AGENCY OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA IN SECURITY SYSTEM OF BOSNIA  AND HERZEGOVINA|website=http://www.osa-oba.gov.ba/osaobaeng.htm|publisher=www.osa-oba.gov.ba|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Intelligence Service falls under the authority of the Prime Minister. Its Head is appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Bosnia|Prime Minister]]. 

OSA operates within this context and while it has been identified as being "generally under effective civilian control" (U.S. Department of State, 2004) the agency has still been associated with various abuses within the country and continues to play a significant role in domestic politics. The Bosnian government has received support from the U.S. and European countries in working to establish or reform national institutions, including its intelligence and security services.

The '''Interim Government of [[Somalia]]''', led by [[Ali Mahdi Muhammad]], was established immediately after the [[Somali Rebellion|collapse]] of the [[Somali Democratic Republic]]. From November 1991 to 1995, Ali Mahdi Muhammad enjoyed recognition as President in the international community following the 1991 Djibouti conference held between 15 and 21 July 1991, Ali Mahdi was elected interim President of Somalia for a period of two years, but because of the legitimacy conferred on Ali Mahdi by the Djibouti conference, his government was recognized by several countries, including [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Italy]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/5267 |title=Harbinger of a new world order? |publisher=library.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he was not able to exert his authority beyond certain parts of the capital. Power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of the country and with autonomous subnational entities in the north.&lt;ref name=SOMALIA-KEY-ACTORS&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Some key actors in the transitional process|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/0/cd80e675a2fba86a49256ff90029df0f?OpenDocument|date=2005-05-06|publisher=[[IRIN]]|accessdate=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition for influence and resources between Muhammad and Aidid continued on through the 1992–95 UN missions to Somalia ([[UNOSOM I]], [[UNOSOM II]], and [[UNITAF]]), until Aidid's eventual death in 1996.

'''Jewish Released Time''', also known as '''Sheloh''' (an abbreviation for ''Shi'urei Limud Hados'' (Classes for Learning the Religion)), is an organization promoting [[released time]] for the [[Jewish education]] of [[Jewish]] children learning in [[Education in the United States|public schools]].

==History==
In 1943, [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]] founded Sheloh as a part of [[Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch]], the educational branch of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement. The program was first directed by Rabbi Y. Feldman. In 1945, Rabbi [[Jacob J. Hecht]] was appointed director, and continued in this position until his death in 1990. Rabbi Schneersohn, and his son in-law and successor Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], were constantly involved in the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/letters-rebbe-3/109.htm Sichos In English, "A Treasury of Letters from the Lubavitcher Rebbe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829144513/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/letters-rebbe-3/109.htm |date=2006-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, when the legality of the Released Time hour was challenged in [[Washington, D.C.]], Rabbi Schneerson worked hard to fight for its continuation, even sending a delegation to Washington to support it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabadnews.us/Old%20Aricles/AT%2000015.htm Chabad News on the Web, "Teaching the Fifth Son"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
These classes take place off public school premises, in keeping with the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' (1948). Generally they are held in a nearby [[synagogue]], but if none is available, they may be held in a wedding hall or similar venue.&lt;ref&gt;http://thejewishchronicle.net/view/full_story/23822373/article-Jewish-leaders-get-advanced-degrees-at-first-Spertus-commencement-here&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagefl.com/story/2013/10/18/news/chabad-offers-new-course-that-looks-at-medical-dilemmas/1560.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postbulletin.com/life/lifestyles/faith-focus/article_ccca47fc-330b-5308-a6d4-7299210de5a3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish released time classes, like those organized by other religious groups, take place for one hour each week (generally on Wednesdays),&lt;ref name=x2018/&gt; at the end of the school day. In these classes, children are taught to recite basic [[Jewish prayer]]s, and learn about the [[Torah]], [[Jewish history]], [[Jewish law]], and [[Jewish ethics]]. The teachers are Rabbinical students from the local central Lubavitcher [[Yeshiva]] [[Tomchei Temimim]]; for locations where there is no such Yeshiva, the teacher is the local [[Shliach]] or one of his assistants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/community/south-florida/promoting-jewish-medical-awareness-in-boca-raton/2013/10/10/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2013/oct/09/promoting-jewish-medical-awareness-northern-virgin/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2013-10-09/story/jacksonville-journal-high-tides-closing-st-johns-county-beaches-now&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheloh's 1946 year-end summary stated that there were 5000 children from 150 different public schools attending their classes every week, with separate classes for boys and girls. By the later 1940s, there were 10,000 children attending Released Time's weekly sessions.
&lt;ref name=x2018&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=Lubavitch International
|date=Summer 2018  |title=Released for an hour, Connected for a Lifetime |author=Dvora Lapkein}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Decades later the classes became generally co-educational.)

Given the limited amount of time, actual reading of Hebrew was not part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=x2018/&gt;

==Today==

Sheloh is a division of [[NCFJE|The National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education]], founded by Rabbi [[Jacob J. Hecht]]. The current chairman of NCFJE is Rabbi [[Sholem Hecht]], and the director of Sheloh is Rabbi [[Zalman Zirkind]].

Sheloh's mission has broadened to include assisting children who are interested in full-time Jewish education to enroll in [[Yeshiva|Yeshivos]]. Sheloh also hosts other programs such as Released Time Winter Camp and Shabbatons ([[Shabbat]] get-togethers). These activities, in turn, have led to many parents becoming [[Baal teshuva|Baalei teshuva]] as a result of their children's interest in [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://patch.com/new-jersey/hillsborough/chabads-learning-series-returns-with-endoflife-study&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zorach v. Clauson]]
In 1952, the case of Zorach v. Clauson came before the Supreme Court. The case involved the education law of New York State, particularly a regulation by which a public school was permitted to release students during school hours for religious instruction or devotional exercises. In a 6 to 3 ruling, the high court upheld the New York law.

In the majority opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that New York's program "involves neither religious instruction in public schools nor the expenditure of public funds", unlike the earlier McCollum case that the Zorach plaintiffs had cited as precedent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/northbrook/community/chi-ugc-article-promoting-jewish-medical-awareness-in-northbr-2013-10-08-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas wrote that a public school "may not coerce anyone to attend church, to observe a religious holiday, or to take religious instruction. But it can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction. No more than that is undertaken here."

The Court's opinion stated that

In the McCollum case the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction. Here, as we have said, the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules to a program of outside religious instruction. We follow the McCollum case. But we cannot expand it to cover the present released time program unless separation of Church and State means that public institutions can make no adjustments of their schedules to accommodate the religious needs of the people. We cannot read into the Bill of Rights such a philosophy of hostility to religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2013/10/promoting_jewish_medical_aware.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.JewishNorthOrlando.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kinkaid Act of 1904''' (ch. 1801, {{USStat|33|547}}, Apr. 28, 1904, {{USC|43|224}}) is a [[United States government|U.S.]] [[statute]] that amended the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] so that one [[section (land)|section]] (1&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 640 [[acre]]s) of public domain land could be acquired free of charge, apart from a modest filing fee.  It applied specifically to 37 counties in northwest Nebraska, in the general area of the [[Sand Hills (Nebraska)|Nebraska Sandhills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kay|first=John|title=Renaissance Survey Final Report of Logan County, Nebraska|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/logan_county.pdf#page=67|publisher=Nebraska State Historical Society|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The act was introduced by [[Moses Kinkaid]], [[United States House of Representatives, Nebraska District 6|Nebraska's 6th congressional district representative]], and was signed into law by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on April 28, 1904 and went into effect on June 28 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keener|first=John|title=Public Land Statutes of the United States|year=1916|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJRKAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The legal provisions of the Kinkaid Act were very similar to those of the [[Homestead Act]].  A claimant had to be at least 21 years of age (or 18 if the head of a household), and a current U.S. citizen or in the process of becoming a citizen.  Five years of residency was required to gain title to a claim, with exceptions made to account for years of military service.&lt;ref name="Keener 1916 99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keener|first=John|title=Public Land Statutes of the United States|year=1916|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJRKAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The residency requirement was shortened to three years in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starrs|first=Paul|title=Let the Cowboy Ride: Cattle Ranching in the American West|year=1998|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|pages=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHfnaQLGIx4C&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PP4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A claimant also had to prove that improvements equivalent to $1.25 per acre had been made to the property.&lt;ref name="Starrs 1998 23"&gt;{{cite book|last=Starrs|first=Paul|title=Let the Cowboy Ride: Cattle Ranching in the American West|year=1998|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|pages=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHfnaQLGIx4C&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PP4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only non-irrigable lands were eligible to be claimed under the provisions of the Kinkaid Act; those that were deemed to be practicably [[Irrigation|irrigable]] by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] were excluded.  A 640-acre claim was required to be as compact as possible, and less than two miles in length.&lt;ref name="Keener 1916 99"/&gt;  A homesteader who already held land in the area at the time of enactment could accumulate additional surrounding available territory in order to acquire a total homestead unit of 640 acres.&lt;ref name="Starrs 1998 23"/&gt;

Commutation (paying cash instead of occupying a claim for the full five years, which had been permitted under the 1862 Homestead Act) was not allowed under the Kinkaid Act.&lt;ref name=landlaws&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/services/refrence/la_pubs/landlaw7.htm "U.S. Government Land Laws in Nebraska, 1854-1904".]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.shtml Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2012-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claimants of land under the provisions of the Kinkaid Act were generally referred to as "Kinkaiders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandoz|first=Mari|title=Old Jules|year=1935|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|pages=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kinkaid Act was repealed on October 21, 1976 (Pub. L. 94–579, title VII, § 702, Oct. 21, 1976, 90 Stat. 2787).  The final patent was issued in 1941 on {{Convert|40|acre}} of land.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 26"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=26|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Brandspade.jpg|thumb|alt=Silhouette of cow with brand marked on it: triangle pointing upward with rounded sides and a vertical projection from lower edge, like a spade|Spade Ranch brand]]

The economy of the Nebraska Sandhills region in the late 19th century was dominated by the cattle ranching industry.  Large ranches dotted the landscape, utilizing largely-unclaimed lands in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooker County Historical Society|title=Hooker County, Nebraska: The First 100 Years|year=1989|publisher=Curtis Media Corp|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ranchers would file claims on lands with water access, and use the surrounding public pastures for grazing.  Large stockmen sometimes used fraudulent homestead filings from employees and other individuals in order to gain title to surrounding land.  A shack would be erected on these fraudulent claims and the claimant would stay there once every six months in order to claim residency.  A common tactic was to gain title to a thin strip of land surrounding a large pasture in the public domain; the pasture would then be used for grazing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=Land Frauds and Illegal Fencing in Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=3|pages=173|jstor=3740079}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This prevented anyone else from grazing their cattle in the enclosed area and discouraged homesteaders from claiming the land.  [[Bartlett Richards]] and William Comstock, who formed the [[Spade Ranch (Nebraska)|Spade Ranch]], were famous for tactics such as these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=Land Frauds and Illegal Fencing in Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=3|pages=178|jstor=3740079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the immense land holdings required for large cattle operations, the population of the Sandhills region decreased by 10% between 1890 and 1900, and millions of acres remained in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=20|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To address this issue, [[William Neville]], a populist congressman from [[North Platte, Nebraska]], introduced legislation in 1902 that would amend the Homestead Law to allow an individual to take a homestead of 1,280 acres in the arid and nonirrigable lands west of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]].  The bill never made it to the floor for debate.

In his 1902 address to congress, President Theodore Roosevelt made it a priority to settle the "public land problem."  He appointed a Public Lands Commission in 1903 to look into the issue and recommend solutions.  The commission concluded that current land laws had been framed to accommodate humid regions, while the remaining public lands were arid in character.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 21"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=21|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;   New land laws would be needed to settle the arid lands west of the 100th meridian.

== Passage of the Kinkaid Act ==
[[File:Moses P. Kinkaid from LOC 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of man in hat|[[Moses Kinkaid]]]]
Moses Kinkaid, a congressman from the sixth district of Nebraska, introduced a bill "to amend the homestead laws as to certain unappropriated and unreserved lands in Nebraska" on April 6, 1904.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 21"/&gt;  The original bill provided for 1,280 acre homesteads, but the Committee on the Public Lands limited the size to 640 acres.  The committee felt that 640 acres would be a good initial experiment size, and the act could be amended in the future if more land were needed.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 22"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=22|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinkaid stated that the bill had three primary purposes: to get the lands into the hands of individuals and thus make the land taxable; to end the fencing and claim fraud controversies over the land; and to build up the communities and homes in the region.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 22"/&gt;  It was a bill meant for "the disposition of sandy and arid lands in western Nebraska," which were too difficult to irrigate.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 22"/&gt;  It specifically applied to the Sandhills region of Nebraska, which is approximately the northwestern two-thirds of the state.  All of the land was west of the 98th meridian.  Only non-irrigable lands were open for entry; those that were deemed irrigable were not eligible.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 23"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=23|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill passed on April 28, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keener|first=John|title=Public Land Statutes of the United States|year=1916|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJRKAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately {{Convert|11000000|acre}} of land was made available within the area of the Kinkaid Act.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 28"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=28|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional {{Convert|1000000|acre}} of land was withdrawn due to potential irrigability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peffer|first=Louise|title=The Closing of the Public Domain: Disposal and Reservation Policies, 1900-1950|year=1951|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uISaAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mixed results in the Sandhills region ==
An immediate land rush followed the passage of the act.  One of the land offices in the region was at [[Alliance, Nebraska|Alliance]], in [[Box Butte County, Nebraska|Box Butte County]].  The first day to claim an entry was June 28, 1904.  There were reportedly 400 people in line at the Alliance office on the initial day, and the original line was not completely processed until 3:00 pm on June 30.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 23"/&gt;  In April 1905, the ''Western Nebraska Observer'' of [[Kimball, Nebraska|Kimball]] reported that there was a construction boom in [[Kimball County, Nebraska|Kimball County]], which was within the territory of the Kinkaid Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=25|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]] Telegraph'' reported in 1906 that merchants had been experiencing their most profitable months ever due to the influx of new residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur|title=The Kinkaid Act and Its Effects on Western Nebraska|journal=Agricultural History|year=1949|volume=23|issue=1|pages=27|jstor=3739379}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her book ''Old Jules'', an autobiographical account of living in the Sandhills region during the turn of the century, [[Mari Sandoz]] describes the scene as land was initially opened for settlement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two weeks before opening, covered wagons, horsebackers, men afoot, toiled into Alliance, got information at the land office, and vanished eastward over the level prairie.  Many turned back at the first soft yellow chophills, pockmarked by blowouts and warted with soapweeds.  Others kept on, through this protective border, into the broad valley region, with high hills reaching towards the whitish sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandoz|first=Mari|title=Old Jules|year=1935|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Nebraska Sandhills NE97 Hooker County 3.JPG|thumb|Dune-like hills covered with brown grass; highway running through foreground|Nebraska Sandhills in October]]

Population rapidly increased in the 37 counties where the law was applicable:&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 28"/&gt;	
*1890: 124,508
*1900: 107,434
*1904: Passage of Kinkaid Act
*1910: 162,217
Nearly all of the public lands in the region had been claimed by 1912.  All that remained were extremely isolated or undesirable sections.  Between November 1910 and 1917, a total of 18,919 land patents were issued for {{Convert|8933257|acre}} of land.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1949 26"/&gt;

Some observers question the success of the Kinkaid Act in bringing new settlers into the region. There were widespread reports by 1914 that 90% of Kinkaid patents were now in the hands of large stockmen.  Some argued that it was impossible to maintain a successful ranching operation in the region with only 640 acres of land.  However, many of these claims came from established cattle ranchers and industry representatives who were originally opposed to the Kinkaid Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grazing Homesteads and the Regulation of Grazing on the Public Lands: Hearing Before the Committee on the Public Lands|year=1915|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=253, 255, 274|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act%20grazing%20homesteads&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In congressional testimony from 1914, Moses Kinkaid reported that the sentiment of settlers in the region was that most of the claims remained in the hands of individual families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grazing Homesteads and the Regulation of Grazing on the Public Lands: Hearing Before the Committee on the Public Lands|year=1915|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act%20grazing%20homesteads&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;    He reported that the region experienced many small festivals every year where Kinkaid homesteaders would meet and display their agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grazing Homesteads and the Regulation of Grazing on the Public Lands: Hearing Before the Committee on the Public Lands|year=1915|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act%20grazing%20homesteads&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;    He described the average Kinkaid homesteader as a small family farmer:

{{quote|They get cows, so far as they are able, and they go into dairying – those that are able to buy cattle enough to go into the stock business do so.  They plow what we call the valleys ... They raise cane a good deal for feeding, and in some places alfalfa.}}

He estimated that the average Kinkaid homesteader had 15 to 40 head of cattle on 640 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grazing Homesteads and the Regulation of Grazing on the Public Lands: Hearing Before the Committee on the Public Lands|year=1915|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act%20grazing%20homesteads&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinkaid's observations were supported by a 1915 report compiled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|University of Nebraska]].  It was found that there were only {{Convert|200000|acre}} remaining in the public domain within the boundaries of the Kinkaid Act, and there were no sites that had 640 contiguous acres available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University of Nebraska|title=Bulletin of the Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska, no. 147|year=1915|location=Lincoln|pages=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A 1917 report from the Department of Interior looked at the first ten years of the Kinkaid Act, from 1904 to 1914.  It found the following results:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reports of the Department of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1916|year=1917|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVoPAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Areas in the hands of small holders: {{Convert|6422963|acre}}
*Areas in the hands of large holders: {{Convert|303553|acre}}
*Areas in the hands of original entrymen: {{Convert|4589871|acre}}
*Total area proved up: {{Convert|9726516|acre}}

The report showed that a majority of the land was in the hands of small holders, and approximately half the acreage was still owned by the original claimants.  The report also showed evidence of a general increase of economic activity for the region:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reports of the Department of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1916|year=1917|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|pages=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVoPAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Increase in value of cattle: 34 percent
*Increase in acres planted to rye: 92 percent
*Increase in acres planted to oats: 80 percent
*Increase in acres planted to corn: 102 percent
*Increase in acres planted to wheat: 142 percent
*Increase in voting population: 55 percent
*Total property valuations increased by 108 percent between 1904 and 1914, compared with 17 percent from 1892 to 1904

While the Kinkaid Act was able to produce an immediate burst in economic activity for the region, it was mostly temporary.  Many Kinkaid homesteaders eventually failed in their attempts to raise crops, usually selling out to large ranchers.  For example, there were 377 farms in [[Holt County, Nebraska|Holt County]] in 1913, but only 144 in 1914.  This pattern repeated itself throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ottoson|first=Howard|title=Land and People in the Northern Plains Transition Area|year=1979|publisher=Ayer Publishing|pages=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JN6XzcQtbUQC&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kinkaid Act was successful in removing land from the public domain, but its goal of populating the region with small family farms had mixed results.  Government officials were apparently pleased with the outcome of the Kinkaid Act, as it served as the blueprint for multiple other western land acts, most notably the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 and the [[Stock-Raising Homestead Act]] of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Opie|first=John|title=The Law of the Land: Two Hundred Years of American Farmland Policy|year=1987|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKjHUAJC_J8C&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=kinkaid%20act&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15406">The [[Danish Royal Family]] inhabit a range of residences around [[Denmark]]. Historically all the residences of the royal family were privately owned. With the introduction of the new Constitution in 1849, some of the residences were claimed as property of the "Kingdom of Denmark". Some of the palaces are still privately owned by the Queen or other members of the Royal Family. The Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties (the Danish equivalent of the [[Historic Royal Palaces|Historic Royal Palaces Agency]]) is responsible for the management and upkeep of some of the royal palaces and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal |title=Palaces |accessdate=2009-01-21  |publisher=The Danish monarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slke.dk/eng/ |title=Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties |accessdate=2013-06-27 |publisher=Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties (Denmark) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627040102/http://www.slke.dk/eng/ |archivedate=June 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish Royal Family traditionally occupy different royal residences during different seasons of the year. In summer, Queen Margarethe and Prince Henrik reside at [[Marselisborg Palace]] or [[Graasten Palace]]. In the winter, they reside at [[Amalienborg]], whereas their residence during spring and autumn is [[Fredensborg Palace]]. Sometimes members of the royal couple spend time on the Royal Yacht Dannebrog, especially when on official visits overseas and on summer cruises in Danish waters.

===Amalienborg Palace===
[[Image:Amalienborg slott 9.jpg|right|thumb|Amalienborg Palace]]
{{Main|Amalienborg Palace}}
Amalienborg Palace is the winter home of the monarch, and is located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It consists of four identical classicizing palace façades with [[rococo]] interiors around an octagonal courtyard; in the centre of the square is a monumental [[equestrian sculpture|equestrian statue]] of Amalienborg's founder, [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederik V]].

Amalienborg was originally built for four noble families; however, when [[Christiansborg Palace]] burnt down on 26 February 1794, the royal family bought the palaces and moved in. Over the years various kings and their families have resided in the four different palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_ama |title=Amalienborg Palace |accessdate=6 January 2009 |work= |publisher=The Danish Monarchy |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225132249/http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_ama |archivedate=25 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slke.dk/eng/castles/amalienborg/ |title=Amalienborg and Ameliehaven |accessdate=2013-06-27 |work= |publisher=Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026012339/http://www.slke.dk/eng/castles/amalienborg/ |archivedate=October 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Queen herself resides in ''Christian IX's Palace'' and the Crown Prince in ''Frederik VIII's Palace''. ''Christian VIII's Palace'' has apartments for other members of the royal family, whereas ''Christian VII's Palace'' is used for official events and to accommodate guests.

===Christiansborg Palace===
[[Image:Christiansborg, Copenhagen.jpg|right|thumb|Christiansborg Palace]]
{{Main|Christiansborg Palace}}
Historically, Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, was the main residence of the Danish kings. But after the fire of the [[Christiansborg Palace (1st)|first Christiansborg Palace]] in 1794, the royal family moved their residence to Amalienborg. However, even though the royal family does not reside in the palace, parts of Christiansborg has continued to be used by the monarch for official purposes and state ceremonies. It is the site of [[Audience (meeting)|public audiences]], meetings of the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]], [[state dinners]], receptions and other ceremonies. Also, the Royal Stables which provide the ceremonial transport by horse-drawn carriage for the royal family, is located here. The royal parts of the palace are open to the public when they are not in use for official purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/palaces/christiansborg-palace |title=Christiansborg Palace |accessdate=6 January 2012 |work= |publisher=The Danish Monarchy |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slke.dk/en/SlotteOgHaver/Slotte/ChristiansborgSlot.aspx |title=Christiansborg Palace |accessdate=2013-06-27 |work= |publisher=Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marselisborg Palace===
[[Image:Marselisborg3.jpg|thumb|200px|Marselisborg Palace.]]
{{Main|Marselisborg Palace}}
Marselisborg Palace is the summer residence of the royal family in [[Aarhus]]. Historically, the Palace was the property of the Marselis dynasty, its namesake. Marselisborg became a royal residence when Crown Prince Christian (later Christian X) and his consort Princess Alexandrine were given the Palace as a wedding present by the people of Denmark. As such the palace is the property of the Kingdom of Denmark, and will remain in possession of all future monarchs of Denmark. The royal couple used it as their summer residence. The building was rebuilt by the Danish architect [[Hack Kampmann]]. The present Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]] was given the palace by her father, King [[Frederick IX of Denmark]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_mar |title=Marselisborg Palace |accessdate=6 January 2009 |work= |publisher=The Danish Monarchy |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225132754/http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_mar |archivedate=25 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermitage Lodge===
{{Main|Hermitage Hunting Lodge}}
The '''Eremitage Hunting Lodge''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: {{lang|da|Eremitageslottet}} or {{lang|da|Eremitagen}}) is located in [[Dyrehaven]] north of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It was built by architect [[Lauritz de Thurah]] in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style from 1734 to 1736 for [[Christian VI of Denmark]] in order to host banquets during royal hunts in Dyrehaven.

Never intended for residence, the Eremitage was built as a setting for hosting royal banquets during hunts in Dyrehaven, which surrounds the building. It originally featured a hoisting apparatus able to raise the table from the basement to the dining room, allowing the king and his guests to dine without any waiters present, or ''"en ermitage"'' (in solitude), hence the name of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sestoft|first=Jørgen|author2=Christiansen, Jørgen Hegner |title=Guide til dansk arkitektur 1 - år 1000-1960|origyear=1991|edition=2.|year=1995|publisher=Arkitektens Forlag|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|isbn=87-7407-158-0|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparatus was removed in the late 18th century as it was causing endless mechanical problems,&lt;ref name=ses&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slke.dk/eng/palaces-and-gardens/the-hermitage/ |title=The Eremitage Hunting Lodge |accessdate=2007-03-25 |date=2005-12-01 |publisher=Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518182304/http://www.ses.dk/398955f0 |archivedate=2007-05-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and no signs of it remain.&lt;ref name=christiansen158&gt;{{cite book|last=Christiansen|first=Torben|title=Dyrehaven|year=2005|publisher=Politikens Forlag|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|isbn=87-567-7250-5|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous building on the site, the Hubertus Chalet, had a similar apparatus and was nicknamed {{lang|da|Heremitagen}} for the same reason.&lt;ref name=bauditz10&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauditz|first=Ove |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Jagtslottet Eremitagen i Jægersborg Dyrehave 1736-1936|series= |year=1936|publisher=Det Berlingske Bogtrykkeri|location=Copenhagen|language=Danish|pages=10|chapter=Eremitagen 1736-1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sorgenfri Palace===
[[File:Sorgenfri.jpg|thumb|Sorgenfri Palace]]
{{main|Sorgenfri Palace}}
Sorgenfri Palace is a royal residence of the Danish monarch located in the [[Lyngby-Taarbæk]] municipality in [[Copenhagen|Greater Copenhagen]]. 
Originally a country seat, Sorgenfri Palace was built for the Danish nobleman Count Carl Ahlefeldt in 1706. The palace first became a royal residence in 1730 after coming into the possession of the Danish Royal Family.

Sorgenfri was the preferred summer residence of King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] and his wife Queen [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Alexandrine]]. Both of Alexandrine's children [[Frederik IX of Denmark|Frederik]] and his brother, [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Knud]], were born there. Both Knud and his wife [[Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark|Caroline-Mathilde]] lived at Sorgenfri Palace until their respective deaths in 1976 and 1995.

Today the palace is closed to the public but the palace gardens are accessible when the monarch is not in residence. [[Anne Dorte of Rosenborg|Countess Anne-Dorte]], the widow of [[Count Christian of Rosenborg]] (a younger son of Prince Knud), presently resides in a wing of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slke.dk/eng/palaces-and-gardens/sorgenfri-palace/ |title=Sorgenfri Palace and Palace gardens |accessdate=2013-06-27 |publisher=Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties (Denmark) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026012410/http://www.slke.dk/eng/palaces-and-gardens/sorgenfri-palace/ |archivedate=October 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_sor |title=Sorgenfri Palace |accessdate=2009-01-20 |publisher=Danish monarchy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225132311/http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_sor |archivedate=2008-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Château de Cayx===
{{main|Château de Cayx}}
Château de Cayx is a residence of the [[Danish Royal Family]] located in the wine district of [[Cahors]] in southern [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website|url=http://www.chateau-de-cayx.com/|publisher=Chateau de Cayx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The château was first fortified during the fourteenth century. Since then it has been rebuilt and renovated several times. The Lefrancs built the extensive wine cellars under the château. 

The [[phylloxera]] infestation devastated the vineyards during the late nineteenth century, and the owners emigrated to [[Indo-China]]. They did not return to Europe until 1955. In 1965 the family's heir, [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri Marie Jean André de Laborde de Monpezat]], married [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Princess Margrethe]], then [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] to the Danish throne, becoming Prince Consort of Denmark after she succeeded to [[Denmark]]'s throne.

The royal couple purchased the château and the estate in 1974. Since then they have renovated it extensively. According to the official website of the [[Danish monarchy]], the residence has become a "relaxed setting for reunions of the entire Danish Royal Family and their French relatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_caix |title=Château de Cayx |accessdate=2009-01-22 |publisher=The Danish monarchy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225132742/http://kongehuset.dk/publish.php?dogtag=k_en_pal_caix |archivedate=2008-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the setting for holiday photocalls for the Danish Royal Family, including for Prince Henrik's 80th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caption:LUZECH, FRANCE - JUNE 11: Danish Royal Family of Denmark attends a Photocall at Chateau de Cayx on June 11, 2014 in Luzech, France.

The residence is not open to the public. A guided tour of the gardens is available during the summer. The château still produces wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chateau de Cayx|url=http://www.myfrenchwinecellar.com/wine-makers/chateau-de-cayx/|publisher=My French Wine Cellar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]], otherwise known by the acronym ALEC, is a non-profit 501(c) political organization established in 1975. The legislative members are state and federal legislators. It is a forum to allow the members to write model laws and discuss legislative language with other members. ALEC meetings are an opportunity for the corporate and non-profit leaders to meet and provide feedback to legislators. Member legislators can then use the model bills as templates for their own bills.

Members here are listed as former members by virtue of the end of their terms in office of the various state legislatures, a necessary qualifier for membership in ALEC.  None of these former members resigned from ALEC.  See [[List of former members of the American Legislative Exchange Council#Resigned legislative members|Resigned legislative members]] for the individuals who have announced they are no longer members by choice.

ALEC keeps its membership, activities and communications confidential. This list includes former members whose identity primarily has become known through internal documents revealed to [[Common Cause]] and by research by members of the press.

[[Image:The Capture of William Joyce, Germany, 1945 BU6910.jpg|thumb|1945: [[William Joyce]] lies in an ambulance under armed guard before being taken from [[British Second Army#Germany, 1945|British Second Army]] Headquarters to a hospital.]]

'''Lord Haw-Haw''' was a nickname applied to the Irish-American [[William Joyce]], who broadcast Nazi propaganda to Britain from Germany during the [[Second World War]]. The broadcasts opened with "Germany calling, Germany calling", spoken in an affected upper-class English accent.

The same nickname was also applied to some other broadcasters of [[English language]] propaganda from Germany, but it is Joyce with whom the name is now overwhelmingly identified. There are various theories about its origin.

==Aim of broadcasts==
The English language propaganda radio programme ''[[Germany Calling]]'' was broadcast to audiences in the United Kingdom on the [[medium wave]] station [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk|Reichssender Hamburg]] and by [[shortwave]] to the United States. The programme began on 18 September 1939 and continued until 30 April 1945, when the British Army overran [[Hamburg]]. The next scheduled broadcast was made by Horst Pinschewer (aka Geoffrey Perry), a German refugee serving in the British Army who announced the British takeover. Pinschewer was later responsible for the capture of William Joyce.&lt;ref name="Horst Pinschewer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natgeotv.com.au/tv/churchills-german-army/geoffrey-perry.aspx |title=Churchill's German Army |work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through such broadcasts, the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] attempted to discourage and demoralise American, Australian, British, and Canadian troops, and the British population, to suppress the effectiveness of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort through propaganda, and to motivate the Allies to agree to peace terms leaving the Nazi regime intact and in power. Among many techniques used, the Nazi broadcasts reported on the shooting down of Allied aircraft and the sinking of Allied ships, presenting discouraging reports of high losses and casualties among Allied forces. Although the broadcasts were well known to be Nazi propaganda, they frequently offered the only details available from behind enemy lines concerning the fate of friends and relatives who did not return from bombing raids over Germany. As a result, Allied troops and civilians frequently listened to Lord Haw-Haw's broadcasts despite the sometimes infuriating content and frequent inaccuracies and exaggerations, in the hopes of learning clues about the fate of Allied troops and air crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stourton|first1=Edward|title=Auntie's War|date=2015|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780857523327|pages=75-86}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mass Observation]] interviews warned the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] of this; consequently, more attention was given to the official reports of British military casualties.&lt;ref name="Freedman1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Jean R.|title=Whistling in the dark: memory and culture in wartime London|year=1999|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Ky|isbn=0-8131-2076-4|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the name==
Radio critic [[Jonah Barrington (journalist)|Jonah Barrington]] of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' applied the phrase in describing a German broadcaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = J. W. | contribution = William Joyce | page = 80 | title = Famous Trials | volume = 4 | editor1-last = Hodge | editor1-first = James H. | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | publication-date = 1954 | quote = Usually, the inventor of a popular nickname is unidentifiable, but the 'onlie begetter' of Lord Haw-Haw was undoubtedly Mr Jonah Barrington, then of the ''Daily Express''… | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to reduce his possible impact: "He speaks English of the haw-haw, dammit-get-out-of-my-way-variety".&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (1999: 43)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farndale, Nigel. ''Haw-Haw: The Tragedy of William and Margaret Joyce'', 2005 ({{ISBN|0-333-98992-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the name probably came from the announcers using such verbiage as "So you English believe that you can defeat the superior German forces! Haw, Haw," a low-brow putdown obviously meant as a discouragement to the opposition. The "Haw, Haw" name reference was then applied to a number of different announcers and, even soon after Barrington coined the nickname, it was uncertain exactly which specific German broadcaster he was describing.&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;{{Harvnb|Doherty|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some British media and listeners just used "Lord Haw-Haw" as a generic term to describe all English-language German broadcasters, although other nicknames, like "Sinister Sam", were occasionally used by the BBC to distinguish between obviously different speakers. Poor reception may have contributed to some listeners' difficulties in distinguishing between broadcasters.&lt;ref name="Kenny"&gt;[[Mary Kenny|Kenny, Mary]] (2004) ''Germany Calling – A Personal Biography of Lord Haw-Haw, William Joyce'' {{cite web |url=http://www.mary-kenny.com/germany_calling_lord_haw_haw.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221072851/http://www.mary-kenny.com/germany_calling_lord_haw_haw.htm |archivedate=21 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to the nickname, American pro-Nazi broadcaster [[Frederick Wilhelm Kaltenbach|Fred W. Kaltenbach]] was given the moniker ''Lord Hee-Haw'' by the British media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.traces.org/kaltenbach.html|title=Goebbel’s Iowan: Frederick W. Kaltenbach and Nazi Short-Wave Radio Broadcasts to America, 1939-1945|last=Laurie|first=Clayton D.|date=|website=Traces|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110145515/http://www.traces.org/kaltenbach.html|archive-date=10 November 2017|dead-url=yes|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lord Hee-Haw'' name, however, was used for a time by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' to refer to Lord Haw-Haw, generating some confusion between nicknames and broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Haw-Haw &amp; William Joyce: the full story'', Faber &amp; Faber, 1964, page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcers associated with the nickname==
A number of announcers could have been Lord Haw-Haw:
* [[Wolf Mittler]] was a German journalist. Mittler spoke near-flawless English, which he had learned from his mother, who had been born of German parents in Ireland. His persona was described by some listeners as similar to the fictional aristocrat [[Bertie Wooster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0204/1224263734268.html Germany calls again as Lord Haw-Haw goes online], The Irish Times, 4 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly finding political matters distasteful, he was relieved to be replaced by [[Norman Baillie-Stewart]], who stated that Mittler "sounded almost like a caricature of an Englishman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doherty|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that it was Mittler's voice which Barrington described; if so it would make him the original Lord Haw-Haw.&lt;ref name="Doherty" /&gt; In 1943, Mittler was deemed suspect and arrested by the [[Gestapo]], but he managed to escape to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tebito.de/index.php/vmchk/Wolf-Mittler/Hoerbucher-/-Lesungen/Verstummt-und-abgetaucht.html Kultur as Bayern].&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he worked extensively for German radio and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvprogramme.net/60/1960/19600329.htm |title=Programm vom Dienstag, den 29. März 1960 |publisher=Tvprogramme.net |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Norman Baillie-Stewart]] was a former officer of the [[Seaforth Highlanders]] who was [[Cashiering|cashiered]] for selling secrets to Nazi Germany. He worked as a broadcaster in Germany for a short time in 1939. He was jailed for five years by the British after the war. For a time he claimed that he was the original Lord Haw-Haw. He did have an upper-class accent, but he later decided that it was probably Mittler whose voice Barrington had heard. He may have been the broadcaster the BBC referred to as "Sinister Sam".&lt;ref name="Doherty"/&gt;
* Eduard Dietze, a [[Glasgow]]-born broadcaster of a mixed German-British-[[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] family background,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doherty|2000|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another possible, but less likely, candidate for the original Lord Haw-Haw.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt; He was one of the English-speaking announcers with an "upper-crust accent" who were heard on German radio in the early days of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doherty|2000|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* James R. Clark was a young English broadcaster and a friend of William Joyce.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt; Clark and his pro-Nazi mother, Mrs. Dorothy Eckersley, were both tried for treason after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doherty|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Eckersley was born Dorothy Stephen in 1893. She later married Edward Clark, a musician, and had a son, James Clark, who was born in 1923. She divorced her first husband and was married to [[Peter Eckersley (engineer)|Peter Eckersley]], a senior figure working in the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). After ten years of marriage to Peter Eckersley, Dorothy's increasing interest in German [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and Fascism led her to move to Germany with her son, enrolling him (by then aged 17 years) in a German school. Following this move, "...Dorothy Eckersley came to play a key role in William Joyce's fate in Berlin..."&lt;ref&gt;page 152 of Mary Kenny's biography on Lord Haw Haw "Germany Calling" (https://mary-kenny.com/books/germany-calling/) Furthermore [ref. page 192] "Dorothy Eckersley...a [Fascist] political radical... with her connections got William Joyce hired by German Radio". As for her son [ref. page 192] "...James Clark had a teenage enthusiasm for Adolf Hitler, and also worked at the Rundfunk as a newsreader..."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Joyce ===
{{Main|William Joyce}}
William Joyce replaced Mittler in 1939. Joyce was American-born and raised in Ireland and as a teenager he was an informant to the British forces about the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|IRA]] members during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. He was also a senior member of the [[British Union of Fascists]] and fled England when tipped off about his planned internment on 26 August 1939. In October 1939, the Fascist newspaper [[Action (newspaper)|Action]] identified "one of the subsidiary announcers" on German radio, "with a marked nasal intonation", as one of its former members and distanced itself from him as a "renegade", whose broadcasts were "likely only to rouse the fighting ire of the average Briton.".&lt;ref&gt;''German Radio Announcer." In: [[Action (newspaper)|Action]], 12 October 1939, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''German Radio." In: [[Action (newspaper)|Action]], 19 October 1939, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1940, the BBC noted that the Lord Haw-Haw of the early war days (possibly Mittler) was now rarely heard on the air and had been replaced by a new spokesman. Joyce was the main German broadcaster in English for most of the war, and became a naturalised German citizen; he is usually regarded as Lord Haw-Haw, even though he was probably not the person to whom the term originally referred. He had a peculiar hybrid accent that was not of the conventional upper class variety. His distinctive nasal pronunciation of "Germany calling, Germany calling" may have been the result of a fight as a schoolboy that left him with a broken nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wharam|1995|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce, initially an anonymous broadcaster like the others, eventually revealed his real name to his listeners. The Germans actually capitalised on the fame of the Lord Haw-Haw nickname and came to announce him as "William Joyce, otherwise known as Lord Haw-Haw".&lt;ref name="Doherty"/&gt;

== Later history and aftermath ==
After Joyce took over, Mittler was paired with the American-born announcer [[Mildred Gillars]] in the [[Axis Sally]] programme and also broadcast to [[ANZAC]] forces in North Africa. Mittler survived the war and appeared on postwar German radio, and occasionally television, until his death. Baillie-Stewart was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Joyce was captured by British forces in northern Germany just as the war ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=THE OCCUPATION: Renegade's Return |date=11 June 1945 |journal=Time |volume=XLV |issue=24 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775821,00.html |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; tried, and eventually [[hanging|hanged]] for [[treason]] on 3 January 1946. Joyce's defence team, appointed by the court, argued that, as an American citizen and naturalised German, Joyce could not be convicted of treason against the [[British Crown]]. However, the [[prosecution]] successfully argued that, since he had lied about his nationality to obtain a British passport and voted in Britain, Joyce owed allegiance to the king.

As J. A. Cole has written, "the British public would not have been surprised if, in that Flensburg wood, Haw-Haw had carried in his pocket a secret weapon capable of annihilating an armoured brigade". This mood was reflected in the wartime film ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'' (1942), starring [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]], in which Joyce's broadcasts are shown to predict actual disasters and defeats, thus seriously undermining British morale.

==Other British subjects who broadcast==
Other British subjects willingly made propaganda broadcasts, including [[Raymond Davies Hughes]], who broadcast on the German [[Radio Metropole (Germany)|Radio Metropole]], and [[John Amery]]. [[P. G. Wodehouse]] was tricked into broadcasting, not propaganda, but rather his own satiric accounts of his capture by the Germans and civil internment as an enemy alien, by a German friend who assured him that the talks would be broadcast only to neutral United States. They were, however, relayed to the UK on a little-known channel. An [[MI5]] investigation, conducted shortly after Wodehouse's release from Germany, but published only after his death, found no evidence of treachery.&lt;ref&gt;Iain Sproat, 'Wodehouse, Sir Pelham Grenville (1881–1975)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
*In the 1940s, actor [[Geoffrey Sumner]] played Lord Haw-Haw for laughs in a series of [[Pathé]] Gazette short subjects named ''"Nasti" News From Lord Haw-Haw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=24396|title="Nasti" News from Lord Haw Haw|date=25 January 1940|work=British Pathé historical archive|publisher=British Pathé|accessdate=8 March 2011|location=London}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The feature film ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'' (1942) combines elements of the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] story "[[His Last Bow (story)|His Last Bow]]" and loosely parallels the real-life activities of Lord Haw-Haw.
*The propaganda cartoon ''[[Tokio Jokio]]'' (1943) has a scene with an anthropomorphic donkey (wearing a suit and a [[monocle]] in one eye) reading a radio broadcast. The sign on his desk reads "Lord Hee Haw, Chief Wind-Bag".
*In the RKO feature, ''[[Passport to Destiny]]'' (1944), [[Gavin Muir (American actor)|Gavin Muir]] plays Herr Joyce / Lord Haw, although he is constantly referred to as Lord Haw, rather than Lord Haw-Haw.
*In various scenes in the World War II film ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' (1949), they have Lord Haw Haw broadcasts, playing to "General" [[Gregory Peck]] and his bomber group. It was a vocal recreation by [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] (uncredited) for the film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*The World War II film ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967) includes a propaganda broadcast by an English-accented person said to be Lord Haw-Haw.
*The World War II film ''[[The Thousand Plane Raid]]'' (1969) includes a propaganda broadcast by an English-accented person said to be Lord Haw-Haw.

*In the novels ''[[Flashman (novel)|Flashman]]'' (1969) and ''[[Flashman at the Charge]]'' (1973), from the series of historical novels by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], the main character [[Harry Flashman]] refers to [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan]], who led the disastrous [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], as "Lord Haw-Haw" due to his tendency to sprinkle his conversation with the phrase "haw-haw".

In the United Kingdom, '''National Government''' is an abstract concept of a coalition of some or all [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom#Major parties|major political parties]]. In a historical sense it usually refers primarily to the governments of [[Ramsay MacDonald]], [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] which held office from 1931 until 1940.

The all-party coalitions of [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] and [[David Lloyd George]] in the [[First World War]] and of [[Winston Churchill]] in the [[Second World War]] were sometimes referred to as National Governments at the time, but are now more commonly called Coalition Governments. The term "National Government" was chosen to dissociate itself from negative connotations of the earlier Coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=25 August 1931|title=MacDonald forms a coalition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/25/archive-1931-macdonald-forms-coalition|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[John Buchan|Buchan]]|first1=John|title=The Gap in the Curtain|date=1932|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|page=162|quote="A Coalition...only shares the loot, but a national government pools the brains."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill's brief 1945 "Caretaker Government" also called itself a National Government and in terms of party composition was very similar to the 1931–1940 entity.

==Crisis of 1931==
{{Main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:(James) Ramsay MacDonald by Solomon Joseph Solomon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]] was Prime Minister for the first four years of National Government]]

The [[Wall Street Crash]] heralded the global [[Great Depression]] and Britain was hit, although not as badly as most countries. The government was trying to achieve several different, contradictory objectives: trying to maintain Britain's economic position by maintaining the [[Pound (sterling)|pound]] on the [[gold standard]], balancing the [[United Kingdom budget|budget]], and providing assistance and relief to tackle unemployment. The gold standard meant that British prices were higher than its competitors, so the all-important export industries did poorly.

In 1931 the situation deteriorated and there was much fear that the budget was unbalanced, which was born out by the independent [[May Report]] which triggered a confidence crisis and a run on the pound. The [[History of the British Labour Party#Second Labour government 1929-1931|Labour government]] agreed in principle to make changes in taxation and to cut expenditure to balance the budget and restore confidence. However the Cabinet could not agree on the two options available: either introduce tariffs (taxes on imports) or make 20% cuts in [[unemployment benefit]]. In the end, MacDonald and Snowden drafted a proposal that would cut benefits by 10%. Even this was rejected by the Trade Unions, however. When a final vote was taken, the Cabinet was split 11-9 with a minority, including many political heavyweights such as [[Arthur Henderson]] and [[George Lansbury]], threatening to resign rather than agree. The unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, made the government resign.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Riddell, ''Labour in Crisis: The Second Labour Government 1929-1931'' (Manchester UP, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wrigley, "The Fall of the Second MacDonald Government, 1931." in T.  Heppell and K. Theakston,  ''How Labour Governments Fall'' (Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2013) pp. 38-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial crisis grew worse and decisive government action was needed as the leaders of both the Conservative and Liberal Parties met with [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and MacDonald, at first to discuss support for the measures to be taken but later to discuss the shape of the next government. MacDonald had originally wished to tender his resignation but was told to re-consider by the King on the grounds that the majority of opposition MPs and the country at large supported the cuts proposed by the [[May Report]], even if the  Labour Party and the Trade Unions led by [[Ernest Bevin]] did not. MacDonald duly changed his mind during the night and met with the Conservative and Liberal MPs the following morning. On 24 August, MacDonald agreed and formed a National Government composed of men from all parties with the specific aim of balancing the Budget and restoring confidence. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called "[[National Labour Organisation|National Labour Party]]") who stood  with MacDonald, plus four Conservatives (led by Baldwin and Chamberlain) and two Liberals. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and made Henderson the leader of the main Labour party. Henderson led it into [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|the general election]] on 27 October against the three-party National coalition. It was a disaster for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52.  MacDonald won the largest landslide in British political history.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Thorpe, "Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931." ''Historical Journal'' 31#1 (1988): 117-139. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639239 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Smart, ''The National Government, 1931–40'' (Macmillan Education UK, 1999) pp. 9-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==
{{main|National Government (1931)}}
The Government was initially applauded by most, but the Labour Party were left in a state of confusion with the loss of several of their most prominent figures, and MacDonald, [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]] and [[James Henry Thomas]] did little to explain themselves, with the result that the Labour Party soon swung fully against the government. This was in part because of the Trade Unions' decision to oppose all forms of cuts proposed by MacDonald and Snowden in response to the [[May Report]], which had concluded the UK government needed to curb government expenditure to reduce the budget deficit amid the fallout from the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929. The May Report in particular recommended to MacDonald that his Labour government cut unemployment benefit by 20%. The Trade Unions that represented a large proportion of the Labour party's base refused to support any cuts to benefits or wages except to "the salaries of Ministers". Efforts to bring public expenditure cuts produced further problems, including a mutiny in the [[Royal Navy]] over pay cuts (the [[Invergordon Mutiny]]), with the result that the [[pound sterling]] came under renewed pressure, and the government was forced to take the radical step of taking the pound off the [[gold standard]] altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars: 1918-1945'' (1955) pp 413–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate then broke out about further steps to tackle the economic problems. At the same time the Labour Party officially expelled all of its members who supported the National Government, including MacDonald. Increasingly, the majority of the Cabinet came to believe that a protective tariff was necessary to support British industry and provide revenue and that a general election should be fought to secure a mandate but this was anathema to the Liberal Party. The Liberals' acting leader and [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]], fought in Cabinet against an election but found the Liberal Party dividing in several directions over the course of action. One group, under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] emerged as the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]], was prepared to accept the tariff and expressed willingness to take the place of the main Liberals in the government. The party's official leader, [[David Lloyd George]] was incapacitated at this time but called for the Liberals to abandon the government altogether and stand independently in defence of [[free trade]], but his call was heeded only by four other MPs, all of whom were his close relatives.

It was eventually agreed that the government as a whole would seek a "Doctor's Mandate" to take a free hand and that each party would issue its own manifesto. Supporters of MacDonald formed the [[National Labour Organisation]] and the parties agreed to allow their local organisations to agree whether or not to oppose each other. The government was opposed by the Labour Party, Lloyd George and his Liberals and the [[New Party (Oswald Mosley)|New Party]] of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]. Within the parties there was particular conflict between the Conservatives and Liberals. The campaign for the 1931 general election run by the National Government was based mainly on fear of a repeat of events, which had occurred in Germany during the start of Great Depression, in Britain, and MacDonald famously waved worthless German Deutschemarks to emphasise the point. The result of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] was the greatest landslide ever, the National Government winning a total of 556 seats and a Parliamentary majority of 500.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Thorpe, "The British General Election of 1931" (Oxford UP, 1991) [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198202189.001.0001/acprof-9780198202189 online]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stanley Baldwin 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stanley Baldwin]] was a dominant figure from the outset of National Government. He became Prime Minister when MacDonald retired]] As few Labour MPs refused to abandon the wishes of the Trade Unionists led by [[Ernest Bevin]], the support for the re-elected National Government was heavily Conservative.

==1931–1935==
{{Main|National Government (1931–1935)}}
Although the Conservatives had a bare majority in Cabinet of 11, compared to 9 non-Conservatives, the former held comparatively few of the most important jobs. The two groups of Liberals were similarly unbalanced in terms of posts, the official Liberals holding one more seat than the National Liberals, despite the parliamentary position being reversed. That balance was to cause tensions, particularly as the [[Diehard Conservatism|Diehard]] wing of the Conservative party felt unrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Ball,  "The Conservative Party and the Formation of the National Government: August 1931." ''Historical Journal'' 29#1 (1986): 159-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government entered protracted wrangling over whether or not to introduce tariffs. Both the Liberals and Snowden found it particularly difficult to accept but were in a heavy minority. However, both MacDonald and Baldwin wished to maintain the multiparty nature of the Government. On the suggestion of Hailsham, it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs while remaining in government. This would hold for some months.&lt;ref&gt;David Marquand, ''Ramsay MacDonald'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald MacLean]] died. MacDonald came under pressure not to merely appoint another Liberal, particularly as it was felt that they would be over-represented, and so instead appointed the Conservative [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]] (later Lord Halifax). Further tensions emerged over the [[Ottawa Agreement]], which set up a series of tariff agreements within the [[British Empire]], and the remaining Liberals and Snowden resigned their ministerial posts although they continued to support the government from the backbenches for another year. MacDonald considered resigning as well to allow a party government to take office but was persuaded to remain even though his health was now in decline. In domestic politics, he increasingly allowed Baldwin to give a lead, but in foreign affairs, the main direction was determined by MacDonald and Simon.

The most prominent policy of the National Government in the early 1930s was the proposal to introduce [[Indian Home Rule]], a measure fiercely opposed by the [[Diehard Conservatism|Diehard]] wing of the Conservative party, with [[Winston Churchill]] one of the most open opponents. The bill was fiercely opposed but eventually passed in 1947 in very different circumstances.

==Baldwin takes over==
{{main|National Government (1935–1937)}}
With MacDonald's health failing, he retired as Prime Minister in June 1935, to be succeeded by Baldwin.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Middlemas and A.J.L. Barnes, ''Baldwin: a biography'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly foreign affairs were coming to dominate political discourse and in November Baldwin led the government to victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]] on a platform of support for the [[League of Nations]] and sanctions against Italy for invading [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. The following month a massive storm developed when it emerged that the new Foreign Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], had negotiated the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] which proposed to cede most of Abyssinia to Italy. Many were outraged, including many government MPs, and the agreement was dropped and Hoare sacked, though he later returned to government.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Doerr, ''British foreign policy, 1919-1939'' (Manchester UP, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  The government sponsored a series of conferences to enable more home rule in India and other colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Mawby, "The Transformation and Decline of the British Empire: Decolonisation After the First World War" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin's last years in office were seen as a period of drift, but in late 1936 he achieved a notable triumph in resolving the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]] without major repercussions. Baldwin took the opportunity of [[George VI]]'s coronation as an opportune moment to retire.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Ching, "Stanley Baldwin's speech on the abdication of Edward VIII." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 42.2 (1956): 163-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peacetime government of Neville Chamberlain==
{{main|National Government (1937–1939)}}
[[File:Neville Chamberlain by William Orpen - 1929.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Neville Chamberlain]] had succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister in 1937]]

[[Neville Chamberlain]] was seen by many as the only possible successor to Baldwin, and his appointment as Prime Minister was widely credited with bringing a new dynamism to the government. With a strong track record as a radical [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and competent [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] many expected Chamberlain to provide a strong lead in domestic affairs and here the government had a number of successes, such as over the nationalisation of coal mining royalties, the curtailing of excess working hours by the Factory Act and much [[slum clearance]]. Another success was the [[1938 Holidays with Pay Act]], which gave a fortnight's paid holiday a year to workers, starting in 1939. The school leaving age was also to be increased from Autumn 1939, but was deferred as war loomed. Further reforms were curtailed by the increased international tension which came to occupy most of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Self, ''Neville Chamberlain: a biography'' (Ashgate, 2006) pp 261-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign affairs, the government sought to increase Britain's armaments, while maintaining the unity of the Empire and [[Dominion]]s and preventing any one power from becoming dominant on the continent of Europe. These proved increasingly difficult to reconcile, as many Dominions were reluctant to support Britain in the event of her going to war, and so military action risked splitting the Empire. Chamberlain took a strong personal lead in foreign affairs and sought to bring about peaceful revision of European frontiers in areas where many commentators had long-acknowledged grievances. In this, he received much popular support at the time, but the policy has been much attacked since. The most prominent point in the policy of [[appeasement]] came in September 1938, when the [[Munich Agreement]] was negotiated. Following the agreement, the government sped up the re-armament process in the hope of being ready for war when it came. At the same time, it took a tougher line in foreign affairs, including making a guarantee to defend [[Poland]] against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Cowling, ''The Impact of Hitler: British Politics and British Policy, 1933-1940'' (Cambridge UP, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak of war==
{{Main|Chamberlain war ministry|Churchill war ministry}}
When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Britain declared war in tandem with France, supported by all of the Dominions except [[Irish Free State|Ireland]]. For some time there had been calls to expand Chamberlain's war ministry by bringing in members of the official Labour and Liberal parties but the latter refused to join. For the first few months of war Britain saw comparatively little action apart from at sea, but the failure of the [[Norwegian campaign]] led to a massive outcry in Parliament.

[[File:Winston Churchill cph.3b13157.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill]] succeeded Chamberlain in 1940. He served as Prime Minister for [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|most of the Second World War]].]]
On 7 and 8 May 1940, a two-day debate took place in Parliament, known to history as the [[Norway Debate]]. Initially a discussion of what had gone wrong in that field, it soon turned into a general debate on the conduct of the war with fierce criticism expressed by all sides of the House. The government won the debate, albeit with a reduced majority, but over the next two days it became increasingly clear that Labour and the Liberals would have to be brought into government and that Chamberlain was unable to achieve this. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the [[Low Countries]] and Chamberlain finally bowed to pressure and resigned, bringing the life of the National Government to a close. It was succeeded by an all-party coalition headed by [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Smith, ''Britain and 1940: history, myth and popular memory'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caretaker government of 1945==
{{Main|Churchill caretaker ministry}}
In May 1945, following the defeat of Germany the coalition government broke up and Churchill formed a new administration, including Conservatives, Liberal Nationals and various non-party individuals who had been previously appointed to Ministerial posts. However, significantly, with the exception of the [[Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]], there were no other Liberal Nationals in the Cabinet, excluding even the Lord Chancellor Lord Simon. This government nevertheless used the title '''National Government''' and could be seen as the heir to the 1930s governments, even though the personnel were very different. The government fought the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] as a National Government but lost.

Following the defeat, elements of the old National Government 'all party coalition' idea continued with [[Sir John Anderson]] (elected as a National MP) and [[Gwilym Lloyd-George]], a former Liberal MP who now sat as an Independent Liberal, occupying important positions in Churchill's [[Shadow Cabinet]] team. In addition the Liberal Nationals ([[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] from 1947–48 onwards) also kept a semi-separate existence and did not finally disappear until 1968, the last political legacy of what happened in the crisis of August 1931.

The '''Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy''' ('''NIMD'''; [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nederlands Instituut voor Meerpartijendemocratie'') works to promote peaceful, just and inclusive politics worldwide. NIMD's approach is characterized by dialogue, which it facilitates for actors across the political spectrum at the local, national and regional level. The organization's values are based on inclusiveness, pluralism and equality, and it supports joint initiatives of political parties and other stakeholders to improve the functioning of [[Multi-party system|multiparty]] democracies around the world.

The institute was founded in 2000 by seven parties across the Dutch political spectrum ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]], [[Dutch Labour Party|PvdA]], [[VVD]], [[Groenlinks]], [[Democrats 66]], [[Christen Unie]] and [[Reformed Political Party|SGP]]). Former [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Minister of Defence]], [[Eimert van Middelkoop]], is Chair of the Supervisory Council of NIMD.

==Activities==
NIMD currently works with over 150 political parties from more than 20 countries in Africa, Latin America, the MENA region, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Programmes NIMD |url=http://nimd.org/nimd-programmes/|accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute promotes interparty dialogue between politicians, providing the opportunity to build trust and create mutual relationship among political parties. Moreover, interparty dialogue can create [[consensus]] and help to find solutions to challenges. NIMD also uses dialogue to create a safe meeting space for politicians and parties to meet and adopt policies to reform their nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.peacefmonline.com/pages/news/201507/247058.php IEA Holds Joint Symposium On Interparty Dialogue With African Political Party Leaders], Peace FM,Ameyaw Adu Gyamfi,7 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A core part of NIMD's work is its Democracy Schools. The organization sets up Democracy Schools around the world, which run courses for young and aspiring politicians who want to gain knowledge and skills on democratic theory and governance. The schools also provide specialized training for established politicians seeking learn about areas such as legislative drafting, debate techniques and internal party democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nimd.org/democracy-school/|title=Democracy School {{!}} NIMD|website=nimd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some alumni of NIMD's Democracy School programmes have later entered public office and passed legislation in areas such as campaign finance transparency and the prevention of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nimd.org/annual-report/annual-report-2017/|title=ANNUAL REPORT 2017 {{!}} NIMD|website=nimd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through all its programmes, NIMD aims to promote the political participation of youth and women. NIMD strives to give these and other marginalized groups a seat at the table by, for example, promoting gender parity in its activities, and helping parties to break down internal barriers to the participation of minorities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nimd.org/programmes/gender/|title=Diversity and Gender Equality {{!}} NIMD|website=nimd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Netroots Nation''' is a political [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] for American [[Progressivism|progressive]] political activists, originally organized by readers and writers of [[Daily Kos]], a liberal political [[blog]].  It was previously called '''YearlyKos'''.

==Upcoming conference==
Netroots Nation 2019 will be held July 11-13 in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=John |title=Netroots Nation going to Philadelphia in 2019 |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2018/08/netroots-nation-going-to-philadelphia-in-2019.html |website=www.bizjournals.com |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Helen Gym / Netroots Nation 2019 Philadelphia Announcement |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4743548/helen-gym-netroots-nation-2019-philadelphia-announcement |website=C-SPAN.org |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Pennsylvania Convention Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Netroots Nation 2019 to be held at PA Convention Center {{!}} PA Convention |url=https://www.paconvention.com/news/detail/netroots-nation-2019-to-be-held-at-pa-convention-center |website=www.paconvention.com |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past conferences==

===2006===
[[File:YearlyKos 2006 (165474190).jpg|thumb|[[Ice sculpture]] at the first convention]]
The first YearlyKos was held in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], from June 8–11, 2006. It was held at the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera Hotel and Casino]] There were 1,200 attendees, and featured prominent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] such as [[Harry Reid]], [[Howard Dean]], and [[Barbara Boxer]], as well as three possible contenders in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primary]]:  retired General [[Wesley Clark]], [[New Mexico]] governor [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]], and former [[Virginia]] governor [[Mark Warner]].

The convention also consisted of panels, roundtable discussion groups, and other gatherings of activists, members of the media and elected officials. Democracy for America and the Center for American Progress were among the groups offering training sessions. Many of the panels were broadcast on [[C-SPAN]].

The convention also received a significant amount of coverage in the traditional media, including a write-up in the New York Times that said this event “seems on its way to becoming as much a part of the Democratic political circuit as the Iowa State Fair.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/10/us/10bloggers.html|title=Gathering Highlights Power of the Blog|last=Nagourney|first=Adam|date=June 10, 2006|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=June 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gina Cooper served as the Founder and first Director of YearlyKos, later to be Netroots Nation.

===2007===
[[File:070804 yearlykos sat 0087.JPG (1011913971).jpg|thumb|Debate at the 2007 conference]]

The 2007 YearlyKos was held at the [[McCormick Place]] Convention Center in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] from August 2–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/10/3/121115/420|title=And the YearlyKos 2007 location is....|date=October 3, 2006|publisher=Daily Kos|accessdate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven of the eight major [[Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2008|Democratic Presidential candidates]] attended the Convention in a debate moderated by bloggers. The candidates were [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Chris Dodd]], [[John Edwards]], [[Mike Gravel]], [[Dennis Kucinich]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Bill Richardson]]. The most memorable moment was when [[Hillary Clinton]] refused to join [[John Edwards]] and [[Barack Obama]]'s pledge to stop taking money from Washington lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/yearlykos-netroots-come-age|title=At YearlyKos, Netroots Come of Age|last=Melber|first=Ari|date=August 6, 2007|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after the debate the candidates held their own break-out sessions.

Media coverage called out the emergence of the Netroots in current political discourse (“Liberal bloggers can count the ways they are making their presence felt in the presidential race.” –Chicago Tribune)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-08-04/news/0708030678_1_bloggers-yearlykos-convention-clinton-campaign|title=Blogger Convention A Magnet For Politicians|date=August 4, 2007|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond 2008 (“The Netroots appear to be here to stay. Much of the debate at this year’s conference is aimed not at defining who the group is but rather at on what the group should do in 2008 and beyond.” –Chris Cillizza, Washington Post).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/04/AR2007080401320.html|title=The Net Roots' Moment in the Sun|author=Chris Cillizza And Shailagh Murray|date=August 5, 2007|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] were expected to appear, but were held up in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] due to various votes. On Saturday night of the Convention, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] passed the controversial FISA legislation to expand [[George W. Bush]]'s powers.

===2008===

After rebranding to Netroots Nation to better reflect the growing influence and membership of the [[netroots]] as a whole rather than just Daily Kos,&lt;ref name="Vox Yglesias Aug, 2018 article - NN explained"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yglesias |first1=Matthew |title=Netroots Nation, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/2/17635034/netroots-nation-explained |website=Vox |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2008 convention was held in [[Austin, Texas]] at the [[Austin Convention Center]] from July 17–20. Prominent speakers in 2008 included Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]], who was joined on stage by a surprise guest, former Vice President [[Al Gore]].

Other prominent speakers included Gov. [[Howard Dean]], [[Harold Ford]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], Rep. [[Donna Edwards]] and [[Van Jones]].

On Saturday night, Gina Cooper announced the end of her tenure as Director of Netroots Nation.

===2009===

In 2009, Netroots Nation was held at [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]], on August 13–16. Pittsburgh was chosen in part because it is a leader in LEED Certified green building technology; it has more square footage of green buildings than any other city in the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Another reason was Pittsburgh's rich labor union history.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Prominent speakers included President [[Bill Clinton]], [[Valerie Jarrett]], former Vermont Gov. [[Howard Dean]], SEIU's [[Anna Burger]], former New Jersey Governor [[Jon Corzine]] and [[Dean Baker]]. There was also a debate between Pennsylvania Senate candidates Rep. [[Joe Sestak]] and Sen. [[Arlen Specter]].

The keynote speaker was former US President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/8/13/766430/-Bill-Clintons-Keynote-at-Netroots-Nation|title=Bill Clinton's Keynote at Netroots Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event captured international headlines when the Democratic Congressional leadership seemingly abandoned the "public option" during the Health Care debate and Howard Dean spoke forcefully that the party would reconsider this issue and not compromise on it.  Former President Bill Clinton also made headlines in Pittsburgh when responding to a question shouted at him during his speech, concerning gay rights and the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lane-hudson/why-i-interrupted-bill-cl_b_259347.html|title=Why I interrupted Bill Clinton|last=Hudson|first=Lane|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton quipped at a shouting audience member, "You know you should go to one of those Congressional health care meetings," and went on to say that the implementation of the policy was not what he envisioned or how it was originally defined and that it was ridiculous that $150,000 was spent "to get rid of an Arabic translator" and that 130 servicemen and -women known to be gay were allowed to serve in the first Gulf War until "they kicked them out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2009/08/video-dont-mask-do-yell.html|title=Don't mask, do yell|publisher=GoodAsYou.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===

The 2010 Netroots Nation conference was held in the Las Vegas Valley at the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino]]. About 2,200 attended the conference. More than 200 media covered this year's conference including CNN,&lt;ref name="Las Vegas 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/24/elizabeth-warren-warmly-embraced-at-netroots/?fbid=M-lfwYo4Uxk|title=Elizabeth Warren warmly embraced at Netroots|last=Bohn|first=Kevin|date=July 24, 2010|publisher=CNN Political Ticker|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Univision, AP,&lt;ref name="Las Vegas 2010 AP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38396801/ns/politics/t/obama-urges-liberals-keep-fight/#.T8vIh7_d7wM|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104044339/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38396801/ns/politics/t/obama-urges-liberals-keep-fight/%23.T8vIh7_d7wM#.T8vIh7_d7wM|dead-url=yes|title=Obama Urges Liberals To 'Keep Up The Fight'|date=July 24, 2010|publisher=AP/NPR|accessdate=July 24, 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt; Politico&lt;ref name="Las Vegas 2010 Politico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=07038BD4-18FE-70B2-A81A115544C6D436|title=The rise of Netroots Nation|last=Mahtesian|first=Charles|date=July 24, 2010|publisher=Politico|accessdate=July 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729152249/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=07038BD4-18FE-70B2-A81A115544C6D436|archivedate=July 29, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.

There were 70 panels, screening series and a Campaign Academy with 30 hands-on training sessions. These trainings, organized with the help of [[Democracy for America]], featured professionals from dozens of organizations and publications in the progressive movement. Along with the panels and trainings there were seven keynote sessions. Two of the keynotes were question-and-answer sessions: Ask the Speaker with Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] and Ask the Leader with Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]].
A memorable moment came when Reid made an on-stage promise to Lt. [[Dan Choi]] to repeal [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephanie Condon|title=Reid Makes a Promise to Dan Choi for Gay Rights|publisher=CBSNews.com|date=July 24, 2010|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011585-503544.html|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his speech, Sen. Franken (D-MN) argued against media consolidation and for net neutrality laws. He said, in part, "If we don't protect Net Neutrality now, how long do you think it will take before Comcast-NBC Universal, or Verizon-CBS Viacom or AT&amp;T-ABC-DirecTV or BP-Haliburton-Walmart-Fox-Domino's-Pizza start favoring its content over everyone else's?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Schafer|title=Help Me Fight the Takeover of Our Media, Franken Says Over the Weekend|quote=Without vital Net Neutrality protections, and tough but fair regulation for corporations like Comcast, Franken sees a dark future where the flow of information in the United States will be controlled by just a few multinational corporations.|publisher=Lippmannwouldroll.com|date=July 29, 2010|url=http://lippmannwouldroll.com/2010/07/29/help-me-fight-the-takeover-of-our-media-franken-says-over-the-weekend/|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Martin O'Malley's exit, Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] stepped onto the stage to make his remarks.

[[File:Paddle.jpg|thumb|400px|right|A spanking paddle]]
A spanking '''paddle''' is an implement used to strike a person on the buttocks. The act of spanking a person with a paddle is known as  "paddling". A paddling may be for punishment (normally of a student at school in the United States), or as an initiation or [[hazing]] ritual.

==Description==
A paddle has two parts: a handle and a blade. Most paddles are designed to be held with one hand, but a giant paddle may be designed to be held with two hands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/photognome/2708830973/in/photostream/ Image] of a very large spanking paddle that was designed to be held with two hands.&lt;/ref&gt; The blade is typically 3 to {{convert|4|in|mm}} wide, 1/4-inch thick, and 1 to {{convert|3|ft|m}} in length.

In the great majority of cases, the paddle is aimed at the recipient's buttocks. Less commonly, the back of the thighs might also be targeted.&lt;ref&gt;"The act of punishment is to be conducted in such a manner that the area of contact will lie between and include the buttocks and the back of the thigh". [http://www.tipton-county.com/Student%20Handbook%202009.10.pdf ''Student Handbook'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (2009), p. 19. Tipton County Schools, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paddles for use in schools are made of wood, or occasionally plastic.&lt;ref&gt;"Corporal punishment shall be administered using an instrument (paddle) made of wood or plastic of reasonable width, length, and thickness. (The paddle shall not be more than 1/4" x 3" x 18".)" [http://www.tasb.org/policy/pol/private/212905/pol.cfm?DisplayPage=FO(LOCAL).pdf&amp;QueryText=PADDLE ''Policy On Line: Student Discipline'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 2. Tyler independent school District, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; Paddles used for school punishments may be roughly hewn from commonly available wood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/wfryer/1014497362/sizes/o/ Image] of a roughly hewn schoolhouse paddle.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, paddles may have holes drilled into them, so there is less air drag when the paddle approaches the buttocks, and produces more sting. The paddles used for fraternity and sorority initiation ceremonies are often professionally made and engraved with organizational symbols and slogans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SororityPaddlingFinalexam280.jpg Image] of a decorated sorority paddle from a fictional spanking film.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the paddle==
[[File:Spanking paddle invented to beat slaves.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of a paddle being used for the punishment of slaves.]]
The paddle may have been originally invented for the punishment of slaves as a way of causing intense pain without doing any permanent damage to the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, George Ryley (1938). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5NbaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+History+of+Corporal+Punishment&amp;q=punctured#search_anchor ''The history of corporal punishment: a survey of flagellation in its historical, anthropological, and sociological aspects''], 2nd Edition, T. W. Laurie, London.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only in former slave states that the paddle has been used in schools. It is not known why or exactly when it became the normal implement for corporal punishment in US schools. There are however instances of paddling using similar implements with individuals who were not slaves.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Scope of use==
{{Corporal punishment}}
[[File:Punishment of the Paddle, 1912.jpg|thumb|250px|1912 illustration of an inmate being punished in an American prison]]
Paddling was mainly used in many parts of the United States (and still is, in a few areas) as a means to discipline misbehaving school students. Paddling has also been used in some homes to punish children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlwt.com/news/22591959/detail.html ''Dad Found Not Guilty In Paddling Case.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225075355/http://www.wlwt.com/news/22591959/detail.html |date=25 February 2012 }} [[WLWT]], ''News 5,'' Cincinnati, Ohio. 17 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2005, a father in Minnesota used a paddle to strike his son 36 times.

The percentage of parents who say that they are very likely to paddle increases to 12% when involving teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Mott Children's Hospital (2010). [http://www.med.umich.edu/mott/npch/pdf/041510report.pdf "Speak or Spank?

===Paddling as punishment in U.S. schools===
{{main|School corporal punishment}}
The paddle is the almost invariable implement in US schools that still allow corporal punishment for student misconduct. Some paddles have traditionally had holes bored in them for aerodynamic effect,&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] (2008). [https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us0808webwcover.pdf ''A Violent Education: Corporal Punishment of Children in US Public Schools,''] p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; but many schools nowadays prohibit the use of such paddles.&lt;ref&gt;"A paddle made of wood with no holes or splinters shall be used in administering corporal punishment..." Rapides Parish School Board (2005). [http://www.rapides.k12.la.us/policy/student/SECTION_I.pdf ''Parish Policy Handbook and Student Code of Conduct.'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The punishment shall consist of no more than three swats on the buttocks with a smooth surface paddle free of holes and/or cracks." Calhoun County Schools. [http://www.calhoun.k12.al.us/parent/Doc/HANDBOOK06-07.doc ''2006–2007 Student Handbook and Code of Student Conduct.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606213440/http://www.calhoun.k12.al.us/parent/Doc/HANDBOOK06-07.doc |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paddling typically causes a slight reddening of the skin but in some cases can cause [[bruise]]s that are "visible for approximately two weeks".&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Mark. [http://times-journal.com/news/article_43a9c106-b315-11e0-b2ae-001cc4c002e0.html "Lawsuit filed over paddling incident"].

There have been cases in the past when paddling was administered incorrectly or excessively. Partly in order to avoid this danger, in the majority of U.S. schools, paddling is more strictly regulated than in the past, many schools publishing detailed rules in their student handbooks.&lt;ref name="handbooks"&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/usscr2.htm Corporal punishment regulations of individual schools or school districts] (external links to present-day school handbooks) at World Corporal Punishment Research.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually a requirement that a professional witness be present. Currently, there is often a maximum of three swats (or "licks" or "pops"). In the past, paddlings of up to 30&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2g1QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c1UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5696,3515697&amp;hl=en "Paddling Charge Dropped; School Bell Rings Again"]. ''[[Evening Independent]],'' 19 April 1960, p. 3-A.&lt;/ref&gt; licks were not unknown, especially in rural schools.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Practice has gradually moved from paddlings in the classroom or hallway to paddlings administered out of the sight of other students, typically in the principal's office. "Hallway" paddlings could typically be seen by other students, administrators or even outsiders visiting the school.

In 1981, a 17-year-old student claimed bleeding wounds as a result of a school paddling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nospank.net/shelly.htm Testimony of Shelly S.

Harnett County Board of Education and Glenn Varney]; North Carolina Court of Appeals, Volume 75, page 34 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent such claims, a school district currently may choose to require the handle of a spanking paddle to be "just large enough for a normal one-hand grip".&lt;ref&gt;Santa Rosa County School District (2009). [http://www.santarosa.k12.fl.us/files/csc.pdf ''Code of Student Conduct,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702115632/http://www.santarosa.k12.fl.us/files/csc.pdf |date=2 July 2010 }} p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Or a rule might provide that the handle shall not be more than {{convert|4|in|mm}} long (just large enough to be held with one hand).&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander City Schools (2010). [http://www.alex.k12.al.us/handbook/hand.pdf ''Student/Parent Information Guide and Code of Conduct, 2009–2010 School Year,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824024436/http://www.alex.k12.al.us/handbook/hand.pdf |date=24 August 2009 }} p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, a nine-year-old student was hit with a wooden paddle that was cracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/817/f2d/650 ''Garcia v. Miera.''] United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, 28 April 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a bleeding wound that became a permanent scar. To avoid this, nowadays some school districts have adopted rules which prohibit using paddles that have cracks in them. For example, the policies of Bloomfield School District provide that, "Corporal punishment will be administered by spanking the buttocks of a student with a flat-surfaced paddle which is smoothly sanded and has no cracks or holes and that will cause no more than temporary pain and not inflict permanent damage to the body."&lt;ref&gt;See the fifth paragraph of section J-4661 of the [http://www.bsin.k12.nm.us/policies/ ''Policy Manual and Administrative Regulations''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304011607/http://www.bsin.k12.nm.us/policies/ |date=4 March 2011 }} of the Bloomfield School District, New Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;

A paddling is typically administered with two or more school employees present. The student may be ordered to bend over a chair&lt;ref&gt;"He [a school principal] told her [an 18-year-old student] to bend over a chair with her buttocks raised." Sacks, Deana Pollard (2009).

Paddling usually occurs in an office but may sometimes occur in a hallway. The punishment is delivered across the seat of the student's trousers or skirt.

In order to avoid allegations of sexual abuse, many school districts require that a female teacher be present during the paddling of a female student.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.burke.k12.nc.us/superintendent/boe/Policies/Section10/10.3610%20%20Corporal%20Punishment.pdf Burke County Public Schools paddling policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714123523/http://www.burke.k12.nc.us/superintendent/boe/Policies/Section10/10.3610%20%20Corporal%20Punishment.pdf |date=14 July 2010 }} provides that, "In the event of corporal punishment being administered to a female student, a female teacher shall at all times be present".&lt;/ref&gt; A school might also ''recommend'' "that female staff members administer corporal punishment to female students (middle and high school)".&lt;ref&gt;St. Johns County School District (2010).

As of April 2011, 19 states allow corporal punishment in public schools. See [[School corporal punishment in the United States]] for further information.

===Social discipline===

{{Property law}}
A '''partition''' is a term used in the [[law]] of [[real property]] to describe an act, by a [[court]] order or otherwise, to divide up a [[concurrent estate]] into separate portions representing the proportionate interests of the owners of property. It is sometimes described as a '''forced sale'''. Under the [[common law]], any owner of property who owns an undivided concurrent interest in land can seek such a division. In some cases, the parties agree to a specific division of the land; if they are unable to do so, the court will determine an appropriate division. A sole owner, or several owners, of a piece of land may partition their land by entering a [[deed poll]] (sometimes referred to as "carving out").

== Why forced sales occur ==
Forced sales generally occur because owners of property are unable to agree upon certain aspects of the ownership. The owners may disagree on how to use the property, on the amount of money to invest into the property, or on their right to occupy and use the whole of the property. If the parties cannot come to an agreement, the case moves to court through a petition to partition action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andysirkin.com/HTMLArticle.cfm?Article=1 Tenancy in Common Questions and Answers - Andy Sirkin, Attorney&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of co-habitants increases in the United States, the petition to partition action has become more common as a remedy to divide real and personal property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricefamilylaw.com/family/petition-to-partition.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Property may be owned by more than one person either as [[joint tenants]], [[tenants in common]], and in some states [[tenants by the entirety]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://real-estate-law.freeadvice.com/real-estate-law/property_ownership_forms.htm Property ownership - what are the common forms?&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of which tenancy to enter into is made by the parties at the time of purchase. With each type of tenancy, each owner has the right to occupy the whole. That means that an owner is not allowed to designate certain rooms as their own and so on. Each element of the property is enjoyed fully by all parties.

==Types of partition==
There are three kinds of partition which can be awarded by court: ''partition in kind'', ''partition by allotment'', and ''partition by sale''.
#A partition in kind is a division of the property itself among the co-owners. Partition in kind is a default method of property partition.&lt;ref&gt;Partition Action 101. [http://www.partitionaction.com Partition Action]&lt;/ref&gt;
#In a partition by allotment, which is not available in all jurisdictions, the court awards full ownership of the land to a single owner or subset of owners, and orders them to pay the person or persons divested of ownership for the interest awarded.
#Partition by sale constitutes a forced sale of the land, followed by division of the profits thus realized among the tenants.  Generally, the court is supposed to order a partition sale only if the land cannot be physically divided, although this determination often rests on whether the economic value of the divided pieces is less in the aggregate than the value of the parcel as a single piece. ''See'' Delfino v. Vealencis, 436 A.2d 27 (Conn. 1980).

A provision in a [[deed]] completely prohibiting partition will not be given effect, but courts will enforce a provision that temporarily restricts partition, as long as the restriction is reasonable.

== Statutory variations ==
=== Ontario, Canada Code ===
The Ontario Partition Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.4, states:
:"3.  (1)  Any person interested in land in Ontario, or the guardian of a minor entitled to the immediate possession of an estate therein, may bring an action or make an application for the partition of such land or for the sale thereof under the directions of the court if such sale is considered by the court to be more advantageous to the parties interested. R.S.O. 1990, c. P.4, s. 3 (1)."

===Florida statutes===
Florida provides for partition actions by statute, Chapter 64, which basically provides that any co-owner of real estate may seek partition.&lt;ref name=Statute&gt;[http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=Ch0064/ch0064.htm Florida Partition Statute]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Florida, there are basically no defenses to a partition action, other than if the parties have agreed not to partition the real estate.&lt;ref name=partition&gt;[http://www.floridaprobatetrustlaw.com/2009/12/articles/florida-homestead/partition-can-be-the-solution-for-florida-heirs/ Partition Can Be the Solution for Florida Heirs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania code===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Property divided under Rule 1560(a) shall be awarded to the parties according to their respective interests.
* A master who is appointed by the court shall make such examinations and hold such hearings as may be necessary, giving reasonable notice thereof. The master may employ appraisers and, with the authorization of the court, such other experts as are necessary to enable the master to perform his or her duties.&lt;ref&gt;The Pennsylvania Code&lt;/ref&gt;
* The court shall permit the shares of any two or more co-tenants to remain undivided between them if they so elect by writing filed within such time as the court or master shall direct.
* Parties defendant owning a majority in value of the property may object in writing to any sale, requesting that the property be awarded to them at its valuation fixed by the court and that their interests in the same remain undivided. Upon such request the entire property shall be awarded to the parties objecting to sale, as tenants in common, subject to payment to the parties desiring partition and sale of the amounts of their respective interests based upon the valuation. The amounts due the parties shall be charged as liens upon the property, to be paid in such manner and time as the court shall direct.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Partition example:
In D’Arcy v. Buckley, 71 Bucks Co. L. Rep. 167 (1997), two people purchased property as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The plaintiff contributed five times more than the defendant toward the purchase price. In a partition action, the plaintiff sought credit for the full amount of his superior contributions. The Court held that, in the absence of fraud, the working of the deed operated to convey a one-half interest to each of the two joint tenants. The decision relies the authorities of Masgai v. Masgai, 460 Pa. 453, 333 A.2d 861 (1975), and DeLoatch v. Murphy, 369 Pa. Super. 255, 535 A.2d 146 (1987). The plaintiff argued, to no avail, that he did not intend to make a lifetime gift to defendant.

=== California Code ===

Partition in kind is favored, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 872.810,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oclaw.org/research/code/ca/CCP/872.810./content.html&lt;/ref&gt; but partition by sale is allowed if a partition by sale maximizes the market value of the subject property(s).

In many cases, a two-step process may be required: (1) a trial,&lt;ref&gt;As partition actions are "equitable" in nature, only court trials are employed; i.e., jury trials are not permitted.
&lt;/ref&gt; during which oral and documentary evidence is heard, and either affirms or denies the right of the moving party to effect a partition of the subject property(s), and, if affirmed, results in an interlocutory judgment (sometimes called a "first interlocutory judgment"), and (2) particularly in a contested partition, an evidentiary hearing (also a trial), usually after the property(s) have been appraised by experts, and during which trial additional oral and documentary evidence is heard, the property(s) are ordered divided and awarded proportionally where possible, including cash compensation where proportional division is impractical or impossible (sometimes called a "second interlocutory judgment"). The division usually requires the employment of experts such as engineers and surveyors, and the preparation of special reports (which include conveyance deeds and easement deeds). As a final act, the court, in a hearing (not a trial), will accept the special reports and order that these be executed by a title company, which will also effectuate "recordation" of the conveyance and easement deeds (any cash compensation due any of the parties will also be effectuated within the escrow).

===Partition procedure===
A party seeking a partition must file a partition lawsuit.  State codes generally favor physical division (partition in-kind) of the affected property(s) over sale (partition by sale as a unit), particularly if a tenant would be displaced from his or her primary residence by a sale. If in-kind partition is feasible, the property(s) will be divided proportionally. Where small differences in such division are unavoidable, cash compensation for the difference(s) will be awarded to maintain proportionality. If the property(s) cannot be divided and allocated to give each tenant a portion without spoiling the whole, the court will order a sale. A special master (referee) is commonly appointed by the court to execute the partition process. The referee is responsible only to the court, and the referee is limited only by the court's instructions, and applicable state codes. For an in-kind partition, the referee will cause deeds to the adjusted property(s) to be prepared.  Where easements are required for access, the referee will employ professionals (engineers, surveyors and other experts) as required to describe the easement(s).  The conveyance deeds for the adjusted property(s) and the easement deed(s) will be recorded simultaneously. Often, "referee's deeds" (deeds signed by the referee, in the owner's stead) may be employed.

===Tenants in common partitions vs. tenants with rights of survivorship partitions===
Tenants in common (TIC) deeds may or may not be taken in equal shares, but a joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) deed must always be taken in equal shares unless specifically and clearly indicated otherwise in the deed language. Therefore, a partition action for those two types of deeds will vary.

When a JTWROS property is partitioned, the proceeds must be divided equally among tenants without regard to contribution to purchase price since a JTWROS deed is always taken in equal shares. So with a JTWROS, contributions to purchase price is not an issue during partition. Otherwise, the premise of a JTWROS deed would be invalid and its purpose would be defeated. On the other hand, when a TIC property is partitioned, courts may be at liberty to consider unequal contributions to purchase price and adjust the tenants' distributions accordingly.

In either partition situation, tenants may request credits for unequal contributions to expenses incurred ''after'' taking deed to the property. Such credits may cover utility and maintenance expenses, and are allocated according to shares. Credits for improvements to the property may be granted if the improvements actually increased the value of the property.

The '''Promised Day Brigade''' ([[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''PDB'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: لواء اليوم الموعود ''Liwā‘ al-Yūm al-Maw‘ūd''), originally called the '''Muqawimun''' (Arabic: المقاومون ''al-Muqāwimūn''; "Resisters")&lt;ref name="Muqawimun"&gt;[http://www.ndia.org/Divisions/Divisions/SOLIC/Documents/Command_Report_12-10-10.pdf Page 29]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Shi'a]] organization and was an [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|insurgent group]] operating in Iraq during the war. In 2010, it was one of the largest and most powerful of what the US military call [[Special Groups (Iraq)|"Special Groups"]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The group was created as successor to [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]'s [[Mahdi Army]], which was Iraq's largest Shi'a militia until its disbanding in 2008, he also called on other Special Groups to join the brigade. Sadr had earlier already talked about the creation of a smaller guerrilla unit which would continue the Mahdi Army's armed activities but for the first time gave the organisation a name in November 2008 when he declared the creation of the Promised Day Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zimbio.com/War+in+Iraq/articles/3427/Iraq+Promised+Day+Brigade+reforming+Shiite# |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119123906/http://www.zimbio.com/War+in+Iraq/articles/3427/Iraq+Promised+Day+Brigade+reforming+Shiite# |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities have particularly increased since May 2009.&lt;ref name="Muqawimun"/&gt; The group's name is in reference to an alternate term for the Islamic [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hadithaday.org/horrors-of-the-promised-day/horrors-of-the-promised-day/&lt;/ref&gt; The group is alleged{{by whom|date=October 2013}} to receive Iranian support.

In October 2009, the Promised Day Brigade fought a battle with rival Special Group [[Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq]] for influence in [[Sadr City]]. The Promised Day Brigade reportedly won the battle and even managed to destroy the house of Abdul [[Hadi al-Darraji]], a senior Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq leader. Since then, the PDB has been the most powerful Special Group in the ex-Mahdi Army stronghold of Sadr City and has increased its activity there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/opensecurity/shatha-al-juburi/can-iraqs-sadrists-prove-their-nationalist-credentials|title=Can Iraq's Sadrists prove their nationalist credentials?|work=openDemocracy|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3668">In [[health policy]], '''Roemer's Law''' may be expressed as follows: "in an insured population, a hospital bed built is a filled bed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Milton I. Roemer, Pioneering UCLA Health Services Professor and Professional Who Defined Health Policy in U.S., Abroad|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/pr/miroemer.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304021055/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/pr/miroemer.html|archivedate=4 March 2012|date=8 January 2001|website=University of California, Los Angeles School of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule was deduced by the American health services researcher Milton Roemer, working at the [[UCLA School of Public Health]]. Roemer and colleagues found a [[positive correlation]] between the number of short-term [[Hospital#General|general hospital]] beds available per 1,000 population and the number of hospital days used per 1,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shain|first1=M|last2=Roemer|first2=MI|title=Hospital costs relate to the supply of beds|journal=Modern Hospital|date=April 1959|volume=92|issue=4|pages=71-3|pmid=13644010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst clearly Roemer's Law will not always hold true (not every bed that is ever built will be filled), it does provide the underpinning for [[certificate of need]] laws and for health planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Problems and Prospects for Health Planning: The Importance of Incentives, Standards, and Procedures in Certificate of Need|url=http://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/instructors/orentlicher/healthlw/Chap10A2.html|first= Randall|last=Bovbjerg|journal=Utah Law Review|volume=83|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2015}}

The law is thought to be a consequence of [[induced demand]] i.e. physicians encouraging patients to consume services that the patients would not have chosen had they been fully informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roemer's Law of Demand|url=http://opus1journal.org/others/killerapps/Roemer_law.html|website=Opus1 Journal: The Journal of Undergraduate Research|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107032619/http://opus1journal.org/others/killerapps/Roemer_law.html|archivedate=7 January 2009|date=7 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Opus1 website appears amateurish, doesn't list author(s).|date=March 2015}} Health planning and [[certificate of need]] laws aim to prevent the waste that would otherwise occur due to Roemer's Law.

"One problem in this finding is that it could be the case that hospital stays are shorter in lower hospital bed [[per capita]] regions because of a deficit in [[supply (economics)|supply]] ([[reverse causation]]). An increased number of beds may be due to patient preference for [[in-patient]] (rather than [[outpatient]]) care in a region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roemer's law|website=Healthcare Economist|date=12 October 2006|url=http://healthcare-economist.com/2006/10/12/roemers-law/|first=Jason|last=Shafrin}}{{Self-published source|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=March 2015}}

[[Enoch Powell]] who was Minister of Health in the United Kingdom propounded a similar proposition, which he called Parkinson's Law of hospital beds:  "the number of patients always tends to equality with the number of beds available for them to lie in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=Enoch|title=A new look at Medicine and Politics|date=1966|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/healthcare-generally/history-of-healthcare/a-new-look-at-medicine-and-politics/a-new-look-at-medicine-and-politics-4/|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rome Declaration on World Food Security''' is a document adopted at the 1996 [[World Food Summit]] took place in Rome, Italy between 13 and 17 November 1996. The summit was organised by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO). The '''Declaration''' reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger and pledges political will and common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015. Therefore, the document has important significance in relation to [[Food security]] and the [[Right to food]]. Signatories commit to the implementation of the [[World Food Summit Plan of Action]].

==Right to food==
In the Declaration, member states stated the following in relation to the right to food:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We pledge our political will and our common and national commitment to achieving food security for all and to an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing the number of undernourished people to half their present level no later than 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4548">[[File:A T Ariyarathna.jpg|thumb|Dr. A. T. Ariyaratne, the founder of Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]]
The '''Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement''' is a [[self-governance]] movement in [[Sri Lanka]], which provides comprehensive development and [[conflict resolution]] programs to villages. It is also the largest indigenous organization working in reconstruction from the [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. Founded in 1958 by [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] when he took “forty high school students and twelve teachers from [[Nalanda College Colombo]] on “an educational experiment” to an outcaste village, Kathaluwa, and helped the villagers fix it up. It is based on [[Buddhist]] and [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] principles, including [[sarvodaya]] from which it got the name and [[swaraj]] (self-governance). The word "[[shramadana]]" means "a gift of labor".&lt;ref name="Garfinkel"&gt;Perry Garfinkel, ''Buddha or bust'' (2006), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, Sarvodaya staff people and programs are active in some 15,000 (of 38,000) villages in Sri Lanka. The organization estimates that 11 million citizens are individual beneficiaries of one of their programs.  The group distributes funds from a financial reserve bank of 1.6 billion [[Sri Lankan rupee|rupees]].&lt;ref name="Garfinkel"/&gt;

== Program ==
The Sarvodaya program begins with an invitation from a village for discussion of what is needed and how it can be done. It proceeds in stages through creating a village council, building a school and clinic, setting up family programs, creating economic opportunity so that the village economy becomes self-sustaining, starting a village bank, and offering help to other villages. In addition, Sarvodaya sponsors public meditations in which tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians meditate together on each other's welfare, using the Buddhist [[Brahmavihara]] (sublime attitude) meditations, which are acceptable within all faiths.

[[Fusion – Sarvodaya ICT4D Movement]] is the ICT for development (ICT4D) program. As a response to the emerging digital divide issues of rural Sri Lanka, Sarvodaya started setting up telecentres experimentally in 1997. This has led to the pioneering [[telecentre]] program in the country. Village Information Centres (popularly known as VICs) are rural libraries, set up by village youth leaders as 'Zero Cost' village initiatives, which prepare disadvantaged, less educated rural communities for the information age. Out of the 172 VICs initiated since early 2000, there are about 21 VICs graduated to their own forms of telecentres by mid-2008.

Author John P. Clark has argued that the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement are [[Anarchism|anarchist]] in their organisation and goals, noting their inspiration from the philosophical anarchist [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impossible Community: Realising Communitarian Anarchism|last=Clark|first=John|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781441185471|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''1966 South African general election''', on 30 March 1966,  resulted in another comprehensive victory for the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] under [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd]].

The election marked a major strengthening of power for the ruling NP, which gained a two thirds majority in parliament for the first time. The main opposition United Party slightly increased its share of the popular vote, but nevertheless saw its parliamentary representation considerably reduced.

The number of [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] seats for White voters in South Africa had been increased from 150 to 160 by the Constitution Amendment Act of 1965. In addition, there were six seats for White voters from [[South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]). There were also four seats reserved for [[Coloured]] representatives, who did not have to stand for re-election during 1966.

==Coloured Representative Members==
The second election for the four coloured representative members had taken place on 4 October 1961, before the (white voters only) general election on 8 October 1961. Under the Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951, the members had been elected to serve until the dissolution of the 1961–1966 Parliament.

The Progressive Party (PP) won the two seats representing coloured voters on the [[Cape Provincial Council]], at an election in 1965. The National Party (NP) government became concerned at the prospect of four additional Progressive MPs being elected. The opposition United Party (UP) also feared the loss of support, if the existing four UP supported independent members were defeated.

Parliament passed the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act 1965. This legislation extended the term of the existing coloured representatives until October 1966.&lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Contemporary Archives, 1965–1966'', pages 21375-21376&lt;/ref&gt; Further Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Acts, in 1966 and 1968, extended the term until the dissolution of what turned out to be the 1966–1970 Parliament. The coloured representation in Parliament would then be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;''In No Uncertain Terms'', pp 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delimitation of electoral divisions==
The [[South Africa Act 1909]] had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division, for general roll voters in the four provinces. The republican constitution continued the arrangements for a commission. The representation by province, under the twelfth delimitation report of 1965, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1958) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;''South Africa 1982'', page 129 (table setting out delimitations of seats by province, the relevant one being that of 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

South-West Africa (with six seats) and the coloured representatives (4 seats), were unaffected by the general delimitation provisions.

==Composition at the dissolution==
The 13th Parliament since the Union of 1910 and the 1st elected after the republic was proclaimed in 1961, was dissolved in 1966. At the  time the House of Assembly consisted of two groups of members. White voters were represented by 156 general roll members and coloured voters in Cape Province by four white MPs known at the time as Coloured Representative Members (CRM).

The general election only affected the representatives of white voters. The other members were elected on a different date (see above).

Since the previous election, the United Party had absorbed the National Union, with which it had had an electoral alliance in 1961.

The representation by party and province, at the dissolution was:- &lt;ref&gt;''Keesing's Contemporary Archives, 1965–1966'', pages 21375-21376&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election results==
The vote totals in the table below may not give a complete picture of the balance of political opinion, because of unopposed elections (where no votes were cast) and because contested seats may not have been fought by a candidate from all major parties. In all, eighteen candidates were returned unopposed, seventeen representing the National Party and one the United Party. The Progressive Party barely kept its [[Houghton, Johannesburg|Houghton]] seat, held by [[Helen Suzman]] since her defection from the UP, with a bare 117 votes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835282,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

356 candidates were nominated. These represented the following parties: National 154, United 141, Progressive 26, Republican 22, the Front 10, Independents 2, and Conservative National Party 1. The Republican, Front and Conservative National groups were new right-wing parties, which had not contested previous general elections.

The total registered electorate was 1,901,479. The votes cast were 1,302,151 (including 7,494 spoilt votes).&lt;ref&gt;''South Africa 1982'', page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tamil United Liberation Front''' ({{lang-ta|தமிழர் ஐக்கிய விடுதலை முன்னணி}}, {{lang-si|ද්‍රවිඩ එක්සත් විමුක්ති පෙරමුණ}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Sri Lanka]] which seeks independence for the [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamil]]-populated areas of Sri Lanka.

==Formation==
On May 4, 1972 several Tamil political groups, including the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]], formed the Tamil United Front (TUF).  The [[Federal Party (Sri Lanka)|Federal Party]] joined the TUF in 1976. The TUF changed its name to the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and adopted a demand for an independent state to be known as the "secular, socialist state of [[Tamil Eelam]]".

==1977 Parliamentary General Election==
In the first general election contested by the TULF, the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1977|21 July 1977 election]] in which the [[United National Party|UNP]] won by a landslide, the TULF won 6.40% of the popular vote and 18 out of 168 seats in the [[Sri Lankan parliament]], including all 14 seats in the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]].

The TULF became the official opposition as result of the rout of the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party|SLFP]]. The TULF's success would lead to [[Sri Lankan riots of 1977|riots]] in which hundreds of [[Tamils]] were murdered by [[Sinhala people|Sinhala]] mobs.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the TULF was frequently blamed by nationalist [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] politicians for acts of violence committed by [[List of Tamil militant groups|militant groups]] such as the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE). In fact, the TULF represented an older, more conservative generation of Tamils that felt independence could be achieved without violence, more rival than ally to youth groups like the LTTE who believed in armed conflict.

In October 1983, all the TULF legislators, numbering sixteen at the time, forfeited their seats in Parliament for refusing to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state in accordance with the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

During the 1980s, the LTTE began to see the TULF as a rival in its desire to be considered the sole representatives of the Tamils of the north and east. Over the next two decades, the LTTE has assassinated several TULF leaders, including [[A. Amirthalingam]] and [[Neelan Thiruchelvam]].

==1989 Parliamentary General Election==
The TULF formed an alliance with the three [[India]]n backed [[paramilitary]] groups, [[Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front]] (ENDLF), [[Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front]] (EPRLF) and [[Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization]] (TELO), to contest the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 1989|15 February 1989 election]]. The alliance won 3.40% of the popular vote and 10 out of 225 seats in the [[Sri Lankan parliament]].

==2001 Parliamentary General Election==
{{Tamil National Alliance 2010 parliamentary election results}}

==Split==
TULF President [[V. Anandasangaree]], a critic of the [[Tamil Tigers]], left the [[Tamil National Alliance]] when it took a pro-Tamil Tigers stance at the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2004|2004 general election]]. Anandasangaree gained control of the TULF after a legal battle, forcing the TULF members who wanted to remain in the TNA to resurrect the [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi]], which is now a constituent party of the TNA.

==2004 Parliamentary General Election==
The legal battle over the control of TULF meant that the TULF led by V. Anandasangaree contested as an [[Independent (politician)|independent group]] and only in one electoral district in the [[Sri Lankan parliamentary election, 2004|2 April 2004 parliamentary election]], winning 0.06% of the popular vote and no seats in the [[Sri Lankan parliament]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13192">'''Technological dualism''' was proposed by Benjamin Higgins. He was the Ritchie Professor of Economics at the University of Melbourne in the late 1940s. His theory explains the causes of unemployment in the underdeveloped economies. Developing countries of today are often characterized by dualistic economies. One is the modern (or formal) sector while the other is the traditional (informal) sector. Their relation has been explained by Higgins in his theory explained below.

{{Economics sidebar}}

==Technological dualism==

The theory of technological dualism comes under the subject of [[development economics]]. This theory was propounded by Benjamin Higgins in place of [[Social dualism]] theory by Professor Boeke. In the words of Prof Higgins "dualism is the situation in which productive employment opportunities are limited not because of lack of effective [[demand]] but because of resource and technological constraints in the two sector". The two sector here means the traditional rural sector and modern sector.
This theory is prevalent in less developed countries. According to Prof Higgins this is the cause of unemployment and underemployment in these less developed countries. The traditional rural sector and the modern sector both use different production function and have different resource endowments and this is the reason for technological dualism in these less developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=ghatak|first=subrata|title=Development Economcs|year=2010|publisher=Longman Publishing Group|location=harlow|isbn=0-582-44873-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation of technological dualism ==

There are two fundamental basis of technological dualism

=== Difference in production function ===
There are differences in the production function in the two sectors. There are fixed technical coefficients in the modern sector whereas in case of traditional sector the technical coefficients are variable. This duality is analyzed by Higgins in the context of Factor Proportions. Prof Eckaus offers a detailed explanation of this feature. This will be explained later on in this topic. This concept of Factor Proportion is used by Higgins for the analysis of the unemployment in the underdeveloped countries.

=== Difference in factor-endowment ===
There is a difference in availability of labour and capital this forms the fundamental basis of technological dualism. In the modern sector more amount of capital than labour is observed so therefor capital intensive techniques would be used. In the traditional sector more of labour is present than capital. So here labour-intensive techniques will be incorporated. Thus two distinct techniques of production can be observed in these two sectors.&lt;ref name="Development Economics" /&gt;

==Features of dual sector==

As mentioned above in case of technological dualism the economy is divided into traditional sector and modern sector. Following are some characteristics of these sector.

===Traditional sector===

1) Agriculture, [[cottage industries]] and small industries are the main occupations of this sector.

2) Different techniques and combinations are used in this sector. It has variable technical coefficients of production. As technical coefficients are variable the products can be produced with a wide range of techniques and combinations of labour and capital.

3) As it is a traditional sector and [[factor endowment]] is such that [[labour-intensive]] technique is dominating in this sector as compared to [[capital intensive]] technique of production.&lt;ref name="Development Economics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=TR|title=Development Economics|year=2009-10|publisher=F.K Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-87140-86-0|pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern sector===

1) Large-scale industries, plantation, transport, oil fields are the main occupation in this sector.

2) As it is the modern Sector hence [[capital intensive]] production is prevalent.

3) Different techniques and combination are not used. The technical coefficients in this sector is fixed due to this different techniques or combination cannot be used.

4) There is a limited degree of technical substitutability of factors and the production is characterized by fixed technical coefficients.&lt;ref name="Development Economics" /&gt;

==Production function in industrial/modern sector==

Two factors of production (labour and capital) and two goods is the assumption taken to show the technological dualism in the two sectors.

[[File:Industrial 22.jpg|left|400px|Capital against Labor graph depicting the industrial production function.]]

The production function in the industrial sector is shown. The horizontal axis depicts Labour and the vertical axis is Capital. The curves which are [[isoquant]]s show the combination of labour and capital at some given level of output. The higher the curve the higher the levels of output i.e. O1 level of output is least and as you go to O2, O3, O4 the output level increases. The dotted line Pi shows the expansion path of the modern sector. From the figure 1 we can see that the production process is capital intensive. For instance, to get an output of O1 then OC1 amount of capital will be used and OL1 units of labour will be employed. If OL2 units are available the excess supply of labour would not have any effect on production techniques and L1L2 (excess labour) will remain unemployed or will try to seek employment in the traditional sector. This proves that only when the capital increases more labour will be taken in and output will be expanded. In this case the labour and capital have to be used in fixed proportion to get any output. As we know the production process is [[capital intensive]]. Figure 1 shows that OC1 units of capital is used and OL1 units of labour is employed to get Q1 units of output. if the availability of capital increases the producer would shift to the higher isoquant curve showing higher level of output. Huggins argues that the technical coefficients are not as rigidly fixed and therefore the small slanting dotted lines where two isoquants meet in the figure above show that they are somewhat flexible.f there are very large differences in the factor endowments such as given by CoLn the [[entrepreneurs]] would probably think of using more labour-intensive technique. The slope of the [[expansion path]] (Pi) shows that despite the increase in capital and output there is no significant improvement in the employment.&lt;ref name="development mishra" /&gt;

==Production function in traditional/agriculture sector==

The technical [[coefficients]] in the traditional sector is variable. The unemployed labour in the industrial sector will have no option but to look for employment in the traditional sector. As traditional sector is labour-intensive therefore the inflow in labour can be absorbed in this sector as the technical coefficients are variable.

Initially this absorption takes place by getting more land under cultivation so as to keep the ratio of labour to land constant.  For sometime the capital and labour combination remain constant as the output rises from O1 to O3 as given in Figure 2.  As resources are not unlimited the good land tends to become scarce and due to inflow of labour the ratio of labour to capital in the sector rises and hence the techniques tend to become increasingly labour-intensive.  When the point On is reached all the available land has already been cultivated due to the high intensive labour techniques used and the marginal productivity of labour falls below zero. [[Disguised unemployment]] starts making an appearance at this point. Under these condition there is no incentive for farmers to or small industries to make an investment in this sector even if they have the money to invest. Nor will they be interested in introducing labour saving innovations even if they knew about them.  Since labour supply is in excess  therefore labour as a group is not interested in increasing their efforts.  Thus methods of production remain labour-intensive and economic and social welfare remain low.&lt;ref name="development mishra"&gt;{{cite book|last=puri|first=mishra|title=Economics of Development and Planning|year=2010|publisher=himalayan publishing house|location=Bombay|isbn=978-81-8488-829-4|pages=258–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins notes that the problem of [[disguised unemployment]] has become more and more serious in the rural sector during the last two centuries.  This happened as technological progress took a form of capital intensive sector and not technological progress took place in agriculture, handicrafts.  The technological progress has been rapid in modern sector.  Particularly after the second world war both he trade union activity and direct government intervention has led to increase in the industrial wage rates in certain countries but these policies have had no effect on the rural wage rate.  As a result, the tendency towards technological dualism has increased.&lt;ref name="Development Economics" /&gt;

== Factor proportion problem ==

As mentioned earlier in this topic we will discuss the factor proportion problem as incorporated by Prof Higgins in his theory.  This problem was discussed by Prof Eckaus in detail in his study.
Prof Eckaus begins with a simple case where one good is produced in the economy, national product, with two factors of production labour and capital.  It is assumed by him that the factors given are used in fixed proportions. Eckaus finds out that the relatively abundant factor i.e. labour faces structural unemployment. This happens even if the technique used is labour-intensive. So from his study it showed that structural unemployment of labour exists even when labour-intensive technique is used.
In the next step the national product is divided into two goods-one is output of local enterprises which are relatively more labour-intensive and output of western enterprises which are relatively more capital intensive.  Again the result is the same very high capital-labour ratio results in structural unemployment of labour.  This cannot be removed even if prce is adjusted, or by creation of increased effective demand.
This conclusion remains unchanged even if variable coefficients replace the fixed coefficients in the more labour-intensive field of employment.
Some of the reasons for aggravation of these structural employment is
1) If the technological progress takes a form of capital intensive sector.
2) If the rate of population growth is higher than the rate of capital accumulation in the labour sector.
3) If government policies or the trade union are able to increase the wages to a higher level.&lt;ref name="development mishra" /&gt;

==Conclusion==

Higgins in his theory of technological dualism shows us that technological dualism in underdeveloped countries is the cause of unemployment and disguised unemployment. He thinks that the development in the modern sector can take place if foreign capital is present in the economy. As a result of this industrialization in these economies do not cause capital formation instead they are associated with ever increase in population. This is the reason for unemployment in these under developed economies.

==Critical evaluation==
Prof Higgins' theory is more realistic as compared to the Boeke theory of social dualism. His theory clearly explains the reasons for unemployment in the underdeveloped countries. Higgins' theory is not free of criticism; some of the criticisms are given below:

1) Higgins fails to offer an explanation of nature and growth of unemployment in the traditional sector in the dual society

2) It is questionable to assume that development of the industrial sector is dependent entirely on imported technology.

3) He gives importance to only technical factors affecting labour and capital whereas social and psychological factors are completely ignored.

4) His theory is based on the assumption that technical coefficients are fixed in the modern sector.  However a little degree of elasticity cannot be ruled out completely. This makes his assumption questionable.

5) The theory explains the underemployment in the traditional sector but it does not provide a solution.&lt;ref name="Development Economics" /&gt;

'''The Culture of Critique series''' is a trilogy of books by psychology professor [[Kevin MacDonald (evolutionary psychologist)|Kevin B. MacDonald]] claiming that [[evolutionary psychology]] provides the motivations behind [[Jewish]] group behavior and [[Jewish culture|culture]], asserting Jewish behavior and culture are central causes of [[antisemitism]] and of alleged Jewish control and influence in government policy and political movements. While the first and second book received some positive reviews,&lt;ref name="tour de force" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eysenck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters" /&gt; later works have been mostly rejected and condemned by academics and journalists as being scientifically unsupportable, academically sloppy, and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name="Eugen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schatz"&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_02.html MacDonald - Schatz: 2 of 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilman/&gt;&lt;!-- the lead summarizes the body of the article, including critical commentary. --&gt;

==Series==
{{Antisemitism}}
The first books constitute what is known as MacDonald's "trilogy."  In this trilogy he describes Judaism as a "[[group evolutionary strategy]]" to enhance the ability of [[Jew]]s to out-compete non-Jews for resources. He argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior. MacDonald also notes a negative shift in tone from the first book to the third, and attributes it to having learned more, read more, and "changed greatly" in that time. MacDonald's trilogy has been described as significant for "its potential to forge a standardized anti-Semitic critique in the far right."&lt;ref name="MICHAEL"&gt;[[George Michael (professor)|George Michael]], Professor Kevin MacDonald's critique of Judaism: legitimate scholarship or the intellectualization of anti-semitism?, ''Journal of Church and State'' September 22, 2006 [http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/JC&amp;S48-2006.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trilogy was followed by additional writings on the topic published by the ''[[Occidental Quarterly]]'', a periodical MacDonald currently edits:

===''A People that Shall Dwell Alone'' (1994)===

MacDonald describes [[Judaism]] as having or being a "group evolutionary strategy" aimed at limiting [[exogamy]], enforcing cultural segregation, promoting in-group charity and economic cooperation, and regulating in-group marriage and births to achieve high levels of intelligence, ability to acquire resources, parenting care, and group allegiance. He examines evidence from Jewish history, culture, and genetics supporting his thesis, arguing that Judaism is based on a strong -- and possibly genetically based -- predisposition to [[ethnocentrism]] characteristic of Middle Eastern cultures generally but exacerbated as a result of selective effects resulting from Jewish cultural practices. He considers the use of the complex and extensive Jewish scriptures and the high prestige of [[Rabbinic]] learning as [[eugenics|eugenic]] mechanisms for promoting Jewish verbal intelligence and [[dexterity]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}

===''Separation and Its Discontents'' (1998)===

Developing his work in ''A People that Shall Dwell Alone'', MacDonald examines antisemitism as a test case for an evolutionary analysis of ethnic conflict in general, applying social identity theory to three critical periods of institutionalized antisemitism: the Roman Empire in the fourth century; the [[Spanish Inquisition|Iberian inquisitions from the fourteenth century]]; and [[Nazi Germany|German Nazism]] in the period 1933-45. He argues that antisemitism can be analysed as a consequence of resource competition between groups in which each group is rationally pursuing its own interests, rather than as a manifestation of irrational malice by non-Jewish out-groups, and asserts that Jews, particularly strongly identified Jews, will be relatively prone to self-deception by ignoring or rationalizing negative information about themselves and their in-group. Finally, he discusses whether Judaism has ceased to be an evolutionary strategy because of the current levels of intermarriage among some groups of diaspora Jews, arguing that it has not ceased to be so and that it continues to flourish.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}

===''The Culture of Critique'' (1998)===

MacDonald examines [[Franz Boas#Later career: academic anthropology|Boasian anthropology]], [[political radicalism]], [[psychoanalysis]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and [[The New York Intellectuals]], arguing that Jews dominated these intellectual movements and that a strong sense of Jewish identity was characteristic of the great majority of the individuals in these movements. He argues that these individuals were pursuing a Jewish ethnic agenda in establishing and participating in these movements, while writing that the Jewish community does not constitute a unified movement and that only a small and elite minority of that community participated in these movements.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}

He claims Jewish efforts to shape [[Immigration to the United States|United States immigration policy]] were in opposition to what he sees as the interests of the peoples of non-Jewish European descent, particularly the peoples of Northern and Western Europe. He concludes the book by claiming that intellectual movements he examines are movements that are either "Jewish" by nature or Jewish-controlled, with baleful results: "the result has been a widening gulf between the cultural successes of Jews and Gentiles and a disaster for society as a whole."{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}

Describing the evolution of his thinking over the course of his writing the trilogy, MacDonald says in his preface to the 2002 paperback edition of ''The Culture of Critique'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think there is a noticeable shift in my tone from the first book to the third simply because (I'd like to think) I knew a lot more and had read a lot more. People often say after reading the first book that they think I really admire Jews, but they are unlikely to say that about the last two and especially about ''CofC''. That is because by the time I wrote ''CofC'' I had changed greatly from the person who wrote the first book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html preface to the paperback edition of The Culture of Critique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006031740/http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Understanding Jewish Influence'' (2004)===

With introduction by [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] political writer [[Samuel T. Francis]], ''Understanding Jewish Influence'' outlines what MacDonald claims are the "background traits" of Jewish influence.  To MacDonald these traits consist of:

*Hyper-[[ethnocentrism]]
*High [[verbal intelligence]] and consequent [[wealth]]
*Psychological intensity
*Social and political aggression

He goes on to assert the influence of these traits upon current events concerning [[Zionism]], [[neoconservatism]], [[immigration]], and Middle Eastern warfare waged by [[Western world|Western]] powers.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}

==Criticism==

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine carried an article by [[Judith Shulevitz]], then Art and Entertainment editor of the Culturebox, entitled "Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite," continuing the discussion followed by an extended rebuttal by MacDonald.  According to Shulevitz, MacDonald's arguments are prescriptive: "Toward the end of the third book, MacDonald lays out his solution for restoring what he calls 'parity' between the Jews and other ethnic groups: systematic discrimination against Jews in college admission and employment and heavy taxation of Jews 'to counter the Jewish advantage in the possession of wealth'".&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;[http://primary.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/culturebox/2000/01/evolutionary_psychologys_antisemite.html Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite - Judith Shulevitz - Slate Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald replied that in the actual passage from ''The Culture of Critique'' quoted by Shulevitz, he was speaking hypothetically of the consequences of competition between ethnic groups of differing abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/quote.html quote]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Potok of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has said of MacDonald that "he put the anti-Semitism under the guise of scholarly work... Kevin MacDonald’s work is nothing but gussied-up anti-Semitism. At base it says that Jews are out to get us through their agenda... His work is bandied about by just about every neo-Nazi group in America."&lt;ref name="Potok"&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~d49er/archives/2004/spring/news/volLIVno119-civil.shtml CSULB Online 49er: volLIVno119: Academic dishonesty punished more leniently]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has included MacDonald in its list of American extremists, ''Extremism in America'', and has written a report&lt;ref name="ADL"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080922101131/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kevin_macdonald/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=7 Kevin MacDonald, Extremism in America]&lt;/ref&gt; on his views and ties. According to the ADL, MacDonald's views on Jews mimic those of antisemites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Academic response===

In a letter to ''Slate'' magazine, [[Harvard University]] psychology professor [[Steven Pinker]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;MacDonald's ideas, as presented in summaries that would serve as a basis for further examination, do not pass that threshold, for many reasons: &lt;br&gt;

1. By stating that Jews promulgate scientific hypotheses because they are Jewish, he is engaging in ''[[ad hominem]]'' argumentation that is outside the bounds of normal scientific discourse and an obvious waste of time to engage. MacDonald has already announced that I will reject his ideas because I am Jewish, so what's the point of replying to them? &lt;br&gt;

2. MacDonald's main axioms &amp;ndash; group selection of behavioral adaptations, and behaviorally relevant genetic cohesiveness of ethnic groups &amp;ndash; are opposed by powerful bodies of data and theory, which Tooby, Cosmides, and many other evolutionary psychologists have written about in detail. Of course any assumption can be questioned, but there are no signs that MacDonald has taken on the burden of proof of showing that the majority view is wrong. &lt;br&gt;

3. MacDonald's various theses, even if worthy of scientific debate individually, collectively add up to a consistently invidious portrayal of Jews, couched in value-laden, disparaging language. It is impossible to avoid the impression that this is not an ordinary scientific hypothesis. &lt;br&gt;

4. The argument, as presented in the summaries, fails two basic tests of scientific credibility: a control group (in this case, other minority ethnic groups), and a comparison with alternative hypotheses (such as [[Thomas Sowell]]'s convincing analysis of "middlemen minorities" such as the Jews, presented in his magisterial study of migration, race, conquest, and culture).&lt;ref name="fringe"&gt;[http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/slatedialog.html Slate Magazine Dialogue On: How To Deal With Fringe Academics]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Pinker closed by commenting that he had "not plowed through MacDonald's trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments, and of not refuting them resoundingly enough".&lt;ref name="fringe" /&gt;

A paper by David Lieberman, a Holocaust researcher at [[Brandeis University]], alleges that MacDonald has distorted evidence and chosen evidence selectively for rhetorical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010609074310/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_01.html MacDonald - Schatz: 1 of 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Tooby]], past president of the [[Human Behavior and Evolution Society]] and a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], insists that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist, and that he advocates a generally discredited view of natural selection. Tooby, the founder of MacDonald's field of evolutionary psychology, criticized MacDonald in an article for the ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' website in 2000: "MacDonald's ideas—not just on Jews—violate fundamental principles of the field".&lt;ref name=SPLC2/&gt;

Reviewing MacDonald's ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy'' in ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', [[Sander Gilman]], professor of the Liberal Arts and Medicine at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] describes MacDonald's arguments about a Jewish group evolutionary strategy as "bizarre". According to Gilman, "MacDonald recasts all of the hoary old myths about Jewish psychological difference and its presumed link to Jewish superior intelligence in contemporary sociobiological garb". Gilman also charges that "MacDonald manipulates his sources rather shamelessly", including Gilman's own work. Gilman concludes that MacDonald's book "is the most recent chapter in the continued myth-building concerning Jewish superior intelligence and achievement. It is, like the numerous earlier works, of interest in how positive images turn into the means by which Jewish difference is stressed and Jewish acculturation is shown to be pathological".&lt;ref name=Gilman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilman |first1=Sander L. |authorlink1=Sander Gilman |title=Review of A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=1995 |volume=86 |issue=1/2 |pages=198–201 |doi=10.2307/1454833 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing Macdonald's ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone'' in the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Eugen Schoenfeld, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at [[Georgia State University]], commented that "the book is controversial, not only because of its theoretical approach, but also, and perhaps primarily, because of sloppy scholarship". Schoenfeld writes that Macdonald "selects historical incidents that can be used to support his thesis and conveniently omits others that challenge his thesis". Schoenfeld points to what he sees as Macdonald's "unfamiliarity with both the sociological frame of reference and historical knowledge", and as an example, notes that Macdonald's comparison of Jewish collectivism during the biblical period with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English individualism "indicates a total ignorance of the impact of industrialization on Western societies".&lt;ref name="Eugen"&gt;Eugen Schoenfeld. Review: A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy by Kevin MacDonald. ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion''. Vol. 34, No. 3 (Sep., 1995):408-410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing Macdonald's ''Separation and Its Discontents'' in the ''American Jewish Society Review'' in 2000, Zev Garber, Professor of Jewish Studies at [[Los Angeles Valley College]], wrote that MacDonald works from the assumption that the dual Torah is the blueprint of the eventual Jewish dominion over the world and that he sees contemporary antisemitism, the Holocaust, and attacks against Israel as "provoked by Jews themselves. In this scenario, Jews imagine themselves as innocent victims of hatred and violence." Garber concludes that Macdonald's "rambling who-is-who-isn't roundup of Jews responsible for the 'Jewish Problem' borders on the irrational and is conducive to misrepresentation".&lt;ref&gt;Seth Garber. Review: Separation and Its Discontents: Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Anti-Semitism, Kevin MacDonald and Antisemitism. Bowerdean Briefings, Milton Shain. ''American Jewish Society Review''. Vol. 25, No. 1. (2000 - 2001):159-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Kriegman]], an evolutionary psychologist, produced a 50-page analysis criticizing MacDonald's work as "pseudo-scientific theorizing", although it does not appear that he ever published it:&lt;ref&gt;http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-antisemitism&amp;month=0107&amp;msg=2rbN3zTBC0rNfGaGv1FvAg&lt;/ref&gt; he did send it to MacDonald, who has since responded.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010702190716/http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/Amherst.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote that MacDonald "believes his own nonsense".  Kriegman remarked in an email, "MacDonald is not the first person to avoid the narcissistic injury of having his ideas rejected by concluding that there was a conspiracy against him rather than becoming aware of the substandard nature [as evidenced in his trilogy] of his thinking."&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;Heidi Beirich: ''[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=1337 Promoting Hate - California Professor is Font of Anti-Semitism]''. Southern Poverty Law Center. Spring 2007. Retrieved on 2007-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

A history professor at MacDonald's university, Don Schwarz, called MacDonald's claims about [[Jewish history]] "unsupportable".&lt;ref name=SPLC2&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2007/spring/promoting-hate |title=California State University, Long Beach Psychology Professor Kevin MacDonald Publishes Anti-Semitic Books |last=Beirich |first=Heidi |date=Spring 2007 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=SPLC |number=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy Professor Warren Weinstein said that MacDonald's work was not science at all, but "something else, masquerading as science": and that "It is in the great tradition of Nazi and Stalinist science which clearly and scientifically proved that their respective insanities were objectively true and defensible."&lt;ref name="SPLC"/&gt;

Academic Jaff Schatz has accused MacDonald of misrepresenting and misusing his work.&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;David Lieberman: ''[http://www.h-net.org/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_02.html Scholarship as an Exercise in Rhetorical Strategy: A Case Study of Kevin MacDonald's Research Techniques]''. H-Antisemitism: Occasional Papers. January 29, 2001. Retrieved on 2007-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hartung, the former associate editor of the ''[[Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology]]'' and an associate professor of anesthesiology at the [[State University of New York]], said that MacDonald's ''The Culture of Critique'' was "quite disturbing, seriously misinformed about evolutionary genetics, and suffering from a huge blind spot about the nature of Christianity".&lt;ref name="SPLC"/&gt;

In a 2000 review in the journal ''[[Shofar (journal)|Shofar]]'', reviewer Jefferson A. Singer wrote that he considered the book to be "written out of a deep and destructive hatred for Jews", and questioned the  editorial policy of the books' publisher, Praeger, in "bringing a book of such dubious scientific merit to a larger audience and in giving it an air of legitimacy it does not deserve".&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson A. Singer. Review of Separation and its discontents  by Kevin McDonald. ''[[Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies]]'', 2000;Vol 19, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Nathan Cofnas of [[the University of Oxford]] published a critique of MacDonald's theory in the journal ''[[Human Nature (journal)|Human Nature]]'' where he concluded that MacDonald relied "on systematically misrepresented sources and cherry-picked facts".&lt;ref name=Cofnas&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-018-9310-x Human Nature volIXno2: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt; Cofnas and Jonathan Anomaly wrote a follow-up article in ''[[Quillette]]'' where they argued that the recent history of persecution was also a factor that influenced Jews to support liberal movements.&lt;ref name=Anomaly&amp;Cofnas&gt;[https://quillette.com/2018/03/15/alt-right-gets-wrong-jews/ What the Alt-Right Gets Wrong About Jews] Quillete&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=June 2018}}

Other responses have been favorable. Laurence Loeb of the [[University of Utah]] (writing for the ''Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review'') called ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone'' a "tour-de-force" and a "watershed contribution to the understanding of Judaism and Jewish life" based on a "cautious, careful assembling of evidence".&lt;ref name="tour de force"&gt;Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review, 19(1-2), 36-38, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald's first books received positive reviews from others including [[Hans Eysenck]],&lt;ref name="Eysenck"&gt;Personality and Individual Differences, 19(1), p. 121, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hartung]],&lt;ref name="Hartung"&gt;Ethology and Sociobiology, 16, pp. 335-342, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lynn]],&lt;ref name="Mankind"&gt;Mankind Quarterly, 37(2), pp. 217-228, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger D.

The '''United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council''' is the diplomatic representative of the [[United States]] to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]].  The position is located within the [[United States Mission to the United Nations and Other International Organizations]] located at [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://geneva.usmission.gov/us-hrc/ | title=U.S. Delegation to the HRC | publisher=[[United States Mission to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva]] | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A formal title for the position is '''United States Representative to the United Nations Human Rights Council, with rank of Ambassador'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://geneva.usmission.gov/2009/11/10/nominationsdonahoe-kennedy/ | title=Nominations for U.S. Ambassador to the Human Rights Council and Conference on Disarmament | publisher=[[The White House]] | date=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until 2006, the position was commonly known as the '''United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights''', as it was associated to a predecessor organization, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intjewishlawyers.org/main/ | title=About Us | publisher=[[International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists]] | accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v4/n1/3/ | title=Recommendations of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change: A Member's Perspective | author=Hannay, David | publisher=[[Journal of International Human Rights]] | date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was more formally called '''United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights''', and did not at first have ambassadorial rank but subsequently attained it.

[[Image:U.S. Mission to the United Nations in Geneva.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|The United States Mission to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva]]
The U.S. Delegation to the Human Rights Council is a part of the U.S. Mission Geneva, and other U.S. ambassadors stationed in Geneva are the United States Ambassador to United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva (head of the overall mission, and not to be confused with the more well-known [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] stationed in New York), the [[United States Ambassador to the World Trade Organization]], and the [[United States Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://geneva.usmission.gov/ | title=United States Mission Geneva | publisher=[[United States Mission to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva]] | accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Commission on Human Rights was formed in April 1946 on a preliminary basis and then in January 1947 on a permanent basis.&lt;ref name="cby-1949"&gt;"Eleanor Roosevelt", ''[[Current Biography Yearbook|Current Biography Yearbook 1949]]''. Published 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  Former [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was chosen as its first chair on both occasions.&lt;ref name="cby-1949"/&gt;  She played a major role in the formation and 1948 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="er-hrc"/&gt;  She also served as the U.S. representative to the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/02/18/87505662.pdf | title=Mrs. Roosevelt Sees U.S. Uncertain on U.N. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 18, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951 she relinquished the chair but stayed on as the U.S. representative to it.&lt;ref name="er-hrc"/&gt;

As with regular ambassadorial posts, nominations are made by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmation by the [[United States Senate]] is required.&lt;ref name="ws-sj"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/537pvssl.asp | title=The Ambassador Nobody Knows | author=[[Scott W. Johnson|Johnson, Scott W.]] | magazine=[[The Weekly Standard]] | date=April 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commentary on people holding the post has often been linked with perceptions that the Commission on Human Rights was anti-U.S. and especially anti-Israel.&lt;ref name="ws-sj"/&gt;  The United States was voted off the commission for a period beginning in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z6U2AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hSUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1975,38036540&amp;dq=ambassador+commission+on+human+rights&amp;hl=en | title=US Loses UN Human Rights Seat | agency=[[Agence France Press]] | page=A9 | date=May 5, 2001 | newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the United States withdrew from the council in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/haley-pompeo-human-rights-bias/index.html | title=US leaving UN Human Rights Council – 'a cesspool of political bias' | first=Laura | last=Koran | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Eleanor Roosevelt, the position has attracted some well-known Americans, including four past members of the [[United States Congress]], one of whom, [[Geraldine Ferraro]], had been [[United States presidential election, 1984|her party's nominee for vice president]].  The most recent person holding the position was [[Keith Harper (lawyer)|Keith Harper]], from June 2014 to January 2017.&lt;ref name="dos-harper"/&gt;

[[File:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|thumb|''[[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Mehemet Ali Viceroy of Egypt]]'', by [[Auguste Couder]], 1841.]]
[[File:როსტომ_ხანი.gif|thumb|200px|[[Rostom of Kartli|Rostom]] (''Rustam Khan''), [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] ''viceroy'' of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]

'''''Wāli''''' or '''''vali''''' (from [[Arabic]] والي ''Wāli'') is an administrative title that was used during the [[Caliphate]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] to designate governors of administrative divisions. It is still in use in some countries influenced by Arab or Muslim culture. The division that a Wāli governs is called [[Wilayah]], or, in the case of [[Turkey|Ottoman Turkey]], "[[Vilayet]]".

== Algerian term ==
In [[Algeria]], a ''wāli'' is the "[[governor]]" and administrative head of each of the [[provinces of Algeria|48 provinces]] of the country, and is chosen by the [[president of Algeria|president]].

== Iranian term ==

In [[Iran]] the term is known as Vāli and refers to the governor-general or local lord of an important province. During the [[Safavid]] reign 1501-1722 the former rulers of the then subordinated provinces of the Georgian [[Kartli]] and [[Kakheti]] kingdom, the Kurdish emirate of [[Ardalan]], the chiefs of [[Lorestān Province]] and of [[Khuzestan Province]] in western [[Iran]] were regarded as hereditary governor-generals titled ''Vāli'' equal to the [[Beylerbeylik (Safavid Persia)]]. These "lords of the marches" should protect Iran's western borders against foreign powers. During the [[Qajar]] rule 1785-1925 the [[kingdom of Georgia]] was lost to Russia and the hereditary lords were replaced by officials of the central power. Mainly these officials came from the group of imperial princes and royal notables and were made Vāli of important provinces. For example, the [[crown prince]] bore traditionally the title of Vāli of [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan (Iran)]].

== Ottoman Empire term ==
'''''"Vali"''''' was the title in the Ottoman Empire of the most common type of Ottoman [[governor]], in charge of a '''''[[vilayet]]''''' (in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]), often a military officer such as a [[pasha]]; see [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire]].

=== Turkish term ===
In [[Turkey]] (the main [[succession of states|successor state]] to the Ottoman Empire), a ''wāli'' (spelled as "vali") is the "[[governor]]" and administrative head of each of the [[provinces of Turkey|81 provinces]] of the country, and is appointed by the [[government of Turkey|government]].

== Omani Sultanate term ==
The [[Sultanate of Oman]], when it ruled [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya]], appointed a ''wali'' for the city known locally as ''LiWali''. The term is still used today to denote settlements of Oman, such as the ''Wilayat [[Madha]],'' a settlement which intersects the road between [[Al Madam|Madam]] in [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]] and [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]] in [[Emirate of Dubai|Dubai]] in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Many Rulers of the [[Trucial States]] (also called Trucial Oman in the past) appointed ''walis'' to look after towns on their behalf, including employing slaves for that purpose.

== Moroccan term ==
Since 1997 regionalisation reform, a ''Wāli'' is the governor of one of the sixteen [[regions of Morocco]].

== Pakistani term ==
In [[Pakistan]], the [[Wali of Swat|rulers]] of the former princely state of [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]] were given the title of ''Wali''.

== Philippine term ==
{{see also|Peace process with the Bangsamoro in the Philippines}}
In the [[Philippines]], the term ''Wali'' is the proposed name for the titular head of [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro]], a proposed, autonomous political entity in the large southern island of [[Mindanao]]. The Bangsamoro, which is intended to give devolved powers to [[Filipino Muslims]], is intended to supersede [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]]. The ''Wali'' (analogous to the present Governor of the ARMM) will have ceremonial functions and powers such as moral guardianship of the territory and convocation and dissolution of its [[Bagsamoro Assembly|proposed legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kabiling|first1=Genalyn|title=PNoy submits draft Bangsamoro law Entity to have 58 exclusive powers; UN, Canada hail move|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pnoy-submits-draft-bangsamoro-law/|accessdate=2 February 2015|agency=Manila Bulletin|publisher=Manila Bulletin|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wartime Measure Act of 1918''' was United States federal legislation deeming wartime travel as an unlawful act when touring without an [[United States passport]].

==Background==
The [[passport]] has long been used as an instrument of international travel, not only in the United States, but also all throughout the world. On August 18, 1856, [[United States Congress|Congress]] resolved that passports were reserved for citizens of the United States alone. Congress also gave the Secretary of State "sole authority to issue passports and made it illegal for any other authority to issue a passport or a document in the nature of a passport."&lt;ref name=craig&gt;Robertson, Craig. The Passport in America: The History of a Document. Oxford University Press, 2010. GoogleBooks. Web. 20 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The first instance of strict regulations on passport travel in the United States was during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], attributable to Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]].&lt;ref name=craig /&gt; These regulations required that anyone entering or exiting the United States have a passport, including immigrants, who had to have their documentation signed by a U.S. minister or consul.&lt;ref name=craig /&gt; There was contention centered upon the 1856 Act that drew from three main components: passports were only issued to citizens of the United States, the authority to issue passports was vested in the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], and that very authority came with incredible discretion. Further, problems arose in the verification of one's citizenship, as "government officials and applicants often sought to turn the vagaries of citizenship to their advantage."&lt;ref name=craig /&gt;

On July 26, 1917, the State and Labor Departments issued a joint order that attempted to "legally control the entry of aliens to the United States," by requiring them to have visas issued by a United States [[Consul (representative)|consul]].&lt;ref name=craig /&gt; However, the Attorney General later determined that the executive branch, namely the President, did not have the authority to implement such regulations. This led to the second instance in which strict regulations were placed on passport travel for citizens of the United States. On May 22, 1918 the Wartime Measure Act, also known as the Travel Control Act, was signed by [[Woodrow Wilson]] just one year following the United States' entrance into World War I.&lt;ref name=dav&gt;Farley, David. Modernist Travel Writing: Intellectuals Abroad. University of Missouri Press, 2010. GoogleBooks. Web. 20 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Act, the continued discretion of passport officials made it nearly "impossible to travel in the 1920s and 1930s without securing the necessary documents."&lt;ref name=dav /&gt; The necessity of this Act stemmed primarily from the "unregulated flow of people across borders" during the war, which was seen as a potential national security threat for countries around the world, including the United States.&lt;ref name=dav /&gt;

== Other provisions ==
What is most commonly referenced{{by whom|date=June 2018}} from the Act is Section II containing the passport restriction condition.  However, the Act itself has many other provisions as well.

The [[65th United States Congress]] approved the Act on May 22, 1918 in Session 2, as Chapter 81. The primary objective was to "prevent in time of war departure from or entry into the United States contrary to the public safety."&lt;ref name=act&gt;{{USStatute|65|154|40|559|1918|05|22|HR|10264}}&lt;/ref&gt; It vested power in the President to impose restrictions on the entry and departure of persons within the jurisdiction of the United States when at war. Essentially, the Act was open-ended: "If the President shall find that the public safety requires that restrictions and prohibitions in addition to those provided otherwise than by this Act…it shall, until otherwise ordered by the President or Congress, be unlawful":&lt;ref name=act /&gt;

* For any alien person to leave or come into the United States "except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders," approved by the President,
* For assisting the entry or departure of another while knowing or suspecting that it would be "forbidden by this Act,"
* For anyone to lie or falsify information relating to themselves or another person in attempt to gain permission to leave or enter the United States,
* For anyone to provide, attempt to provide, or assist in providing anyone with a permit to depart or enter the United States that was "not issued and designed for his use,"
* For anyone to themselves use a permit or issuance of permission for entry or exit from the United States that was not intended for them,
* For the forging of such documentation required for entry into and departure from the United States,
* For the forging of such documentation for another person required for entry into and departure from the United States.&lt;ref name=act /&gt;

===Section II===
Most commonly known and referenced, this section required that any citizen of the United States obtain a passport for travel to and from the United States.&lt;ref name=act /&gt;

===Section III===
This section outlined the punishments faced should anyone violate any of the components of the Act. If convicted, one could face a fine not exceeding $10,000, or if a natural citizen, they could face no more than 20 years imprisonment, or both. Additionally, any "officer, director or agent of any corporation" convicted of a violation could be punished by such fine or imprisonment, or both. Any "vehicle or vessel, together with its or her appurtenances, equipment, tackle, apparel, and furniture, concerned in any such violation, shall be forfeited to the United States."&lt;ref name=act /&gt;

===Section IV and Conclusion===
The United States is defined as including the Canal Zone, and all territories and their respective waters, "continental or insular."&lt;ref name=act /&gt; A person is defined as any "individual, partnership, association, company, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation, or body politic."&lt;ref name=act /&gt;

==Aftermath==
An article from the New York Times, published August 26, 1919, quoted President Woodrow Wilson's request to Congress to extend the passport provision for one more year. His rationale was that a lift on travel restrictions to and from the United States would welcome an increase in immigrants, including those "undesirable, from the point of view of becoming future citizens," and those whose "origin and affiliations make it inadvisable that they should be permitted to enter"&lt;ref&gt;New York Times: "President Urges Longer Alien Ban." 26 Aug. 1919. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; the country. The extension, necessitating a $750,000 appropriation, would, according to President Wilson, maintain a necessary system of passport control.

Another New York Times article headlined "Enemy Aliens Need No Permit Now to Quit the United States,"&lt;ref name=enemy&gt;New York Times: "Enemy Aliens Need No Permit Now to Quit the United States." 2 July 1920. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; also discussed the issue of travel control during this time. The President amended a previous Executive Order, so that "hostile or enemy aliens"&lt;ref name=enemy /&gt; that wished to leave the United States no longer needed permission for departure, unless stated by the Secretary of State. A passport from their country of origin was sufficient, so long as it was dated within one year prior to the desired date of departure.&lt;ref name=enemy /&gt;

The '''White Cross Army''' was an organisation set up in 1883 by philanthropist [[Ellice Hopkins]] with help from the [[Joseph Lightfoot|Bishop of Durham]], to promote "social purity". The recruits&amp;nbsp;– all of them men&amp;nbsp;– pledged to show a "chivalrous respect for womanhood", to apply ideas of purity equally to men and women, and not to indulge in foul language or indecent behaviour. It was renamed the '''White Cross League''' in 1891, and merged with the Church of England Purity Society, which had been formed by [[Edward White Benson]].{{sfnp|Prochaska|1980|p=215|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Rappaport|2001|p=307|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Prettejohn|1999|p=228|ps=none}}

The organisation was Christian in ethos but, at the insistence of Hopkins and somewhat unusually for a purity association, it was non-denominational in practice. Its name was symbolic: ''White'' denoted purity, ''Cross'' referred to the campaign being for Christ, and ''Army'' reflected its disciplined nature.{{sfnp|Mumm|1998|p=170|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Bartley|2012|p=156|ps=none}} It adopted as its motto the words of [[Sir Galahad]]:{{sfnp|DeCosta|1887|p=5|ps=none}}
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;My strength is as the strength of ten,
Because my heart is pure&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The army based its structure on that of the [[Temperance movement in the United Kingdom|temperance movement]]. Its target audience was mostly working-class men, who were exhorted to pledge their support for its aims by speakers at mass meetings.{{sfnp|Mumm|1998|p=170|ps=none}} In lectures delivered by the organisation, the pledge of ''purity'' was defined for married men as the practice of sexual restraint, while young and unmarried men were expected to practice chastity and renounce masturbation.{{sfnp|Hunt|1998|p=614|ps=none}} As with the Church of England Purity Society, whose goals were similar but aimed at upper-class men, the Army believed that it was men who should be responsible for sexual virtue.{{sfnp|Bartley|2012|p=156|ps=none}}

There were 102 affiliated branches in Britain within a year of formation, and branches in Australia, Canada, Germany, India and the United States. The British branches had attracted 2000 pledge-takers in that time and were mostly in the industrialised regions of [[The Midlands]] and [[North England]].{{sfnp|Mumm|1998|p=170|ps=none}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12660">A '''works council'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://onelook.com/?w=works+council "works council"] at Onelook.com&lt;/ref&gt; (very rarely called "'''work council'''")&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=work+council%2Cworks+council&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cwork%20council%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cworks%20council%3B%2Cc0 Ngram Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onelook.com/?w=work+council "work council"] at Onelook.com&lt;/ref&gt; is a "shop-floor" organization representing workers that functions as a local/firm-level complement to [[trade union]]s but is independent of these at least in some countries. Works councils exist with different names in a variety of related forms in a number of European countries, including Britain (''joint consultative committee or employees’ council''); [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] (''Betriebsrat'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verdi.de/service/fragen-antworten/++co++e5a9cfae-a883-11e0-43aa-00093d114afd|title=Information about ''Betriebsrat'' in Germany (German)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.verdi.de|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/service/betriebsrat/rechteundpflichtendesbetriebsrates/Rechte_und_Pflichten_des_Betriebsrates.html|title=Information about Betriebsrat in Austria (in German)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.arbeiterkammer.at|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luxembourg]] (''comité mixte'', ''délégation du personnel''); the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]] in [[Belgium]] (''ondernemingsraad''); [[Italy]] (''comitato aziendale'');  [[France]] (''comité d'entreprise''); [[Wallonia]] in Belgium (''conseil d'entreprise'') and [[Spain]] (''comité de empresa'').

One of the most commonly examined (and arguably most successful) implementations of this institution is found in Germany.  The model is basically as follows:  general labour agreements are made at the national level by national unions (e.g. [[IG Metall]]) and national employer associations (e.g. [[Gesamtmetall]]), and local plants and firms then meet with works councils to adjust these national agreements to local circumstances. Works council members are elected by the company workforce for a four-year term. They don't have to be union members; works councils can also be formed in companies where neither the employer nor the employees are organized.

Works council representatives may also be appointed to the [[board of directors]].

As with [[co-determination]], there are three main views about why works councils primarily exist: to reduce workplace conflict by improving and systematising communication channels; to increase bargaining power of workers at the expense of owners by means of legislation; and to correct market failures by means of public policy.

==European Works Council==
On 22 September 1994, the [[Council of the European Union]] passed a [[European Union directive|Directive]] (94/45/EC) on the establishment of a European Works Council (EWC) or similar procedure for the purposes of informing and consulting employees in companies which operate at [[European Union]] level.

The EWC Directive applies to companies with at least 1,000 employees within the EU and at least 150 employees in each of at least two Member States.

[[European Works Council]]s were created partly as a response to increased transnational restructuring brought about by the [[Single European Act]]. They give representatives of workers from all European countries in big [[multinational companies]] a direct line of communication to top management. They also make sure that workers in different countries are all told the same thing at the same time about transnational policies and plans. Lastly, they give workers’ representatives in [[Trade union|unions]] and national works councils the opportunity to consult with each other and to develop a common European response to employers’ transnational plans, which management must then consider before those plans are implemented.

The EWC Directive was revised by the Council and the European Parliament in May 2009.  The changes contained in the new ("Recast") Directive must be transposed into national law by 5 June 2011, and have important implications for all companies in scope of the legislation, both those with an existing [[European Works Council]] and those yet to have set one up.

===France===
A comité d’entreprise (works council) is mandatory in any company with 50 employees or more. Members of the C.E. are elected by all the employees, and have 20 hours of delegation. The main role of the C.E. is being the interface between the employees and the members of the board which is constituted of the Chairman and the HR. The number of members depends of the number of people in the company. All members of the C.E. have a monthly meeting with the board, in which very specific points are dealt with.&lt;ref name="Bento 10–11"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bento|first=F|title=Interviewing member of C.E in CRO France|url=http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/149-interview-with-florence-bentolila-describing-the-comit%C3%A9-dentreprise|work=Expatriates Magazine|publisher=EP|location=Paris|pages=10–11|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
Works councils in Germany have a long history, with their origins in the early 1920s in the post [[World War I]] [[Weimar Republic]], established by the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz or Works Council Act. Initially, unions were very skeptical of works councils, seeing them as a way for management to negotiate with employees without employing [[collective bargaining]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inequality and Prosperity: Social Europe vs. Liberal America|last=Pontusson|first=Jonas|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780801489709|location=Ithaca and London|pages=Ch. 6|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually they developed clearly defined responsibilities with works councils not allowed to organize strikes or enforce a wage increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bund-verlag.de/blog/betriebsrat/betriebsverfassungsgesetz-betrvg/|title=Das Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (BetrVG) {{!}} Nachrichten für Betriebsräte|website=www.bund-verlag.de|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years with a decline in union membership, works councils have come to be seen as a way for unions to recruit members, specifically by having works councils campaign for people to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Martin|year=2009|title=Still Married after All These Years? Union Organizing and the Role of Works Councils in German Industrial Relations|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=62| issue =  3|pages=275–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, they serve two functions. The first is called [[co-determination]], through which works councils elect members of the board of directors of German companies. The second is called participation, and means that works councils must be consulted about specific issues and have the right to make proposals to management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Countries/Germany/Workplace-Representation|title=Workplace Representation / Germany / Countries / National Industrial Relations / Home - WORKER PARTICIPATION.eu|last=Cleverway|website=www.worker-participation.eu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most impressive achievements of the councils is producing incredibly harmonious relations between management and workers, leading to a situation with strong unions and an incredibly low strike rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma98/pollklas/thesis/germany.html|title=Interest Group History - The Case of Capital and Labor in Germany|website=xroads.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows for a lot of coordination between the firm and the workers, resulting in, for example, the ability of many German firms to dramatically scale back the hours of each worker without large scale layoffs during the 2008 financial crisis, and then slowly scaling back up as the recovery took effect. This was all assisted by the Kurzarbeit, a fund that helps workers who have had their hours reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailysignal.com/2014/06/19/economic-crisis-survival-germany-shows-preparation-key/|title=How Germany Survived the Economic Crisis|date=2014-06-19|website=The Daily Signal|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works councils in Germany have been correlated with a number of positive effects. They promote higher wages, even more than collective bargaining (although situations with both will promote wages the highest),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=John T. et al.|year=2010|title=German works councils and the anatomy of wages|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=63| issue =  2|pages=247–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; they make firms more productive (although the degree to which they increase productivity can be hard to measure).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Steffen|year=2012|title=Works councils and establishment productivity|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=65| issue =  4|pages=880–898}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they don’t inhibit investment or innovation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=John T. et al|year=2007|title=Do Works Councils Inhibit Investment?|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=60| issue =  2|pages=187–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=John T. et al|year=2001|title=Works Councils in Germany: Their Effects on Establishment Performance|url=|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=53| issue =  4|pages=659–694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works councils have also been shown to help women, [[East Germany|East German]], and foreign workers at a higher rate compared to West German men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, they are correlated lower profitability, likely since they tend to bring higher wages, and there may not be as much benefit in smaller companies as there is in larger ones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] has held that works councils must be elected, and without interference by the employer, in order to be lawful. The simplest method is that the recognized labor union organizes the elections for works councils. A [[company union]], organized, funded or influenced by the employer, is prohibited under section 8(a)(2) of the [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlabor.org/2013/09/19/wsj-columnist-jenkins-gets-the-law-wrong-on-vw-works-council/|title=WSJ Columnist Jenkins Gets Works-Council Law Wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been upheld in the courts; the controlling case is ''[[Electromation, Inc. v. NLRB]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btlaw.com/experience/xpqExperienceDetail.aspx?xpST=ExperienceDetail&amp;experience=1228|title=Electromation, Inc. v. NLRB, Nos. 92-4129, 93-1169 (7th Cir. 1994).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/us/setback-for-labor-management-teamwork-efforts.html|title=Setback for Labor-Management Teamwork Efforts|last=Presley Noble|first=Barbara|date=1992-12-18|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
