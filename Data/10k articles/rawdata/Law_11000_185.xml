      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1822">The '''Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA)''' ('''RA 8435''') is a comprehensive legislation that provides blueprint for the sector’s modernization and rural development in the [[Philippines]].

==History==
The landmark Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), or Republic Act 8435,  was signed into law in December 1997 by former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]]. AFMA focuses on five (5) major concerns: poverty alleviation and social equity, food security, global competitiveness, sustainable development, and income profitability especially for farmers and fisher folks.

Trade and fiscal incentives are provided under AFMA. Section 109 of RA 8435 provides that all enterprises engaged in agriculture and fishery duly certified by the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] in consultation with the [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Department of Finance]] and the Board of Investments (BOI) shall, for five (5) years be exempted from the payment of tariff duties.

The '''Armistice of 11 November 1918''' was the [[armistice]] that ended fighting on land, sea and air in [[World War I]] between the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and their opponent, [[German Empire|Germany]]. Previous armistices had been agreed with [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Also known as the '''Armistice of Compiègne''' from the place where it was signed at 5:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. by the French [[Ferdinand Foch|Marshal Foch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/armistice.htm|access-date=26 November 2018|title=Armistice: The End of World War I,1918|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126000847/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/armistice.htm|archive-date=26 November 2018|website=EyeWitness to History}}&lt;/ref&gt; it came into force at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. Paris time on 11 November 1918 ("the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month") and marked a victory for the Allies and a defeat for Germany, although not formally a surrender.

The actual terms, largely written by the Allied Supreme Commander, [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Ferdinand Foch]], included the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of German forces to behind the [[Rhine]], Allied occupation of the [[Rhineland]] and bridgeheads further east, the preservation of infrastructure, the surrender of aircraft, warships, and military [[materiel]], the release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, eventual reparations, no release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval [[blockade of Germany]].

Although the armistice ended the fighting, it needed to be prolonged three times until the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed on 28 June 1919, took effect on 10 January 1920.

[[File:Armistice 18 novembre 1918.jpg|thumb|Last page of the Armistice agreement]]

==October 1918 telegrams==
[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|thumb|left|Front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 11 November 1918]]
On 29 September 1918 the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German Supreme Army Command]] informed [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and the Imperial [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]], [[Count]] [[Georg von Hertling]] at Imperial Army Headquarters in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] of [[Belgium|occupied Belgium]], that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless. [[Quartermaster general|Quartermaster General]] [[Erich Ludendorff]], probably fearing a breakthrough, claimed that he could not guarantee that the front would hold for another two hours and demanded a request be given to the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] for an immediate ceasefire. In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demands of US president [[Woodrow Wilson]] (the [[Fourteen Points]]) including putting the [[Imperial Government]] on a democratic footing, hoping for more favorable peace terms. This enabled him to save the face of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely into the hands of the democratic parties and the parliament. He expressed his view to officers of his staff on 1 October: "They now must lie on the bed that they've made for us."{{Sfn|Axelrod|2018|p=260}}

On 3 October, the liberal [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] (prime minister), replacing [[Georg von Hertling]] in order to negotiate an armistice.{{Sfn|Czernin|1964|p=}} After long conversations with the Kaiser and evaluations of the political and military situations in the Reich, by 5 October 1918, the German government sent a message to President Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared "Fourteen Points". In the subsequent two exchanges, Wilson's allusions "failed to convey the idea that the Kaiser's abdication was an essential condition for peace. The leading statesmen of the Reich were not yet ready to contemplate such a monstrous possibility."{{Sfn|Czernin|1964|p=7}} As a precondition for negotiations, Wilson demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and the Kaiser's abdication, writing on 23 October: "If the Government of the United States must deal with the military masters and the monarchical autocrats of Germany now, or if it is likely to have to deal with them later in regard to the international obligations of the German Empire, it must demand not peace negotiations but surrender."{{Sfn|Czernin|1964|p=9}}

In late October, Ludendorff, in a sudden change of mind, declared the conditions of the Allies unacceptable. He now demanded to resume the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier. However the German soldiers were pressing to get home. It was scarcely possible to arouse their readiness for battle anew, and desertions were on the increase. The Imperial Government stayed on course and Ludendorff was replaced by [[Wilhelm Groener]]. On 5 November, the Allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce, now also demanding [[reparations (transitional justice)|reparation]] payments.{{sfn|Morrow, Jr.|2005|p=278}}

The latest note from Wilson was received in Berlin on 6 November. That same day, the delegation led by [[Matthias Erzberger]] departed for France.{{sfn|Leonhard|2014|p=916}}

A much bigger obstacle, which contributed to the five-week delay in the signing of the Armistice and to the resulting social deterioration in [[Europe]], was the fact that the French, British and Italian governments had no desire to accept the "Fourteen Points" and President Wilson's subsequent promises. For example, they assumed that the de-militarization suggested by Wilson would be limited to the Central Powers. There were also contradictions with their post-War plans that did not include a consistent implementation of the ideal of national self-determination.{{sfn|Leonhard|2014|p=884}} As Czernin points out:

{{Quote|The Allied statesmen were faced with a problem: so far they had considered the "fourteen commandments" as a piece of clever and effective American propaganda, designed primarily to undermine the fighting spirit of the [[Central Powers]], and to bolster the morale of the lesser [[Allies]]. Now, suddenly, the whole peace structure was supposed to be built up on that set of "vague principles", most of which seemed to them thoroughly unrealistic, and some of which, if they were to be seriously applied, were simply unacceptable.{{Sfn|Czernin|1964|p=23}}}}

==German Revolution==
{{Main|German Revolution of 1918–19}}

The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]] which took place during the night of 29 to 30 October 1918 in the naval port of [[Wilhelmshaven]] spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and to the announcement of the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II.{{efn|The announcement by [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] had great effect, but the abdication document was not formally signed until 28 November.}}
However in various areas soldiers challenged the authority of their officers and on occasion established [[Soldiers' Councils]]. Thus for example the [[Brussels Soldiers' Council]] was set up by revolutionary soldiers on 9 November 1918.

Also on 9 November, Max von Baden handed over the office of Chancellor to [[Friedrich Ebert]], a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]. Ebert's SPD and Erzberger's Catholic [[German Centre Party|Centre Party]] had enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the Imperial government since [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s era in the 1870s and 1880s. They were well represented in the Imperial [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], which had little power over the government, and had been calling for a negotiated peace since 1917. Their prominence in the peace negotiations would cause the new [[Weimar Republic]] to lack legitimacy in right-wing and militarist eyes.

==Negotiation process==
{{see also|Compiègne Wagon}}
The Armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process. The German delegation headed by Matthias Erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of Northern France, arriving on the morning of 8 November. They were then taken to the secret destination aboard [[Ferdinand Foch]]'s private train parked in a railway siding in the [[forest of Compiègne]].{{sfn|Rudin|1967|pp=320–349}}

Foch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations: on the first day, to ask the German delegation what they wanted, and on the last day, to see to the signatures. The Germans were handed the list of Allied demands and given 72 hours to agree. The German delegation discussed the Allied terms not with Foch, but with other French and Allied officers. The Armistice amounted to complete German demilitarization (see list below), with few promises made by the Allies in return. The naval [[blockade of Germany]] was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon.{{sfn|Rudin|1967|p=377}}{{sfn|Haffner|2002|p=74}}

There was no question of negotiation. The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands (for example, the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed), extended the schedule for the withdrawal and registered their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms. But they were in no position to refuse to sign. On Sunday 10 November, they were shown newspapers from Paris to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated. That same day, Ebert instructed Erzberger to sign. The cabinet had earlier received a message from Hindenburg, requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on.{{sfn|Haffner|2002|p=113}}{{sfn|Rudin|1967|p=389}}

The [[Armistice]] was agreed upon at 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 11 November, to come into effect at 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Paris time (noon German time),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poulle |first=Yvonne |title=La France à l'heure allemande|journal=Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes |year=1999 |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=493–502 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024453/http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989/article_bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989.pdf|doi=10.3406/bec.1999.450989|language=fr|trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to as "the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month". Signatures were made between 5:12&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 5:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., Paris time.

===Allied Rhineland occupation===
{{Main|Occupation of the Rhineland}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:US 64th regiment celebrate the Armistice.jpg|thumb|American soldiers of the [[64th Infantry Regiment (United States)|64th Regiment]], part of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Division]], celebrate the news of the Armistice.]]
The British public was notified of the armistice by a subjoined official [[communiqué]] issued from the Press Bureau at 10:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., when [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] announced: "The armistice was signed at five o'clock this morning, and hostilities are to cease on all fronts at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. to-day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Peace Day in London|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=PBH19190102.2.3|newspaper=[[Gisborne Herald|The Poverty Bay Herald]]|location=[[Gisborne, New Zealand]]|date=2 January 1919|page=2|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official communique was published by the United States at 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm: "In accordance with the terms of the Armistice, hostilities on the fronts of the American armies were suspended at eleven o'clock this morning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/mirror07_01.shtml|title=World Wars: Daily Mirror Headlines: Armistice, Published 12 November 1918|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the armistice being signed was officially announced towards 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. in Paris. One hour later, Foch, accompanied by a British admiral, presented himself at the [[Ministry of War]], where he was immediately received by [[Georges Clemenceau]], the [[Prime Minister of France]]. At 10:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., Foch issued this general order: "Hostilities will cease on the whole front as from November 11 at 11 o'clock French time The Allied troops will not, until further order, go beyond the line reached on that date and at that hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Reich Quit Last War Deep in French Forest|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vSoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4794,2713567|newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|location=[[Milwaukee]]|date=7 May 1945|page=10|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five minutes later, Clemenceau, Foch and the British admiral went to the [[Élysée Palace]]. At the first shot fired from the [[Eiffel Tower]], the Ministry of War and the Élysée Palace displayed flags, while bells around Paris rang. Five hundred students gathered in front of the Ministry and called upon Clemenceau, who appeared on the balcony. Clemenceau exclaimed "Vive la France!"—the crowd echoed him. At 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., the first peace-gunshot was fired from [[Fort Mont-Valérien]], which told the population of Paris that the armistice was concluded, but the population were already aware of it from official circles and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The News in Paris|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 November 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the information about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before, fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour. At 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides. But in general, reactions were muted. A British corporal reported: "...the Germans came from their trenches, bowed to us and then went away. That was it. There was nothing with which we could celebrate, except cookies."{{sfn|Leonhard|2014|p=919}} On the Allied side, euphoria and exultation were rare. There was some cheering and applause, but the dominant feeling was silence and emptiness after 52 exhausting months of war.{{sfn|Leonhard|2014|p=919}}

The peace between the Allies and Germany was subsequently settled in 1919, by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that same year.

==Last casualties==
[[File:GuntherHNstone.JPG|thumb|Gravestone of Henry N. Gunther in Baltimore]]
Many artillery units continued to fire on German targets to avoid having to haul away their spare ammunition. The Allies also wished to ensure that, should fighting restart, they would be in the most favourable position. Consequently, there were 10,944 casualties, of whom 2,738 men died, on the last day of the war.{{Sfn|Persico|2005}}

An example of the determination of the Allies to maintain pressure until the last minute, but also to adhere strictly to the Armistice terms, was Battery 4 of the US Navy's long-range [[14"/50 caliber railway gun|14-inch railway guns]] firing its last shot at 10:57:30 am from the Verdun area, timed to land far behind the German front line just before the scheduled Armistice.{{sfn|Breck|1922|p=14}}

[[Augustin Trébuchon]] was the last Frenchman to die when he was shot on his way to tell fellow soldiers, who were attempting an assault across the [[Meuse]] river, that hot soup would be served after the ceasefire. He was killed at 10:45&amp;nbsp;a.m.

Earlier, the last soldier from the UK to die, [[George Edwin Ellison]] of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, was killed that morning at around 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. while scouting on the outskirts of Mons, Belgium.

The final Canadian, and Commonwealth, soldier to die, Private [[George Lawrence Price]], was shot and killed by a sniper while part of a force advancing into the Belgian town of [[Ville-sur-Haine]] just two minutes before the armistice to the north of Mons at 10:58&amp;nbsp;a.m., to be recognized as one of the last killed with a monument to his name.

[[Henry Gunther]], an American, is generally recognized as the last soldier killed in action in World War I. He was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished German troops who were aware the Armistice was nearly upon them. He had been despondent over his recent reduction in rank and was apparently trying to redeem his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The last soldiers to die in World War I |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7696021.stm |work=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=6 November 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081107020204/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7696021.stm| archivedate= 7 November 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Michael Palin: My guilt over my great-uncle who died in the First World War |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3329304/Michael-Palin-My-guilt-over-my-great-uncle-who-died-in-the-First-World-War.html |quote=We unearthed many heart-breaking stories, such as that of Augustin Trébuchon, the last Frenchman to die in the War.

News of the armistice only reached African forces, the [[King's African Rifles]], still fighting with great success in today's [[Zambia]] about a fortnight later. The German and British commanders then had to agree on the protocols for their own armistice ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46329241|title=Where World War One finally ended|access-date=26 November 2018|archive-date=26 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126003302/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46329241|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Legacy==
Celebration of the Armistice became the centrepiece of memories of the war, along with salutes to the unknown soldier. Nations built monuments to the dead and the heroic soldiers, but seldom to the generals and admirals.{{sfn|Theodosiou|2010|pp= 185–198}} 11 November is commemorated annually in many countries under various names such as [[Armistice Day]], [[Remembrance Day]], [[Veterans Day]], and in Poland it is [[National Independence Day (Poland)|Independence Day]].

The end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in China (end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War#End of Pacific War and surrender of Japanese troops in China|Second Sino-Japanese War]]) formally took place on 9 September 1945 at 9:00 (the ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month). The date was chosen in echo of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 (on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month); and because "nine" is [[Numbers in Chinese culture#Nine|homophone of the word for "long lasting"]] in Chinese (to suggest that the peace won would last forever&lt;ref&gt;Hans Van De Ven, "A call to not lead humanity into another war", ''[[China Daily]]'', 31 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Stab-in-the-back myth==
The myth that the German Army was [[Stab-in-the-back myth|stabbed in the back]], by the Social Democratic government that was formed in November 1918, was created by reviews in the German press that grossly misrepresented British [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Maurice]]'s book, ''The Last Four Months''. "Ludendorff made use of the reviews to convince Hindenburg."{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=31}}
{{Quote|In a hearing before the Committee on Inquiry of the National Assembly on November 18, 1919, a year after the war's end, Hindenburg declared, "As an English general has very truly said, the German Army was 'stabbed in the back'."{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=31}} }}

In English [[criminal law]], '''attainder''' or '''attinctura''' was the metaphorical "stain" or "corruption of blood" which arose from being condemned for a serious [[capital crime]] ([[felony]] or [[treason]]). It entailed losing not only one's life, property and [[hereditary titles]], but typically also the right to pass them on to one's [[heirs]]. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.

'''Attainder by confession''' resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the [[coroner]] in [[sanctuary]]. '''Attainder by verdict''' resulted from [[Jury trial|conviction by jury]]. '''Attainder by process''' resulted from a legislative act [[outlaw]]ing a fugitive. The last form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|abolished]].

==Attainders of English noblemen and women in the Middle Ages and Renaissance==
[[File:Richard of York Talbot Shrewsbury Book.jpeg|thumb|[[Richard of York]], attainted by [[Margaret of Anjou]]]]
Medieval and Renaissance English monarchs used acts of attainder to deprive nobles of their lands and often their lives. Once attainted, the descendants of the noble could no longer inherit his lands or income. Attainder essentially amounted to the legal death of the attainted's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J. R. Landera1 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=52879FB5697304D27E716E4E892366E0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3334696 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monarchs typically used attainders against political enemies and those who posed potential threats to the king's position and security. The attainder eliminated any advantage the noble would have in a court of law; nobles were exempt from many of the techniques used to try [[commoners]], including [[torture]].  Likewise, in many cases of attainder, the king could coerce the parliament into approving the attainder and there would be a lower or non-existent burden of proof (evidence) than there would be in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/attainder.htm |title=Attainder, Being Attainted, Attainder Reversed - Luminarium Encyclopedia |publisher=Luminarium.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Tudors, most rulers reversed their attainders in return for promises of loyalty. For example, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] reversed all 21 attainders, [[Edward IV]] 86 of 120, and [[Richard III]] 99 of 100.&lt;ref name="sommerville"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20HVII%20policy.htm |title=Domestic and foreign policy of Henry VII |publisher=History.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053718/http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20HVII%20policy.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this changed with [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], as described below.

Regnants who used attainder include:
* [[Margaret of Anjou]]: her attainder of [[Richard of York]] compelled him to invade England and attempt to seize the throne after the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], which led to the penultimate phases of the [[War of the Roses]].
* [[Edward IV of England]]: used attainder after killing his brother, [[George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence]] for high treason.  This allowed [[Richard III of England]] to seize the throne when he claimed that Edward IV's sons were [[illegitimate]].  
* [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]: initially attainted men after he ascended the throne.&lt;ref name="sommerville"/&gt; He used the threat of attainder as a means to keep the few nobles who survived the [[War of the Roses]] in line. Often, however, he would penalize them with exorbitant fees and fines, or force them to have bonds which would be forfeit unless they exhibited good behaviour (his goal was to reduce the number of nobles with private armies of [[Bastard feudalism|retainers]].) Henry VII attainted 138 men, of whom he reversed only 46 attainders, and some of these were conditional.
* [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: compelled parliament to attaint many nobles during his lifetime, including magnates with major land holdings, and any magnates whom he came to mistrust. Examples include:
** [[Anne Boleyn]]: Before her execution, she was stripped of her title, and her marriage was [[annulment|annulled]].
** [[Catherine Howard]]: Henry VIII had an Act of Attainder passed against Catherine Howard, which made it [[Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541|treason]] for a woman with an [[Virginity|unchaste]] reputation to marry the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Mahoney |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/tudor_4.htm |title=Kings and Queens of England - Henry VIII |publisher=English Monarchs |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward Stafford]], Duke of Buckingham, one of the wealthiest magnates in England, whom Henry had executed on flimsy charges in 1521.&lt;ref name="sommerville"/&gt;
** [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]]: One of the last surviving noble Plantagenets of senior line.
** [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]]: The poet son of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]].
* [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]: subsequent to the failed [[impeachment]] of his former [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], was attainted during the political crisis of 1640 -1641. The Bill of Attainder, having passed  the depleted [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]], was enacted by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as a concession to his political opponents. During his reign, the [[Long Parliament]] of 1641 passed an Act of Attainder against [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] in 1645.

* [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]: Although deceased by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Thomas Pride]] were served with a Bill of Attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]).

* [[William III of England|William III]]: 
** [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James, III and VIII, the Old Pretender]], 1702&lt;ref name="jamesiiiattainder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/p739 |title=William III, 1701: An Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason |publisher=British History Online |date= |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George II of Great Britain]], following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]:
**[[Attainder of Earl of Kellie and others Act 1746]]

Once attainted, nobles were considered commoners, and as such, could be subjected to the same treatments, including [[torture]] and methods of [[execution]]. For example, commoners could be [[burned at the stake]], whereas nobles could not.

Often, nobles would refer to the act of being attainted (and then executed) as the person's "destruction".

==Passage in Parliament==
In the [[Westminster system]], a [[bill of attainder]] is a bill passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to attaint persons who are accused of [[high treason]], or, in rare cases, a lesser crime.  A person attainted need not have been convicted of treason in a court of law; in fact, the attainder process is a method of declaring a person a [[fugitive]].

A rumour circulated that a bill of attainder against [[Thomas Jefferson]] occurred in 1774 because of his authorship of ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Meacham: ''Thomas Jefferson The Art of Power''&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill of attainder was last passed in Britain in 1798, against [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]]. Attainders by confession, verdict and process were abolished in the United Kingdom by the [[Forfeiture Act 1870]] (33 &amp; 34 Vict., c.23).

Section 9 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] provides that no bill of attainder or [[ex post facto law]] shall be passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 9, ¶ 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The following section forbids states from passing them.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 10, ¶ 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption of blood==
'''Corruption of blood''' is one of the consequences of attainder. The descendants of an attainted person could not inherit either from the attainted person (whose property had been forfeited by the attainder) or from their other relatives through him. For example, if a person is executed for a crime leaving innocent children, the property of the criminal is forfeited to the crown and will not pass to the children. If the criminal's innocent father subsequently dies, the property inherited by the criminal from the father cannot be inherited by the criminal's children either: it will be distributed among other family members.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

The [[United States Constitution]] prohibits corruption of blood as a punishment for treason.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 3, ¶ 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[England and Wales]] corruption of blood has been [[Corruption of Blood Act 1814|abolished]].

== Examples of cases where a person's property was subject to attainder ==

* [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]]
* [[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]]
* [[Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven]]
* [[Parker Wickham]]
* [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel]]
* [[Thomas Cromwell]]
* [[Earl of Perth]]
* [[Viscount Strathallan]]

The '''Australian Consumer Laws''' (ACL), being [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/caca2010265/sch2.html Schedule 2] to the ''[[Competition and Consumer Act 2010]]'', is uniform legislation for consumer protection, applying as a law of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] and is incorporated into the law of each of Australia's [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]]. The law commenced on 1 January 2011, replacing 20 different consumer laws across the Commonwealth and the states and territories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/shoppers-and-parents-among-those-to-benefit-from-law-changes-at-midnight/story-fn59niix-1225979359030|title=Shoppers and parents among those to benefit from law changes at midnight|last=Kelly|first=Joe|date=31 December 2010|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although certain other Acts continue to be in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Exceptions under commonwealth, state &amp; territory legislation|url = http://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/australian-competition-consumer-commission/legislation/exceptions-under-commonwealth-state-territory-legislation|publisher = Australian Competition and Consumer Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Australian Consumer Law was developed by agreement of the [[Council of Australian Governments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|memo|tpaclb22010505|Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No. 2) 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions of the Australian Consumer Law broadly reflects the provisions previously afforded by the ''[[Trade Practices Act 1974]]'', although some additional protections have been added. The Australian Consumer Law also generally reflects most of the consumer protection provisions of the fair trading legislation in each state and territory.

The ACL has a broad definition as to who is a "consumer",&lt;ref&gt;''Competition and Consumer Act'' 2010 (Cth) sch 2 Australian Consumer Law s 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes anyone who acquires:

:* goods or services that are priced at less than $40,000, or
:* goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption (even if priced greater than $40,000), or
:* a vehicle or trailer for use principally in the transport of goods on public roads.

A person is still defined as a "consumer" if the good was acquired for purposes of re-supply or for the purpose of using or transforming it in trade or commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid s 3(1).&lt;/ref&gt; It accordingly extends protections relating to business behaviour, product safety and quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Consumer Law and your safety |url=http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=fact_sheets/safety.htm |publisher=consumerlaw.gov.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411065732/http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=fact_sheets%2Fsafety.htm |archivedate=2015-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to businesses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Consumer Law and your business |url=http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=fact_sheets/business.htm |publisher=consumerlaw.gov.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411065804/http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=fact_sheets%2Fbusiness.htm |archivedate=2015-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and farms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Consumer Law and your farm |url=http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=fact_sheets/farm.htm |publisher=consumerlaw.gov.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411065819/http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=fact_sheets%2Ffarm.htm |archivedate=2015-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the areas covered above.

Certain provisions possess different scope in their application:

:* Unfair terms are void, where they appear in standard form contracts signed with individuals "whose acquisition of the goods, services or interest is wholly or predominantly for personal, domestic or household use or consumption."&lt;ref&gt;''Competition and Consumer Act'' 2010 (Cth) sch 2 Australian Consumer Law ss 23{{endash}}28.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* All persons are prohibited from engaging in unconscionable conduct (beyond unfair terms in standard form consumer contracts) when dealing with persons (other than public listed companies) in the course of trade and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid ss 20{{endash}}22A.&lt;/ref&gt;

These provisions are vigorously enforced. In December 2014, the [[Federal Court of Australia]], on the application of the ACCC, issued a $10 million pecuniary penalty order against [[Coles Supermarkets]] in relation to two connected proceedings arising from payment demands by Coles to which it was not entitled by threatening harm to the suppliers that did not comply with such demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Gibbons|first1= Fleur|last2= Uthmeyer|first2= Simon|title = Pecuniary penalty order against Coles is a win for good standards of conduct in commercial dealings|url = https://www.dlapiper.com/~/media/Files/Insights/Publications/2015/04/Comp_and_Reg_Update_%20Coles_10_million_pecuniary_penalty_order.pdf|publisher = [[DLA Piper]]|date= 8 April 2015}}, discussing {{cite AustLII|litigants=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd|link=|court=FCA|num=1405|year=2014|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Court finds Coles engaged in unconscionable conduct and orders Coles pay $10 million penalties|url = https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/court-finds-coles-engaged-in-unconscionable-conduct-and-orders-coles-pay-10-million-penalties|publisher = Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|date = 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
The ACL is administered and enforced jointly by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] and the State and Territory consumer protection agencies, with the involvement of [[Australian Securities and Investment Commission]] on financial services matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business and the ACL |url=http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=businesses_ACL.htm |publisher=consumerlaw.gov.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411065618/http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=businesses_ACL.htm |archivedate=2015-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following matters are regulated federally, by virtue of the [[corporations power]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|caca2010265|Competition and Consumer Act 2010|131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the conduct of corporations;
:* a supply or possible supply of goods or services by any person to a corporation (other than a listed public company); or
:* an acquisition or possible acquisition of goods or services from any person by a corporation (other than a listed public company).

Federal jurisdiction also extends to conduct outside Australia by bodies corporate incorporated or carrying on business in Australia, [[Australian citizen]]s, and persons ordinarily resident in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|caca2010265|Competition and Consumer Act 2010|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All other matters subject to the ACL are handled by the States.

Implementing identical consumer protection laws at Commonwealth and state/territory levels promotes consistency between jurisdictions. It will also make it easier for the [[Australian Federal Parliament|Federal Parliament]] to amend the provisions which will then be reflected in the laws of the states and territories without the parliaments of each jurisdiction needing to debate and enact the amendments separately, although the states and territories reserve the right not to implement any amendments within their own jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20262">The process of [[beatification]] and [[canonization]] has undergone various reforms in the history of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. For current practice, as well as a discussion of similar processes in other churches, see the article on [[canonization]]. This article describes the process as it was in 1914, before the promulgation of the ''[[Code of Canon Law|Codex Iuris Canonici]]'' (''Code of Canon Law'') of 1983.

The causes of [[martyr]]s were considered somewhat differently from those of [[confessor]]s, for some points of the process.

==Beatification==

===Of Confessors===

In order to secure beatification, the most important and difficult step in the process of canonization, the regular procedure was as follows:

#Selection of a vice-postulator by the postulator-general of the cause, to promote all the judicial inquiries necessary in places outside of Rome. Such inquiries were instituted by the local [[bishop|episcopal]] authority.
# The preparation of the inquiries (''processus'') all of which were carried on by the ordinary episcopal authority. They were of three kinds: (a) Informative inquiries regarded the reputation for sanctity and [[miracle]]s of the servants of God, not only in general, but also in particular instances; there might be several such inquiries if the witnesses to be examined belonged to different [[diocese]]s. (b) Processes ''de non cultu'' were instituted to prove that the decrees of [[Pope Urban VIII]] regarding the prohibition of public veneration of servants of God before their beatification had been obeyed; they were generally conducted by the bishop of the place where the [[relic]]s of the [[servant of God]] were preserved. (c) Other inquiries were known as "''processiculi diligentiarum''" and had for their object the writings attributed to the person whose beatification was in question; they varied in number according to the [[diocese]]s where such writings were found, or were thought likely to be found, and might not be judicially executed before an "instruction" was obtained from the Promotor of the Faith by the Postulator General and by him sent to the [[bishop]] in question.
# The results of all these inquiries were sent to Rome, to the [[Congregation of Rites]], in charge of a messenger (''portitor'') chosen by the judges, or by some other secure way, in case a rescript of the Congregation dispensed from the obligation of sending a messenger.
# They were opened, translated if necessary into [[Italian (language)|Italian]], a public copy was made, and a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] was deputed by the [[Pope]] as relator (''ponens'') of the cause, for all which steps rescripts of the Congregation, confirmed by the [[Pope]], must be obtained.
# The writings of the servant of God were next revised by theologians appointed by the cardinal Relator himself, authorized to so act by a special rescript. Meanwhile, the Advocate and the Procurator of the cause, chosen by the Postulator General, had prepared all the documents that concerned the introduction of the cause (''positio super introductione causae''). These consisted of (a) a summary of the informative processes, (b) an information, and (c) answers to the observations or difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith sent by him to the Postulator.
#This collection of documents (''positio'') was printed and distributed to the cardinals of the Congregation of Rites 40 days before the date assigned for their discussion.
#If nothing contrary to faith and morals was found in the writings of the servant of God, a decree was published that authorized further action (''quod in causa procedi possit ad ulteriora''), i. e., the discussion of the matter (''dubium'') of appointment or non-appointment of a commission for the introduction of the cause.
# At the time fixed by the Congregation of Rites an ordinary meeting (''congregatio'') was held in which this appointment was debated by the cardinals of the aforesaid Congregation and its officials, but without the vote or participation of the Consultors, though this privilege was always granted them by prescript.
# If in this meeting the cardinals favoured the appointment of the aforesaid Commission, a decree to that effect was promulgated, and the [[Pope]] signed it, but, according to custom, with his baptismal name, not with that of his pontificate. Thenceforward the servant of God was judicially given the title of "[[Venerable]]".
# A petition was then presented asking remissorial letters for the bishops outside of Rome (''in partibus''), authorizing them to set on foot, by Apostolic authority, the inquiry (''processus'') with regard to the fame of sanctity and miracles in general. This permission was granted by rescript, and such remissorial letters were prepared and sent to the bishops by the Postulator General. In case the eyewitnesses were of advanced age, other remissorial letters were usually granted for the purpose of opening a process known as "inchoative" concerning the particular virtues of miracles of the person in question. This was done in order that the proofs might not be lost (''ne pereant probationes''), and such inchoative process preceded that upon the miracles and virtues in general.
# While the Apostolic process concerning the reputation of sanctity was under way outside of Rome, documents were prepared by the Procurator of the cause for the discussion ''de non cultu'', or absence of ''cultus'', and at the appointed time an ordinary meeting (''congregatio'') was held in which the matter was investigated; if it was found that the decree of [[Pope Urban VIII]] had been obeyed, another decree provided that further steps might be taken.
# When the inquiry concerning the reputation of sanctity (''super fama'') had arrived in Rome, it was opened (as already described in speaking of the ordinary processes, and with the same formalities in regard to rescripts), then translated into [[Italian language|Italian]], summarized, and declared valid. The documents ''super fama'' in general were prepared by the Advocate, and at the proper time, in an ordinary meeting of the cardinals of the Congregation of Rites, the question was discussed: whether there was evidence of a general repute for sanctity and miracles of this servant of God. If the answer was favourable, a decree embodying this result was published.
# New remissorial letters were then sent to the bishops ''in partibus'' for Apostolic processes with regard to the reputation for sanctity and miracles in particular. These processes must be finished within 18 months and when they were received in Rome were opened, as above described, and by virtue of an equal number of rescripts, by the cardinal Prefect, translated into [[Italian language|Italian]], and their summary authenticated by the Chancellor of the Congregation of Rites.
# The Advocate of the cause next prepared the documents (''positio'') which had reference to the discussion of the validity of all the preceding processes, informative and Apostolic.
# This discussion was held in the meeting called ''congregatio rotalis'' from the fact that it was only judges of the [[Roman Rota]] who voted. If the difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith were satisfactorily answered, the decree establishing the validity of the inquiries or processes was published.
# Meanwhile all necessary preparation was made for the discussion of the question (''dubium''): Is there evidence that the venerable servant of God practiced virtues both [[Theological virtues|theological]] and [[Cardinal virtues|cardinal]], and in an [[Heroic virtue|heroic]] degree? (''An constet de virtutibus Ven. servi Dei, tam theologicis quam cardinalibus, in heroico gradu?'') In the causes of confessors this step was of primary importance. The point was discussed in three meetings or congregations called respectively, ante-preparatory, preparatory, and general. The first of these meetings was held in the palace of the cardinal Relator of the cause, and in it only consultors of the Congregation of Sacred Rites, and with their prefect presiding, the third was also held in the [[Vatican City]], and at it the [[Pope]] presided, and both cardinals and consultors voted. For each of these congregations the Advocate of the cause prepared and printed official reports (''positiones''), called respectively "report", "new report", "final report", report "concerning the virtues", et cetera (''positio'', ''positio nova'', ''positio novissima'', ''super virtutibus'', et cetera). In each case, before proceeding to the subsequent meeting, a majority of the Consultors must decide that the difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith had been satisfactorily solved.
# When the Congregation of Rites in the above described general meeting had decided favourably, the [[Pope]] was asked to sign the solemn decree which asserted that there existed evidence of the heroic virtues of the servant of God. This decree was not published until after the [[Pope]], having commended the matter to God in prayer, gave a final consent and confirmed by his supreme sentence the decision of the Congregation.
# The miracles now remained to be proved, of which two of the first class were required in case the practice of virtues in the heroic degree had been proved, in both ordinary and Apostolic inquiries or processes by eyewitnesses: three, if the eyewitnesses were found only in the ordinary processes and four, if the virtues were proven only by hearsay (''de auditu'') witnesses. If the miracles had been sufficiently proven in the Apostolic processes (''super virtutibus'') already declared valid, steps were taken at once to prepare the documents with regard to miracles (''super miraculis''). If in the Apostolic processes only general mention had been made of the miracles, new Apostolic processes must be opened, and conducted after the manner already described for proving the practice of virtues in an heroic degree.
# The discussion of the particular miracles proceeded in exactly the same way and in the same order as that of the virtues. If the decisions were favourable, the general meeting of the Congregation was followed by a decree, confirmed by the [[Pope]], in which it was announced that there was proof of miracles. In the ''positio'' for the ante-preparatory congregation there were required and were printed opinions of two physicians, one of whom had been chosen by the Postulator and the other by the Congregation of Rites. Of the three reports (''positiones'') above mentioned, and which were now also required, the first was prepared in the usual way; the second consisted of an exposition of the heroic virtues of the servant of God, an information, and a reply to later observations of the Promotor of the Faith; the last consisted only of an answer to his final observations.
# When the miracles had been proved, another meeting of the Congregation of Rites was held in which it was debated once, and only once, whether or not, given the approbation of the virtues and miracles, it was safe to proceed with the solemnities of beatification. If a majority of the Consultors was favourable, the [[Pope]] issued a decree to this effect and at the time appointed by him the solemn beatification of the servant of God occurred in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], on which occasion a [[Papal brief]] was issued permitting the public ''[[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]]'' and [[veneration]] of the beatified person, now known as "Blessed" ("''Beatus''").

===Of Martyrs===

# The causes of [[martyr]]s were conducted in the same way as those of confessors as far as the informative processes and those ''de non cultu'' and ''ad introductionem causae'' were concerned. But when once the commission of introduction had been appointed they advance much more rapidly.
# No remissorial letters were granted for Apostolic processes concerning the general reputation for martyrdom and miracles; the letters sent called for an immediate investigation into the fact of martyrdom, its motive, and the particular miracles alleged. There was no longer a discussion of the general reputation for martyrdom or miracles.
# The miracles were not discussed, as formerly, in separate meetings, but in the same meetings that dealt with the fact and the motive of the martyrdom.
# The miracles (''signa'') required were not those of the first class; those of the second class sufficed, nor was their number determined. On some occasions the decision as to miracles was entirely dispensed with.
# The discussion as to martyrdoms and miracles, formerly held in three meetings or congregations, viz. the ante-preparatory, preparatory, and general, was at a later time usually conducted, through a dispensation to be had in each instance from the sovereign pontiff, in a single congregation known as particularis, or special. It consisted of six or seven cardinals of the Congregation of Rites and four or five prelates especially deputed by the pope. There was but one positio prepared in the usual way; if there was an affirmative majority a decree was issued concerning the proof of martyrdom, the cause of martyrdom, and miracles. (''Constare de Martyrio'', ''causâ Martyrii et signis''.)
# The final stage was a discussion of the security (''super tuto'') with which advance to beatification might be made, as in the case of confessors; the solemn beatification then followed.

===Confirmation of Cult===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Charlemagne]] --&gt;
This procedure was followed in all cases of formal beatification in causes of both confessors and martyrs proposed in the ordinary way ("''per viam non cultus''"). Those proposed as coming under the definition of cases excepted ("''casus excepti''") by [[Pope Urban VIII]] were treated differently. In such cases proof is required that an immemorial public veneration for at least 100 years before the promulgation in 1640 of the decrees of [[Pope Urban VIII]] had been paid the servant of God, whether as a confessor or martyr. Such cause was proposed under the title of "confirmation of veneration" ("''de confirmatione cultus''"); it was considered in an ordinary meeting of the Congregation of Rites. When the difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith had been satisfied, a Pontifical decree confirming the ''cultus'' was promulgated. Beatification of this kind was denominated "equivalent" or "virtual".

==Canonization==

The canonization of confessors or martyrs might be taken up as soon as two miracles were reported to have been worked at their [[Intercession of saints|intercession]], after the pontifical permission of public veneration as described above. At this stage it was only required that the two miracles worked after the permission awarding a public cultus be discussed in three meetings of the congregation. The discussion proceeded in the ordinary way; if the miracles were confirmed, another meeting (''super tuto'') was held. The pope then issued a [[Papal bull|Bull]] of Canonization in which he not only permitted, but commanded, the public cultus, or veneration, of the saint.

It may be easily conjectured that considerable time must elapse before any cause of beatification or canonization could be conducted, from the first steps of the information, inquiry, or process, to the issuing of the decree super tuto. According to the constitution of this Congregation, more than one important discussion (''dubia maiora'') could not be proposed at the same time. It must be remembered:

* that the same cardinals and consultors must vote in all discussions;
* that there was but one promotor of the Faith and one sub-promotor, who alone had charge of all observations to be made with regard to the ''dubia''; and
* that these cardinals and consultors had to treat questions of ritual as well as processes of canonization and beatification.

To execute all this business there was but one weekly meeting (''congressus''), a kind of minor congregation in which only the cardinal prefect and the major officials voted; in it less important and practical questions were settled regarding rites as well as causes, and answers were given, and rescripts which the [[Pope]] afterwards verbally approved. The other meetings of the congregation (ordinary, rotal, and "upon virtues and miracles") might be as few as sixteen in the course of the year. Some other cause must therefore be found for the slow progress of causes of beatification or canonization than a lack of good will or activity on the part of the Congregation of Rites.

The act provides that unclaimed bodies of dead persons cast ashore from the sea should be removed by the [[churchwarden]]s and [[Overseer of the Poor|overseers]] of the [[parish]], and decently interred in [[consecrated ground]].

The passage of the 1808 act was one of the consequences of the wreck of the [[Royal Navy]] [[frigate]] [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS ''Anson'']] in [[Mount's Bay]] in 1807. Prior to the passage of this act it was customary to unceremoniously bury drowned seamen without shroud or coffin and in unconsecrated ground. However the burial in this manner of the many dead from the ''Anson'', and the length of time that many of the bodies remained unburied, caused controversy and led to a local solicitor, Thomas Grylls, drafting a new law to provide more decent treatment for drowned seamen. This law was introduced to parliament by [[John Hearle Tremayne]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]], and was enacted in 1808.&lt;ref name=thoc&gt;{{cite book | title = The history of Cornwall: from the earliest ..., Volume 2 | page = 607 | first = Fortescue | last = Hitchins | authorlink = Fortescue Hitchins | editor = [[Samuel Drew]] | publisher = William Penaluna | year = 1824 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YUYQAAAAYAAJ | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument to the drowned sailors, and to the passing of Grylls' Act, stands near the entrance to the harbour of [[Porthleven]]. The construction of this harbour was another of the consequences of the loss of the ''Anson''.&lt;ref name="ccp"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cornwall Coast Path|last=Schofield|first=Edith|publisher=Trailblazer Publications|year=2009|isbn=978-1-905864-19-5|edition=third}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2009-09-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hopl&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Porthleven in Cornwall | url = http://www.porthleven-online.com/custom9.html | publisher = Neil Smith | work = www.porthleven-online.com | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act was amended by the '''Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1886''' (citation ''49 &amp; 50 Vict c.20''), to extend its applicability to bodies found in, or cast on shore from, all tidal or navigable waters.&lt;ref name="tlob2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/lawburialinclud00offigoog/lawburialinclud00offigoog_djvu.txt|title=The Law of Burial: Including All the Burial Acts as Modified Or Affected by ...|last=Little|first=James Brooke|publisher=Shaw|year=1902|accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This was needed following the case of the wreck of the [[SS Princess Alice (1865)|Princess Alice]], when various parishes refused to pay the cost of interment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS118537025&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=The Collision On The Thames|last=|first=|date=1 October 1878|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|page=7|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parish was responsible for burial, under the Burial of Drowned Persons Act, and a fee of 5 shillings (a crown) was also paid by the parish for the [[Kew Mortuary#Recovery_of_bodies_in_the_Thames|recovery of drowned bodies]].

The [[Anglican Communion]] as a whole, unlike the [[Roman Catholic Church]], does not have a centralised [[canon law]] of its own.{{sfn|Skyes|Booty|1988|p=206}}  Each of the autonomous member churches of the communion, however, does have a canonical system.  Some, such as the [[Church of England]] have an ancient, highly developed [[Canon law (Church of England)|canon law]] while others, such as the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] have more recently developed canonical systems originally based on the English canon law.

A '''case bond''' is an investment in a [[legal claim]].

More specifically, it is a [[Nonrecourse debt|non-recourse]] purchase of an [[Assignment (law)|assignment]] interest in a legal [[cause of action]]. A case bond provides a [[litigant]] with money prior to a monetary recovery. In return, the case bond [[accrual|accrues]] fees until there is a recovery which triggers the satisfaction of the assignment interest. If there is no recovery in the underlying claim or lawsuit the case bond self terminates and the obligation to satisfy its terms expire. Typically, case bonds are used by litigants to cover the costs of daily living expenses, medical bills and litigation costs.

This [[investment vehicle]] was first developed in the late 1990s due to the need for funding to claimants in lawsuits prior to a recovery due to the extended lengths of time involved with litigation. A case bond is a type of [[structured investment|structured investment product]]; it varies in size based on the anticipated value of a potential resolution in a pending lawsuit or claim [[securitized]] solely by any proceeds recovered.

==History==
Historically, a third party investing in a lawsuit was a problem.

In the [[Common law of England]], the practice of financing lawsuits was connected with [[champerty and maintenance]], which was a practice whereby the investor would become involved in the lawsuit. Lawsuits were won through intimidation and other methods rather than the merit of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Works'' (Bowring (ed), 1843) vol 3, pp 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

English common law was incorporated into the statutes of many states,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flsenate.gov/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=sb2636.html&amp;Directory=session/2010/Senate/bills/billtext/html/ line 46]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the states inherited the rules prohibiting this practice. However, the definition of Champerty and/or Maintenance differs between states. In many states, it is no longer part of the law, in favor of existing laws regarding [[legal fees]] and recognizing existing laws regarding investment and financing in general. It is also important to note that in some instances, the retraction of these laws was due to the belief that the modern judicial system is not susceptible to the pressures exerted on [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval English]] judges.

The original laws stemmed from the fact that the third party would or could interfere with the justice system.

In a case bond, the third party does not get involved with the lawsuit at all. The purpose of the investor in a case bond is to allow the [[plaintiff]] to continue life without the requirement of a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] due solely to a lack of funds (which is often the case). Historically in the US, the plaintiff has often been "caught" in a lawsuit that could be won or settled for a large figure, but simply cannot support him/herself long enough to see the lawsuit through to its end. In many cases a [[defendant]] has been aware of this situation and has relied upon it to coerce the plaintiff to settle for a much lower figure than would otherwise be possible.

With the present system of case bonds, there is a lack of "urgency" for the plaintiff to settle out of court for lower amounts than those they would owe based on the amount of the case bond already in force. For example: if a plaintiff were required to pay $10,000 to the case bond investor based on the contractual case bond amount, settling for less than $10,000 would not be possible. This creates a problem for the defendant and possibly even for the plaintiff's attorney if they are considering settling for a lower amount. So, the purpose of the case bond is to reduce the "urgency" or "need" of the plaintiff to settle for a lower amount.

==Disambiguity==

===Lawsuit venture capitalism===
Lawsuit venture capitalism is different from a case bond in that it occurs before the lawsuit begins. It is arguable that in many cases the lawsuit would not have been filed without the introduction of the 3rd party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/sebok/20010226.html |title=FindLaw's Writ - Sebok: Venture Capitalism For Lawsuits? (part Two) |publisher=Writ.news.findlaw.com |date=2001-02-26 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A case bond requires that a case already be filed and "underway".

===Litigation funding===
{{main|Litigation funding}}
Litigation funding is different from a case bond in that it is primarily used for support of the lawsuit itself, or related items such as expert fees and court fees. A case bond is only linked to the case by the simple nature of the possibility of payout at the end, should the case be successful. while litigation funding may or may not be dependent upon the outcome and may involve fee recovery being attached. Litigation funding may also be required in a case where a contingency fee-based attorney is not available.

===Legal finance===
{{main|Legal finance}} 
Legal finance is the category in which a case bond will be found. A case bond is one distinct type of legal finance or legal funding.

===Champerty and maintenance===
{{main|Champerty and maintenance}} 
Maintenance "...is directed against those who, for an improper motive, often described as wanton or officious intermeddling, become involved with disputes (litigation) of others in which the maintainer has no interest whatsoever and where the assistance he or she renders to one or the other parties is without justification or excuse."&lt;ref name="canlii2002"&gt;http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2002/2002canlii45046/2002canlii45046.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} paragraph [27]&lt;/ref&gt;

Champerty "...is an egregious form of maintenance in which there is the added element that the maintainer shares in the profits of the litigation.  Importantly, without maintenance there can be no champerty."&lt;ref name="canlii2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Findon v. Parker'' (1843), 11 M. &amp; W. 675 at 682, 152 E.R. 976 at 979 (Exch.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the above, a case bond is merely supplied, with no involvement on the part of the investor(s) in the bond (therefore there is no meddling).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11935">A '''certified paralegal''' or '''certified legal assistant''' is the title of [[paralegal]]s in the United States who have met certain education and work experience requirements and have passed one of a number of available certification exams. The primary function of paralegals is to assist [[lawyer|attorney]]s in the delivery of legal services. According to the American Bar Association: “A legal assistant or paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training and/or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because certification programs are voluntary in most states, a paralegal may find work in the field without obtaining certification. Additionally, requirements for certification may vary by state.

==American Bar Association Definition of Legal Assistant/Paralegal==

In the United States "paralegal" and "legal assistant" are frequently used interchangeably. At the August 1997 ABA Annual Meeting, the ABA's policy making body, the House of Delegates, adopted the current definition of "legal assistant/paralegal", as recommended by the Standing Committee on Legal Assistants. The current definition reads as follows: ''A legal assistant or paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.

The current definition of "legal assistant/paralegal" replaces the definition adopted by the ABA Board of Governors in 1986. It adds the term "paralegal" since the terms "legal assistant" and "paralegal" are, in practice, used interchangeably. The term that is preferred generally depends on what part of the country one is from. The current definition streamlines the 1986 definition and more accurately reflects how legal assistants are presently being utilized in the delivery of legal services.'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/resources/current_aba_definition_of_legal_assistant_paralegal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the American Bar Association's position on this matter, there is no consensus in the legal field as a whole regarding the specific duties of paralegals/legal assistants and some law firms and legal departments still maintain paralegal and legal assistant as separate job titles.

==Certified Paralegals vs. Certificated Paralegals==

According to the American Bar Association, there is a distinction between "certified" paralegals and "certificated" paralegals and the terms are not interchangeable. Certified Paralegals have passed a professional exam and certificated paralegals have completed a paralegal program or other preparatory education through an academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/paralegals/ls_prlgs_diff_bet_paralegal_certificate_certification.authcheckdam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Certificated paralegals are generally eligible to take one of several certification exams after graduating from an approved paralegal program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.NALA.org/certification.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224061731/http://NALA.org/Certification.aspx |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, paralegals mistakenly refer to themselves as an "ABA Certified Paralegal" in reference to the certificate that they were given upon completion of paralegal school. This is entirely different from certification. A certificate from paralegal school is a Certificate of Completion. The paralegal school these paralegals attended has been approved by the ABA. Out of approximately 1500 or so paralegal schools in the U.S., only about 280 have been approved by the ABA. The school must meet certain qualifications set down by the ABA and pay upfront and annual fees to maintain its approval status.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/paralegals/ls_prlgs_fee_schedule.authcheckdam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When a student completes the 4 month, 2-year or 4-year program, they are given a certificate of completion but are not certified.*

==Sources of National and State Specific Paralegal Certifications (United States)==

===Certification by the National Association of Legal Assistants===

CP or CLA is the post-nominal credential in the United States earnedy by paralegals who have passed the Certified Paralegal Exam and have met up education and experience requirements for certification as a CP or CLA. The CP and CLA credential is recognized by the American Bar Association&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/resources/state_activity_home.html&lt;/ref&gt; and State Bars.

To become a CP in the United States, the candidate voluntarily passes the Certified Paralegal Exam (CP Exam)&lt;ref&gt;https://NALA.org/certification/exam-application-and-qualifications&lt;/ref&gt;. The Certified Paralegal program - the oldest in the United States - was established in 1976 and is administered by the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.NALA.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309145543/http://www.NALA.org/ |date=2012-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CP designation is a certification duly registered with the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (No. 78213275)

The term "certified paralegal" is not owned by NALA or any other organization (just as the term "Certified Public Account" is not owned by the various organizations that offer accountant certification). The term is not proprietary to NALA, only the certification mark is (image and mark information is available via the U.S. Patent Office: http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:l0lqo1.2.1 and via NALA).

According to Legal Assistant Today magazine, the CP Exam has a 45-50% pass rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://paralegaltoday.com/issue_archive/features/feature1_jf07.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After a paralegal obtains the CP credential, he or she is eligible to participate in the Advanced Paralegal Certification program. The credential awarded after successful completion of the program is the "ACP" credential. A CP must complete an ACP course and pass an exam which demonstrates advanced knowledge in the specific practice area or areas of practice in which the course is taken &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.NALA.org/APC-award.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314000056/http://NALA.org/APC-award.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification by the National Federation of Paralegal Associations===

The National Federation of Paralegal Associations, or NFPA, offers two certification programs. Their Paralegal Advanced 
Competency Exam (PACE®) was established in 1996. Their Paralegal CORE Competency Exam (PCCE™) was established in 2011. A paralegal who completes the certification process through the NFPA earns the credential Registered Paralegal (RP) for completion of the PACE Exam and Core Registered Paralegal (CRP) for completion of the PCCE Exam. The Paralegal CORE Competency Exam™ (PCCE™) was developed to assess the knowledge, skills and ability of early-career and entry-level paralegals. The PACE exam consists of hypothetical questions testing advanced application of general knowledge, paralegal experience, and critical analysis obtained only by a higher level of education and actual work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralegals.org/includes/get_asset.asp?asset%3D922 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408214247/http://www.paralegals.org/includes/get_asset.asp?asset=922 |archivedate=2014-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RP and CRP credentials is recognized by the American Bar Association&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/resources/state_activity_home.html&lt;/ref&gt; and State Bars.

===Certification by the National Association of Legal Secretaries===

The Association for Legal Professionals, or NALS, previously National Association of Legal Secretaries, offers the Professional Paralegal 
Exam established in 2004. A paralegal who completes the certification process through NALS earns the credential Professional Paralegal (PP).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralegals.org/includes/get_asset.asp?asset%3D922 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408214247/http://www.paralegals.org/includes/get_asset.asp?asset=922 |archivedate=2014-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PP credential is recognized by the American Bar Association&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/resources/state_activity_home.html&lt;/ref&gt; and State Bars.

===Certification by the American Alliance of Paralegals===

The American Alliance of Paralegals (AAPI) awards the designation American Alliance Certified Paralegal (AACP). The AACP credential is recognized by the American Bar Association&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/resources/state_activity_home.html&lt;/ref&gt; and State Bars.

===State Specific Certifications===

The American Bar Association recognizes national certification set forth above and the voluntary state specific certifications of the:

*Florida Bar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.floridabar.org/about/frp/&lt;/ref&gt;
*North Carolina State Bar&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nccertifiedparalegal.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ohio State Bar Association&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohiobar.org/forlawyers/certification/paralegal/Pages/StaticPage-785.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Carolina Bar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scbar.org/lawyers/bar-programs/paralegal-certification/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Texas Board of Legal Specialization&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohiobar.org/forlawyers/certification/paralegal/Pages/StaticPage-785.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Although California does not certify paralegals in general, California legislation (AB 1761) makes it unlawful for persons to identify themselves as paralegals unless they meet certain requirements. Paralegals must also complete continuing legal education every two years in order to lawfully perform services or identify as a paralegal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/99-00/bill/asm/ab_1751-1800/ab_1761_bill_20000914_chaptered.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing Major Certification Exams==

A comparison chart for the various national level paralegal certifications is available on the NFPA website.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.paralegals.org/files/CHART_-_Comparison_of_National_Level_Paralegal_Certification_Exams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==

All certifying bodies require applicants to complete a special examination containing ethics to become certified. Most exams require the knowledge of the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct &lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents.html&lt;/ref&gt;. NALA also has its own Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.NALA.org/code.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210064153/http://www.NALA.org/code.aspx |archivedate=2012-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing Legal Education (CLE)==

All certifying bodies require applicants to take continuing legal education courses in order to renew their certification. Credentials may be revoked from certified paralegals who fail to meet the recertification requirements. The paralegal must then retake the certifying exam again to use the credential.

'''Circumstantial evidence''' is [[evidence]] that relies on an [[inference]] to connect it to a conclusion of fact—such as a fingerprint at the scene of a crime. By contrast, [[direct evidence]] supports the truth of an assertion directly—i.e., without need for any additional evidence or inference.

On its own, circumstantial evidence allows for more than one explanation. Different pieces of circumstantial evidence may be required, so that each [[corroborating evidence|corroborates]] the conclusions drawn from the others. Together, they may more strongly support one particular [[inference]] over another. An explanation involving circumstantial evidence becomes more likely once alternative explanations have been ruled out.

Circumstantial evidence allows a [[trier of fact]] to infer that a fact exists.&lt;ref&gt;Transnational principle used in international commercial arbitration: [http://www.trans-lex.org/968000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal law, the inference is made by the trier of fact in order to support the truth of an assertion (of guilt or absence of guilt).

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/9664/Reasonable-Doubt.html|title=Reasonable Doubt|website=law.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasonable doubt is tied into Circumstantial evidence as circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference, and reasonable doubt was put in place so that the circumstantial evidence against someone in a criminal or civil case must be enough to acquit someone fairly. Reasonable doubt is described as the highest standard of proof used in court and means that there must be clear and convincing evidence of what the person has done. Therefore, the circumstantial evidence against someone may not be enough but it can contribute to other decisions made concerning the case. 

[[Testimony]] can be direct evidence or it can be circumstantial. For example, a [[witness]] saying that she saw a [[defendant]] stab a [[crime victim|victim]] is providing direct evidence. By contrast, a witness who says that she saw the defendant enter a house, that she heard screaming, and that she saw the defendant leave with a bloody knife gives circumstantial evidence. It is the necessity for inference, and not the obviousness of a conclusion, that determines whether evidence is circumstantial.

[[Forensic evidence]] supplied by an [[expert witness]] is usually treated as circumstantial evidence. For example, a [[forensic science|forensic scientist]] may provide results of [[ballistics|ballistic]] tests proving that the defendant’s firearm fired the bullets that killed the victim, but not necessarily that the defendant fired the shots.

Circumstantial evidence is especially important in civil and criminal cases where direct evidence is lacking. 

==Civil law==
Circumstantial evidence is used in civil courts to establish or refute [[legal liability|liability]]. It is usually the most common form of evidence, for example in [[product liability]] cases and [[road traffic accident]]s. Forensic analysis of [[skid mark]]s can frequently allow a reconstruction of the accident. By measuring the length of such marks and using dynamic analysis {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} of the car and road conditions at the time of the accident, it may be found that a driver underestimated his or her speed. [[Forensic science]] and [[forensic engineering]] are common as much in civil cases as in criminal.

==Criminal law==
Circumstantial evidence is used in criminal courts to establish [[guilt (law)|guilt]] or [[innocence]] through [[reasoning]]. 

With obvious exceptions ([[child|immature]], incompetent, or [[mental illness|mentally ill]] individuals), most criminals try to avoid generating direct evidence. Hence, the [[prosecutor|prosecution]] usually must resort to circumstantial evidence to prove the existence of ''[[mens rea]]'', or intent. The same goes for the plaintiff's establishing the negligence of [[list of legal terms#tortfeasor|tortfeasor]]s in [[tort]] [[law]] to recover damages from them.

One example of circumstantial evidence is the behavior of a person around the time of an alleged offense. In the case of someone charged with theft of money, were the suspect seen in a shopping spree purchasing expensive items shortly after the time of the alleged theft, the spree might prove to be circumstantial evidence of the individual's guilt.

===Forensic evidence===
Other examples of circumstantial evidence are [[fingerprint]] analysis, [[blood analysis]] or [[DNA analysis]] of the evidence found at the scene of a crime. These types of evidence may strongly point to a certain conclusion when taken into consideration with other facts—but if not directly witnessed by someone when the crime was committed, they are still considered circumstantial. However, when proved by [[expert witness]]es, they are usually sufficient to decide a case, especially in the absence of any direct evidence. Owing to subsequent developments in forensic methods, old undecided cases (or [[cold case (criminology)|cold cases]]) are frequently resolved.

===Validity of circumstantial evidence===
A popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence.&lt;ref&gt;LH Hoffmann &amp; DT Zeffertt, The South African Law of Evidence, 4th ed., p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Would a judge dismiss a case based solely on circumstantial evidence? |url=http://legallyliterate.com/judge-dismiss-case-based-solely-on-circumstantial-evidence/ |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is only partly true: direct evidence is popularly assumed to be the most powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Douglas. ''Legal Argumentation and Evidence''. Penn State Press, 2010. pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt; Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. 

Indeed, the common metaphor for the strongest possible evidence in any case—the "smoking gun"—is an example of proof based on circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Douglas. ''Legal Argumentation and Evidence''. Penn State Press, 2010.  page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, fingerprint evidence, videotapes, sound recordings, photographs, and many other examples of physical evidence that support the drawing of an inference, i.e., circumstantial evidence, are considered very strong possible evidence.

In practice, circumstantial evidence can have an advantage over direct evidence in that it can come from multiple sources that check and reinforce each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/districtcourt/jury-instructions/criminal/pdf/2240-direct-and-circumstantial-evidence.pdf Massachusetts Courts, jury instructions, Direct and Circumstantial Evidence] "Circumstantial evidence ... may have an advantage because it comes from several different sources, which can be used as a check on each other."&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitness testimony can be inaccurate at times,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/178240.pdf Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement], U.S. Department of Justice, 1999 "Even honest and well-meaning witnesses can make errors, such as identifying the wrong person or failing to identify the perpetrator of a crime."&lt;/ref&gt; and many persons have been convicted on the basis of perjured or otherwise mistaken testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/StudyCWC2001.pdf How Mistaken and Perjured Eyewitness Identification Testimony Put 46 Innocent Americans on Death Row.] Rob Warden, Executive Director, Center on Wrongful Convictions, Northwestern University School of Law, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, strong circumstantial evidence can provide a more reliable basis for a verdict. Circumstantial evidence normally requires a witness, such as the police officer who found the evidence, or an expert who examined it, to lay the foundation for its admission. This witness, sometimes known as the sponsor or the authenticating witness, is giving direct (eyewitness) testimony, and could present credibility problems in the same way that any eyewitness does.

Eyewitness testimony is frequently unreliable, or subject to conflict or outright fabrication. For example, the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sank in the presence of approximately 700 witnesses. For many years, there was vigorous debate on whether the ship broke into two before sinking.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/articles/wormstedt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the ship was found, in September 1985, that the truth was known.

However, there is often more than one logical conclusion inferable from the same set of circumstances. In cases where one conclusion implies a defendant's guilt and another his innocence, the "benefit of the doubt" principle would apply.  Indeed, if the circumstantial evidence suggests a possibility of innocence, the prosecution has the burden of disproving that possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Circumstantial_Evidence.pdf New York State Courts, Criminal Jury Instructions, Circumstantial Evidence] "If there is a reasonable hypothesis from the proven facts consistent with the defendant's innocence, then you must find the defendant not guilty." citing ''People v Morris, 36 N.Y.2d 877 (1975)''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
Much of the evidence against convicted [[Timothy McVeigh]] was circumstantial. Speaking about McVeigh's trial, Robert Precht said, "the prosecution's use of indirect evidence is no cause for worry." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='U' community satisfied with bombing verdict |last1=Jason |first1=Stoffer |last2=Paik |first2=Christine M. |newspaper=The Michigan Daily Online |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/jun/06-04-97/news/news3.html |date=June 4, 1997 |accessdate=April 16, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990423153905/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/jun/06-04-97/news/news3.html |archivedate=April 23, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 murder trial of [[Scott Peterson]] was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence.

'''Damage waiver''' or, as it is often referred to, '''collision damage waiver''' ('''CDW''') or '''loss damage waiver''' ('''LDW'''), is optional damage insurance coverage that is available to you when you [[Car rental|rent a car]].

Car rental companies treat the CDW as a waiver of their right to make the renter pay for damages to the car.&lt;ref name="carhire1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carhire.ie/excessexplained.php|title=CARHIRE.ie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, it is a legal requirement to have CDW insurance included in the basic car rental rate. It covers the rented car. Some rental companies also offer [[liability insurance]] and coverage of towing charges. Terms and prices vary. Alternatives to the CDW include other car insurance policies, some coverage from credit card issuers ([[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], etc.) and some [[travel insurance]].

==Risks addressed==

===Liability===
If the car damages property or injures someone, the customer or other insurance must pay for the damages (i.e., is "held liable"). US car rental companies sometimes include minimum liability insurance required by law in the basic rental charge. Hertz includes it in all states except California, but will subrogate any damages against the driver (meaning the car is insured to the state minimum but the driver will pay for all damages paid by Hertz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hertz.com/rentacar/reservation/reviewmodifycancel/templates/rentalTerms.jsp?KEYWORD=COVERAGES&amp;EOAG=LAXT15|title=Rental Terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avis includes it in all states except California and Texas, at least for renters who lack their own coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avis.com/search/SearchMain.jsp?question_box=liability&amp;question=lew&amp;ui_mode=question&amp;charset=UTF-8&amp;language=en-US&amp;site=Avis&amp;searchtype=WebSearch&amp;user.segment=avisnew |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616125634/http://www.avis.com/search/SearchMain.jsp?question_box=liability&amp;question=lew&amp;ui_mode=question&amp;charset=UTF-8&amp;language=en-US&amp;site=Avis&amp;searchtype=WebSearch&amp;user.segment=avisnew |archivedate=2012-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies do not publicize where they include liability insurance in the basic rental charge. Some car rental companies offer more liability insurance for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;Avis offers one or two million dollars of [http://www.avis.com/car-rental/content/render-faq.ac Additional Liability Insurance (ALI)] in the US.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertz offers one or two million dollars of [https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/byr/index.jsp?targetPage=rentalQualificationsView.jsp# Liability Insurance Supplement (LIS)] in the US&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Canada, all auto rentals are required by law to include a minimum of $200,000 in third-party liability insurance, regardless of whether the renter has their own auto insurance or not. Most rental agencies thus do not provide a third-party liability insurance option, and simply factor in the premium as part of fixed cost of rental.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/what-insurance-comes-with-rental-cars-in-canada/article26166553/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collision, theft, other damage===
{{See also|Loss of use#Loss of use (property)}}
When a customer does not pay the car rental company to waive damage, and a rented car is stolen, or damaged by accident, vandalism, weather (hail), etc., the customer or other insurance must pay to the rental company the full cost of repair, plus administrative charges and, in some states, [[loss of use]]. From some companies, in some states and countries, there are charges for towing, storage, impound, administrative fees&lt;ref name="hzterms" /&gt; and [[diminution in value|diminution of value]] of the car (Avis,&lt;ref name="avisdim"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avisalaska.com/reservation-center/rental-contract-terms-and-conditions/ | title=Rental Contract Terms and Conditions | publisher=Avis Alaska | accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budget,&lt;ref name="budget"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.budget.com/budgetWeb/html/bridge/assoc/usaa/faq.html?MID=usaa_faq | title=USAA - Budget Car Rental Program Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=Budget | accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; National,&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nationalcar.com/en_US/car-rental/loyalty/ec-special-cases/enroll-or-sign-in/terms-and-conditions.html | title=Terms &amp; Conditions | publisher=National Car Rental | accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thrifty&lt;ref name="thrifty"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thrifty.com/AboutUs/content/GeneralPolicies.aspx | title=General Policies and Fee Information | publisher=Thrifty | accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some companies even say they alone will decide the diminution (Dollar,&lt;ref name="dollar"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dollar.com/AboutUs/GeneralPolicies.aspx | title=General Policies and Fee Information | publisher=Dollar | accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hertz"&lt;ref name="hzterms"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/emember/join/gold/displayTermsAndConditions.do | title=Terms and Conditions | publisher=Hertz | work=items 4.b and 4.c | accessdate=24 September 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927035614/https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/emember/join/gold/displayTermsAndConditions.do | archivedate=27 September 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The rental company's damage waiver normally covers accidental damage and towing a damaged vehicle, as long as the renter complies with the rental contract (such as authorized drivers, locations, no racing) and with the damage waiver (such as police report&lt;ref name="cn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-09-26/how-to-avoid-hidden-rental-car-fees | title=How to Avoid Hidden Rental Car Fees | publisher=Conde Nast Traveler | date=September 26, 2014 | accessdate=24 September 2016 | author=Jordan, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Waivers may also cover theft, vandalism, loss of use, and liability. The renter often has a choice among different coverages for different fees.

Damage waivers are not necessarily complete. They may have [[deductible]]s (also called excess) and limits on the amount covered.&lt;ref&gt;Holifield, Lee, [http://www.intltravelnews.com/2007/08/rented-car-online-for-heathrow/ Rented car online for Heathrow]&lt;/ref&gt; Liability coverage always has limits.

The descriptions above come from rental company websites, under headings like Policies, FAQ, Coverage, or More.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avis.com/car-rental/content/render-faq.ac Avis].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budget.com/budgetWeb/html/en/smartservices/protectionsCountOn.html Budget].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hertz provides insurance notes among various topics shown for each location under Reservations/[https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/byr/index.jsp?targetPage=rentalQualificationsView.jsp# Qualifications].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://Thrifty.com Thrifty] provides insurance notes under "Terms and Conditions" after a location and vehicle are selected, but before making a reservation.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Damage Waivers can be bought from the car rental company in most countries, or through a car hire excess insurer in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moneymaxim.co.uk/pages/car-hire-insurance-cdw-ldw.htm Collision Damage Waiver] - moneymaxim.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; or through travel insurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemut.com/car-rental-topmenu-310/922-avoiding-unwanted-cdw-charges-on-european-car-rentals.html|title=Avoiding Unwanted CDW Charges on European Car Rentals - Gemut.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage from the car rental company may be required if the renter lacks proof of coverage elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Holifield, Lee, [http://www.intltravelnews.com/2007/08/rented-car-online-for-heathrow/ Rented car online for Heathrow] ''International Travel News'', August 2007, p.30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harkin, John, [http://www.intltravelnews.com/2007/12/rental-cars-and-cdw/ Rental Cars and CDW] International Travel News, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance or not?==
CDW meets the basic definition of [[insurance]], since it transfers some risk from the car renter to the rental company. However rental companies do not call it insurance, since it is a waiver between the renter and the company. &lt;!-- that the company waives their right to charge the renter for valid damages to the vehicle --&gt; Rental companies are not licensed or regulated as insurers. There are also no claims made. Rental companies treat CDW as a waiver of their right to make the renter pay for damage to the vehicle.&lt;ref name="carhire1"/&gt;

== Credit card coverage of damage waiver==

=== Cards issued in the US ===

Some credit card issuers ([[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], etc.,) offer insurance for theft or damage to rented cars. A few of the cards (noted in the table below) offer "primary" insurance, so the driver does not need to file a claim with his or her personal insurance. More cards offer "secondary insurance." This means that if the renter has personal or business vehicle insurance with appropriate coverage, then that insurance will pay first. Then the credit card issuer will pay the primary insurance's [[deductible]] and will address any large claims above the primary insurance limit.

If the renter has no other vehicle insurance for the specific claim (no insurance at all, or not in the relevant country, or no collision insurance, etc.), the credit card company (if it offers coverage) will pay the whole amount, up to its limits.

All four credit card companies listed below cover ''collision damage'' with some of their cards. Visa and some MasterCards and American Express cards also cover ''theft'', while other MasterCards and American Express cards include ''theft, vandalism, hitting a deer or chipping a window'' (sources at bottom of table).

Other issues important to some renters are that Visa and MasterCard only cover rental contracts of ''15 days'' or less (not even the first 15 days of longer rentals). Some American Express and MasterCards are not useful on ''dirt or gravel roads'', since they exclude "damage sustained on any surface, other than a bound surface such as concrete or tarmac".&lt;ref name="benefitinformationcenter1"&gt;[http://www.benefitinformationcenter.com benefit information center]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MasterCard and Visa in the United States say they cover "Physical damage and/or theft", but an introductory paragraph for some MasterCards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.us/card-benefits/rent-and-save.pdf|title=Card Benefits - Mastercard Debit &amp; Credit Card Rewards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all Visa&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.visa.com/personal/cards/benefits/bft_dmg_waiver_personal.html Visa]&lt;/ref&gt; cards limits this to "collision or theft," so vandalism and hail are excluded. It may be ambiguous whether deer impacts and glass chips are covered as "collisions." MasterCards from Bank of America and MBNA generally have a simpler opening paragraph, which leaves coverage in place for any physical damage.&lt;ref name="benefitinformationcenter1"/&gt;

Even among these brands, some cards lack coverage entirely, especially debit cards and cards with low credit limits. The AmEx Platinum Cash [[Rebate card]], for example, has no coverage. MasterCard "Standard" cards lack coverage, while "Premier", "Gold" and "Platinum" cards vary in their coverage.  Citi® / AAdvantage®, Citi ThankYou®, Citi® Dividend or Citi CashReturns® MasterCard-branded cards are notable for providing coverage worldwide without geographic exclusions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.benefitbuilder.citi.com/|title=Citi® Card Benefits - Credit Card Benefits for Citi Customers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while most other MasterCard, Visa and American Express cards exclude coverage in Ireland, Israel, Jamaica.

These schemes apply to cards issued in the US, Trinidad and Tobago,&lt;ref name="mastercard1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/tt/personal/en/findacard/credit_cards/platinum/platinum_mc_master_rental.html|title=Credit Cards - Trinidad and Tobago|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080301222323/http://www.mastercard.com/tt/personal/en/findacard/credit_cards/platinum/platinum_mc_master_rental.html|archivedate=2008-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently nowhere else. In addition, no credit card will cover a rental that is being billed to a third party, such as in the event that an insurance company is being directly billed for the rental.

The following table is an effort at a summary, though not guaranteed. Coverage is complex and changes periodically. Telephone staff do not know the changes. Formal insurance policies govern and are not easily available to cardholders, who are only given summaries, like the links below.

"Loss of use" and administration fees are often advertised as covered by credit cards. However, credit card companies pay these items only if the rental car company provides proof. If rental car company does not provide proof, there seems little reason for the renter to pay either.

The '''Declaration on the Establishment of the Authority of the People''' was brought into force on 2 March 1977 by the [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]], in the name of the [[Arab people]] of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]]. This [[amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Libya (1969)|constitution of 1969]] would remain in force until the adoption of the [[Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration|interim constitution]] on 3 August 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8471">{{About|deferred tax as an accounting concept|deferral of tax liabilities in cash-flow terms|tax deferral}}

{{accounting}}

A notional asset or liability to reflect corporate income taxation on a basis that is the same or more similar to recognition of profits than the taxation treatment.  '''Deferred tax''' liabilities can arise as a result of corporate taxation treatment of capital expenditure being more rapid than the accounting depreciation treatment. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carry-overs, which are only recorded as asset if it is deemed more likely than not that the asset will be used in future fiscal periods. Different countries may also allow or require discounting of the assets or particularly liabilities. There are often disclosure requirements for potential liabilities and assets that are not actually recognised as an asset or liability.

== Permanent and Temporary differences==
If an item in the profit and loss account is never chargeable or allowable for tax or is chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but never appears in the profit and loss account then this is a permanent difference. A permanent difference does not give rise to deferred tax.

If items are chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but in different periods to when the income or expense is recognised then this gives rise to temporary differences. Temporary difference do give rise to potential deferred tax, but the rules on whether the deferred asset or liability is actually recognised can vary.

Temporary differences are usually calculated on the differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability recognized in the statements of financial position and the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax at the beginning and end of the year. The differences in the charges to the profit and loss account compared to the amounts taxable or allowable can also be calculated and should reconcile the change in position at the beginning and end of the year.&lt;ref name="IAS 12.5"&gt;IAS 12.5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
The basic principle of accounting for deferred tax under a temporary difference approach can be illustrated using a common example in which a company has fixed assets that qualify for tax depreciation.

The following example assumes that a company purchases an asset for $1,000 which is depreciated for accounting purposes on a straight-line basis of five years of $200/year. The company claims tax depreciation of 25% per year on a reducing balance basis. The applicable rate of [[corporate income tax]] is assumed to be 35%, and the net value is subtracted.

|-
! Deferred tax liability/(asset) at 35%

|}

As the tax value, or [[tax base]], is lower than the accounting value, or [[book value]], in years 1 and 2, the company should recognize a deferred tax liability. This also reflects that the company has claimed tax depreciation in excess of the expense for accounting depreciation recorded in its accounts, whereas in the future the company should claim less tax depreciation in total than accounting depreciation in its accounts.

In years 3 and 4, the tax value exceeds the accounting value, therefore the company should recognise a deferred tax asset (subject to it having sufficient forecast profits so that it is able to use future tax deductions). This reflects that the company expects to be able to claim tax depreciation in excess of accounting depreciation.

== Timing differences ==

In many cases the deferred tax outcome will be similar for a temporary difference or timing difference approach. However, differences can arise such as in relation to [[revaluation]] of [[fixed assets]] qualifying for [[tax base|tax depreciation]], which gives rise to a deferred tax asset under a balance sheet approach, but in general should have no impact under a timing difference approach.

== Justification for deferred tax accounting==

Deferred tax is relevant to the matching principle.

== Examples ==

=== Deferred tax liabilities ===

Deferred tax liabilities generally arise where tax relief is provided in advance of an accounting expense/unpaid liabilities, or income is [[accrue]]d but not taxed until  received

=== Deferred tax assets ===

Deferred tax assets generally arise where tax relief is provided after an expense is deducted for accounting purposes:

* a company may [[accrue]] an accounting expense in relation to a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] such as bad debts, but tax relief may not be obtained until the provision is utilized
* a company may incur tax losses and be able to "carry forward" losses to reduce taxable income in future years..

An asset on a company's balance sheet that may be used to reduce any subsequent period's income tax expense. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carryover.

== Deferred tax in modern accounting standards ==

Modern accounting standards typically require that a company provides for deferred tax in accordance with either the [[#temporary differences|temporary difference]] or [[#Timing differences|timing difference]] approach. Where a deferred tax liability or asset is recognised, the liability or asset should reduce over time (subject to new differences arising) as the temporary or timing difference reverses.

Under [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], deferred tax should be accounted for using the principles in [[IAS 12]]: Income Taxes, which is similar (but not identical) to [[SFAS 109]] under [[US GAAP]]. Both these accounting standards require a [[#temporary differences|temporary difference]] approach.

Other accounting standards which deal with deferred tax include:

* '''[[UK GAAP]]''' - [[Financial Reporting Standard 19: Deferred Tax]] ([[#Timing differences|timing difference approach]])
* '''Mexican GAAP or PCGA''' - Boletín D-4, el impuesto sobre la renta diferido
* '''[[Canadian GAAP]]''' - [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants|CICA]] Section 3465
* '''[[Russia]]n PBU 18 (2002)''' ''Accounting for profit tax'' ([[#Timing differences|timing difference approach]])
*'''[[INDIAN AS]]'''-[[Institute Of Charted Account of India -AS 22 Accounting for taxes on income]]

== Derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities ==
Management has an obligation to accurately report the true state of the company, and to make judgements and estimations where necessary. In the context of tax assets and liabilities, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the tax difference may be realised in future years.

For example, a tax asset may appear on the company's accounts due to losses in previous years (if carry-forward of tax losses is allowed). In this case a deferred tax asset should be recognised if and only if the management considered that there will be sufficient future taxable profit to use the tax loss.&lt;ref&gt;IAS 12.34&lt;/ref&gt; If it becomes clear that the company does not expect to make profits in future years, the value of the tax asset has been ''impaired'': in the estimation of management, the likelihood that this [[tax loss]] can be used in the future has significantly fallen.

In cases where the carrying value of tax assets or liabilities has changed, the company may need to do a [[write down]], and in certain cases involving in particular a fundamental error, a restatement of its financial results from previous years. Such write-downs may involve either significant income or expenditure being recorded in the company's profit and loss for the financial year in which the write-down takes place.

'''Edwin Newton Atherton''' (October 12, 1896 – August 31, 1944) served as a Foreign Service Officer, [[Bureau of Investigation]] (BOI) Agent, Private Investigator, and later, appointed head of the college athletics organization, the [[Pacific Coast Conference]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=ccnathbos&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c29WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=H-QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6900%2C1509266 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press |title=Coast colleges name Atherton boss |date=January 6, 1940 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ecfbczr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BkslAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2438%2C4625658 |newspaper=Berkeley Daily Gazette |agency=United Press |title=Edwin Atherton, Coast football czar, dies |date=September 1, 1944 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], Atherton studied law at [[Georgetown University]] (1914) for only four months. After leaving Georgetown, he was a clerk in a bank and then entered the consular service (January 1916) where during [[World War I]] he served in [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Jerusalem]].  After the war, Atherton served in [[Canada]], then resigned from consular duties (March 13, 1925 and served the Department of Justice from 1925 to 1927. He served in New York, Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles and headed the Department of Justice office in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/aug03/estrada081503.htm FBI information on Enrique Estrada capture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225075651/https://www2.fbi.gov/page2/aug03/estrada081503.htm |date=2016-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His service in the BOI (later [[FBI]]) was notable for his having worked on the 1924 capture of a neo-revolutionary army of Mexican nationals under the leadership of General [[Enrique Estrada]] at Engineer Springs on the California border. He resigned from the BOI in 1927 and started a private investigating firm in [[Los Angeles]] with another former special agent, Joseph Dunn, called Atherton and Dunn.

Atherton's firm was hired to investigate police graft and corruption and wrote the so-called "Atherton Report" on police corruption in the [[San Francisco Police Department]] in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/131865 1937 Atherton Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was paid $40,000 to thoroughly investigate the Pacific Coast Conference in 1938.&lt;ref name=fopccrl&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZWsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r6sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1416%2C422193 |newspaper=San Jose News |agency=United Press |title=Faults of P.C.C. are listed |date=January 5, 1940 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years and the submission of his extensive two-million-word report,&lt;ref name=athre40spsp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cW9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=H-QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6708%2C1249185 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press |title=Atherton Report, $40,000 worth, calls a spade a spade for colleges |date=January 4, 1940 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was immediately appointed to be High COmmissioner of the Pacific Coast Conference in January 1940 to carry out his recommended reforms.&lt;ref name=ccnathbos/&gt;

==Death==

Since 2005, federal legislation has been introduced in the [[109th Congress]], [[110th Congress]], [[111th Congress]] and the [[112th Congress]] to amend Title 28 United States Code section 1259 to allow members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] to appeal [[court-martial]] convictions when the [[Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] denies a petition for grant of review or extraordinary relief. In the 112th Congress the '''Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011''', H.R. 3133 was introduced in the House of Representatives and the '''Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011''', S. 1664 was introduced in the Senate. Both bills are currently pending.

==Controversy over Supreme Court access==
Since the establishment of the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] by the [[United States Constitution]] in 1789, [[United States Congress|Congress]] has not allowed service members direct appeal to the nation’s highest federal court should the service member be convicted by courts-martial.{{cn|date=October 2015}} In 1950 Congress created the modern military justice system by enacting, in 1951, the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. In 1984 Congress passed the Military Justice Act of 1983, that gave service members limited access to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="crs"&gt;Elsea, Jennifer K., [http://www.jaa.org/other/CRS_Memo.pdf Supreme Court Review of Decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces Under Writs of Certiorari], Congressional Research Service, February 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Under existing law, Title 28 [[United States Code]] section 1259, a service member may appeal to the Supreme Court in death penalty cases or if review is granted by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] (CAAF) - which happens about twenty percent of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Kevin, [http://msulr.law.msu.edu/back_issues/2002/1/Barry.pdf A Face Lift (And Much More) For An Aging Beauty: The Cox Commission Recommendations To Rejuvenate The Uniform Code Of Military Justice], 2002 L. Rev. M.S.U. – D.C.L. 57 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the government can appeal any ruling in which the service member prevails by having the individual service judge advocate general certify an issue for appeal.&lt;ref name="crs" /&gt;

CAAF, as initially established in 1951 (known then as "Court of Military Appeals") was the final authority on cases arising under the military justice system, except for a limited number of cases considered by the Supreme Court under collateral proceedings, such as through writs of [[habeas corpus]].

In March 2004, Norbert Basil MacLean III, a former [[United States Navy]] [[cryptologist]], began to petition Congress to permit all court-martialed service members access to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="HASCltr"&gt;McHugh, John; Davis, Susan, [[:Image:RepsMcHughDavis.JPG|House Armed Services Committee letter to Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes II, April 23, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under MacLean's proposal, which Rep [[Susan Davis (politician)|Davis]] (D-Calif.) and Senator [[Dianne Feinstein|Feinstein]] (D-Calif.) adapted as introduced bills in the House of Representatives and Senate, service members would be able to access the nation's highest court if CAAF denied a grant of review or relief in extraordinary writ and writ-appeal cases.&lt;ref name="HASCltr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SenateOKs"&gt;Ernde, Laura, "Senate OKs Review of Courts-Martial", ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', September 12, 2008, front page&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2006 report issued by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) showed that ninety percent of all court-martialed service members whose cases were eligible for review by the court could not have Supreme Court review because the court had either denied a grant of a petition for review or denied extraordinary relief.&lt;ref name="abareport"&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/policy/am06116.pdf American Bar Association Resolution 116], adopted by ABA House of Delegates on August 7–8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA called on Congress in 2006 to change the law and permit all court-martialed service members the right of review in the high court.

==109th Congress==
* H.R. 1364 Equal Justice for Our Military Personnel Act, 2005, 109th Congress [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-1364] (referred to committee—did not pass)

On April 23, 2004, the House Armed Services Committee sent a bipartisan letter, written by Reps. Davis (D-Calif.) and [[John Michael McHugh]] (R-NY), to [[United States Department of Defense|The Pentagon]] asking for feedback on MacLean's proposal.&lt;ref name="ladji" /&gt; Then-Principal Deputy General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto wrote to lawmakers opposing MacLean's proposal of Supreme Court access for service members. According to the ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', Dell'Orto stated that changing the law and giving service members greater Supreme Court access would only serve to burden the nation's highest court.&lt;ref name="ladji"&gt;Walbert, Claude, "Bill Would Let Court-Martialed Appeal to Justices", ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', March 21, 2005, front page&lt;/ref&gt; Rep. Davis first introduced the ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act'' on March 17, 2005, in the 109th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/t2GPO/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1364ih.txt.pdf Equal Justice for Our Military Act], H.R. 1364 introduced in the 109th Congress (March 17, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; After its introduction the bill was opposed by the Bush administration through then-Department of Defense General Counsel [[William J. Haynes, II]]. Haynes wrote to Congress in opposition stating "there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="ladjii"&gt;Ernde, Laura, "Momentum Grows for Opening High Court to Servicemembers", ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', July 17, 2007, front page&lt;/ref&gt; The bill failed in the 109th Congress.

At the behest of MacLean, Legislative Research Inc. ("LRI"), based in California, developed two decades of military justice statistics to present to Congress. LRI completed its study in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Research Incorporated, ''"The Military Justice System: 1983-84 Through 2004-05: Twenty-two Years of Key Statistical Findings"'' (March 30, 2006) Preface by Norbert Basil MacLean III, presented to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Judiciary Committees of the 109th Congress and to the Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, the American Bar Association ("ABA") issued a report and unanimously passed a resolution urging Congress to correct the law and permit U.S. armed forces members equal access to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="abareport" /&gt; The ABA report references military justice statistics compiled as a direct result of MacLean's work on this issue noting that: "CAAF denies petitions for grant of review and petitions for relief far more often than it grants them. While there is significant variation from year to year, in 2004-05, petitions for review were denied in 78.3 percent (581) of the cases and granted in 19.54 percent (145) of the cases. Petitions for grants of extraordinary relief were denied in 70.45 percent (31) of the cases and granted in 4.55 percent (2) of the cases. Equally sobering, the statistical compilation reveals that during the same time-period, there were 7,564 court-martial convictions and only 799 petitions for grant of review granted by CAAF."&lt;ref name="abareport" /&gt;

==110th Congress==
Reps. Susan A. Davis, (D-Calif.) and [[Ike Skelton]] (D-Mo.) of the House Armed Services Committee reintroduced the bill that had previously failed in the last Congress entitled the ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007'', H.R. 3174.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3174ih.txt.pdf Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007], H.R. 3174 introduced in 110th Congress-House (July 25, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The reintroduced bill was in broader form and included not only denials for extraordinary writs but also petitions for direct review. It would amend 28 U.S.C. sections 1259(3) and (4) so that if the Court of Appeals denied review or relief to a service member an appeal could be taken to the Supreme Court. Six days after H.R. 3174's introduction, it received bipartisan support by Rep. [[Rodney Alexander]] (R-La.), a [[U.S. Air Force Reserve]] veteran, who signed on as cosponsor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2007_record&amp;page=H9277&amp;position=all Congressional Record - House (Daily Digest), page H9277] (July 31, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate Judiciary markup's bill and favorably reports it to full Senate===
On September 17, 2007, a companion bill, identical to the House bill, was introduced in the Senate by Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.), then-Republican Arlen Specter, and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), entitled ''Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s2052is.txt.pdf ''Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007''], S. 2052 introduced in 110th Congress-Senate (September 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; When the Senate returned from its 2008 summer recess, Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (D-NY), a member of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], signed on as cosponsor to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2008_record&amp;page=S8132&amp;position=all U.S. Congress.

===House suspends rules and passes its version of bill===
On September 27, 2008, the House of Representatives debated and passed, by two-thirds voice vote, the ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007'', H.R. 3174.&lt;ref name="HouseCRpass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisRel"&gt;Davis, Susan, [http://www.house.gov/susandavis/press/pr092708equal.shtml House Passes Susan Davis ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act''], Press Release, September 27, 2008 (retrieved on September 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Rep. [[Lamar S. Smith]] (R-Tx.), the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee opposed the bill during floor debate arguing, among other things, that there were no hearings in the House Judiciary Committee.&lt;ref name="HouseCRpass" /&gt; It was expected that the U.S. Senate would take up the House passed H.R. 3174 during the week of December 8, 2008. However, several print media and blogs had reported opposition by at least one Republican Senator who blocked a Senate floor vote on the bill.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Slater, Dan, [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/09/30/supreme-court-access-for-military-members-convicted-of-crimes/ "Supreme Court Access for Military Members Convicted of Crimes?"], ''The Wall Street Journal'' Law Blog, September 30, 2008 (retrieved October 12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maze, Rick, [http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/09/military_courtmartial_appeal_092908w/ "Appeal rights bill may die in Senate"], ''Navy Times'', September 30, 2008 (retrieved October 12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palazzolo, Joe, [http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2008/09/service-members.html "Service Members One Step Closer to SCOTUS Access"], ''The Blog of Legal Times'', September 30, 2008 (retrieved October 12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==111th Congress==
Early in the [[111th Congress]] two identical bills were introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to give servicemembers the same right to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court as civilian citizens. On January 15, 2009, Rep. Davis (D-Calif.) Chairwoman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the House Armed Services Committee reintroduced the bill in the 111th Congress as the ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2009'', H.R. 569.&lt;ref name="Housereintro111"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.569: U.S. Congress.

Identical legislation was also introduced on January 30, 2009, when Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.), then-Republican Arlen Specter and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) reintroduced the Senate bill in the 111th Congress as the ''Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2009'', S. 357.&lt;ref name="S357"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.357: U.S. Congress.

Both the House and Senate bills were also the same language as MacLean first proposed to Congress in 2004.&lt;ref name="HASCltr" /&gt;

In March 2009 before a joint session of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees, Ira Novoselsky, the national commander of the [[Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America]] announced that JWV was making the House bill and the issue of Supreme Court access for service members a legislative priority.&lt;ref name="JVW"&gt;Novoselsky, Ira, [http://www.jwv.org/images/uploads/Ira_Novoselsky_testimony_2009.pdf Legislative Priorities of the Jewish War Veterans of the USA], Before Joint Session of Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (111th Congress - 1st Session), March 5, 2009, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselsky asked the Veteran's Committee to weigh in on the important issue and stated that "JWV supports legislation that will restore due process and equal treatment under the law for our service members and veterans".&lt;ref name="JVW" /&gt;

===House subcommittee hearing===
On June 11, 2009, the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy|Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy]] of the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] held a hearing on H.R. 569.&lt;ref name="JudiciaryHR569hearing"&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_090611.html Hearing information on H.R. 569, House Judiciary Committee] (retrieved June 3, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses who appeared before the subcommittee included retired Army Major General [[John D.

On July 30, 2009, the House Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy held a mark up on H.R. 569 and approved the bill for full House Judiciary Committee action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2009_record&amp;page=D953&amp;position=all Congressional Record - Daily Digest, July 30, 2009, page D953]&lt;/ref&gt;

===House Judiciary Committee markup, favorable report issued and placed on Union Calendar===
On January 27, 2010, the full House Judiciary Committee, by voice vote, favorably reported H.R. 569 to the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/transcripts/transcript100127.pdf Transcript of Markup on Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2009, H.R. 569] (January 27, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2010, a U.S. House of Representatives Report was filed which amended H.R. 569 and changed its name to the ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2010''.&lt;ref name="HouseReport111-547"&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr547.111.pdf Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2010, U.S. House of Representatives Report 111-547 (July 14, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; H.R. 569 was placed on the Union Calendar of the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h569rh.txt.pdf Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The House Report refers to MacLean in footnotes. One in particular states that "during the full Committee mark-up of H.R. 569, Members of the Minority charged that the bill was introduced primarily for the benefit of a single individual, former Navy Officer Norbert Basil MacLean, III. In fact, a number of individuals and organizations have taken note of the inherent injustice of the current law. Additionally, it should be pointed out that H.R. 569 applies only to courts-martial that were initiated on or after the effective date of the Act, which thereby forecloses any personal benefit to Mr. MacLean, whose court-martial was concluded well before this legislation was introduced."&lt;ref name="HouseReport111-547" /&gt;

==112th Congress==
The Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011 has been introduced in the House of Representatives as H.R. 3133 and in the Senate as S. 1664. Currently, no action has been taken on either bill.

==Congressional Research Service reports==
On October 6, 2008, the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) issued a report entitled [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34697_20081006.pdf "Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Cases."]&lt;ref name="CRS6OCT08"&gt;Henning, Anna C., [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34697_20081006.pdf "Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Cases"], ''Congressional Research Service'', October 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The CRS report noted that under existing law the CAAF "functions as a gatekeeper for military appellants' access to Supreme Court review."&lt;ref name="CRS6OCT08" /&gt; The report further noted that "if the CAAF denies an appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court will typically lack the authority to review the decision. In contrast, criminal appellants in Article III courts have an automatic right of appeal to federal courts of appeals and then a right to petition the Supreme Court for review."&lt;ref name="CRS6OCT08" /&gt; On January 30, 2009, the CRS issued a second report also entitled [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34697_20090130.pdf "Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Case."] This CRS report discusses HR 569 in the 111th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Henning, Anna C.,[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34697_20090130.pdf "Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Cases"], ''Congressional Research Service'', January 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office costings==
The United States [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) issued a [[cost estimate]] on October 22, 2008, regarding the '''Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007''', S.2052, 110th Congress. The CBO estimated costs to be approximately $1 million a year if S.2052 was enacted which would include the workload of Department of Defense attorneys and Supreme Court clerks.&lt;ref name="CBO"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/98xx/doc9899/S2052.pdf Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate - S.2052 Equal Justice for Our Military Act], October 22, 2008 (retrieved October 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Further it estimates a possible additional $1 million to $2 million in appropriated funds for the Department of Defense to defend a case in the Supreme Court if a servicemember petitioned the high court for a [[writ of certiorari]].&lt;ref name="CBO" /&gt; However, the CBO determined that by enacting S.2052 there would be no direct spending and it would impose no costs on local, state or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="CBO" /&gt;

On October 27, 2008, the [[The Press-Enterprise (California)|''Press-Enterprise'']] noted in an article that the cost to the average family if S.2052 was enacted would be $0.16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=PELEG.story&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-27-2008/0004911692&amp;EDATE=MON+Oct+27+2008,+07:10+AM Veterans' Benefits on the March, ''Press Enterprise'', October 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of costs related to an increase in workload, the American Bar Association stated in a letter to House leaders that "to those that argue that permitting equal access to the courts will create workload problems, we emphatically respond that nothing is more important than the provision of fundamental due process to our service members."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/judiciary/2008sep19_eqljustmilh_l.pdf American Bar Association letter to House Leaders dated September 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2009, Washington, DC attorney Dwight H. Sullivan testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee that the costs, should HR 569 (111th Congress) be passed, would be approximately $1,000 per case.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Sullivan090611.pdf Testimony of Dwight H. Sullivan, Attorney, Washington, DC, Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy, House Committee on the Judiciary, June 11, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2010, the CBO issued a cost estimate on HR 569.&lt;ref name="CBO2"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/110xx/doc11051/hr569.pdf Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate - H.R. 569 Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2009], February 2, 2010 (retrieved March 22, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO's estimate indicates that "Based on information provided by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Supreme Court, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase the workload of DoD attorneys and Supreme Court clerks and would cost less than $1 million each year, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. We expect that the bill would make several hundred service members eligible to file petitions each year, but that only a small portion of those individuals would pursue review by the Supreme Court (based on the experience of individuals whose cases currently qualify for Supreme Court review). CBO cannot predict whether the Supreme Court would grant review of any particular petition. If the Supreme Court agreed to review any petitions, DoD would probably spend no more than $1 million in any year from appropriated funds to defend those cases. (Any such amounts would depend on the number and complexity of such cases.) Enacting H.R. 569 would not affect direct spending or revenues." &lt;ref name="CBO2" /&gt; The February 2010 estimate was considerably less in estimated costs compared to the previous CBO estimate in 2008.

===Major opponents to the legislation===
The following are opponents to the legislation and have either testified before Congress or sent letters in opposition which are part of the Congressional record:

====William J. Haynes II====
In 2002 the ''[[Army Times]]'' editorial board was critical of the Department of Defense (DoD) trying to prevent servicemembers from accessing the federal courts regarding military personnel issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armytimes.com/legacy/new/0-ARMYPAPER-406877.php EDITORIAL: Equal rights for soldiers], Army Times, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[William J. Haynes II]] had submitted various proposals to Congress, in the DoD 2002 budget proposal, to not allow service members access to the federal courts to challenge military personnel issues such as promotions, retention actions, separations, retirement, enlistments and re-enlistements.

{{Wikisource|Letter of William J. Haynes, II opposing SCOTUS access for troops}}

A front page article in the ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' reported that Haynes opposed giving members of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] access to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] if they are court-martialed. In February 2006, he wrote letters to Congress opposing the ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act'', which was pending in the 109th Congress. Haynes opined that "there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction."&lt;ref&gt;"Momentum Grows for Opening High Court to Servicemembers" by Laura Ernde, ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', July 17, 2007, front page&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, in March 2006, Navy veteran Norbert Basil MacLean III lobbied lawmakers with twenty-two years of military justice statistics showing that over 80 percent of all court-martialed service members are shut out of seeking [[U.S. Supreme Court]] review.&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Research Incorporated, [http://base.googlehosted.com/base_media?q=hand-1245427223114476909&amp;size=8 ''"The Military Justice System: 1983-84 Through 2004-05: Twenty-two Years of Key Statistical Findings"'']{{dead link|date=November 2012}} (March 30, 2006) Preface by Norbert Basil MacLean III, presented to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Judiciary Committees of the 109th Congress and to the Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, the [[American Bar Association]] issued a report and passed a resolution urging Congress to give servicemembers Supreme Court access.&lt;ref name="abareport"/&gt;

After MacLean was precluded from Supreme Court access by operation of 28 U.S.C. 1259(4), and learning that other service members were also, he began his advocacy to change the law.&lt;ref name="SenateOKs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sdut"&gt;Rogers, Rick, [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/military/20070726-9999-7m26suit.html "Bill Offers Troops Way to Appeal"], ''San Diego Union Tribune'', July 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funk, Deborah, [http://www.armytimes.com/legacy/new/0-ARMYPAPER-757803.php "Bill would let more military defendants appeal to high court"], ''Army Times'', April 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; MacLean first started to petition Members of the [[108th Congress]] in March 2004 to amend the law and permit service members access to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="HASCltr" /&gt; MacLean's proposal, which was included in the HASC letter to the Defense Department, was simple: to permit a petition for writ of certiorari to be filed by any member of the U.S. Armed Forces who was denied review or relief by the CAAF. This concept would bring the Armed Forces court in line with other federal Courts of Appeal concerning Supreme Court review of federal criminal convictions. MacLean's proposal would afford service members full procedural due process protections in appellate review of courts-martial to the Supreme Court.

=====MacLean's commentary calling on Congress to take action to allow service members court access=====
The ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', the ''San Francisco Daily Journal'', the ''Los Angeles Times'' and the ''Legal Times'' published MacLean's commentary calling upon Congress to take action on pending bills allowing for service members to access the Supreme Court.

=====Criticism of MacLean's position=====
U.S. Department of Defense officials in the [[George W. Bush administration]] were critical of MacLean's proposal&lt;!--This term is tagged earlier--&gt; to Congress. Department of Defense Principal Deputy General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto indicated opposition to the issue of access to the Supreme Court for members of the U.S. Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg11150222/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg11150222.pdf Hearing transcript on Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2009, H.R. 569 (111th Congress)] June 11, 2009 (Daniel J. Dell'Orto letter is at pages 68-69 of transcript) (retrieved August 28, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The House Armed Services Committee wrote a letter to the Defense Department attaching correspondence from MacLean on the inequity. Dell'Orto wrote back to the Armed Services committee criticizing MacLean's proposal for fear it would "increase the burden upon the Supreme Court."&lt;ref name="ladji" /&gt; In 2006 then-Department of Defense General Counsel [[William J. Haynes, II]] was critical of MacLean's proposal and indicated that the Bush administration opposes giving servicemembers equal access to the Supreme Court. In February 2006 Haynes opined to Congress that "there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="ladjii" /&gt;

After the House of Representatives passed the ''Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007'', Robert E. Reed, an associate general counsel at the Department of Defense in the George W. Bush administration told ''[[The New York Times]]'' the legislation would increase the burdens on the Supreme Court and Defense Department lawyers, adding that supporters were not taking a “panoramic view.”&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Becker, Bernie, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/washington/28military.html "Military Appeals Process is Challenged"], ''The New York Times'', November 27, 2008, A30&lt;/ref&gt; “A lot of those supporters are only looking at this as a motherhood, apple pie sort of issue,” he said. “There’s a logic and a rationale to this. We’re not just trying to be mean and difficult for the defendants.”&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Reed's comment to ''The New York Times'' may have been in response to MacLean's 2007 comment to the ''[[San Diego Union Tribune]]'' when he (MacLean) said "I think there is a high likelihood that this bill will pass because voting against it would be like voting against Mom and warm apple pie.”&lt;ref name="sdut" /&gt; Finally, Reed told ''The New York Times'' “It’s the same old people with the same old arguments and the same propositions.”&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

=====Praise of MacLean's position=====
Despite critics in the George W. Bush administration, in 2005, the press secretary for Rep. Davis said in the ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' that after considering MacLean's arguments, Davis believes both prosecution and defense should have equal opportunity to appeal to the Supreme Court. "He brought up a very important issue of equality under the law," Aaron Hunter, press secretary said.&lt;ref name="ladji" /&gt;

The American Bar Association mentioned MacLean in its resolution and report to Congress in 2006 which urged the law be changed to permit members of the U.S. Armed Forces to have equal access to the Supreme Court. The ABA report references MacLean's work on military justice statistics.&lt;ref name="abareport" /&gt;

During a 5 June 2009 House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on H.R. 569 (111th Congress), Rep. Davis made reference to MacLean in her testimony as "a tireless champion for this issue and other military justice reform on behalf of the service members and veterans that fall under the jurisdiction of those [military courts of appeal]."&lt;ref name="DavisTestimony" /&gt;

'''Eunomics''' is a term, first proposed by legal scholar [[Lon L. Fuller|Lon Fuller]] in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forms Liberate: Reclaiming the Jurisprudence of Lon L Fuller |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=zyfcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Eunomics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2AHwMyeGfJ&amp;sig=-8U08h7ULJnnghn3y-5KxMvk3tc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiirc7i1MPcAhUH8LwKHdxtDw4Q6AEwDnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Eunomics&amp;f=false |website=Google Books |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to describe "the science, theory or study of good order and workable arrangements".&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Lon L. (1954). ''American Legal Philosophy at Mid-Century - A Review of Edwin W. Patterson's ''Jurisprudence, Men and Ideas of the Law'', p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from [[Behavioral Systems Theory]], it was an attempt to fuse what Fuller saw as the inherent [[morality]] of [[law]] with the [[empirical]] data and methods of the objective [[sciences]]. Its main practical application appears to be as a form of industrial dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EUNOMICS AND JUSTICE |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1847&amp;context=dlj |website=scholarship and law |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with New Institutional Economics==

[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel prize]] winner [[Oliver E. Williamson]], a leading mind of the [[New institutional economics|New Institutional Economics]] (NIE) movement, refers to Fuller's definition of eunomics as a [[simulacrum]] of his understanding of the term ''[[governance]]''. Same as with the NIE, eunomics are foremost concerned with the question how to achieve a desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1996). ''The Mechanisms of Governance''. Oxford University Press. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Euthanasia Laws Act 1997''''' (Cth) is an Act of the [[Parliament of Australia]] to amend the ''[[Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1978425/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988|''Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988'' (Cth)]] and the [[Norfolk Island Act 1979|''Norfolk Island Act 1979'' (Cth)]] to remove the power of the Parliament of each of those territories to legalise [[euthanasia]]. The law was enacted in response to the enactment by the [[Northern Territory Parliament]] of the [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995]] (NT) which had legalised euthanasia in the Territory.

The ''Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996'' was introduced in the Australian Parliament by [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] backbencher [[Kevin Andrews (politician)|Kevin Andrews]] as a [[private member's bill]].

{{Fascism sidebar}}
As there have been many different manifestations of [[fascism]], especially during the interwar years, there were also many different symbols of fascist movements. Fascist symbolism typically involved [[nationalism|nationalist]] imagery.

==Common symbolism of fascist movements==
Organized fascist movements have [[militarist]]-appearing uniforms for their members; use national symbols, historical symbols of a nation as symbols of their movement; and use orchestrated rallies for [[propaganda]] purposes. Fascist movements are led by a "Leader" (i.e. ''[[Duce]]'', ''[[Führer]]'', ''[[Caudillo]]'' and so on) who is publicly idolized in propaganda as the nation's saviour. A number of fascist movements use a [[Roman salute|straight-armed salute]].

The use of symbols, graphics, and other artifacts created by fascist, [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments has been noted as a key aspect of their propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heller |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Heller (graphic design) |title=Iron Fists: Branding the 20th-Century Totalitarian State |year=2008|publisher=[[Phaidon Press]] |location= |isbn=0-7148-4846-8|page=240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Fascist movements adopted symbols of Ancient Roman or Greek origin, for example the German use of Roman standards during rallies, the Italian adoption of the ''[[fasces]]'' symbol, the Spanish "[[Falange]]" from the Spanish word for "Phalanx".

==Italy==
[[File:Flag of the National Fascist Party (PNF).svg|left|thumb|Flag of the National Fascist Party, bearing the fasces, which was the premier symbol of Italian Fascism.]]
[[File:Fascist Eagle.svg|right|thumb|200px|A perched eagle clutching a fasces was a common symbol used on Italian Fascist uniforms.]]
The original symbol of fascism, in Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]], was the [[fasces]]. This is an ancient [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] symbol of power carried by [[lictor]]s in front of [[magistrate]]s; a bundle of sticks featuring an [[axe]], indicating the power over [[life]] and [[death]]. Before the Italian Fascists adopted the fasces, the symbol had been used by Italian political organizations of various political ideologies (ranging from socialist to nationalist), called [[Fascio]] ("leagues") as a symbol of strength through unity.

Italian Fascism utilized the color [[black]] as a symbol of their movement, black being the color of the uniforms of their paramilitaries, known as [[Blackshirts]]. The blackshirt derived from Italy's daredevil elite [[shock troops]] known as the ''[[Arditi]]'', soldiers who were specifically trained for a life of violence and wore unique blackshirt uniforms.&lt;ref name=rg207&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. Fascism: Fascism and culture. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2004. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The colour black as used by the Arditi, symbolized death.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Oxon, England, UK: Digital Printing, 2005. Pp. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascist Italy was not officially racist, unlike its World War II Axis partner of [[Nazi Germany]]. But it equally gave importance to the purity of race, as Mussolini at multiple times expressed alarm towards a possible extinction of white people. Consolidation of gained territory in the northeast of Italy led to state-sanctioned persecution and ethnic cleansing of [[Slovenes]], while closer ties with Hitler caused Mussolini to collaborate in sending Italian Jews to die in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/nyregion/05italians.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]] (Italy), Mussolini stated, "Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our [[Aryan]] and [[Mediterranean race]]".&lt;ref name=nm35&gt;Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini was concerned with the low birth rates of the [[white race]] in contrast to the African and Asian races. In 1928, he noted the high birth-rate of blacks in the United States, and that they had surpassed the population of whites in certain areas, such as Harlem in New York City. He described their greater racial consciousness in comparison with American whites as contributing to their growing strength.&lt;ref name=ag43&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London; New York. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other symbols used by the Italian Fascists included the ''[[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]]'', the [[Capitoline Wolf]], and the [[SPQR]] motto, each related to Italy's ancient Roman cultural history, which the Fascists attempted to resurrect.

==Germany==
[[File:Flag of Nazi Germany (1933-1945).svg|left|thumb|Flag of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), bearing the [[swastika]], the premier symbol of [[Nazism]] which remains strongly associated with it in the Western world.]]
{{main|Nazi symbolism}}
[[File:Parteiadler der Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (1933–1945).svg|right|thumb|200px|NSDAP Parteiadler eagle]]
[[File:Parteiadler_der_Nationalsozialistische_Deutsche_Arbeiterpartei_(1933–1945)_(andere).svg|right|thumb|200px|NSDAP Parteiadler eagle variant]]
The nature of German fascism, as encapsulated in [[Nazism]] was similar to Italian Fascism ideologically and borrowed symbolism from the Italian Fascists such as the use of mass rallies, the straight-armed [[Roman salute]], and the use of pageantry. Nazism was different from Italian Fascism in that it was officially [[racism|racist]]. Its symbol was the [[swastika]], at the time a commonly seen symbol in the world that had experienced a [[Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century|revival in use in the western world in the early 20th century]]. German [[Völkisch movement|völkisch Nationalists]] claimed the swastika was a symbol of the [[Aryan race]], who they claimed were the foundation of Germanic civilization and were superior to all other races.

As the Italian Fascists adapted elements of their ethnic heritage to fuel a sense of Nationalism by use of symbolism, so did Nazi Germany. Turn-of-the-century [[Germanic mysticism|German-Austrian mystic]] and author [[Guido von List]] was a big influence on [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]], who introduced various ancient Germanic symbols (filtered through von List's writings) most thoroughly into the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], including the stylized double [[Sig Rune]] (von List's then-contemporary [[Armanen runes|Armanen rune]] version of the ancient ''[[sowilo]]'' [[runic alphabet|rune]]) for the organization itself.

The black-white-red tricolor of the [[German Empire]] was utilized as the color scheme of the Nazi flag. The color [[brown]] was the identifying color of Nazism (and fascism in general), due to it being the color of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] paramilitaries (also known as [[Brownshirts]]).

Other historical symbols that were already in use by the German Army to varying degrees prior to the Nazi Germany, such as the [[Wolfsangel]] and [[Totenkopf]], were also used in a new, more industrialized manner on uniforms and insignia.

Although the swastika was a popular symbol in art prior to the regimental use by [[Nazi Germany]] and has a long heritage in many other cultures throughout history - and although many of the symbols used by the Nazis were ancient or commonly used prior to the advent of Nazi Germany - because of association with Nazi use, the swastika is often considered synonymous with [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and some of the other symbols still carry a negative post-[[World War II]] stigma in some Western countries, to the point where some of the symbols are banned from display altogether.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/06/24/germany_banned_its_ugly_historic_symbols_should_we_do_that_too.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{see also|Symbols of Francoism}}
[[File:Bandera FE JONS.svg|left|thumb|Flag of the Spanish Falange, bearing the yoke and arrows, the premier symbol of Falangism.]]
The fascist [[Falange]] in Spain utilized the [[yoke and arrows]] as their symbol. It historically served as the symbol of the shield of the monarchy of [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] and subsequent [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] monarchs, representing a united Spain and the "symbol of the heroic virtues of the race".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Parkins. ''Fashioning the body politic: dress, gender, citizenship''. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Berg, 2002. Pp. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The original uniform of the ''Falangistas'' was the blue shirt – derived from the blue overalls of industrial workers – which was later combined with the red [[beret]] of the [[Carlism|Carlists]] to represent their merger by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].

==Militarist uniforms with nationalist insignia==
[[Image:Mussolini young.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] in uniform.]]
Organized fascist movements typically use military-like uniforms with the symbol of their movement on them.
[[Image:Hitler Mannerheim.png|thumb|100px|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] in uniform.]]
In Italy, the Italian Fascist movement in 1919 wore black military-like uniforms, and were nicknamed [[Blackshirts]]. In power, uniforms during the Fascist era extended to both the party and the military which typically bore ''fasces'' or an eagle clutching a ''fasces'' on their caps or on the left arm section of the uniform.

In Germany, the fascist Nazi movement was similar to the Italian Fascists in that they initially used a specifically colored uniform for their movement, the tan-brown colored uniform of the SA paramilitary group earned the group and the Nazis themselves the nickname of the Brownshirts. The Nazis used the swastika for their uniforms and copied the Italian Fascists' uniforms, with an eagle clutching a wreathed swastika instead of a fasces, and a Nazi flag arm sash on the left arm section of the uniform for party members.

Other fascist countries largely copied the symbolism of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis for their movements. Like them, their uniforms looked typically like military uniforms with Nationalist type insignia of the movement. The Spanish Falange adopted dark blue shirts for their party members, symbolizing Spanish workers, many of whom wore blue shirts. Berets were also used, representing their [[Carlist]] supporters. The Spanish [[Blue Division]] expeditionary volunteers sent to the Eastern Front of WW2 in (relatively indirect) support of the Germans likewise wore blue shirts, berets and their army trousers.

==Other regions==
[[File:Ustaše symbol.svg|thumb|right|100px|Symbol of the Croatian [[Ustaše]].]]
Many other fascist movements did not win power or were relatively minor regimes in comparison and their symbolism is not well-remembered today in many parts of the world, although the BUF's [[Flash and Circle]] was later used by the non-fascist [[People's Action Party]] of [[Singapore]].

* The symbol of the [[Bulgaria]]n national-socialist [[Ratniks|Ratnik]] movements was a [[sun cross]] named "Bogar".
* Lightning bolts were a common symbol of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]], appearing on uniforms, newspaper mastheads, badges and on the movement's flags. The symbol completely replaced the fasces used from 1932 to 1935 with the adoption of the [[Flash and Circle]].
* The symbol of the [[Croatia]]n [[Ustaše]] movement was capital letter U with the flaming grenade and the [[Coat of arms of Croatia|Croatian coat of arms]].
* A prominent symbol of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[4th of August Regime]] was the [[Labrys]]/Pelekys, the double-headed axe which [[Ioannis Metaxas]] thought to be the oldest symbol of all Hellenic civilizations.
* The symbol of [[Hungary]]'s fascistic [[Arrow Cross Party]] was the [[Arrow Cross]].
* Austria's [[Fatherland's Front (Austria)|Fatherland's Front]], that ruled the country from 1933 to 1938, used the [[crutch cross]] as its symbol.

[[File:Neo-Nazi celtic cross flag.svg|thumb|[[Celtic cross]] on a Neo-Nazi flag]]
Some [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organizations continue to use the swastika, but many have moved away from such inflammatory symbols of early fascism. Some [[neo-fascist]] groups use symbols that are reminiscent of the swastika or other cultural or ancestral symbols that may evoke nationalistic sentiment but do not carry the same racist connotations.

Some of these symbols are also used by a variety of non-fascist movements and organizations. The swastika has been a notable symbol in [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]], as well as in modern pagan religions, such as in [[Germanic neopaganism]]. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) states:
{{quote|Nazi Germany glorified an idealized "Aryan/Norse" heritage, consequently extremists have appropriated many symbols from pre-Christian Europe for their own uses. They give such symbols a racist significance, even though the symbols did not originally have such meaning and are often used by nonracists today, especially practitioners of [[modern paganism|modern pagan religions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/Pagan_graphics.asp adl.org], accessed 19 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fasces are used in the [[national emblem of France]], the coat of arms and [[wordmark]] of the Swedish Police and the [[Swedish Security Service]], the coat of arms of the Swiss [[Canton of St. Gallen]], and the coat of arms of the Spanish Civil Guard.

A '''framework decision''' was a kind of legislative act of the [[European Union]] used exclusively within the EU's competences in [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|police and judicial co-operation in criminal justice matters]]. Framework decisions were similar to [[directive (European Union)|directive]]s in that they required member states to achieve particular results without dictating the means of achieving that result.&lt;ref name="Lebeck-507"&gt;Lebeck, Carl, ''[http://germanlawjournal.net/pdfs/Vol08No05/PDF_Vol_08_No_05_501-532_Articles_Lebeck.pdf Sliding Towards Supranationalism? The Constitutional Status of EU Framework Decisions after Pupino]'', 8(5) German Law Journal 501 at 507.&lt;/ref&gt; However unlike directives, framework decisions were not capable of [[direct effect]],&lt;ref name="Lebeck-507" /&gt; they were only subject to the optional jurisdiction of the [[European Court of Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 35 of the Treaty on European Union (Treaty of Nice Version) (OJ C 325, 24 December 2002, p 1).&lt;/ref&gt; and enforcement proceedings could not be taken by the [[European Commission]] for any failure to [[transposition (law)|transpose]] a framework decision into domestic law.

Framework decisions were created in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] and replaced joint actions which were legal instruments available under the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. The Lisbon Treaty abolished framework decisions and the EU can now enact directives and [[regulation (European Union)|regulation]]s in the area of criminal justice by means of the [[ordinary legislative procedure]].

==Legal basis==
The legal basis for framework decisions was Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union. As amended by the Treaty of Nice and before being repealed by the Lisbon Treaty this Article read:

{{quote|'''Article 34'''

2. The Council shall take measures and promote cooperation, using the appropriate form and procedures as set out in this title, contributing to the pursuit of the objectives of the Union. To that end, acting unanimously on the initiative of any Member State or of the Commission, the Council may:

...

:(b) adopt framework decisions for the purpose of approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States. Framework decisions shall be binding upon the Member States as to the result to be achieved but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods. They shall not entail direct effect; ... }}

The continued basis for framework decisions is set out in transitional provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 9 of the Protocol on Transitional Provisions provides that:

{{quote|The legal effects of the acts of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union adopted on the basis of the Treaty on European Union prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon shall be preserved until those acts are repealed, annulled or amended in implementation of the Treaties. The same shall apply to agreements concluded between Member States on the basis of the Treaty on European Union.}}

==Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice==
The [[European Court of Justice]] only had jurisdiction to make [[preliminary ruling]]s on the interpretation of framework decisions when a member state made a declaration under the (pre-Lisbon) [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] indicating the circumstances in which the Court could exercise such a jurisdiction. All [[European Union member states|member states]] except Ireland and the United Kingdom made such a declaration.

The [[European Commission]] could not bring enforcement proceedings against member states for failing to implement a framework decision or for implementing it incorrectly. Although the Court did have jurisdiction to resolve disagreements between member states concerning the interpretation of framework decisions and to hear annulment proceedings regarding their validity.

As of the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty the ''status quo ante'' regarding preliminary rulings and enforcement proceedings were preserved for a transitional period of five years although this transitional period ceases to apply to a framework decision which has been amended after the Lisbon's coming into force.&lt;ref&gt;Article 10 of the Protocol on Transitional Provisions attached to the Treaty of Lisbon.&lt;/ref&gt; After the transitional period has expired on 30 November 2014, preliminary rulings and enforcement proceedings have become possible.

===United Kingdom opt-out===
However the United Kingdom negotiated an opt-out from the continued legal force of framework decisions which it may put into effect no later that six months before the expiry of the transitional period by so notifying the Council of the European Union. In October 2012 the UK government announced that it intended to exercise this opt-out and then selectively opt back into certain measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The UK's planned 'block opt-out' from EU justice and policing measures in 2014 |last1=Peers |first1=Steve |publisher=Statewatch |url=http://www.statewatch.org/analyses/no-199-uk-opt-out.pdf |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless this decision is reversed, all framework decisions which are not amended during the transitional period but which are still in force will cease to apply to the UK from 1 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Article 10(4) of the Protocol on Transitional Provisions attached to the Treaty of Lisbon.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gott v. Berea College''''', 161 S.W. 204 (Ky. 1913), was a case heard before the Kentucky Court of Appeals wherein a restaurant owner sued a college when the college issued a new policy forbidding students from patronizing establishments not owned by the college.

==Facts==
Around September 1, 1911, J.S. Gott—a businessman in [[Berea, Kentucky]]—purchased a restaurant located across a street from [[Berea College]]. A restaurant had been at that location for some years, and primarily subsisted on business from students from the college. Unbeknownst to Gott, during the 1911 summer vacation, the college authorities had revised the student code. Previously, the student code had forbidden students from entering "any place of ill repute, liquor saloons, gambling houses" or similar places. Beginning with the fall semester, which started September 11, 1911, the college promulgated the updated student code, which forbade students from entering "eating houses and places of amusement in Berea[] not controlled by the college". The punishment for any violation was immediate dismissal. Shortly after the new code was published, some students who continued to patronize Gott's restaurant were caught and expelled.&lt;ref name=gott_205&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Gott v. Berea College|vol=161|reporter=S.W.|opinion=204|pinpoint=205–06|court=Ky.|date=1913|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044103151239?urlappend=%3Bseq=226|accessdate=January 8, 2016}} {{via|HT}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mlr_summary&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent Important Decisions|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=12|issue=6|pages=497–498|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mlr12&amp;id=513|accessdate=9 January 2016|date=April 1914|via=[[HeinOnline]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, Gott filed suit against the college, obtaining an injunction to enjoin enforcement of the rule, and initially seeking $500 in damages. He later requested an additional $1,500, claiming that the college had slandered him by telling the student body that Gott was a [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]. In the proceedings that followed, the injunction was dissolved, and the Gott's petition was ultimately dismissed. He appealed the dismissal.&lt;ref name=gott_205 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mlr_summary /&gt;

==Judgment==
The court acknowledged that Gott's business had been much reduced after the rule was effected but the question was whether the college's actions were unlawful.  The court first determined that because Berea College was acting [[in loco parentis]], the college did have the authority to issue the rule and that students at the college were obligated to conform their behavior to the rule since a "...college or university may prescribe [[requirement]]s for [[University and college admissions|admission]] and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student impliedly agrees to conform to such rules of government."

The court noted that a [[US public institution|public institution]], one supported "from the public treasure" had more exacting criteria to meet but since Berea College was a private institution, the above implied [[contract]] between student and college was sufficient.

Next the court reviewed the relationship between Gott and Berea College to determine if there was a contractual relationship which the college had broken but found none.  Finally, the court reviewed the question of unreasonable, malicious, or wrongful [[restraint of trade]] by the actions of the college but could find no evidence of such.

Shown here is a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] recharging]]

'''Government incentives for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles''' have been established by several national governments and local authorities around the world as a financial incentives to [[plug-in electric vehicle]] vehicles to consumers. These mainly include tax exemptions and [[tax credit]]s, and additional perks that range from access to bus lanes to waivers on fees (charging, parking, tolls, etc.).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/GlobalEVOutlook2017.pdf|title=Global EV Outlook 2007: Two million and counting.|last=|first=|date=2017-10-07|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of these incentives usually depend on [[Electric-vehicle battery|battery]] size and the vehicle all-electric range, and some countries extend the benefits to [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles. The [[Institute of Economic Affairs|IEA]] determined that, as of 2016, 0.2% of all passenger vehicles (approximately 2 million) currently on the road worldwide are electric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation|title=Which Countries Have the Best Incentives for EV Purchases?|url=https://www.fleetcarma.com/countries-best-incentives-ev.purchases/|publisher=Fleetcarma|accessdate=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's total final consumption of energy by sector represented 9,426 Million [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Tonnes of Oil Equivalent]] (Mtoe) in 2014, 28% of which is attributed to transport alone, accounting for an increase of 5% from 1971 statistics.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorldEnergyTrends.pdf|title=Excerpt from: World energy balances|last=|first=|date=2017-10-07|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 23% of energy-related [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gas (GHG)]] emissions worldwide are also attributable to transport.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Thus, the electrification of the transport sector represents an area of opportunity for governments to cut their GHG emissions,&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; which is why they are starting to champion policies that increase plug-in hybrid electric vehicles adoption rates.

The Chinese government adopted a plan in 2009 with the goal of turning the country into one of the leaders of all-electric and [[hybrid vehicle]]s by 2012. The government's intention was to create a world-leading industry that would produce jobs and exports, and to reduce urban pollution and its oil dependence. However, a study found that even though local air pollution would be reduced by replacing a gasoline car with a similar-size electric car, it would reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by only 19%, as China uses coal for 75% of its electricity production.&lt;ref name=NYTChina&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/business/global/02electric.html|title=China Vies to Be World's Leader in Electric Cars|publisher=The New York Times|first=Keith|last=Bradsher|date=2009-04-01|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government uses the term [[new energy vehicle]]s (NEVs) to designate plug-in electric vehicles, and only pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are subject to purchase incentives.&lt;ref name=NEVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNEWSCHINESE/Resources/3196537-1202098669693/EV_Report_en.pdf|title=The China New Energy Vehicles Program - Challenges and Opportunities |author=PRTM Management Consultants, Inc.|publisher=[[World Bank]]|date=April 2011|accessdate=2013-04-22}} ''See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v''&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 2010, the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] government announced a trial program to provide incentives up to 60,000 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]]  (~{{USD|9,281}} in June 2011) for private purchase of new [[battery electric vehicle]]s and 50,000 yuan  (~{{USD|7,634}} in June 2011) for [[plug-in hybrid]]s in five cities.&lt;ref name=EdmondsCh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/06/china-announces-plan-to-subsidize-evs-and-plug-in-hybrids-in-five-major-cities.html |title=China Announces Plan to Subsidize EVs and Plug-in Hybrids in Five Major Cities |publisher=[[Edmunds.com]] |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605040731/http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/06/china-announces-plan-to-subsidize-evs-and-plug-in-hybrids-in-five-major-cities.html |archivedate=2010-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0610&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/china-to-start-pilot-program-providing-subsidies-for-electric-cars-and-hybrids/|title=China to Start Pilot Program, Providing Subsidies for Electric Cars and Hybrids|publisher=New York Times|date=2010-06-02|accessdate=2010-06-02 | first=Jim | last=Motavalli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities participating in the pilot program are [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Hefei]] and [[Changchun]]. The subsidies are paid directly to automakers rather than consumers, but the government expects that vehicle prices will be reduced accordingly. The amount of the subsidy will be reduced once 50,000 units are sold.&lt;ref name=EdmondsCh/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0610/&gt; In addition to the subsidy, the Chinese government is planning to introduce, beginning on January 1, 2012, an exemption from annual taxes for pure electric, fuel-cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Hybrid vehicles will be eligible for a 50% reduction only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2011-06/20/content_12731970.htm|title=Taxes slashed to cut emissions|last=Han |first=Tianyang|work=[[China Daily]]|date=2011-06-20|accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, only 8,159 electric cars were sold in China despite a 120,000 yuan subsidy.
Unsubsidized lead-acid EVs are produced without government approval at a rate of more than 30,000 per year in [[Shandong]] and requires no driving license because the top speed is less than 50&amp;nbsp;km/h. They cost 31,600 yuan and have been the target of criticism from major car manufacturers.&lt;ref name=reuShi&gt;{{cite news |first1=Fang |last1=Yan |first2=Ken |last2=Wills |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/19/us-china-mini-ev-idUSBRE83I0CZ20120419 |title=Mini electric cars fill gap in China as official EVs sputter |publisher=[[Reuters]] |location=US |date=2012-04-19 |access-date=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-September joint announcement in 2013 by the National Development and Reform Commission and finance, science, and industry ministries confirmed that the central government will provide a maximum of {{USD|9,800}} toward the purchase of an all-electric passenger vehicle and up to {{USD|81,600}} for an electric bus. The subsidies are part of the government's efforts to address China's problematic air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China announces new electric car subsidy program|url=http://www.chinaeconomicreview.com/node/64577|accessdate=2013-09-18|newspaper=China Economic Review|date=2013-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217055135/http://www.chinaeconomicreview.com/node/64577#|archive-date=2013-12-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the government support and new incentives issued in 2014, production of new energy vehicles between January and August reached 31,137 units, up 328% from the same period of 2013. Domestic production during the first eight months of 2014 includes 6,621 plug-in hybrid sedans and 16,276 all-electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2014/09-07/133426.shtml|title=China's Jan.-Aug. NEV production up 328 percent |last=Gu |first=Liping|work=Xinhua|publisher=ECNS|date=2014-09-07|accessdate=2014-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, to further electric vehicle production, China passed measures to greatly increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.  Original policy declared that companies with vehicles sales of over 30,000 vehicles must comply with new rules around NEVs.  Each company was required to fulfill a number of NEV credits, as much as 8% by the year 2018.  This target was later pushed to 2019, with a requirement of 12% by 2020.  These credits are granted by the fuel efficiency and weight of the vehicles, so more fuel efficient vehicles count for more credits.  Originally, these credits were granted according to the vehicles' range, however the final policy provided a more continuous way of determine credits.  The breakdown of credits in the original proposal are given below:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Proposed Credit Policy
!Electric Range (km)
!Per-vehicle credit
|-
|'''80-150'''
|2
|-
|'''150-250'''
|3
|-
|'''250-350'''
|4
|-
|'''≥ 350'''
|5
|}
In the final policy, credits were instead given by the formula: (0.012 × electric range + 0.8) × adjustment factor.  These credits were capped at 6.  Additionally, these credits can be bought and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/China-NEV-mandate_ICCT-policy-update_20032018_vF-updated.pdf |title=China’s New Energy Vehicle Mandate Policy (Final Rule) |publisher=International Council on Clean Transportation |date=January 2018 |access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, to further promote energy-efficient electric vehicles, China raised subsidies for electric vehicles meeting additional range requirements.  Electric vehicle incentives for cars with at least 400 km of range increased from 44,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, while vehicles with less than 150 km of range have been removed from the list of vehicles qualifying for an incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/china-raises-subsidies-to-reward-longer-traveling-electric-cars|title=China Raises Subsidies to Reward Longer Range Electric Cars|last=|first=|date=2018-02-13 |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes were also made to the incentive structure for electric buses and trucks.  Buses are now required to have a range of at least 150 km and have energy consumption of less than 0.7 Wh/km·kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/China-NEV_ICCT_policy-update_17052017_vF.pdf |title=Adjustment to subsidies for New Energy Vehicles in China |publisher=International Council on Clean Transportation |date=May 2017 |access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the Government of India (GoI), through the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy]] (MNRE), announced a subsidy of {{currency|950|INR}} million for electric vehicles. The subsidy provided benefits up to 20% on the ex-factory price, with a maximum benefit of {{currency|100,000|INR}} on electric cars, {{currency|4,000|INR}} on two-wheelers, {{currency|5,000|INR}} on high speed two-wheelers, {{currency|400,000|INR}} for electric minibuses, and {{currency|60,000|INR}} for three-wheelers. To claim the subsidy, manufacturers needed to certify that 30% of the components were made in India. The scheme ended on 31 March 2012.&lt;ref name=IndiaSalesDrop&gt;{{cite news |title=Electric vehicles sales drop after subsidy scheme ends |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-06-18/news/32299423_1_subsidy-scheme-cash-subsidy-sohinder-gill |accessdate=2015-01-14 |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IndiaApproves&gt;{{cite news |title=India Approves Incentives for Electric Vehicles |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-22/india-approves-incentives-for-electric-vehicles-update1-.html |accessdate=2015-01-14 |work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] |date=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IndiaSubsidyWall&gt;{{cite news |title=How India's e-vehicle dream crashed into the subsidy wall |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/how-india-s-e-vehicle-dream-crashed-into-the-subsidy-wall-114082600021_1.html |accessdate=2015-01-14 |work=[[Business Standard]] |date=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the Indian government announced a new plan to provide subsidies for hybrid and electric vehicles. The plan will have subsidies up to {{currency|150,000|INR}} for cars and {{currency|30,000|INR}} on two-wheelers. India aims to have seven million electric vehicles on the road by 2020.&lt;ref name=IndiaNewPlan&gt;{{cite news |title=Boost for electric and hybrid cars with Rs 1.5 Lakh subsidy |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/boost-for-electric-and-hybrid-cars-with-rs-1-5-lakh-subsidy/99/ |accessdate=2015-01-14 |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no subsidy or incentive for hybrids and imported vehicles, which acts as a deterrent to new entrants. To meet the stated GoI objectives under the Paris Accord, the GoI has set deadline for 'Only Electric Vehicle (Manufacturing)' by 2030. Although highly ambitious as it may seem, there is growing recognition among policy makers to incentivise electric vehicle manufacturing under the 'Make In India ' policy, and a new framework policy for this was to be released by year end, 2017. Moreover, infrastructure for electric vehicle charging is also being considered; provided either through existing energy retailers like fuel pumps or by subsidising manufacturers' investments in the field.

Tesla Motors has been offered tax incentives and potential financial backing via Special Purpose Vehicles ('SPV's) to establish a domestic manufacturing unit in India. Although, there are local sourcing norms of 30%, electric vehicle entrants have been exempted. Yet much will depends on governments plan to subsidise the vehicle, due their high upfront cost,  that will determine any potential shift in the market.

According to an [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] report, India is regarded as a country providing the least subsidies, compared to other major markets, to renewable energy in electric vehicle and that may hamper the governments target of achieving the all electric target by 2030.

Various state governments and cities provide their own subsidies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Vehicle India |url=https://www.tekes.fi/globalassets/global/ohjelmat-ja-palvelut/ohjelmat/eve/selvitykset/finpro_electric_mobility_in_india_2013.pdf |first1=Rekha |last1=Salvi |first2=Sreehari B. |last2=Nambiar |publisher=[[Tekes (agency)|Tekes: Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation]] |accessdate=2015-01-14 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Lakshadweep don't levy [[Value added tax|VAT]]
* Chandigarh, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat &amp; West Bengal offer partial rebate on VAT
* Delhi also provides a 15% subsidy of the base price of select electric cars, like [[REVAi|REVA]]. It also exempts such cars from road tax and registration fees.

The Japanese government introduced the first electric vehicle incentive program in 1996, and it was integrated in 1998 with the Clean Energy Vehicles Introduction Project, which provided subsidies and tax discounts for the purchase of [[electric vehicle|electric]], [[natural gas vehicle|natural gas]], [[methanol fuel|methanol]] and [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s. The project provided a purchase subsidy of up to 50% the incremental costs of a clean energy vehicle as compared with the price of a conventional engine vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evaap.org/pdf/incentive.pdf|title=Incentives for EV &amp; HEV|date=October 2003|publisher=Electric Vehicle Association of Asia Pacific|accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program was extended until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Max |last=Ahman|title=Government policy and the development of electric vehicles in Japan|journal=Energy Policy|date=March 2006|pages=433–443|issue=34|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2004.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea ===

In July 2016, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced a plan to make electric car batteries run longer, build a network of charging stations and make electric car purchases and ownership more affordable. The government expects that the current and future policy programs will help increase the electric car market share in South Korea to 0.5% in 2017, up from 0.2% in 2015, and to achieve 5.3% in 2020.&lt;ref name=Korea2020&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bna.com/south-korea-formulates-n73014444008/ | title=South Korea Formulates Ambitious Plan to Promote E-Cars | first=James | last=Lim | work=Blomberg BNA | date=2016-07-10 | accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government subsidy has in place a one-time purchase subsidy for electric cars.  Effective July 8, 2016, the subsidy was increased to 14 million won ({{USD|12,100}}) from 12 million won ({{USD|10,400}}). Also starting in 2016, the purchase tax surcharges of electric cars will be reduced, and all-electric car drivers will benefit from reductions in insurance premiums, expressway tolls and parking fees. The government plan calls for the deployment of fast charging stations in 2020 to be available at an average of one within a two-kilometer radius in the capital city of Seoul. In addition, 30,000 slow charging stations will be strategically located at about 4,000 apartment complexes nationwide by 2020.&lt;ref name=Korea2020/&gt;

The government's plan also includes the development of an electric car battery, beginning in 2016, with energy density high enough to more than double the travel distance on a charge to {{Convert|400|km|abbr=on}}. The government expects to increase the global market share of South Korean electric cars to match that of South Korean gasoline and diesel cars, which reached 8.5% based on sales by South Korea's two main car exporters, [[Hyundai Motor Company]] and [[Kia Motors]].&lt;ref name=Korea2020/&gt;

{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicles in France|Bonus-malus#French taxation|l1=French bonus-malus}}
Since 2008 France has a [[bonus-malus]] system offering a financial incentive, or bonus, for the purchase of cars with low [[carbon emissions]], and a fee, or malus, for the purchase of high-emission vehicles. The bonus applies to private and company vehicles purchased on or after 5 December 2007 and are deduced from the purchase price of the vehicle. The malus penalty applies to all vehicles registered after 1 January 2008, and is added at the time of registration. Since 2009, every family with more than two children receives a deduction from the malus of 20 g of {{CO2}} per km per child.&lt;ref name=EUenvironTax&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1398/ETR_in_Europe_-_Annex_2_3_4.pdf | title=Environmental Tax Reform in Europe: Opportunities for the Future | publisher=[[Institute for European Environmental Policy]] (IEEP) | date=2014-05-30 | accessdate=2016-10-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009191722/http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1398/ETR_in_Europe_-_Annex_2_3_4.pdf | archivedate=2016-10-09 | df= }}'' See Chapter 3 - Car Registration Tax ('Bonus-Malus' system) in France pp. 15-21.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective on August 1, 2012, the government increased the bonus for electric cars up to {{euro|7,000}} but capped at 30% of the vehicle price including [[VAT]]. The price includes any battery leasing charges, and therefore, electric cars which need a battery leasing contract also are eligible for the bonus. For example, an electric car sold for {{euro|23,333}} including VAT was eligible for the maximum bonus of {{euro|7000}}. The emission level for the maximum bonus was raised to 20 g/km or less. Cars with emission levels between 20 and 50 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to {{euro|5,000}}, and between 50 and 60 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to {{euro|4,500}}.

;2017
{{As of|2016|09}}, the government proposal to be in force from 1 January 2017 provides that the {{euro|10,000}} super-bonus for scrapping a diesel vehicle over 10 years-old will be renewed. However, the bonus for the purchase of a pure electric car will drop to {{euro|6000}} from {{euro|6300}} in 2016, but to compensate, the additional scrappage bonus will be increased to {{euro|4000}} from {{euro|3700}} in 2016. Also, the government plans to introduce a purchase price cap to the vehicles eligible for the bonus, and to introduce a new bonus for two-wheeled motor vehicles. For the more polluting vehicles, the government intends to increase the maximum malus fee to {{euro|10000}} from {{euro|8000}} in 2016 for vehicles emitting more than 191 g/km, lowering the limit from 200 g/km in 2016.&lt;ref name=bonus2017&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avem.fr/actualite-projet-de-loi-de-finances-2017-decryptage-6212.html | title= Projet de loi de finances 2017 : décryptage |language=French | trans-title= Bill 2017 Finance: deciphering |first=Tiphaine |last=Leurent |publisher= Association pour l'Avenir du Véhicule Electrique Méditerranéen (AVEM)|date=2016-09-29 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government intends to maintain the  {{euro|1000}} purchase bonus for plug-in hybrids with a {{CO2}} emission level between 21 and 60 g/km. However, the proposal does not include anything about the conversion premium for scrapping a 10-year-old diesel car for the purchase of a plug-in hybrid.

The private use of a company car is treated as taxable income in Germany and measured at a flat monthly rate of 1% of the vehicle's gross list price. So plug-in electric cars have been at a disadvantage since their price tag can be as much as double that of a car using a conventional internal combustion engine due to the high cost of the battery. In June 2013 German legislators approved a law that ends the tax disadvantage for corporate plug-in electric cars. The law, backdated to 1 January 2013, allows private users to offset the list price with {{euro|500}}  per unit of battery size, expressed in [[kilowatt hour]]s (kWh). The maximum offset was set at {{euro|10,000}} corresponding to a 20 [[kWh]] battery. The amount one can offset will sink annually by {{euro|50}} per kilowatt hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/07/germany-electricvehicles-tax-idUSL5N0EJ1Y320130607|title=Germany ends tax disadvantage for corporate electric cars |work=[[Reuters]] |date=2013-06-07|accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range criteria will rise to {{Convert|40|km|abbr=on}} starting in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/transport/berlin-approves-new-incentives-electric-car-drivers-308700|title=Berlin approves new incentives for electric car drivers|first=Daniel |last=Tost |publisher=EurActiv.com|date=2014-09-25|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the package of financial incentives approved in 2016, private owners of plug-in electric vehicles that charge their cars in their employer premises are exempted from declaring this perk as a cash benefit in their income tax return.

In August 2014, the federal government announced its plan to introduce non-monetary incentives through new legislation to be effective by 1 February 2015. The proposed user benefits include measures to privilege battery-powered cars, fuel cell vehicles and some plug-in hybrids, just like Norway does, by granting local governments the authority to allow these vehicles into bus lanes, and to offer free parking and reserved parking spaces in locations with charging points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/neuwagen/handel/articles/454644/?cmp=nl-125 |title=Förderung von Elektroautos kommt ins Rollen |language=German |trans-title=Promotion of electric cars gets rolling |author=&lt;!--Staff--&gt; |work=KFZ-betrieb |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826165602/http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/neuwagen/handel/articles/454644/?cmp=nl-125 |archivedate=2014-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2014/08/15/germany-plans-new-ev-incentives-to-spur-uptake/|title=Germany plans new EV incentives to spur uptake |first=Faye |last=Sunderland|work=The Green Car Website UK|date=2014-08-15|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all plug-in hybrids will qualify for the benefits, only those with {{CO2}} emissions of no more than 50 g/km or an [[all-electric range]] of over {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} are eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-24/germany-proposes-free-parking-to-spur-electric-car-sales |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140925011901/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-24/germany-proposes-free-parking-to-spur-electric-car-sales |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-09-25 |title=Germany Proposes Free Parking to Spur Electric-Car Sales |first=Stefan |last=Nicola |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the fourth progress report of the German National Electric Mobility Platform, only about 24,000 plug-in electric cars are on German roads by the end of November 2014, well behind the target of 100,000 unit goal set for 2014. As a result, Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] recognized in December 2014 that the government has to provide more incentives to meet the goal of having 1 million electric cars on the country's roads by 2020. Among others, and based on the recommendations of the report, the federal government is considering to offer a tax break for zero-emission company cars, more subsidies to expand charging infrastructure, particularly to deploy more public fast chargers, and more public funding for research and development of the next generation of rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref name=GERincentives2014&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-12-02/merkel-backs-incentives-in-1-million-electric-cars-push |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141207130846/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-12-02/merkel-backs-incentives-in-1-million-electric-cars-push |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-12-07 |title=Merkel Backs Incentives in Push for a Million Electric Cars |first1=Brian |last1=Parkin |first2=Dorothee |last2=Tschampa |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=2014-12-02 |accessdate=2014-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/the-future-is-electric-or-is-it/a-18108847|title=The future is electric - or is it?|first=Sabine |last=Kinkartz|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2014-12-03|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Purchase incentive

At the beginning of 2016, German politicians from the three parties in Mrs. Merkel's ruling coalition and auto executives began talks to introduce a subsidy for green car buyers worth up to {{euro|5000}} ({{USD|5500}}) to boost sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20160129/ANE/160129831/germany-will-mull-5000-euro-incentive-for-ev-plug-in-hybrid-sales | title=Germany considers $5,500 incentive for electric cars | work=[[Reuters]] | publisher= [[Automotive News|Automotive News Europe]] |date=2016-01-29 |accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|02}}, the German government proposal is for the auto industry to cover 40% of the cost of the purchase subsidy.

An incentive scheme to promote plug-in electric vehicle adoption was approved in April 2016 with a budget of {{euro|1 billion}} ({{USD|1.13 billion}}). A total of {{euro|600 million}} ({{USD|678 million}})  is reserved for the purchase subsidies, which are expected to run until all the money is disbursed, estimated to last until 2019 at the latest. Another {{euro|300 million}} ({{USD|339 million}}) are budgeted to finance the deployment of charging stations in cities and on autobahn highway stops. And another {{euro|100 million}} ({{USD|113 million}}) would go toward purchasing electric cars for federal government fleets. The program is aimed to promote the sale of 400,000 electric vehicles. The cost of the purchase incentive is shared equally between the government and automakers. Electric car buyers get a {{euro|4000}} ({{USD|4520}}) discount while buyers of plug-in hybrid vehicles get a discount of {{euro|3000}} ({{USD|3390}}). Premium cars, such as the [[Tesla Model S]] and [[BMW i8]], are not eligible to the incentive because there is a cap of {{euro|60,000}} ({{USD|67800}}) for the purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-germany-discount-idINKCN0XO1Y4 | title=Germany to launch 1 billion-euro discount scheme for electric car buyers | first=Andreas | last=Cremer | work=[[Reuters]] | date=2016-04-27 | accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/germany-subsidy-boost-electric-car-sales | title=Germany to give €1bn subsidy to boost electric car sales |author=Agence France-Presse | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2016-04-28 | accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/wirtschaft/articles/531213/?cmp=nl-125&amp;uuid=B225CA8F-E6F9-464D-9839-BAB0E10881B8 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20160616183533/http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/wirtschaft/articles/531213/?cmp=nl-125&amp;uuid=B225CA8F-E6F9-464D-9839-BAB0E10881B8 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-06-16 |title=Bis zu 4.000 Euro Förderung für Elektroautos |language=German |trans-title=Up to 4,000 euros in funding for electric cars |author=&lt;!--Staff--&gt; |work=KFZ-betrieb |date=2016-04-27 |accessdate=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only electric vehicles purchased after 18 May 2016 are eligible for the bonus and the owner must keep the new electric car at least nine months.

The [[Electricity Supply Board|ESB]] eCar electric vehicle charging network serves as the main charging network for the island of Ireland and has rapidly expanded in recent years. Currently the network is free to use with an RFID card provided by ESB to EV owners who wish to use the network. The network aims to provide rapid charging every 30&amp;nbsp;km on major routes and as of 2015 has almost 2000 standard charging points (all provide connection via [[IEC 62196]] Type 2 Mennekes, around half are 22&amp;nbsp;kW with the remainder a mix of 3.6&amp;nbsp;kW and 7.4&amp;nbsp;kW).

Other factors contributing to the rapid adoption of plug-in electric vehicles are the relative small size of the country, which reduces [[range anxiety]] (the Netherlands stretches about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} east to west); a long tradition of environmental activism; high gasoline prices ({{USD|8.50}} per gallon as of January 2013), which make the cost of running a car on electricity five times cheaper; and also some EV leasing programs provide free or discounted gasoline-powered vehicles for those who want to take a vacation driving long distances. With all of these incentives and tax breaks, plug-in electric cars have similar driving costs to conventional cars.&lt;ref name=NYT02913/&gt;

Government officials reserved in 1999 the "EL" prefix for exclusive use of all-electric vehicles in order to be able to enforce on the road the benefits available to EVs. As the "EL" series is set to end at "EL 99999" ([[Vehicle registration plates of Norway#Prefixes and sequence numbers|most vehicles in the country have five-digit registration numbers between 10000 and 99999]]), the Norwegian Public Roads agency opted for the prefix "EK" in the second series of plates, to signify "''elektrisk kjøretøy''", Norwegian for electric vehicle. And because the sale of electric vehicles is expected to continue at a rapid pace, meaning that the second phase of license plates is likely to run out as well, the "EV" prefix has been set aside for future electric cars.&lt;ref name=NorskEK&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2015/08/28/electric-car-craze-keeps-rolling-along/ |title=Electric car craze keeps rolling along |first=Nina |last=Berglund |work=News in English.no |date=2015-08-28 |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, as the stock of "EL" prefix plates was almost depleted, the first electric vehicles registered with the new "EK" series were on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dinside.no/937121/elbil-eller-ladbar-hybrid | title=Elbil eller ladbar hybrid? |language=Norwegian |trans-title=BEV or PHEV? |first=Fred Magne |last=Skillebæk |work=Dinside.no | date=2016-08-14 | accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EKseries&gt;{{cite news | url=http://norwaytoday.info/finance/first-ek-registered-e-cars-road/ | title=The first EK-registered e-cars on the road | first=Stefan | last=Jekic | work=Norway Today | date=2016-07-11 | accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until June 2013, [[plug-in hybrid]]s have not been eligible for these benefits.&lt;ref name="NorIncentives"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NORincentives"/&gt; Because the Norwegian tax system levies higher taxes to heavier vehicles, plug-in hybrids are more expensive than similar conventional cars due to the extra weight of the battery pack and its additional electric components.

In September 2013 the Norwegian Parliament approved, as part of the revised 2014 budget, an exemption from the 25% VAT for leasing electric vehicles effective on 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elbil.no/nyheter/debatt/3128-positive-elbilnyheter-i-budsjettforliket |title=Positive elbilnyheter i budsjettforliket |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Positive EV news in the budget compromise |first=Ståle |last=Frydenlund |publisher=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914045447/http://www.elbil.no/nyheter/debatt/3128-positive-elbilnyheter-i-budsjettforliket |archivedate=2014-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{as of|2014|09|lc=y}}, the exemption has not gone into effect because the [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]] decided to defer the measure, pending a formal consultation with the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] (ESA) to ensure that the VAT exemption for leasing was not in violation of the [[European Economic Area]] Agreement.

==== Phase out of incentives ====

In May 2015 the Government decided to keep the existing incentives through 2017, and the political parties in Parliament agreed to reduced and phase out some of the incentives. Beginning in January 2018, electric car owners will be required to pay half of the yearly road license fee and the full rate as of 2020. The value-added tax (VAT) exemption for electric cars will end in 2018, but replaced by a new scheme, which may be subjected to a ceiling that could be reduced as technology develops. The agreement also gave local authorities the right to decide whether electric cars can park for free and use public transport lanes.&lt;ref name=EV2018_1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/11589548/Norway-to-slash-electric-car-perks-because-its-costing-government-too-much-money.html | title=Norway to slash electric car perks because it's costing government too much money |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2015-05-07|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EV2018_2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dn.no/nyheter/politikkSamfunn/2015/05/06/2226/Bilavgifter/samarbeidspartiene-enige-om-bilavgifter | title= Samarbeidspartiene enige om bilavgifter |language=Norwegian| trans-title=Cooperative parties agreed vehicle taxes |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=2015-05-06|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the Ministry of Transport issued new regulations for parking in locations with access to the general public. The new parking regulations, that go into effect on January 1, 2017, terminated the free parking for zero-emission vehicles, but established that Municipalities can introduce payment exemption for electric and hydrogen powered motor vehicles on municipal parking locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2016-03-18-260#KAPITTEL_1 | title=Forskrift om vilkårsparkering for allmennheten og håndheving av private parkeringsreguleringer (parkeringsforskriften) | language=Norwegian | trans-title=Regulations on conditions parking for the general public and the enforcement of private parking regulations (parking regulations) |author=Ministry of Transport | publisher=LOVEDATA | accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|09}}, the city councils of [[Trondheim]] and [[Tønsberg]] decided to introduce full payment for EVs from 2017; the cities of [[Bodø]] and [[Tromsø]] will introduce payment for parking in downton but exempted parking outside the city's center; and the cities of [[Oslo]], [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]] and [[Drammen]] decided to keep free parking for zero-emission vehicles.&lt;ref name=Norsk092016&gt;{{cite web | url= http://elbil.no/mandal-forst-ute-med-fortsatt-gratis-parkering-for-elbil/ | title=Mandal først ute med fortsatt gratis parkering for elbil |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Mandal pioneered to keep free parking for electric cars | first=Petter |last=Haugneland |publisher=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) |date=2016-09-16 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elbil.no/drammen-fortsetter-med-gratis-elbilparkering/ | title=Drammen fortsetter med gratis elbilparkering |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Drammen continues with free parking for electric cars | first=Ståle |last=Frydenlundd |publisher=Norsk Elbilforening (Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association) |date=2016-09-21 |accessdate=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/8620804/ | title=I denne byen blir det slutt på gratis elbil-parkering |language=Norwegian |trans-title=This city finally gets free electric vehicle parking | first=Robin

===Portugal===
The Portuguese Government launched in early 2008 a national Programme for Electric Mobility called [[Mobi.E]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobi-e.pt/ MOBI.E - Rede Nacional de Mobilidade Eléctrica. A energia que nos move]. Mobi-e.pt (2010-06-15). Retrieved on 2010-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobi.E is deploying a national electric mobility system. The system was designed to be scalable and used in multiple geographies, overcoming the current situation of lack of communication among the different electric mobility experiences that are being deployed in Europe. By the first semester of 2011, a wide public network of 1 300 normal and 50 fast charging points will be fully implemented in the main 25 cities of the country.

EVs are fully exempt from both the Vehicle Tax due upon purchase (Imposto Sobre Veículos) and the annual Circulation Tax (Imposto Único de Circulação). Personal income tax provides an allowance of EUR 803 upon the purchase of EVs. EVs are exempt from the 5%-10% company car tax rates which are part of the Corporation Income Tax. The Budget Law provides for an increase of the depreciation costs related to the purchase of EVs for the purpose of Corporation Income Tax.

[[Portugal]] established a government subsidy of €5,000 for the first 5,000 new electric cars sold in the country. In addition, there is in place a €1,500 incentive if the consumer turns in a used car as part of the down payment for the new electric car.&lt;ref name=Portg0510&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jn.sapo.pt/blogs/velocidade/archive/2010/05/17/nissan-j-225-divulgou-pre-231-o-do-carro-el-233-ctrico-leaf.aspx|title=Nissan já divulgou preço do carro eléctrico Leaf|publisher=Journal de Notícias|date=2010-05-17|accessdate=2010-05-17|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100517184611/http%3A//jn.sapo.pt/blogs/velocidade/archive/2010/05/17/nissan%2Dj%2D225%2Ddivulgou%2Dpre%2D231%2Do%2Ddo%2Dcarro%2Del%2D233%2Dctrico%2Dleaf.aspx|archivedate=2010-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric cars are also exempt from the registration tax.&lt;ref name=ACEA3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100420_EV_tax_overview.pdf|title=Overview of Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles in the EU|publisher=[[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]]|date=2010-04-20|accessdate=2010-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611201348/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100420_EV_tax_overview.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 the Spanish government approved a {{€|72 million}} ({{USD|103 million}}) fund for year 2011 to promote electric vehicles. The incentives include direct subsidies for the acquisition of new electric cars for up to 25% of the purchase price, before tax, to a maximum of €6,000 per vehicle (US$8,600), and 25% of the gross purchase price of other electric vehicles such as buses and vans, with a maximum of €15,000 or €30,000, depending on the range and type of vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/spain-20110510.html#more|title=Government of Spain approves subsidies for purchase of electric vehicles|date=2011-05-10|publisher=Green Car Congress |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several regional government grant incentives for the purchase of [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s including electric and hybrid vehicles.

===Sweden===
In September 2011 the Swedish government approved a {{SEK|200 million}} program, effective starting in January 2012, to provide a subsidy of {{SEK|40,000}} per car for the purchase of electric cars and other "super green cars" with ultra-low carbon emissions (below 50 grams of carbon dioxide per km).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Desk|first=Lifestyle|title=Sweden Follows Suit with Electric Car Subsidy|url=http://theglobalherald.com/sweden-follows-suit-with-electric-car-subsidy/24444/|accessdate=13 September 2011|newspaper=The Global Herald|date=2011-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017103803/http://theglobalherald.com/sweden-follows-suit-with-electric-car-subsidy/24444/|archivedate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an exemption from the annual circulation tax for the first five years from the date of their first registration that benefits owners of electric vehicles with an energy consumption of 37 [[kWh]] per 100&amp;nbsp;km or less, and hybrid vehicles with {{CO2}} emissions of 120 [[g/km]] or less. In addition, for both electric and hybrid vehicles, the taxable value of the car for the purposes of calculating the benefit in kind of a company car under personal income tax is reduced by 40% compared with the corresponding or comparable gasoline- or diesel-powered car. The reduction of the taxable value has a cap of {{SEK|16,000}} per year.&lt;ref name=ACEA2/&gt;

The exemption for the first five years of ownership from the annual circulation tax is still in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bilsweden.se/fordon-i-samhallet/miljo/e10/stimulanser-for-miljobilar |title=Stimulanser för miljöbilar |language=Swedish |trans-title=Incentives for green cars |work=Bil Sweden |date=2016 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Subisdies2015_2020/&gt; In 2016, in order to promote the introduction of electricity-powered buses in the market, the Government planned to allocate {{SEK|50 million}} for 2016 and {{SEK|100 million}} per year between 2017 and 2019 to introduce an electric bus premium.&lt;ref name=Subisdies2015_2020&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.government.se/government-policy/environment/fossil-free-transport-and-travel-the-governments-work-to-reduce-the-impact-of-transport-on-the-climate/ |title=Fossil-free transport and travel: The Government's work to reduce the impact of transport on the climate |publisher=Government Offices of Sweden |date=2016-05-25 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two alternative proposals are being considered by the Swedish government regarding the introduction of a [[bonus-malus]] system. Both proposals entail changes to vehicle and car benefit taxation and the premium system for purchases of new cars. An official inquiry report was due by 29 April 2016. The goal is for the system to enter into force on 1 January 2017.&lt;ref name=Subisdies2015_2020/&gt;
The new bonus-malus system, starting 1 july 2018, will offer electric car buyers a bonus of 60 000 SEK.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/bonusmalus#166190&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
Switzerland has a car import tax which is 4% of the purchase price (before adding the VAT) which is waived for electric cars.&lt;ref name=ezv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezv.admin.ch/zollinfo_privat/04392/04393/04394/index.html?lang=de|title=Eidgenössische Zollverwaltung|date=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xtares&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xtares.admin.ch|title=swiss customs database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Switzerland]] consists of [[cantons of Switzerland|26&amp;nbsp;cantons]] which have their own legislature, additional incentives for plug-in electric vehicles differ between the respective regions. The current list can be downloaded from the website of the Swiss Department of Energy.&lt;ref name=bfe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/energieetikette/00886/02038/index.html?lang=de&amp;dossier_id=02083|title=Bundesamt für Energie|date=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no additional incentives on the actual purchase price, but some cantons offer road tax cuts. The Swiss road tax is a yearly recurring fixed amount calculated based on the specifications of the tax payers car. Currently, only the cantons [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] (GL), [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] (SO), [[Ticino]] (TI) and [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]] (ZH) are completely waiving the tax for plug-in electric vehicles.

;Calculation example for [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]]

Based on a usual car with the following specification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stva.zh.ch/internet/sicherheitsdirektion/stva/de/StVAgeb/GEBva14/VArechner.html|title=Verkehrsabgabenrechner|work=zh.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engine: 2 L
* Total weight: 1800&amp;nbsp;kg
* Energy efficiency: C
* Year: 2013

The resulting tax to be paid per year will be {{CHF|278}}. Hence when calculating with a life expectancy of 10 years, the car owner in this example might save around {{CHF|2,780}} when buying a plug-in electric car.

However, since the [[Fuel tax|tax on fossil fuels]] are relatively high in all European countries, including Switzerland, there is still an indirect, but quite strong incentive for car buyers to decide for energy efficient vehicles.

Based on the following examples:
* Fuel economy: {{Convert|7.8|L/100km|mpgUS|abbr=on}} unleaded
* Driving habits: {{Convert|15000|km|abbr=on}} per year
* Fuel tax: {{CHF| 0.7312}} per liter ({{CHF|2.7679}} per gallon)
* Carbon tax (since January 1, 2014): {{CHF|0.1414}} per liter ({{CHF|0.5353}} per gallon)

The resulting taxes on the burned fuels will be around {{CHF|1,021}} per year, which results in {{CHF|10,210}} over the car's 10-year lifetime.

====Plug-in Car Grant====

The Plug-in Car Grant started on 1 January 2011 and is available across the UK. The program reduces the up-front cost of eligible cars by providing a 25% grant towards the cost of new plug-in cars capped at {{GBP|5,000}} ({{USD|7450}}).&lt;ref name=GCC0210/&gt;&lt;ref name=DfT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-car-grant/plug-in-car-grant-vehicles |title=Plug-in car grant eligibility guidance |publisher=[[Department for Transport]] |date=February 2015 |accessdate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216174641/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-car-grant/plug-in-car-grant-vehicles |archivedate=2015-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 April 2015, the purchase price cap was raised to cover up to 35% discount of the vehicle's recommended retail price, up to the already existing {{GBP|5,000}} limit.

* Warranty: Vehicles must have a 3-year or {{Convert|60,000|mi}} vehicle warranty (guarantee) and a 3-year battery and electric drive train warranty, with the option of extending the battery warranty for an extra 2 years('drive train' means the parts that send power from the engine to the wheels. These include the clutch, transmission (gear box), drive shafts, U-joints and differential).
* Battery performance: Vehicles must have either a minimum 5-year warranty on the battery and electric drive train as standard, or extra evidence of battery performance to show reasonable performance after 3 years of use
* Electrical safety: Vehicles must comply with certain regulations (UN-ECE Reg 100.01) that show that they are electrically safe.
* Crash safety: To make sure cars will be safe in a crash, they must either have: EC whole vehicle type approval (EC WVTA, not small series) or evidence that the car has appropriate levels of safety as judged by international standards.

In February 2015 the government announced that to take account of rapidly developing technology, and the growing range of ULEVs on the British market, the criteria for the plug-in car grant was updated and from April 2015, eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of the following categories depending on emission levels and zero-emission-capable mileage, with a technology neutral approach, which means that [[fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell cars]] are also eligible for the grant:&lt;ref name=DfT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grant2015/&gt;
* Category 1: {{CO2}} emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range of at least {{Convert|70|mi|abbr=on}}.
* Category 2: {{CO2}} emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range between {{Convert|10|to|69|mi|abbr=on}}.
* Category 3: {{CO2}} emissions of 50-75g/km and a zero emission range of at least {{Convert|20|mi|abbr=on}}.

In December 2015, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced that Plug-in car grant was extended until March 2018 to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy cleaner vehicles. A total funding of {{GBP|400 million}} (~{{USD|600 million}}) is available for the extension. To reflect the changes in the British market, the criteria for the Plug-in Car Grant was updated and the maximum grant drops from {{GBP|5,000}} (~{{USD|7,450}}) to {{GBP|4,500}} (~{{USD|6,700}}). For the extension, the amount of the grant is linked in directly with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles three vehicle categories issued in April 2015. The eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of three categories depending on emission levels ({{CO2}} emissions bands between 50 and 75g/km) and zero-emission-capable mileage (minimum of {{Convert|10|mi|abbr=on}}), with a technology neutral approach, which means that [[fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell cars]] are eligible for the grant.&lt;ref name=Grant2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Extension2018&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/plug-in-car-grant-extended-to-2018 |title=Plug-in car grant extended to 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2015-12-17|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Extension2018_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextgreencar.com/news/7409/extension-announced-for-plugin-car-grant/ |title=Extension announced for Plug-in Car Grant|first=Chris |last=Lilly|publisher=Next Green Car|location=UK |date=2015-12-17|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated scheme went into force on 1 March 2016.&lt;ref name=Extension2018_2/&gt;

A price cap is in place, with all Category 1 plug-in vehicles eligible for the full grant no matter what their purchase price, while Category 2 and 3 models with a list price of more than {{GBP|60000}} (~{{USD|90000}}) are eligible for the grant. Vehicles with a zero-emission range of at least {{Convert|70|mi|abbr=on}} (category 1), including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, get a full {{GBP|4,500}} (~{{USD|6,700}}), but plug-in hybrids (categories 2 and 3) costing under {{GBP|60000}} (~{{USD|90000}}) receive {{GBP|2500}} (~{{USD|3725}}).&lt;ref name=Extension2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Extension2018_2/&gt; Under the extended scheme, some plug-in hybrid sports car are no longer be eligible for the grant, such as the [[BMW i8]] because of its {{GBP|100000}} (~{{USD|150,000}}) purchase price tag.&lt;ref name=Extension2018_3&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-3364184/Plug-car-grant-extended-plug-hybrid-buyers-receive-half-saving.html |title=Plug-in car grant extended to 2018 but hybrid buyers will now receive half as much as before towards new vehicles|first=Robert |last=Hull |work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=2015-12-17|accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant scheme will come under review when a cumulative total of 40,000 Category 1 claims, and 45,000 Category 2 and 3 combined sales have been made.

In addition to the extension of the Plug-in Grant, the government also announced it will continue the "Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme." Starting in March 2016 owners of ultra-low emission vehicles who install a dedicated charge point at their home, covering roughly half the average cost, will get {{GBP|500}} (~{{USD|750}}) towards the cost of installing the charging point, rather than the previous {{GBP|700}} (~{{USD|1050}}) maximum.&lt;ref name=Extension2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Extension2018_2/&gt;

====Plug-in Van Grant====
[[File:Vito E-Cell trimmed.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Mercedes-Benz Vito E-Cell]] is eligible for the Plug-In Van Grant.]]

The Plug-In Car Grant began in February 2012. Van buyers can receive 20% - up to {{GBP|8000}} - off the cost of a plug-in van. To be eligible for the scheme, vans have to meet performance criteria to ensure safety, range, and ultra-low tailpipe emissions. Consumers, both business and private will receive the discount at the point of purchase.&lt;ref name=UKPIVan/&gt; The Plug-In Van Grant scheme was extended in October 2016 to make electric trucks above 3.5 tonnes eligible for grants of up to {{GBP|20,000}}, when businesses switch their large trucks to an electric vehicle.

====Plugged-in Places====
On 19 November 2009, [[Andrew Adonis]], the [[Secretary of State for Transport]], announced a scheme called "Plugged-in-Places", making available £30 million to be shared between three and six cities to investigate further the viability of providing power supply for electric vehicles, and encouraging local government and business to participate and bid for funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/news/2009/11/thousands-of-electric-car-charging-points-due-189176

====London congestion charge====
[[Battery electric vehicles|All-electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) and eligible [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs) qualify for a 100% discount from the [[London congestion charge]]. A plug-in electric drive vehicle qualifies if the vehicle is registered with the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) and has a fuel type of 'electric', or alternatively, if the vehicle is a 'plug-in hybrid' and is on the Government's list of PHEVs eligible for the OLEV grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions?intcmp=4368|title=Discounts and exemptions - Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED)|publisher=[[Transport for London]] |date=February 2015|accessdate=2015-02-15}} ''Click on "Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED)" for details.''&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015|02}}, approved PHEVs include all extended-range cars such as the [[BMW i3 REx|BMW i3 with range extender]] and [[Vauxhall Ampera]], and plug-in hybrids that emit 75g/km or less of {{CO2}} and that meet the [[Euro 5]] standard for air quality, such as the [[Audi A3 Sportback e-tron]], [[BMW i8]], [[Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV]], and [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goultralow.com/what-are-go-ultra-low-cars/types-of-vehicles/plug-in-hybrid/|title=Vehicle technologies - Plug-in hybrids|publisher=Go Ultra Low|date=February 2015|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Greener Vehicle Discount was substituted by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) scheme that went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and meets the [[Euro 5]] emission standards for air quality. {{As of|2013|07}} there are no [[internal combustion]]-only vehicles that meet this criteria. The measure is designed to limit the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads. [[Mayor Boris Johnson]] approved the new scheme in April 2013, after taking into account a number of comments received during the 12-week public consultation that took place. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year [[Sunset provision|sunset period]] (until 24 June 2016) before they have to pay the full congestion charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/04/uled-20130424.html |title=London to introduce new Ulta Low Emission Discount for Congestion Charge scheme; countering dieselization |publisher=Green Car Congress  |date=2013-04-24 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/24/pollution|title=London tightens up congestion charge in attempt to drive out diesel |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2013-04-24|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2013/07/01/london-tightens-congestion-charge-exemptions/ |title=London tightens Congestion Charge exemptions |first=Faye |last=Sunderland |publisher=The Green Car Website |location=UK |date=2013-07-01 |accessdate=2013-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216062939/http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2013/07/01/london-tightens-congestion-charge-exemptions/ |archivedate=2015-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23125082|title=New green discount for the congestion charge comes in |work=[[BBC News]]|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Former rebate program
The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) established the Electric Vehicle Incentive Program (EVIP) – later renamed the Electric and Hydrogen Vehicle Incentive Program (EHVIP) {{endash}} in 2010. To qualify, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) had to be purchased or leased from a seller in Ontario and owned or leased for at least 12 months. Leased vehicles with 12 month terms received 33% of the incentive, 24-month lease terms received 66%, and lease terms 36 months or longer received the full incentive. Vehicles were required to be on a government-developed list of approved vehicles to qualify, and vehicles with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of {{CAD|75,000}} or greater were not eligible for the incentive. Electric vehicles with a battery size of 5 -16 kWh were eligible for incentives from {{CAD|6000}} to {{CAD|10,000}}. Vehicles with a battery size exceeding 16 kWh qualified for {{CAD|9000}} to {{CAD|13,000}}. Vehicles with five or more seats were eligible for an additional {{CAD|1000}}. Demonstration vehicles under a specified mileage and used exclusively for test drives at dealerships or leasing companies were also eligible. Applications for incentives were required to be submitted within 3 months of the vehicle's provincial registration. Prior to the cancellation of the program, the Government of Ontario included rebates of up to {{CAD|14000}} for electric and hybrid vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/vehicles/electric/electric-vehicle-rebate.shtml |title=Eligible Electric Vehicles |publisher=Ministry of Transportation |location=[[Ontario]] |date=2017-12-14 |access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EHVIP was financed by proceeds from Ontario's participation with Quebec and California in the [[Western Climate Initiative]] (WCI) cap-and-trade program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/vehicles/electric/electric-vehicle-incentive-program.shtml |title=Electric vehicles incentive program |publisher=Ministry of Transportation |location=[[Ontario]] |date=2017-02-01 |access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The program (and the companion incentive program to encourage private businesses to install charging stations) was cancelled on July 11, 2018 after the government of Premier [[Doug Ford]] began the withdrawal of Ontario from the WCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ontario government ends electric and hydrogen vehicle incentive programs |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-electric-hydrogen-vehicle-charging-incentive-program-ends-1.4743579 |work=CBC News |date=2018-07-11 |access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebates will still be issued for vehicles if either of the following conditions are met: the vehicle was delivered to the consumer, registered, and plated on or before July 11; or the vehicle is currently in the inventory of a dealership or was ordered from the manufacturer on or before July 11, provided that the vehicle is delivered to the consumer, registered, and plated by September 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Maronese |first1=Nicholas |title=Ontario’s EV rebate goes away by September 10 |url=https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/ontarios-ev-rebate-goes-away-by-september-10 |work=Driving |publisher=Postmedia Network |date=2018-07-12 |access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric vehicles in Ontario are eligible for special license plates, officially called Green Vehicle License Plates, from the Ministry of Transportation. In addition to a green colour scheme distinct from the province's typical blue and white license plates, these green plates permit BEV and PHEV owners to travel in the province's [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|high-occupancy vehicle]] (HOV) and travel at no cost in the [[High-occupancy toll lane|high-occupancy toll]] (HOT) lanes, regardless of the number of passengers in the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goddard |first1=John |title=Going green has perks for drivers |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/personal_finance/spending_saving/2011/09/02/going_green_has_perks_for_drivers.html |work=Toronto Star |date=2011-09-02 |access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ontario's Green Vehicle Licence Plate Program |url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/vehicles/electric/green-licence-plate.shtml |website=Ministry of Transportation |publisher=Government of Ontario |accessdate=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quebec====

[[Quebec]] began offering rebates of up to {{CAD|8000}} (~ {{USD|8358}}) beginning on January 1, 2012, for the purchase of new plug-in electric vehicles equipped with a minimum of 4 [[kWh]] battery, and new [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s were eligible for a {{CAD|1,000}} rebate. All-electric vehicles with high-capacity battery packs were eligible for the full {{CAD|8,000}} rebate, and lower incentives were set for low-range electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Quebec's government earmarked  {{CAD|50 million}} (~ {{USD|49.9 million}}) for the program, and the maximum rebate amount was set to be slowly reduced every year until a maximum of {{CAD|3,000}} in 2015, but the rebates would continue until the fund runs out. There was also a ceiling for the maximum number of eligible vehicles: 10,000 for all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, and 5,000 for conventional hybrids.&lt;ref name=QuebecRebate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/04/11/quebec-offer-plug-in-vehicle-rebates-8000-dollars/|title=

In November 2013, the provincial government announced its decision to earmark in 2014 an additional {{CAD|65 million}} (~ {{USD|45.5 million}}) to fund a three-year extension to the electric-vehicle rebate program. The maximum rebate was kept at {{CAD|8000}}, but a graded scale was introduced in order to spread the incentive over 10,000 or more vehicles.&lt;ref name=Quebec2014&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1088156_will-quebec-join-california-oregon-as-electric-car-pioneers | title=Will Quebec Join California, Oregon As Electric-Car Pioneers? | first=Matthew |last=Klippenstein | work=Green Car Reports | date=2013-11-07 | accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec's government also set the goal to deploy 12,500 more electric vehicles in the province by 2017, consisting of 10,200 consumer cars, 325 taxis, and 2,000 government-fleet vehicles. Also, incentives were issued for "greening" 525 taxis, aimed to introduce 325 plug-in vehicles (275 plug-in hybrids and 50 all-electrics) and 200 conventional hybrids. The purchase incentives start at  {{CAD|20,000}} for battery-electric taxis,  {{CAD|12,000}} for plug-in hybrids, and  {{CAD|3,000}} for conventional hybrids, with the rebate declining over time. The province planned to also subsidize 125 Level 2 stations for the taxi industry, paying 75% of the cost up to {{CAD|5,000}}, and pay for the majority of costs to fund 10 Level 3 chargers for taxis.&lt;ref name=Quebec2014/&gt;

Also in 2013, the provincial government announced it support to deploy 5,000 new charging stations. A total of 500 stations were to be located around various cities and along the province's so-called Electric Circuit route, another 1,000 near government buildings, and 3,500 at various workplaces for employee use. Businesses are eligible for a 75% rebate on installation costs up to {{CAD|5,000}} for Level 1 or Level 2 charging stations. In addition, a 50% rebate will continue to be offered to individuals for installation of home charging stations, with a maximum of {{CAD|1,000}}.&lt;ref name=Quebec2014/&gt; Also the government announced an initiative for the gradual electrification of the provincial government's own vehicle fleet. The goal is to replace vehicles of the provincial government's 34 ministers (cabinet-level officials) with plug-in hybrid or pure electric vehicles by March 2017. The government expects to bring 2,000 plug-in vehicles into the provincial fleet over the same time.&lt;ref name=Quebec2014/&gt;

In October 2016, the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] passed a new zero emission vehicle legislation that obliges any carmaker who sells in the Canadian province more than 4,500 new vehicles per year over a three-year average, to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% of the total number of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be [[zero emissions vehicle]]s (ZEV) starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A [[Carbon credit|tradable credit system]] was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. The quotas will be determined by Quebec's [[Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (Quebec)|Ministry of Sustainable Development]]. Quebec became the first Canadian province to pass such legislation, joining ten U.S. states, including California, that have similar ZEV laws. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020.&lt;ref name=QuebecPEVs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avere-france.org/Site/Article/?article_id=6747&amp;from_espace_adherent=0 |title=L'Assemblée nationale du Québec adopte la loi véhicules zéro émission | language=French | trans-title=Quebec's National Assembly enacted a zero emissions vehicle law |publisher=France Mobilité Électrique - AVERE France |date=2016-10-28 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QuebecZEV&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-autos-quebec-idUSL1N1CW1TZ | title=Quebec approves new law to boost sales of zero emission vehicles | first=Allison |last=Lampert | work=[[Reuters]] | date=2016-10-26 | accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the provincial government set the goal in 2011 to have 300,000 plug-in vehicles on the roads by 2020.&lt;ref name=QuebecRebate/&gt;

As of April 1, 2015, [[British Columbia]]'s Clean Energy Vehicle (CEV) Program, funded by the Government of British Columbia and administered by the New Car Dealers of British Columbia industry group, was renewed with funding for approximately 1250 to 1500 vehicles. This program will expire on March 31, 2020 or when the {{CAD|6,355,000}} in new funding is depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cevforbc.ca/clean-energy-vehicle-program |title=Clean Energy Vehicle Program {{!}} Clean Energy Vehicles for British Columbia |publisher=New Car Dealers Association of BC |location=Canada |date=2018 |access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current levels of incentives are: {{CAD|5000}} for an EV (min.15 kWh capacity), {{CAD|2500}} for a plug-in hybrid or an extended range vehicle with a smaller battery capacity (min. 4 kWh capacity) and up to {{CAD|6000}} for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, these amounts may be reduced annually. All vehicles must be new and purchased in BC, each claim is processed by the dealer at the Point of Sale and deducted from the vehicle price. The previous program that provided funding to cover part of the cost of installing home EV charging equipment has been discontinued. There is also a separate provincially funded "SCRAP-IT" program with incentives for scrapping model year 2000 or earlier, conventional gas powered vehicles. Basic incentives range from bus passes to coop car-share membership credits, or {{CAD|200}} in cash. However, there is also the option of applying for a {{CAD|3000}} rebate cheque (plus {{CAD|250}} off the Point of Sale purchase price) when buying a new or used EV (min.15 kWh capacity). The "SCRAP-IT" rebate program currently brings the combined provincial incentives available to buyers of a qualifying new EV in BC to {{CAD|8250}}.

The Government of British Columbia had announced the ''LiveSmart BC'' program, which started offering rebates of up to {{CAD|5,000}} per eligible clean energy vehicle commencing on December 1, 2011. The incentives were available until March 31, 2013 or until available funding were depleted, whichever came first. Available funds were enough to provide incentives for approximately 1,370 vehicles. Battery electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids with battery capacity of 15.0 kWh and above are eligible for a {{CAD|5,000}} incentive. Also effective December 1, 2011, rebates of up to  {{CAD|500}} per qualifying electric vehicle charging equipment were available to B.C. residents who had purchased a clean energy vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/|title=The Clean Energy Vehicle (CEV) Program|publisher=LiveSmart BC|date=2011-11-05|accessdate=2011-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114150054/http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/#|archive-date=2011-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/vehicle_incentives_list.pdf|title=Table 1 –Examples of Clean Energy Vehicles and Incentive Levels|publisher=LiveSmart BC|accessdate=2011-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403123015/http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/vehicle_incentives_list.pdf#|archive-date=2012-04-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 14, 2014, the Point of Sale Incentive Program and Residential Electric Charging Station Program had depleted their budgets and were no longer accepting applications for rebates prior to the Point of Sale incentive program being re-funded in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesmartbc.ca/incentives/transportation/index.html|title=NEW February 14, 2014|publisher=LiveSmart BC|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, there are several existing incentives regarding Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) at a federal level. Fiscal incentives for end-consumers include higher daily lease tax deductions per car ($285 versus $200 MXN), higher tax deduction caps per car ($250,000 versus $175,000 MXN), and fiscal credits for up to 30% of investments for charging stations located in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LISR_301116.pdf|title=Income Tax Law|last=|first=|date=2017-10-07|website=Mexico's Chamber of Deputies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, PHEVs are exempt of the tax on new vehicles (paid by the manufacturer, assembler or dealer).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/123_120117.pdf|title=Federal Tax Law on New Vehicles|last=|first=|date=|website=Mexico's Chamber of Deputies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, a group of America's [[Edison Electric Institute|largest electric utilities]] sided with U.S. automakers and asked Congress to preserve the tax credit in order to support the continued growth of sales of electric vehicles. Currently, there are hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles on the road. However, the auto industry is approaching a point at which the tax incentives will begin to expire. According to ''Daily Energy Insider'', "The utilities' efforts occur at a time when growth in electric sales is sluggish and electric companies see a possible opportunity to apply the latest battery technology to help serve their customers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/11363-utilities-ask-congress-keep-electric-vehicle-tax-incentive/|title=Utilities ask Congress to keep electric vehicle tax incentive|last=Yingling|first=Bill|date=2018-03-20|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-03-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== New plug-in electric vehicles =====&lt;!--move image?--&gt;

The [[Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008]] granted tax credits for new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles.&lt;ref name="IRS2009" /&gt; The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA) also authorized federal [[tax credits]] for converted plug-ins, though the credit is lower than for new PEVs.&lt;ref name="IRS0409" /&gt; [[American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009]] (ACES) also has extensive provisions for electric cars. The bill calls for all electric utilities to, "develop a plan to support the use of plug-in electric drive vehicles, including heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles". The bill also provides for "smart grid integration," allowing for more efficient, effective delivery of electricity to accommodate the additional demands of plug-in electric vehicles. Finally, the bill allows for the Department of Energy to fund projects that support the development of PEVs and smart grid technology and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090331/acesa_discussiondraft.pdf |title=Discussion Draft of Waxman Markey ACES Bill |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813103414/http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090331/acesa_discussiondraft.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualified plug-in electric vehicle credit phases out for a PEV manufacturer over the one-year period beginning with the second calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which at least 200,000 qualifying vehicles from that manufacturer have been sold for use in the U.S. Cumulative sales started counting sales after December 31, 2009. After reaching the cap, qualifying PEVs for one quarter still earn the full credit, the second quarter after that quarter PEVS are eligible for 50% of the credit for six months, then 25% of the credit for another six months and finally the credit is phased out.&lt;ref name="IRS2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IRS2009s" /&gt;

;Studies
A 2013 study published in the journal ''Energy Policy'' determined that current federal subsidies are "not aligned with the goal of decreased gasoline consumption in a consistent and efficient manner." In particular, hybrid-vehicle credit is given according to battery capacity rather than on the vehicle's [[all-electric range]]. Across the battery-capacity and charging-infrastructure scenarios examined, the lowest-cost solution is for more drivers to switch to traditional hybrid electrics or low-capacity plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Installing charging infrastructure would provide lower gasoline savings per dollar spent than paying for increased PHEV battery capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/sustainability/cost-effectiveness-plug-in-hybrids-charging-infrastructure | title=Cost-effectiveness of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Battery Capacity and Charging Infrastructure Investment for Reducing U.S. Gasoline Consumption}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = Scott B. | last2 = Michalek | first2 = Jeremy J. | year = 2013 | title =Cost-effectiveness of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Battery Capacity and Charging Infrastructure Investment for Reducing U.S. Gasoline Consumption | journal = Energy Policy | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512008415 | doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.09.059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study conducted by researchers from the [[University of California, Davis]] found that the federal tax credit was the reason behind more than 30% of the plug-in electric sales. The impact of the federal tax incentive is higher among owners of the [[Nissan Leaf]], with up to 49% of sales attributable to the federal incentive. The study, based on a stated preference survey of more than 2,882 plug-in vehicle owners in 11 states, also found that the federal tax credit shifts buyers from [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles to plug-in vehicles and advances the purchase timing of new vehicles by a year or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Exploring the Impact of the Federal Tax Credit on the Plug-In Vehicle Market |first1=Gil |last1=Tal |first2=Michael A. |last2=Nicholas  |journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board | volume=2572 |issue=|pages= |date=2016 |doi=10.3141/2572-11}} Published online 2008-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== New proposals =====
[[File:Cadillac ELR 2013 NY Auto Show.jpg|thumb|left|An initiative by the [[Obama Administration]] to increase the maximum tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles to {{USD|10,000}}, would not apply to luxury vehicles with a sales price of over {{USD|45,000}}, such as the [[Cadillac ELR]] (shown) and the [[Tesla Model S]].]]

Two separate initiatives were pursued in 2011 to transform the tax credit into an instant cash rebate; these did not pass. The objective of both initiatives was to make new qualifying [[plug-in electric car]]s more accessible to buyers by making the incentive more effective. The rebate would have been available at the point of sale allowing consumers to avoid a wait of up to a year to apply the tax credit against income tax returns.&lt;ref name=Rebate1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/blog/1055032_senator-stabenow-7500-electric-car-credit-should-be-rebate|title=

This bill was introduced in August 2010 but was not voted by the full [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name=Rebate1/&gt; The bill would have turned the tax credit into a rebate worth up to {{USD|7500}} for plug-in electric vehicles and also would have provided businesses with a tax credit for purchasing medium or heavy duty [[plug-in hybrid]] trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stabenow.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=238|title=Charging America Forward Act to support Michigan-made vehicles|publisher=Stabenow.senate.gov|date=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other initiative was from the [[Obama Administration]] and was submitted in the FY2012 Budget as a provision to transform the existing credit into a rebate that would have been claimable by dealers and passed along to the consumers, this was not included in the Budget.&lt;ref name=Rebate2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/white-house-pushes-instant-7500-cash-rebate-towards-electric-car-purchases-106794.html|title=White House Pushes For a $7,500 Instant Cash Rebate Towards Electric Car Purchases|publisher=PluginCars.com|first=Nick |last=Chambers|date=2011-02-09|accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another change plug-in tax credit was proposed by Senator [[Carl Levin]] and Representative [[Sander Levin]] who proposed to raise the existing cap on the number of plug-in vehicles eligible for the tax credit. The proposal would have raised that limit from the existing 200,000 PEVs per manufacturer to 500,000 units, this was not passed.&lt;ref name=Rebate1/&gt;

In March 2014 the [[Obama Administration]] included a provision in the FY2015 Budget to increase the maximum tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles and other advanced vehicles to {{USD|10,000}}. However, the new maximum tax credit would not apply to luxury vehicles with a sales price of over {{USD|45,000}}, which would be capped at {{USD|7,500}}. The proposal sought to remove the 200,000 vehicle cap per manufacturer after which the credit phases out over a year. Instead, the incentives would begin to phase out—falling to 75% of the current credit—starting in 2019 for all manufacturers, and would be completely phased out by 2022; this did not get included in the Budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140304/AUTO01/303040118 |title=White House: Boost EV, alternative vehicle tax credits to $10,000 |first=David |last=Sheparson |work=[[The Detroit News]] |date=2014-03-04 |accessdate=2014-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071656/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140304/AUTO01/303040118 |archivedate=2014-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, House Republicans proposed scrapping the $7,500 tax credit as part of a sweeping tax overhaul,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-vehicles/house-republicans-propose-to-scrap-7500-electric-vehicle-credit-idUSKBN1D2282|title=House Republicans propose to scrap $7,500 electric vehicle credit|date= 2017-11-02|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the final bill passed left the credit intact.

[[File:Model S 04 2015 Berkeley 1849.JPG|thumb|The [[Tesla Model S]]  is eligible for a {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit and a rebate in [[California]], depending on income.]]

The Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP), initially funded with a total of {{USD|4.1}} million by the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Air Resources Board]] (ARB), was established in order to promote the production and use of [[zero-emission vehicle]]s (ZEVs), including plug-in electric and [[fuel cell vehicle]]s. The program was created from Assembly Bill 118 that was signed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Governor Schwarzenegger]] in October 2007. The funding is provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and the project is expected to go through 2015.&lt;ref name=CalCVRP&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energycenter.org/index.php/incentive-programs/clean-vehicle-rebate-project |title=Clean Vehicle Rebate Project|publisher=Center for Sustainable Energy|accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2014|03|10}}, a total of 52,264 clean vehicle rebates have been issued by the CVRP, for a total of {{USD|110,222,866}} disbursed, with only {{USD|3.8 million}} remaining for fiscal year 2013-2014. {{As of|2014|04}}, the CVRP was facing an estimated {{USD|30 million}} funding shortfall for the 2013-14 fiscal year, and uncertainty about additional funding for the 2014-15 fiscal year. CARB staff presented a proposal to the board to overcome the funding shortage and also to facilitate the rebates to benefit buyers in disadvantaged communities who live in areas with bad air quality or who can't afford high-end electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://capitolweekly.net/tesla-rebates-california-cap-msrp/ |title=ARB, Tesla at odds over rebate cuts for electric vehicles|first=John |last=Howard|work=Capitol Weekly|date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill signed into law in September 2014, mandated the CARB to draft a financial plan to meet California's goal of putting one million vehicles on the road while making sure that disadvantaged communities can participate. CARB had to change the Clean Vehicle Rebate program to provide an extra credit for low-income drivers who wish to purchase or lease an electric car. CARB also provides assistance to [[carsharing]] programs in low-income neighborhoods and install charging stations in apartment buildings in those communities. Under bill SB 1275, low-income residents who agree to scrap older, polluting cars will also get a clean vehicle rebate on top of existing payments for junking smog-producing vehicles.&lt;ref name=SFG092014&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Brown-signs-several-clean-air-vehicle-bills-5771184.php |title=Brown signs several clean-air vehicle bills|first=Marisa |last=Lagos|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2014-09-22 |accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green77K&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-brown-electric-vehicles-20140921-story.html |title=Gov.

{{As of|2016|03|29}}, California added income-based caps to its rebate system.

In California a vehicle that meets specified emissions standards may be issued Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) decals that allow the vehicle to be operated by a single occupant in California's [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s (HOV), or [[carpool]] or diamond lanes. All-electric vehicles are classified as Federal Inherently Low Emission Vehicles (ILEVs), and as zero emissions vehicles are entitled to an unlimited number of white CAV stickers. Green CAV stickers were initially available to a limited number of applicants that purchased or leased cars meeting California's Enhanced Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (Enhanced AT PZEV) or Transitional Zero-Emission Vehicle (TZEV) requirements, for which plug-in hybrids classify. The green car sticker cap was increased several times, and since September 2016 the cap was removed.&lt;ref name=CAVdecal&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dmv.ca.gov/vr/decal.htm |title=Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) Decals - High Occupancy Vehicle HOV Lane Usage |publisher=Department of Motor Vehicles |location=California|date=March 2014|accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research performed in 2015 by the [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs|UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation]] found that access to HOV lanes has a significant impact on plug-in car sales. Researchers linked automobile sales to a sample of more than 7,000 of the 8,057 [[census tracts]] in California for the study, including Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco. The study concluded that the ability to use potentially time-saving HOV lanes prompted the purchase of more than 24,000 plug-in electric cars and hybrids in the four urban areas from 2010 to 2013, or about 40% of the total of such vehicles. The UCLA researcher concluded that without the policy giving plug-in vehicles access to HOV lanes, total plug-in sales in the same study areas would have been only 36,692 for the three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-1111-california-commute-20151111-story.html |title=Law expanding HOV access to plug-in cars drives higher sales, UCLA study says|first=Dan |last=Weikel|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2015-11-10 |accessdate=2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal incentives===

In Australia, the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] offers no direct incentives for electric vehicle ownership and imposes a substantial financial ''disincentive'' by way of a Federal [[Luxury Car Tax]] that is applied on new vehicles valued over a certain threshold (in 2014–15, this was [[Australian dollar|A$]]61,884).  The application threshold for this tax is increased to A$75,375 for fuel efficient vehicles - defined as those with a fuel consumption rating under 7 litres per 100 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/luxury-car-tax-rate-and-thresholds/?fb_locale=en_GB&amp;page=1|title=Australian Taxation Office - Luxury Car Tax rate and thresholds|publisher=[[Australian Taxation Office]]|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By definition, electric vehicles which do not use conventional fuel sources are covered by this classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au/GVGPublicUI/Information.aspx?type=ElectricVehicleInformation |title=Green Vehicle Guide - Electric Vehicle Information |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |accessdate=2015-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115080951/http://www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au/GVGPublicUI/Information.aspx?type=ElectricVehicleInformation |archivedate=2015-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and Territory incentives===
Motor vehicle registrations in Australia are the responsibility of the [[states and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments.  Two of these jurisdictions offer incentives or rebates for electric vehicles:

====Victoria====
* In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], hybrid and electric vehicles received a $100 annual discount on vehicle registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/registration/registration-fees/vehicle-registration-fees|title=VicRoads - Registration fees|publisher=[[VicRoads]]|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themotorreport.com.au/50581/victorian-hybrid-and-ev-drivers-to-get-100-registration-rebate|title=Victorian Hybrids And EVs To Get $100 Rego Rebate; Opposition Calls Hybrid Camry A "Flop"|publisher=themotorreport.com.au|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australian Capital Territory====
* In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[stamp duty#Australia|stamp duty]] on motor vehicle purchases is reduced for lower emission vehicles - for electric vehicles with [[zero emission|zero tailpipe emissions]], the stamp duty is $0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/2928 |title=Stamp Duty Payable upon registration or transfer of a motor vehicle |publisher=ACT Road Transport Authority |location=Australia |date=2016-01-25 |accessdate=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric powered vehicles are entitled to 20% discount on registration. The owner pays 20% less on the cost of the annual registration component, however must pay the full fee for compulsory third party insurance, road rescue fee, road safety contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/694#!tabs-8|publisher=Access Canberra |title = Motor vehicle registration and renewal |location=Australia |date=2016-09-21 |accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no electric vehicle incentives in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] or the [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aevasa.kestar.com.au/#Incentives|title=Australian Electric Vehicle Association - Incentives|publisher=[[Aeva]]|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.teslamotors.com/en_AU/incentives/AU|title=Nationwide Incentives - Australia|publisher=[[Tesla Motors]]|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green building in Israel''' refers to the practice and regulation of [[green building]] in [[Israel]].

==History==
Israel has had its own voluntary Green Building Standard,for buildings with reduced environmental impact, IS-5281 since 2005. The standard is based on a point rating system, awarding up to 5 stars based on the number of points achieved (55 – 100) in 8 categories.

While the 2005 version covered only new residential and office buildings,a significantly revised and updated new version was approved in 2011, following pressure from professionals and market players. The new standard written with the help of BRE, the British office that wrote BREEAM, the UK Green Building tool,covers new buildings and buildings under significant renovation.
This version was revised in August 2014.

A number of Israeli municipalities are currently using the standard as a mandatory part of their building licensing process. Together with complementary standards 5282 [classification of buildings according to energy use] and 1738 for [[sustainable products]] provides a system for evaluating the [[sustainability|environmental sustainability]] of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/env_topics/GreenBuilding/Pages/GreenBuildingStandards.aspx Green Building Standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

United States Green Building Council [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] rating system has been implemented on some building in Israel including the [[Intel]] Development Center in [[Haifa]].

==Standard 5281==
The Israeli Green Building Standard ('Buildings of Lesser Environmental Harm'), Standard 5281, was upgraded and expanded in 2011 in cooperation with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Standards Institute of Israel, the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Building and Housing and the Israeli Green Building Council. While the old standard only applied to residential and office buildings, the revised version defined seven standards for seven types of buildings: residential, offices, healthcare institutions, public, commercial, education and tourism buildings.

The 5281 standard encompasses issues pertinent to every green building: energy, land, water, building materials, health and welfare of building users, waste, transportation, building site management and innovation. Each issue is divided into sub-categories that include rating and assessment criteria, and the score is determined in accordance with the project's compliance with the requirements. 

A building is deemed a 'green building' if it meets the minimal requirements for each of the categories, as well as additional preconditions to minimize the building's "environmental footprint." The standard has five levels, ranging from one star to five stars. 

The Israeli Green Building Council (ILGBC) publishes general and technical manuals that provide information on these standards and their implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en-environment.tau.ac.il/PSESbuilding/Israeli_Green_Building_Standard Israeli Green Building Standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hopkinson v Police''''' was a successful appeal by a protester convicted for the offence of [[flag desecration|burning]] the [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand flag]] with the intention of dishonouring it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Hopkinson v Police'' [2004] 3 NZLR 704&lt;/ref&gt; The case is notable because of the High Court's interpretation of the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 in a manner consistent with the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. Justice Ellen France held that "the prohibition of flag burning under the Act was a breach of the right to freedom of expression, and such a limit was not justified under s 5 of the Bill of Rights."&lt;ref&gt;''R v Morse'' [2009] NZCA 623 at [87].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 10 March 2003 between 500 and 1000 people marched through central [[Wellington]] in protest at a visit of Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] to the New Zealand Parliament. The protest was against the Australian Government's support for the United States-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the protest Hopkinson held the New Zealand flag on a pole upside down and a Mr Phillips lit the flag with a cigarette lighter resulting in a fireball and a column of flame 2 metres high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result of the protest, Wellington schoolteacher Paul Hopkinson became the first person ever to be prosecuted under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 after burning a New Zealand flag at an anti-war protest in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://tvnz.co.nz/content/229906/423466/article.html|title = Flag burning trial under way|last = |first = |date = 20 October 2003|work = One News|access-date = 14 May 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkinson was convicted in November in the [[District Courts of New Zealand|Wellington District Court]] of an offence under s 11(1)(b) of the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981; destroying the New Zealand flag with the intention of dishonouring it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Judge Noble ruled that Hopkinson had deliberately disrespected the flag to gain attention as he "sought to add weight to the effects of the protest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/08/1068013410082.html?from=storyrhs|title = Teacher convicted of flag burning|last = |first = |date = 8 November 2003|work = AP|access-date = 14 May 2015|via = theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkinson appealed the conviction on the basis that the District Court had failed to correctly interpret the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 in a manner consistent with the right to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly under ss 14 and 16 of the Bill of Rights Act 1990.

==Judgment==
Section 6 of the Bill of Rights required the Court to adopt a meaning of the word "dishonour" that could be read consistently with the Bill of Rights. Justice Ellen France held, &lt;blockquote&gt;[81] Looking at the statutory scheme as a whole, there is some support for the respondent's view that there is just the one tenable meaning, namely, that adopted by the District Court Judge. However, the better view is that the statute does allow of the narrower meaning of “vilify”. If that meaning is adopted, as s 6 of the Bill of Rights demands that it must, I consider s 11(1)(b) can be read consistently with the Bill of Rights. However, I do not accept the respondent's submission that the appellant's conduct would fall foul of this narrower definition of “dishonour”, that is, one limited to dishonour in the sense of vilifying. That would have required some additional action on the appellant's part beyond a symbolic burning of the flag. My decision is of course confined to this particular appellant's conduct. What other conduct may come within this narrower interpretation of “dishonour” is a matter for a different case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[82] On this basis, that is, that the prohibition on the appellant's conduct is not a justified limit on the right to freedom of expression and does not come within the proper Bill of Rights consistent interpretation of s 11(1)(b), the appellant's conviction cannot stand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Ihlen Declaration''' was a statement made on 22 July 1919 by the [[Foreign minister of Norway]], [[Nils Claus Ihlen]], on the topic of [[Denmark]]'s [[sovereignty]] over [[Greenland]], in which Ihlen declared verbally to the Danish Minister that "...the plans of the Royal [Danish] Government respecting Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland...would be met with no difficulties on the part of Norway." The declaration became an issue when the question was raised whether the statement was binding on [[Norway]]. The question eventually went all the way to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in the form of the [[Eastern Greenland Case]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="General-Principles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheng|first=Bin|author2=Georg Schwarzenberger|title=General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|location=Oxford|pages=198–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qE52nT_aD20C&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=Ihlen+Declaration&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Mk2xqkPkSe&amp;sig=m3gIGI4SA1Aspj2Em1a3PwMREAs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA198,M1|isbn=0-521-03000-5 |id={{ISBN|9780521030007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contemporary-issues"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzmaurice|first=Malgosia|author2=Olufemi Elias|title=Contemporary issues in the law of treaties|publisher=Eleven International Publishing|year=2005|pages=13–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD_DDw2Rr_EC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Ihlen+Declaration&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TQ9IHf3w9k&amp;sig=Q2vJDcLMy8HUy-1YTVMe_goia8M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA13,M1|isbn=90-77596-06-2 |id={{ISBN|9789077596067}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The declaration==
[[File:Nils Claus Ihlen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Foreign minister of Norway]] [[Nils Claus Ihlen]]]]
In a meeting, Denmark agreed not to object to any claim to [[Spitsbergen]] which Norway might submit at an upcoming peace conference, if Norway would not oppose the Danish claim at the same conference to the whole of [[Greenland]]. This was on 4 July 1919. At the time, Norway occupied certain parts of East Greenland.

In response, Ihlen made the declaration on 22 July 1919 that "...the plans of the Royal [Danish] Government respecting Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland...would be met with no difficulties on the part of Norway."&lt;ref name="contemporary-issues"/&gt;

==Eastern Greenland Case==
{{main|Eastern Greenland Case}}
However, Norway continued to occupy East Greenland into the 1930s. This led Denmark and Norway to agree to take the case to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in 1933. This led to several questions: Are affirmations made by one government to another binding? Was the declaration valid if it was made in violation of Norwegian municipal law article 46 - invalidity (article 27 - observance) of the [[Norwegian Constitution]] requiring consent by the [[Norwegian Parliament]] to enter into a treaty? Should Denmark have known that assent by the Norwegian Parliament was needed to make a treaty?&lt;ref name="questions"&gt;{{cite web|last=Halvorssen|first=Anita M.|title=TREATIES|date=12 September|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:KP0bNfZlr5UJ:sobek.colorado.edu/~halvorss/Intl-law%25204-8.ppt+Ihlen+Declaration&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a|format=PPT|accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Court at the Hague awarded the disputed territory to Denmark. The Court declared that the Ihlen declaration constituted an unconditional and definitive promise. The decision was accepted by both countries.&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauterpacht|first=Elihu|authorlink=C.

'''Italian irredentism in Savoy''' was the political movement among Savoyards promoting annexation to the [[House of Savoy|Savoy dynasty's]] [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was active from 1860 to [[World War II]].

==History==

Italian irredentists were citizens of Savoy who considered themselves to have ties with the [[House of Savoy]] dynasty. Savoy was the original territory of the duke of Savoy that later became King of Italy's [[House of Savoy]]. Since the [[Renaissance]] the area rules over [[Piedmont]] and had for regional capital the town of ([[Chambéry]]). The official language of  Savoy was French since the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;Honoré Coquet, Les Alpes, enjeu des puissances européennes : L'union européenne à l'école des Alpes ?, L'Harmattan, 2003, 372 p.

[[Vaugelas]], a native of the duchy became one of the most renowned French linguist.

In spring 1860 the area was annexed to France after a referendum and the administrative boundaries changed, but most of the Savoyard population demonstrated against the annexation. Indeed, the final vote count on the referendum announced by the Court of Appeals was 130,839 in favour of annexation to France, 235 opposed and 71 void, showing an unbelievable complete support for French nationalism (that motivated strong criticism about rigged results).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pKQBAAAAYAAJ Wambaugh, Sarah &amp; Scott, James Brown (1920), ''A Monograph on Plebiscites, with a Collection of Official Documents'', New York: Oxford University Press, p. 599]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Presently, the situation seems the following : generally, it does not exist any will to separate Savoy and Piedmont. In the highest part of the country, Maurienne, Tarentaise and Upper-Savoy (Albertville and Beaufortain), the population is resolutely for the statu quo. In Genevois, Faucigny and Chablais, if ever should produce a change, the annexation by Switzerland is preferred to any other solution.&lt;ref&gt;F. ENGELS, ''Savoyen, Nizza und die Rhein'', Berlin, 1860&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
At the beginning of the year 1860, more than 3,000 persons demonstrated in Chambéry against the annexation to France rumours. On 16 March 1860, the provinces of Northern Savoy (Chablais, Faucigny and Genevois) sent to [[Victor Emmanuel II]], to [[Napoleon III]], and to the Swiss Federal Council a declaration - sent under the presentation of a manifesto together with petitions - where they were saying that they did not wish to become French and shown their preference to remain united to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (or be annexed to Switzerland in the case a separation with Sardinia was unavoidable).&lt;ref&gt;[http://notre.savoie.free.fr/default_a.htm Section: our country, Savoy / History]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Italy unification 1815 1870.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Italian unification]] process was done even with the loss in 1860 of the Savoy province of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Savoy is located northwest in the map, on the upper left corner]]

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] complained about the referendum that allowed France to annex Savoy and [[Nice]], and a group of his followers (between the Italian Savoyards) took refuge in Italy in the following years. With a 99.8% vote in favour of joining France, there were allegations of [[vote-rigging]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freesavoy.com/post/2009/09/21/Universal-suffrage-in-Savoy   The Times (April 28 1860): Universal suffrage in Savoy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opposition to French rule was manifest when, in 1919, France officially (but contrary to the annexation treaty) ended the military neutrality of the parts of the country of Savoy that had originally been agreed to at the [[Congress of Vienna]], and also eliminated the [[free trade zone]] - both treaty articles having been broken unofficially in World War I.  France was condemned in 1932 by the international court for noncompliance with the measures of the treaty of Turin, regarding the countries of Savoy and Nice.  Indeed, in 1871 a strong break away movement appeared in north and central Savoy against the annexation. The Republican Committee of the town of [[Bonneville, Haute-Savoie|Bonneville]] considered that "the 1860 vote, was the result of  imperial pressure, and  not the free demonstration of the will of our country" and called for a new Referendum: France sent 10,000 troops to Savoy to restore order.

In the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was founded after 1861 the ''Associazione Oriundi Savoiardi e Nizzardi Italiani''
,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bollettino01sociuoft/bollettino01sociuoft_djvu.txt Text (in Italian) of "Bollettino" from the Savoiardi association]&lt;/ref&gt; an association of the Italian Savoyards that lasted one century until 1966.

During the [[Italian fascism|fascist]] period in the early 1940s, organizations were created that promoted the unification of Savoy to the Kingdom of Italy. The fascist members were nearly one hundred in 1942, concentrated mainly in [[Grenoble]] and [[Chambéry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcUNELPsQQsC&amp;printsec=index&amp;dq=davide+rodogno+fascism's+european+empire&amp;psp=1&amp;source=gbs_toc_s&amp;cad=1#PRA7-PA148,M1 Fascism's European Empire -By Davide Rodogno]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Italy occupied Savoy in November 1942 these fascist groups claimed that nearly 10,000 Savoyards demanded the unification to Italy, but nothing was done mainly because the [[Victor Emmanuel III|King of Italy]] opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;Vignoli, Giulio. ''Gli Italiani Dimenticati''  p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II all the organizations of the Irredentist Savoyards were outlawed by the French authorities of [[Charles de Gaulle]].

Most of the remaining Irredentist Savoyards supported in the 1950s and 1960s the development of autonomistic political organizations of Savoy, like the [[Mouvement Région Savoie]] (Savoy Regional Movement).

===Italian-occupied Savoy===

[[image:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation.svg|thumb|left|200 px|The parts of Savoy under Italian control are highlighted in green]]Only in 1940 did the Italian Savoyards fulfilled their [[Italia irredenta|irredentism]], and some small areas bordering the [[Alps]] were annexed by Italy. The initial zone was 832&amp;nbsp;km² and contained 28,500 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="GSWW311"&gt;Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt. ''Germany and the Second World War - Volume 2: Germany's Initial Conquests in Europe'', pg. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1942, in conjunction with "[[Case Anton]]", the German occupation of most of [[Vichy France]], the [[Royal Italian Army (1940–1946)|Royal Italian Army]] (''Regio Esercito'') expanded its occupation zone.  Italian forces took control of [[Grenoble]], [[Nice]], the [[Rhône River]] delta, and nearly all of Savoy.

A process of [[Italianization]] of the schools in Savoy was started, but was never fully implemented. Only a few Italian Savoyards were voluntarily enrolled in the Italian Army through fascist organizations like the [[Blackshirts|Camicie Nere]], most of them rejoined the resistance and fought against the invaders.

Most of the Irredentist Savoyards helped actively the Jews in the occupied zone in Savoy, a region that  acted as a refuge for [[Vichy Regime#Vichy.27s racial policies and collaboration|Jews fleeing persecution in Vichy France]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''Vichy France, Old Guard, New Order''. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The projects to unify Savoy to the Kingdom of Italy were supported by the fascist Savoyards of Grenoble{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, but nothing was done even because in September 1943 [[Nazi Germany]] substituted Italy in the occupation of Savoy.

==The Savoyard dialect==

Savoyards historically have spoken a dialect related to the [[Arpitan language]]: the [[Savoyard dialect]]. Arpitan is spoken in France, in Switzerland and in Italy. However, [[French language|French]] is the predominant language today.

During the fascist occupation in 1940-1943, Italian authorities promoted a process of Italianization of all the people of Savoy, mainly related to the use of [[Italian language|Italian]] in substitution of the Savoyard dialect{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

'''Jefferson Rowe Thompson,''' known as '''Jeff R. Thompson''' (born March 10, 1965), is a [[judge]] of the Louisiana 26th Judicial District Court for [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier]] and [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster]] parishes, who is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] for District 8, a position which he held from January 2012 to January 2015.

A resident of [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]], Thompson ran without opposition in the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on November 4, 2014, to succeed the retiring Division B Judge [[Ford E. Stinson Jr.]], a [[Democratic party (United States)|Democrat]], on the 26th District Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-herald.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9892:thompson-announces-bid-for-district-judge&amp;catid=34:local-news&amp;Itemid=69|title=Thompson announces bid for district judge|publisher=''[[Minden Press-Herald]]''|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2014/08/20/desoto-da-minden-mayor-candidates-qualify/14331543/|title=Final day of qualifying in DeSoto, Webster|author=Vickie Welborn|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

A graduate of [[Jena High School]] in Jena in [[Central Louisiana]], Thompson obtained degrees in [[real estate]] and [[insurance]] from the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] (1988) and the [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Tulane University Law School]] in [[New Orleans]] (1995). He was affiliated with [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] [[fraternity]]. While living in [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], he was from 1989 to 1992 the ULM (then Northeast Louisiana University) Associate Director of Development. He was also a reserve officer with the Monroe Police Department and an [[insurance agent]] for [[Ralph T. Troy|Troy]] &amp; Nichols Mortgage Company. After obtaining his law degree with honors from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, he relocated to Bossier City to engage in the practice of law and is active in the bar association. He is a member of the large Cypress [[Southern Baptist|Baptist]] Baptist Church of Benton. He is affiliated with the [[National Rifle Association]] and was a district director of the Norwela Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. In 2004, he was the president of the Bossier [[Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref name=votesmart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/108814/jeff-thompson#.U_fpEctAQ5s|title=Jeff R. Thompson|publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]]|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson and his wife, the former Toni Estelle Hurst, reside in [[Benton, Louisiana|Benton]], the Bossier Parish [[County seat|parish seat]], where the 26th Judicial District Court convenes. The couple has two children, Lillie and Rowe Thompson.&lt;ref name=votesmart/&gt;

==Political life==

Thompson was elected to the House in 2011, when the term-limited incumbent, fellow Republican [[Jane H. Smith]] of Bossier City, ran instead, unsuccessfully, for the [[Louisiana State Senate]]. Thompson defeated fellow Republican, Michael Durrell "Duke" Lowrie (born April 1970), 4,991 (56.8 percent) to 3,803 (43.3 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10222011/10222011_Legislative.html|title=Election returns, October 22, 2011|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, meanwhile, was defeated by the Republican businessman [[Barrow Peacock]] of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] for the Senate seat vacated by [[B. L. Shaw|B. L. "Buddy" Shaw]].

In 2008, Thompson was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[Louisiana's 4th congressional district]]. The seat opened when the incumbent [[Jim McCrery]] stepped down to become a [[lobbyist]]. Thompson finished in third place in the primary. The position went to the Republican physician and businessman [[John C. Fleming]] of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], who held it until 2017.

In the spring of 2012, Representative Thompson amended an anti-[[bullying]] bill sponsored by Patricia Smith, a Democrat from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. [[Conservative (politics)|Conservative]] opponents of the bill claimed the measure is at odds with [[freedom of speech]] rulings by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Thompson offered an amendment, which removed those sections of the bill that specify prohibitions against bullying in regard to only [[sexual orientation]], disabilities, and race. Smith said that the Thompson amendment effectively killed the focus of the legislation, and she withdrew it from further consideration.  Thompson opposed bullying in schools for any reason and worked to protect the educational opportunities of all children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/2606631-125/changes-doom-bullying-proposal |title=Changes doom bullying proposal |author=Will Sentell |date=May 1, 2012 |publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'' |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514130100/http://theadvocate.com/home/2606631-125/changes-doom-bullying-proposal |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative Thompson served on the House Education, Homeland Security, Ways and Means, and Military and Veterans Affairs committees. He also sits on the Joint House and Senate Committee on Homeland Security.  Thompson was a leader in the Louisiana legislature to address the over 17 millions pounds of propellant improperly and illegally stored at Camp Minden near Doyline, Louisiana.&lt;ref name=votesmart/&gt;

[[Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)|Mike Johnson]], a Republican lawyer from Benton, was unopposed in the special election held in February 2015 to choose Thompson's successor in the House. Johnson is not the U.S. representative for the 4th congressional district.

==Court activities==

In 2017,  [[plaintiff]]s James Wheat and Danny Brinson, after their arrests in Bossier City for violating a state statute forbidding [[Begging|panhandling]], filled a [[class action]] lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana]] against Bossier Parish Sheriff Julian Curtis Whittington and all judges of the 26th Judicial District Court, including Chief Judge Parker Self and Judge Thompson. Wheat and Brinson allege that Bossier Parish unjustly jails defendants who cannot pay for [[bail]] or the required $40 fee to the office of the [[public defender]]. Nor does Bossier Parish permit defendants to seek a lowering of the bail amount, which is instead automatically set by the court. The suit claims that the parish has for years violated a "bedrock principle of our legal system that a person cannot be detained or imprisoned solely for their inability to pay a fee. Such an [[incarceration]] violates the [[substantive due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] clauses of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2017/03/21/lawsuit-claims-violation-constitutional-rights-impoverished/99467604/|title=Lawsuit: Bossier Parish routinely violates rights of poor|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]''|author=Sarah Crawford|date=March 21, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksla.images.worldnow.com/library/4fcc84a0-2727-4274-9bd8-a676452413e8.pdf|title=''James M.

His sons, Johnson Whittaker Jr. and Miller Whittaker, both served as Army officers in World War I.  In addition, a grandson joined the all-black Tuskegee Airmen in World War II and a great-grandson served as a first lieutenant in the Vietnam-era Army.

==Posthumous commission==
In the 1970s, a book about Whittaker by [[John Marszalek]], a historian at Mississippi State University, drew attention to his case.&lt;ref name="black"/&gt; In 1994, a television movie based on the book aired, which generated momentum for the movement to award Whittaker a posthumous [[Officer (armed forces)#United States|commission]].&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

On July 25, 1995, President Bill Clinton awarded the commission to Whittaker's heirs, saying, "We cannot undo history. But today, finally, we can pay tribute to a great American and we can acknowledge a great injustice."&lt;ref name="week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
''[[Assault at West Point: The Court-Martial of Johnson Whittaker]]'' is a 1994 TV movie about the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0109161|Assault at West Point: The Court-Martial of Johnson Whittaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''Matter of Honor'', a stage play by Michael Chepiga retelling Whittaker's story while at West Point, was produced at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in Pasadena, California, in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2007/legit/markets-festivals/matter-of-honor-1200556667/ |title=Matter of Honor |last=Verini |first=Bob |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocating for environment==
Through his career and especially in deposit-return system for bottles, he became a known figure for advocating for environment in Norway, lecturing at academic gatherings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logistics Seminar in Bergen, February 2007|url=http://www.logistikkforeningen.no/file.php?id=271|website=Logistikkforeningen.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national TV programs to promote the idea of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV - Søk - Kjell Olav Maldum|url=https://tv.nrk.no/sok?q=Kjell%20Olav%20Maldum&amp;filter=rettigheter|website=NRK TV|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he has promoted sustainable production with low impact on environment and recycling of one-way containers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vil heve panten på boks og flasker|url=https://www.nrk.no/rogaland/vil-heve-panten-pa-boks-og-flasker-1.7307823|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV 16.09.2011 (program nr 1435)|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/16.09.2011-_program-nr-1435_-1.7794618|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mangler 40 millioner bokser|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/mangler-40-millioner-bokser-1.5507016|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and avoid wasting food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right in the garbage with fruit and vegetables (English-translated title)|url=http://www.vg.no/forbruker/mat-og-drikke/mat/rett-i-soepla-med-frukt-og-groent/a/105074/|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;In 2006 he won the Optimization Award of the year in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optimization Award 2006: the winner is Kjell Olav Maldum - Ny Teknikk|url=http://www.nyteknikk.no/index.php?articleid=2570|website=www.nyteknikk.no|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the first time that a person won the award instead of an entity for "his extensive efforts to ensure that the retail sector have optimal logistics and thus be the most environmentally friendly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emballasjedagene 07: Kjell Olav Maldum fikk Optimeringsprisen {{!}} PACKobserver|url=http://www.packobserver.dk/idn651.asp|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Maldum has been behind the deposit-return TV commercials and "Infinitum movement"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinitum Movement|url=http://infinitummovement.no/|website=Infinitum Movement|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Norway where a number of celebrities, artists and athletes advertise and encourage for recycling of the materials in the society. The movememnt encourages people to infinitely recycle instead the containers instead of just rhewoing them away. Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] also took part&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRK TV - Se Dagsrevyen 21|url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/dagsrevyen-21/NNFA21101614/16-10-2014|website=National Norwegian TV - NRK|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statsministeren gir sin pant til TV-aksjonen|url=http://infinitum.no/aktuelt/statsministeren-gir-sin-pant-til-tv-aksjonen|website=infinitum.no|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the TV action for the bottle recycling.

==Special initiatives==
*Coca-Cola switching to deposit bottles
Until 2014 [[Coca-Cola]] has been using non-deposit bottle for its beverages in Norway. Kjell Olav Maldum played a central role in negotiations for Coca-Cola Norway switching from non-deposit refillable bottles to non-refillable deposit bottles. The move was considered as an environmentally friendly one to introduce deposit on bottles and decrease littering, but it also led to downsizing of Coca-Cola in Norway due to less labor needed for one-way bottles and made headline in Norwegian market about the job losses and also counter-arguments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cola-kutt kan gi nye arbeidsplasser|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/cola-kutt-kan-gi-nye-arbeidsplasser-1.7991853|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola Norway also promised to invest in recycling facilities inside Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Packaging: Recycling|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/packaging-recycling|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Recycling cans in Norway
Maldum was also behind the efforts that finally led to the recycling of aluminum cans performed in Norway. The aluminum cans that have been collected in Norway were used to be sent to France for recycling but it has been recycled by Norsk Hydro in Holmestrand since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solholm|first1=Rolleiv|title=More environmentally friendly recycling|url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/culture/museums/29252|website=www.norwaypost.no|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was considered as environmentally friendly step vowing for recycling 60,000 mt of aluminium annually in Holmestrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now recycled in Norway: drink cans get a shorter trip to their new life  - Norsk Hydro|url=http://www.hydro.com/en/Press-room/News/Archive/2013/Now-recycled-in-Norway-drink-cans-get-a-shorter-trip-to-their-new-life-/|website=www.hydro.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Literary property''' is a term used in [[publishing]] to refer to works generally covered by [[copyright]] but also an associated set of [[property rights]] that go far beyond what courts have historically permitted to be claimed as [[copyright infringement]].

The [[Writers Guild of America]], for instance, uses this term exclusively to refer to works registered with its [[WGA script registration service]], so as not to restrict the claims it or its users can make regarding their rights.

==Narrower than "intellectual property"==
Since it applies only to literary works and not technological or social constructs such as are covered by [[patent]] or [[trademark]] law, the term is much narrower in scope than the hotly contested term "[[intellectual property]]" sometimes used to refer to all non-physical works in which property rights are recognized.

==Differences between literary property and other non-physical property==
Among other differences, in literary works a very specific concept of [[:wikt:attribution|attribution]] is a critical part of the work itself - works tend to become markedly less valued or more valued based upon who originated or created it, which is simply not the case for [[invention]]s or [[brand name]]s.  Also, most countries recognize [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] that are not [[alienable]] from the work, that is, a purchaser of rights in the work does not have the right to relabel it as if someone else had written it.  While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3233">The '''National Notary Association''' ('''NNA''') is an [[United States|American]] organization at 9350 De Soto Avenue, [[Chatsworth, California]], which provides education to and about [[notary public|notaries public]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jmlr31&amp;div=45&amp;id=&amp;page= Valera, Milton G. 31 J. Marshall L. Rev. 971 (1997-1998) "The National Notary Association: A Historical Profile" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;National Notary Association, [http://www.nationalnotary.org/about/ ''History of the NNA''], (Chatsworth, CA: National Notary Association, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the [[American Society of Notaries]].

==History==

Originally the California Notary Association, it was established in 1957 by Raymond C. Rothman to support California Notaries Public with educational resources and tools to better perform their roles in society. In 1964, the California Notary Association expanded to become the National Notary Association (NNA). With this expansion came new services including seminars, the telephone "Hotline" and the NNA annual conference.

In 1973, the National Notary Association collaborated with [[Yale Law School]] to create the Uniform Notary Act, which became the [[Model Notary Act]] when revised in 1984. It was revised again in 2002 and 2010. More than 40 states have adhered their laws to parts of the Model Notary Act. The [[Uniform Law on Notarial Acts]], published by the [[Uniform Law Commission]], provides an alternative to the Model Notary Act.  The Model Notary Act included funding for the Model to Notary project which trained fashion models to be notaries.

The National Notary Association is also responsible for the Notary Public Code of Professional Responsibility, which was first published in 1998.

The association is sometimes listed as a source of information by state agencies responsible for notaries.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Division of Revenue, [http://www.newjersey.gov/treasury/revenue/dcr/geninfo/notarymanual.htm ''Notary Public Manual''], (Trenton, 2003), Reference Sources section.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Montana Secretary of State, [http://sos.mt.gov/notary/Training/index.asp ''Notary Schedule''], (Helena, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

An expert with the association was quoted in a newspaper after a notary was arrested for election fraud by improperly notarizing signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://poststar.com/news/local/national-notary-association-strough-can-t-witness-from-afar/article_0383e168-4da9-57c4-bd8d-690870623fb2.html  |title= National Notary Association: Strough can't witness from afar |first=Kathleen |last=Moore

'''Patentleft''' (also '''patent left''', '''copyleft-style patent license''' or '''open patent''') is the practice of licensing [[patent]]s (especially [[biological patent]]s) for [[royalties|royalty]]-free use, on the condition that adopters license related improvements they develop under the same terms. Copyleft-style licensors seek "continuous growth of a universally accessible technology commons" from which they, and others, will benefit.&lt;!-- quote pg 183 --&gt;&lt;ref name="biobazaar"&gt;{{cite book

''Patentleft'' is analogous to [[copyleft]], a license which allows distribution of a [[copyright]]ed work and derived works, but only under the same terms.

==Uses==
The [[Biological Innovation for Open Society]] (BiOS) project implemented a patentleft system to encourage re-contribution and collaborative innovation of their technology. BiOS holds a patented technology for transferring genes in plants, and licenses the technology under the terms that, if a license holder improves the gene transfer tool and patents the improvement, then their improvement must be made available to all the other license holders.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Wilbanks and [[Thomas J. Wilbanks]], "Science, Open Communication and Sustainable Development", 13 April 2010, "[http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/4/993/]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The open patent idea is designed to be practiced by [[consortium|consortia]] of research-oriented companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bios.net/daisy/bios/10/version/live/part/4/data Cambia Biosciences Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; and increasingly by [[standards body|standards bodies]].  These also commonly use [[open trademark]] methods to ensure some compliance with a suite of compatibility tests, e.g. [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[X/Open]] both of which forbid use of the mark by the non-compliant.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On October 12, 2001 the [[Free Software Foundation]] and Finite State Machine Labs Inc. (FSMLabs) announced a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] - compliant open-patent license for FSMLabs' [[software patent]], {{Cite patent|US|5995745}}. Titled the Open RTLinux patent license Version 2, it provides for usage of this patent in accordance with the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/press/2001-09-18-RTLinux.html FSF/FSMLabs press release for the RTLinux Open Patent License], October 12, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Person A has a patent, and licenses it under a patentleft license.

Person B has two patents in her product and wants to use Person A's patents in that product. Person B also wants to charge royalties for her two patents. She decides to use Person A's patent, but now must license her patents, royalty-free, under the same terms as Person A's patent.

Person C has three patents in his product and wants to use Person B's two patents in that product, but doesn't want to use Person A's patent. Person C also wants to charge royalties for his three patents. He decides to use Person B's patent, but now must license his patents, royalty-free, under the same terms as Person A's patent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3652">'''Pierre Pontard''' (23 September 1749 – 22 January 1832) was a [[constitutional bishop]] and a [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|deputy]] during the [[French Revolution]].

== Political career during the Revolution ==
Pontard was born in [[Mussidan]] in [[Dordogne]]. He followed a career in the [[Roman Catholic]] priesthood and became a ''[[curé]]'' in [[Sarlat-en-Canéda|Sarlat]]. Having espoused the reforming ideas of the Revolution, he was a fervent advocate of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. In February 1791 he was elected [[constitutional bishop]] of the [[Dordogne]],&lt;ref&gt;the post which replaced that of the [[Bishop of Périgueux]] during the Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; and on 8 September of that year was elected to the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] as a representative of the clergy of Dordogne.

A critic of [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]], he married, and presented his wife to the ''[[Convention Nationale]]'' on 22 September 1793. He supported several measures in favour of the marriage of priests issued by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.

Pontard was responsible for bringing to Paris the prophetess [[Suzette Labrousse]], like him a native of the Dordogne, and remained closely associated with her subsequent career. He was also closely connected to the esoteric circles of the time, particularly to the Duchess of Bourbon, [[Bathilde d'Orléans]], to [[Catherine Théot]], and also [[Dom Gerle]] (presented as rivals by some contemporaries). He was also linked to the scandals associated with these circles.

He actively encouraged Suzette Labrousse while she was being sheltered and having her works published by the Duchess of Orléans (''Journal prophétique'', 1792; ''Recueil des ouvrages de la célèbre Mlle Labrousse'', 1797), and supported Labrousses's journey to Rome. He brought ridicule upon himself by presenting her to several prominent religious figures. When she died he was the executor of her will, in which she left him a (contested) legacy of 3,000 [[francs]]. In Suzette Labrousse's analysis of the [[Apocalypse]] he saw the proofs that the French Revolution was initiating a "universal regeneration"..

== After the Directoire ==
Under the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], Pontard ran a boarding school in [[Paris]], but had to abandon it for financial reasons. He fell into poverty and was supported from 1820 by Bathilde d'Orléans, who gave him a [[life annuity]]. He lived for the rest of his life in the [[Hôpital Sainte-Périne]], where he died.

In 1812 he published the ''Grammaire mécanique élémentaire de l'orthographe française''.

{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
'''''R. v. Jim''''' (1915) 26 C.C.C. 236, was a decision by the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] on [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal]] ("Indian") hunting and provincial [[game law]]s.  The Court found that Aboriginal hunting on [[Indian reserve]]s is primarily federal jurisdiction, relating to section 91(24) of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]] which assigns "Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians" to the federal government.

==Background==
The case involved an Aboriginal Chief named Edward Jim of the [[Saanich people|North Saanich]] tribe.  In [[Victoria, British Columbia]] in 1914 a police magistrate convicted him of possession of a part of a [[deer]] in violation of the provincial Game Protection Act.  Jim had hunted the deer on a reserve and used the meat in his home.  Jim fought the charges against him by saying he had treaty rights, and that the British North America Act and federal [[Indian Act]] ensured the province could not apply this law to Aboriginals.

==Decision==
Justice Hunter, on the BC Supreme Court, found that the conviction should be overturned.  He pointed to section 91(24) of the British North America Act to note that "Indians" are under federal jurisdiction.  The federal government had then enacted the Indian Act, and it stated that "Indian lands" are "managed" by the [[Governor in Council]].  Hunter interpreted the word "managed" to be broad in its application, and it should include governing hunting and fishing on reserves (Indian lands).  Hunter also noted the federal government did regulate Aboriginal hunting in other provinces, suggesting it would have jurisdiction in [[British Columbia]] as well.  The fact that there was no such regulation in British Columbia at the time possibly related to treaties.

==Aftermath==
Generally, provincial laws apply to Aboriginals.  Provincial laws do not apply when they affect "Indianness," primary Aboriginal issues.  As constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] writes, "Hunting on a reserve is such a significant element of traditional Indian ways that it should probably be free of provincial regulation."  He points to ''R. v. Jim'' to back this up.  As for hunting outside reserves, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case ''[[Kruger and al. v. The Queen]]'' (1978) suggested this was not "Indianness," whereas ''[[Dick v. The Queen]]'' (1985) suggested it was.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick Douglass (1).jpg|thumb|right|240px|Portrait of [[Frederick Douglass]] in the D.C. Recorder of Deeds Building. Frederick Douglass was the first recorder of deeds for the [[District of Columbia]]]]

'''Recorder of deeds''' is a government office tasked with maintaining public records and documents, especially records relating to [[real property|real estate]] ownership that provide persons other than the owner of a property with real [[property law|rights over that property]].

==Background==
The offices with similar duties (varying by [[jurisdiction]]) include [[registrar general]], register of deeds, registrar of deeds, registrar of [[title (property)|titles]]. The office of such an official may be referred to as the deeds registry or deeds office. In the United States, the recorder of deeds is often an elected county office and is called the county recorder. In some U.S. states, the functions of a recorder of deeds are a responsibility of the [[county clerk]] (or the county's [[clerk of court]]), and the official may be called a clerk-recorder or recorder-clerk.

The recorder of deeds provides a single location in which records of real property rights are recorded and may be researched by interested parties. The record of deeds often maintains documents regularly recorded by the recorder of deeds, including deeds, [[Mortgage law|mortgages]], [[mechanic's lien]]s, [[Legal release|releases]] and [[plat]]s, among others. To allow full access to deeds recorded throughout the office history, several indexes may be maintained, which include [[grantor–grantee index]]es, [[tract index]]es, and [[Lot and Block survey system|plat maps]]. Storage methods to record registry entries include paper, [[microform]], and computer.

The principles of statutory, case, and [[common law]] are given effect by the recorder of deeds, insofar as it relates to vested ownership in land and other real rights. Because [[estate in land]] can be held in so many complex ways, a single deeds registry provides some clarity, even though it cannot "guarantee" those real property rights.

The legal certainty provided by a title deed issued under the registration of the recorder of deeds is of great significance to all parties who hold, or wish to acquire rights in real property. Certainty of title is the basis for the investment of massive amounts of money in real estate development for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural use each year. This is why the meticulous recording of registration information by the recorder of deeds is so important.

Each document recorded against title to real estate can be examined and the portion of the [[bundle of rights]] that it includes can be determined. These records can assist interested parties in researching the history of land and the [[chain of title]] for any property and purpose.

==Philippines: Registry of Deeds==
The Registry of Deeds exists in almost all cities and municipalities in the Philippines and it has a primary duty of registering and keeping all documents pertaining to transfer of real property and issuance of certificates of land title, whether original, transfer or condominium as well as [[chattel mortgage]] papers. The said agency is under the supervision of the [[Land Registration Authority (Philippines)|Land Registration Authority]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]].

==South Africa: Deeds Registry==
The South African system of deeds registry is unique in that it is associated with tenure security. When [[Conveyancer|conveyancers]] transfer title, they are expected to follow rigid procedures which involve ensuring the title and the property comply with all the relevant legislation and regulations, leading to a high degree of certainty and accuracy. Recent concerns about the standard of legal education in South Africa, however, has raised concerns about whether this is still the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghostdigest.com/articles/a-fact-or-a-fallacy/55369|title=A fact or a fallacy? - GhostDigest|website=www.ghostdigest.com|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African Registrar of Deeds is responsible for the national system of deeds offices which, through a juristic foundation and long-standing practices and procedures, has the effect of “guaranteeing” title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.connectarealty.co.za/images/downloads/Land%20Registration%20System%20In%20South%20Africa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deeds Registries Act and Sectional Titles Act are applied to regulate the deeds registry system, and form the foundation of land registration in South Africa.

==United States: Recorders of Deeds==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hennepin County, Minnesota]] --&gt;
In the U.S., most recorders of deeds are elected officials who serve the area of a county or equivalent jurisdiction.

In some states, the recorder of deeds may also act as a public posting place for documents that are not directly related to [[estates in land]], such as corporate [[charter]]s, [[military discharge]]s, [[Uniform Commercial Code]] records, applications for marriage licenses, and [[judgment (law)|judgments]].

Deeds in a few states of the U.S. are maintained under the [[Torrens title]] system or some limited implementation of it. (For example: [[Minnesota]], some property in [[Massachusetts]], [[Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[North Carolina]], [[Ohio]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].)

Other U.S. states maintain their deeds under [[common law]]; typically, they are filed in chronological order with a grantor/grantee index.

The '''Reichskriegsgericht''' (RKG; {{lang-en|Reich Court-Martial}}) was the highest [[German military law|military court]] in [[Nazi Germany]] .

==Legal basics and responsibilities==
[[File:Berlin-Charlottenburg Postkarte 052.jpg|thumb|left|New ''Reichsmilitärgericht'' building (left), postcard, {{circa|1915}}]]
After the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]]-led [[Unification of Germany]], the [[German Empire]] with effect from 1 October 1900 had established a particular [[court-martial]] jurisdiction ({{lang-de|Militärgerichtsbarkeit}}) to try soldiers of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], with the ''Reichsmilitärgericht'' (RMG) as the supreme court. The presiding judge in the rank of a general or admiral was appointed directly by the [[German Emperor]]. From 1910, the court had its seat in a newly erected prestigious building in [[Charlottenburg]]. During [[World War I]], German military law enabled military courts to try not only soldiers but also civilians held to have violated the military law. In the post-war [[Weimar Republic]] (1919-1933), the separate jurisdiction for military personnel was abolished by the law of 17 August 1920, based on Article 106 of the [[Weimar Constitution]]. 

After the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, courts-martial were reinstated by law of May 12, with effect from 1 January 1934. During the [[German re-armament]] and the deployment of the [[Wehrmacht]] armed forces, the ''Reichskriegsgericht'' was re-established as supreme court on 1 October 1936. According to the Wartime Criminal Code of Procedure (''Kriegsstrafverfahrensordnung'', KStVO) enacted by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Wilhelm Keitel]] on 17 August 1938, the RKG had jurisdictional competence over acts of [[high treason]], [[treason]], and aiding the enemy (''Kriegsverrat''); if the defendant was not directly liable to prosecution by his commander-in-chief. The court also had sole responsibility for all legal proceedings against highest-ranking Wehrmacht officers. 
[[File:Gedenktafel Kriegsdienstverweigerer.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque to the conscientious objectors and members of the Resistance sentenced at the ''Reichskriegsgericht'']]
For all severe cases of ''[[Wehrkraftzersetzung]]'' ("undermining military force") according to Wartime Special Penal Code (''Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung'', KSSVO), the RKG was the first and last instance. By this accusation, the court sentenced numerous [[conscientious objector]]s to death. By ordinance of 18 May 1940, proceedings against civilians were handed over to ''[[Sondergericht]]'' courts; from 29 January 1943, the "[[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]]" (''Volksgerichtshof'') had exclusive jurisdiction over all accusations of public ''Wehrkraftzersetzung'' and intentionally evading military service.

The President of the ''Reichskriegsgericht'' was able to affirm or to set aside a judgement; as was Hitler in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht.

== Organisation ==
Der Dienstsitz des Reichskriegsgerichts lag bis 1943 in der Witzlebenstraße 4–10 im [[Berlin]]er Bezirk [[Berlin-Charlottenburg|Charlottenburg]], wo später von 1946 bis zum Abzug der Alliierten das [[Kammergericht]] untergebracht war. Wegen der zunehmenden Bombenabwürfe auf Berlin – [[Luftangriffe der Alliierten auf Berlin|durch Amerikaner und Briten]] und [[Sowjetische Luftangriffe auf Berlin|durch die Sowjetunion]] – wurde das Reichskriegsgericht 1943 zuerst nach [[Potsdam]] und dann nach [[Torgau]] in die Zietenkaserne verlegt. Am 15. April 1945 stellte das Reichskriegsgericht dort seine Tätigkeit ein. Der Kommandostab des Reichskriegsgerichtes wurde am 5. Mai auf dem Schlossgut in [[Kundratice]] verhaftet.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Gribbohm: ''Das Reichskriegsgericht...'', Berlin 2004, {{ISBN|3-8305-0585-X}}, S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erster Präsident des Reichskriegsgerichts war General [[Walter Heitz]]. Von September 1939 bis Ende Oktober 1944 amtierte Admiral [[Max Bastian]]&lt;ref&gt;Er wurde am 31. Oktober 1944 zur [[Z. D. (Militärsprache)|Disposition]] des [[Oberbefehlshaber]]s der [[Kriegsmarine]] gestellt und am 30. November 1944 ehrenvoll aus dem Dienst in den Ruhestand verabschiedet.&lt;/ref&gt;; sein Nachfolger wurde General [[Hans-Karl von Scheele]]. Bis Kriegsende hatten insgesamt 190 Richter für kürzere oder längere Zeit am Reichskriegsgericht gewirkt.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Baumann, Magnus Koch: ''„Was damals Recht war...“ - Soldaten und Zivilisten vor Gerichten der Wehrmacht.'' Berlin-Brandenburg 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-89809-079-7}}, S. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Das Reichskriegsgericht bestand aus drei, ab November 1941 aus vier Senaten, denen jeweils vier Militärjustizbeamte und drei Offiziere zugeteilt waren. Die Verhandlungen leitete ein Senatspräsident, dem ein Reichskriegsgerichtsrat sowie drei Offiziere zur Seite standen. Kurzzeitig wurde 1943 ein zentrales Sonderstandgericht der Wehrmacht angegliedert; 1945 wurden die Senate auf drei Richter reduziert. Dem Reichskriegsgericht untergeordnet war die Reichskriegsanwaltschaft als Anklagebehörde mit zwanzig Militärjuristen. Oberreichskriegsanwälte waren [[Walter Rehdans]] und ab 1943 [[Alexander Kraell]].&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Haase: ''Das Reichskriegsgericht und der Widerstand gegen die nationalsozialistische Herrschaft,'' Berlin 1993, {{ISBN|3-926082-04-6}}, S. 11 (= Katalog der Sonderausstellung der Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand)&lt;/ref&gt;

Im Zeitraum von August 1939 bis zum 7. Februar 1945 fällte das Reichskriegsgericht 1.189 [[Todesstrafe|Todesurteile]], darunter 313 wegen Landesverrats, 96 wegen Hochverrats, 24 wegen Kriegsverrats, 340 wegen Spionage und 251 wegen Verweigerung und Wehrkraftzersetzung.&lt;ref&gt; Manfred Messerschmidt: ''Das System Wehrmachtjustiz.'' In: Ulrich Baumann, Magnus Koch: ''„Was damals Recht war...“ - Soldaten und Zivilisten vor Gerichten der Wehrmacht.'' Berlin-Brandenburg 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-89809-079-7}}, S. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Insgesamt 1.049 dieser Todesurteile wurden nachweislich vollstreckt.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Haase: ''Das Reichskriegsgericht...,'' Berlin 1993, {{ISBN|3-926082-04-6}}, S. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obwohl die [[Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung|Verordnung über das Sonderstrafrecht im Kriege und bei besonderem Einsatz]] für minderschwere Fälle Freiheitsstrafen vorsah, verhängte das RKG wegen ''Kriegsdienstverweigerung aus religiösen Gründen'' fast ausnahmslos die Todesstrafe. Diese Urteile betrafen in erster Linie [[Zeugen Jehovas im Nationalsozialismus|Zeugen Jehovas]]. Nach zahlreichen Interventionen von [[Seelsorger]]n ging das Reichskriegsgericht dazu über, bereits verurteilten Verweigerern die Möglichkeit eines Widerrufs einzuräumen. In diesem Falle wurde eine Haftstrafe von drei bis vier Jahren Dauer verhängt, die nach dem Kriege anzutreten sei.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Haase: ''Das Reichskriegsgericht...,'' Berlin 1993, {{ISBN|3-926082-04-6}}, S. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neben [[Sondergericht]]en und dem [[Volksgerichtshof]] war auch das Reichskriegsgericht mit Verfahren nach dem [[Nacht-und-Nebel-Erlass]] befasst. Von Dezember 1942 bis September 1943 führte das RKG mehr als 20 Verhandlungen gegen rund 80 Angehörige der Widerstandsgruppe um [[Arvid Harnack]] und [[Harro Schulze-Boysen]]. Dabei wandte der 2. Senat unter Alexander Kraell die sogenannte „[[Gewaltverbrecherverordnung]]“ an, um mehrere Frauen hart bestrafen zu können, denen lediglich [[Beihilfe (Strafrecht)|Beihilfe]] nachzuweisen war.

In einem Urteil vom 2. April 1940 hatte das Reichskriegsgericht die Bedeutung des Begriffs „Öffentlichkeit“ extensiv auf private Gespräche ausgedehnt, so dass jede „defätistische Äußerung“ als Wehrkraftzersetzung gelten konnte.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Haase: ''Das Reichskriegsgericht...'', Berlin 1993, {{ISBN|3-926082-04-6}}, S. 12 mit Anm. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Als „Wesensmerkmale der Praxis des Reichskriegsgerichts“ zählt Norbert Haase die drakonischen Urteile nach weit auslegbaren nationalsozialistischen Strafgesetzen, den Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit in den als „Geheime Kommandosache“ geführten Prozessen, die oft praktizierte Nicht-Aushändigung von Anklageschriften und die oftmals auf eine Alibifunktion beschnittene Verteidigungsmöglichkeit auf.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Haase: ''Das Reichskriegsgericht...,'' Berlin 1993, {{ISBN|3-926082-04-6}}, S. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Im [[Zweiter Weltkrieg|Zweiten Weltkrieg]] seien – so eine rechtliche Bewertung der Institution – die maßgebenden [[gerichtsverfassungsrecht]]lichen und prozessualen Grundlagen geändert worden zur Durchsetzung dessen, was man „für militärisch zweckmäßig und für im NS-Sinne kriegsnotwendig“ hielt.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Gribbohm: ''Das Reichskriegsgericht...,'' Berlin 2004, {{ISBN|3-8305-0585-X}}, S. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aufhebung der Urteile ==

1998 wurden durch ein [[Gesetz zur Aufhebung nationalsozialistischer Unrechtsurteile in der Strafrechtspflege]]&lt;ref&gt;NS-AufhG vom 25. August 1998 ([[Bundesgesetzblatt (Deutschland)|BGBl I]], S. 2501 [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bundesrecht/ns-aufhg/gesamt.pdf NS—AufhG] (PDF; 37&amp;nbsp;kB) vom 25.

Darunter fallen auch viele Urteile des Reichskriegsgericht. Mit einer Ergänzung des NS-AufhG aus dem Jahr 2002 wurden die Urteile von Gerichten aus der NS-Zeit gegen [[Deserteur]]e und [[Homosexualität|Homosexuelle]] aufgehoben. Erst mit einer weiteren Ergänzung des NS-AufhG von 2009 wurden auch die Urteile wegen [[Kriegsverrat im Nationalsozialismus |Kriegsverrat]] nach § 57 [[Militärstrafgesetzbuch |MStGB]] gesetzlich aufgehoben.&lt;ref&gt; Änderungsgesetze zum NS-AufhG (2002 BGBl I, S. 2714) und (2009 BGBl I, S. 3150)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Replevin''' ({{IPAc-en|r|I|'|p|l|ɛ|v|@|n}}) or '''claim and delivery''' (sometimes called '''''revendication''''') is a legal remedy which enables a person to recover personal property taken wrongfully or unlawfully, pending a final determination by a court of law, and to obtain compensation for resulting losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498381/replevin|title=Replevin|website= britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology== 
The word "replevin" is of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] origin and is the noun form of the verb "replevy". This comes from the Old French ''replevir'', derived from ''plevir'' ("to pledge"), which is derived from the Latin ''replegiare'' ("to redeem a thing taken by another").

==Nature==
In ''The Law of Torts'', John Fleming has written:

{{cquote|
From medieval times, there has also come down to us a summary process, known as replevin, by which a man out of whose possession goods have been taken may obtain their return until the right to the goods can be determined by a court of law. Replevin arose out of the need of a turbulent society to discourage resort to self help and although for a long time primarily used in disputes about distress between landlord and tenant, it was gradually expanded to cover all cases of allegedly wrongful dispossession. If the plaintiff wanted return of his chattel ''in specie'', replevin was a more appropriate remedy than either [[Trespass to chattels|trespass]] or [[trover]] in which only damages could be recovered.  Restoration of the property is, of course, only provisional, pending determination of title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fleming|first= John|year= 1971|title= The Law of Torts|edition= 4th|location= Melbourne|publisher= The Law Book Company|page= |isbn=  0-45515790-1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In common law, several types of action existed with respect to deprivation of possession (being subdivided into the wrongful taking of chattels and the unjust detention of them, even where the original taking was lawful):{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|pp=142{{endash}}143}}

* In the case of wrongful taking:
** A writ of replevin was available only for an unlawful taking in the nature of a wrongful distress, where restitution could be made for the goods wrongfully taken (being in the nature of a redelivery of the pledge or the thing taken in distress){{sfn|Blackstone|1771|p=147}} with damages for the loss sustained by such action.{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|pp=142{{endash}}143}} As distrained goods are in the custody of the law, any attempt to take them back by force without a writ of replevin could be contested by writ of ''rescous'' or ''[[de parco fracto]]'', with a remedy in damages.{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|p=144}}
** A writ of trespass ''[[vi et armis]]'' was available in the taking of goods, with a remedy in damages.{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|p=150}}
** An action of trover and [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] was available for the non-forcible taking of goods, with a remedy in damages.{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|p=150}}
* In the case of unjust detention:
** Replevin lay to recover goods still held after a tender of amends.{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|p=151}}
** Detinue lay to recover lent goods where the holder refused to return them to the owner. However, the defendant was allowed to exculpate himself by oath, so this action was displaced by that of trover and conversion.{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|p=151{{endash}}152}}

At common law, the ordinary action for the recovery of goods wrongfully taken was originally one of [[detinue]], but no means of immediate recovery was possible until the action was tried. Replevin arose to deal with the matter of the illegal [[distraint|distress]] of goods for rent or ''damage feasant'',{{sfn|Oldham|Foster|1889|p=346}} in order to procure their restoration to the owner.{{sfn|Woodfall|Lely|Aggs|1902|p=584}} Illegal distress has been held to occur where:{{sfn|Woodfall|Lely|Aggs|1902|p=584}}

#no relationship of landlord and tenant exists at all,
#there is no demise at a fixed rent,
#no rent is due, or none due to the person who has distrained,
#goods have been released before the distress, or tendered before the impounding,
#the entry was illegal, or
#things privileged from distress (ie, neither goods nor chattel) have been seized.

Replevin will not lie where if any part of the rent claimed was due, but this defence is not effective where the only rent claimed by the landlord is not recoverable by distress.{{sfn|Woodfall|Lely|Aggs|1902|p=584}}

It has been held that replevin applies to any wrongful taking of goods and chattel.{{sfn|Oldham|Foster|1889|pp=344{{endash}}345}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Allen v Sharpe|link=|reporter=ER|year=1848|num=506|volume=154|firstpage=529|pinpoint=|parallelcite=2 Ex 352|date=15 May 1848|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=George v Chambers|link=|reporter=ER|year=1843|num=240|volume=152|firstpage=752|pinpoint=|parallelcite=11 M&amp;W 149|date=24 January 1843|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A party seeking relief may elect to adjudicate the right to possession prior to obtaining immediate relief to obtain the property in question. In such cases, replevin actions are still designed to afford the petitioning party a relatively speedy process for obtaining judgment, as compared to typical lawsuits. The summary remedy afforded by replevin statutes can be thwarted by defendants who contest the claimant's right to possession, by contesting the plaintiff's complaint, and insisting on traditional litigation involving discovery, and in some cases, trial by jury.

Replevin actions are often filed by secured creditors seeking to take possession of collateral securing loans or other debt instruments, such as retail installment contracts. A common example is where an automobile finance company initiates a replevin action to gain possession of a vehicle, following payment default. Replevin actions are usually employed when the lender cannot find the collateral, or cannot peacefully obtain it through [[Self-help (law)|self-help]] [[repossession]]. Replevin actions may also be pursued by true owners of property, e.g., consignors seeking return of consigned property that the party in possession will not relinquish for one reason or another.

Replevin is an action of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], not [[criminal law]]. Therefore, because of the differing [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], a defendant found not guilty of criminal theft may nevertheless be required to return the disputed item or items in civil court.

Replevin does not provide compensation for any monetary loss arising from the loss of use of some income-producing property item. Note also that replevin involves return of an actual specific item or items, not monetary compensation for loss. Thus, it would not normally be used in a case regarding a sum of money, as distinct from the loss of a rare coin, for instance, where the return of the actual coin itself was at issue. In occasional cases of no particular [[numismatism|numismatic]] interest, however, ''e.g.,'' a [[bag of money]] whose contents have not yet been counted, an action may be filed to recover the actual  coins and/or bills in question if they are still together.

The question of replevin becomes [[mootness|moot]] should the item in question no longer exist as an entity, ''i.e.'' if it is destroyed, or in the case of a bag of money, for instance, if the money has been spent. For this reason, the item is normally seized by the court when the action is filed and held until the decision is reached to prevent the waste of a legal action over a nonexistent object and, further, to ensure that the item in question is not destroyed, spent, etc., during the action. This can be used to force a [[settlement (law)|settlement]] from the [[defendant]], just or unjust, as he or she is deprived of the use of the disputed object for the duration of the action; if this results in a financial loss, the defendant may find it advantageous to merely pay a relatively small settlement and have the item returned quickly.

Replevin remains the modern action, albeit defined by statute, for recovery of chattels pending a decision of the right of possession. It lies only where the possession was taken from the plaintiff, whether under colour of legal process or otherwise, by an act having the nature of a trespass.{{sfn|Kiralfy|1962|p=405}}

==History==
One of the oldest actions in the royal courts, replevin had its roots in the law of customary courts, and its formal origin can be attributed to [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvil]], [[Justiciar|Chief Justiciar]] of England during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154–1189).{{sfn|Blackstone|1771|p=145}} Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy.{{sfn|Kiralfy|1962|p=403}} Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (''distractio''). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the incidents of tenure were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as ''damage feasant''. When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock ''damage feasant'', the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving "gage and pledge" – a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay in the fact that the distrainor did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the distrainor that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Enever|first= Frank Alfred|year= 1931|title= History of the law of distress for rent and damage feasant|others = Introduction by [[Edward Jenks]]|url= |location= London|publisher= Routledge|page= |oclc= 250426259|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kiralfy|1962|pp=403{{endash}}404}}

The action in replevin began to appear in the thirteenth century. It seems clear that originally the action of replevin lay simply where the question to be determined was that of wrongful distress. Excess and abuse of distress was punished.&lt;ref&gt;Year Book 32 Edward I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Year Book 33 Edward I p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;52 Henry III (1267), cc. 1,2,3,4&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the distrainor did not get possession he was not originally liable in trespass, and the spheres of the two forms of action remained distinct. During the fourteenth century, after some vacillation by judges, it was held that the plaintiff could elect which remedy he chose when the chattels had been distrained.&lt;ref&gt;Year Book 7 Henry IV, M., pl. 5 at f. 29&lt;/ref&gt; It was also held that replevin could be used in place of the writ of ''trespass de bonis aspotatis'' (trespass by the asportation of goods). In reality, there is little evidence this substitution ever occurred with any frequency, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ames|first= James Barr|author-link=James Barr Ames|year= 1913|title= Lectures on legal history and miscellaneous legal essays|url= https://archive.org/stream/lecturesonlegalh00ames#page/182/mode/2up|location= Cambridge|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 183|isbn= |accessdate= }}, at fn. 2&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kiralfy|1962|p=404}} The rule involved interference with the possession of a chattel by the rightful owner. In 1856, ''Mennie v. Blake'' summarized the law of replevin by stating, "... it seems clear that replevin is not maintainable unless in a case in which there has been first a taking out of the possession of the owner.  This stands upon authority and the reason of the thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Mennie v. Blake|link=|reporter=ER|year=1856|num=745|volume=119|firstpage=1078|pinpoint=849|parallelcite=6 El &amp; Bl 842|date=3 July 1856|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mere claim by the distrainor that he had a right to the chattels distrained was a technicality that ended the action in replevin. It was then necessary to re-file using a new writ invented in the early fourteenth century, called the writ ''de proprietate probanda'' – a writ "concerning the proof of ownership".&lt;ref&gt;H. E. L., III p. 284, n.7; S. S., p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kiralfy|1962|p=404}}

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the action of [[trover]] also arose, which largely replaced that of trespass in the matter of wrongful distress. Replevin and trover never completely coincided, because there was a limitation on replevin.{{sfn|Kiralfy|1962|p=404}}

Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 came into effect in England and Wales, a defendant was able to exercise an option of paying damages instead of restoring the actual goods.&lt;ref&gt;Common Law Procedure Act 1854, s. 78, discussed at {{cite book |last= Kerr|first= Robert Malcolm|year= 1854|title= The Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, with practical notes|url= https://archive.org/stream/commonlawproced00kerrgoog#page/n6/mode/2up|location= London|publisher= Butterworths|pages= 50{{endash}}51|isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 65 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] made provision for the common law rules governing replevin in [[England and Wales]] to be replaced,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = si| year = 2014| number = 768| si = The Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (Commencement No. 11) Order 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this provision did not become effective until 6 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type = act| year = 2007|chapter = 15|act = Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Replevin actions are common and fall into two types of action: if immediate possession of the property is sought and if the party filing the action is content to wait for an adjudication of final rights. In a case in which immediate possession of property is sought, the petitioning creditor is often required to post a bond to protect the defendant against wrongful detention. That approach can be a very powerful weapon in a case of someone holding property wrongly because it deprives the holder of the use of the property while the case is awaiting trial, thereby putting pressure on the holder to settle the matter quickly.

This replevin process falls into two stages:
#the replevy, the steps that the owner takes to secure the physical possession of the goods, by giving security for prosecuting the action and for the return of the goods if the case goes against him and
#the action (suit) of replevin itself (at [[common law]], the ordinary action for the recovery of goods wrongfully taken would be one of [[detinue]]; but no means of immediate recovery liable to be seized).

Replevin is used when the party having the right of property cannot simply invoke self-help and take the property back. If the party has the ability to do so directly, the action is referred to as [[repossession]]. For example, in the states of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Louisiana]], if a person who finances an automobile, becomes a [[registered owner]] of that vehicle and fails to make payments as agreed, the [[lienholder]] cannot simply repossess the vehicle. The lienholder must go to court and obtain an order of replevin.

In many cases, parties initiating a replevin action will elect not to gain immediate possession of the collateral or other wrongfully-held property and will instead file the replevin action without posting a bond.  Once [[service of process]] is achieved, the defendant will likely be required to attend a court hearing on a specific date, then the parties' rights to possession will be adjudicated. A plaintiff creditor can typically prevail in the case by offering testimony and business records showing the borrower/defendant's obligation to pay, and default in payment. The Court will thereafter issue a judgment and authorize issuance of a writ of replevin, which is served by a sheriff's deputy, working in conjunction with persons hired or employed by the creditor to take the collateral or other property into its possession. The sheriff's role is to keep the peace and allow the creditor to get its property, without threat from the borrower. Once the creditor takes the property into its possession, it can sell the collateral, and apply the proceeds to the debt owed by the borrower.

In other cases, replevy is used to prevent damages that may occur from the continued use of an item, such as a public utility meter. In the case of non-payment of a public utility, a meter is typically left on the premise to allow reconnection should the balance due be paid, or if the person owing the bill sells the premise to another person who does not owe arrears to the utility, however, it is possible for one to reconnect the device and continue obtaining the commodity in question. In such cases, the utility could seek replevin for the utility meter itself, thereby preventing this practice.

==Law of replevin internationally==
In the 1899 case of ''McGregor v. McGregor'',&lt;ref&gt;''McGregor v. McGregor'', 6 BCR 432 (1899)&lt;/ref&gt; Irving J of the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] wrote:

{{cquote|
An action of replevin may be brought

#where goods have been wrongfully distrained or
#where goods have been otherwise, i.e. otherwise than by distress, wrongfully taken or detained.

The word ‘wrongfully’ is applicable to both cases. ‘Wrongfully’ ... imports the infringement of some right, and any invasion of the civil rights of another is in itself a legal wrong, and the appropriate action for the violation of the legal right unconnected with contract is an action for tort. The early history of replevin action in England is traced (as) ... "The nature of the complaint in the action was for a tortious taking of the goods." Our British Columbia replevin action, which is wider than the English, gives the right to replevy to the party who could maintain trespass or trover.  It is given, as it were, supplementary to, or in aid of, the remedy which those actions afford; but as all three actions, trespass, trover and replevin are classed ... as actions of tort, I think the action under our British Columbia statute is for the tortious taking or tortious detention of goods.
}}

Provisions analogous to replevin in the case of distraint are found in the [[Civil Code of Quebec]]&lt;ref&gt;known as [[hypothec|movable hypothec without delivery]], at {{cite CCQ|2696}} ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St Lucia]] (arts. 1888 et seq.), which was reproduced in substance from French law, which is also in force in [[Mauritius]]. There are analogous provisions in the [[Spain|Spanish]] Civil Code (art. 1922).

Similar provisions are also found in:

'''Robert Brown''' is a Scottish man who spent 25 years in jail for a crime he did not commit. In January 1977, Annie Walsh was beaten to death in her home in [[Manchester]], England and Brown was first interrogated and beaten by the police officers investigating this crime. Under duress, Brown signed a confession and was found guilty at trial. He maintained his innocence throughout his prison sentence even going so far as denying himself parole by not admitting to the crime. He was released on appeal in 2002 and is thought to be one of the longest serving victims of a miscarriage of justice in the United Kingdom.

==Background==
Brown grew up in [[Kilbowie]] in [[Dumbartonshire]] and was placed into care when he was nine years old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Innocent man jailed for 25 years for crime he did not commit calls for justice reform|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/15671986.Innocent_man_jailed_for_25_years_for_crime_he_did_not_commit_calls_for_justice_reform/|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=Herald Scotland|date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by his mother after he witnessed his dad beating her up.&lt;ref name=":HS:" /&gt; At the age of 15 he took himself out of care and returned home where he and his father "came to blows". His dad threw him out soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=":HS:" /&gt; Brown admits that he partook in a life of petty crime. He later moved to Manchester to make "a fresh start" after going to a football match in the city.&lt;ref name=":BBC:"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brocklehurst|first1=Steven|title=Locked up for life for crimes they didn't commit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-41108765|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in Manchester he met a girl, Cathy Shaw, who later became his girlfriend.&lt;ref name=":TS:" /&gt;

On 31 January 1977, factory worker Annie Walsh, who was 51 at the time, was found battered to death in her flat in Charles Berry Crescent, [[Hulme]], [[Greater Manchester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fight for "justice" after 25 years|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/fight-for-justice-after-25-years-1167760|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25-year-old murder inquiry re-opened|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2723871.stm|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=4 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a man who had come to read the electricity meter.&lt;ref name=":HS:"&gt;{{cite news|title=He spent 25 years  in jail for a murder he didn't commit.

In May 1977, the police went to the flat that Brown shared with his girlfriend Cathy; it was in the same block of flats where Annie Walsh had lived and been murdered.&lt;ref name=":HS:" /&gt; He was originally arrested for non-payment of a fine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murder probe reopens - 25 years on|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/murder-probe-reopens---25-1182760|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=30 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was taken in for questioning without his rights being read to him and held for 32 hours without legal representation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some sources state 36 hours.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":BBC3:" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Killer’s confession ‘false’|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/killer-s-confession-false-1-502305|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=9 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial, Brown stated that the confession was beaten and coerced out of him and when he did ask for a lawyer, he was told by the policemen that "only guilty men need a lawyer".&lt;ref name=":TS2:" /&gt;

The trial was presided over by [[Helenus Milmo|Judge Helenus Milmo]] who directed the jury's attention to the fact that it came down to whether or not they believed the police, or whether they believed Brown was innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopkins|first1=Nick|title=Man wrongly convicted of murder freed after 25 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/14/ukcrime.nickhopkins|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury convicted Brown of murder and Judge Milmo sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 15 years.&lt;ref name=":BBC3:"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bail denied to 1977 murderer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2159478.stm|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=30 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==

Brown appealed the sentencing in 1978, but the appeal was turned down.&lt;ref name=":BBC2:"&gt;{{cite news|title=Killer's case goes to appeal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2041286.stm|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=12 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal was lodged again with then [[Home Secretary]], [[Michael Howard]] in 1993, but this was also denied in the following year.&lt;ref name=":HS2:"&gt;{{cite news|title=Innocent man jailed for 25 years for crime he did not commit calls for justice reform|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15671986.Innocent_man_jailed_for_25_years_for_crime_he_did_not_commit_calls_for_justice_reform/|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Herald Scotland|date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst in prison, Brown was caught in what [[Simon Hattenstone]], writing in [[The Guardian]], describes as "the Miscarriage of Justice [[Catch-22]]" (the [[Innocent prisoner's dilemma]]); because he would not admit his guilt in the crime for which he was imprisoned, he could not be rehabilitated and be deemed fit to be put in front of a parole board.&lt;ref name=":TG1:" /&gt; Brown refused the chance of parole from a point of view that investigative journalist Eamonn O'Neill called a point of logic; "how could he be paroled for a crime that he did not commit?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neill|first1=Eamonn|title=Will Robert Brown ever be released?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/jun/21/prisonsandprobation|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=21 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst in prison, Brown shared a cell with [[Paul Hill (Guildford Four)|Paul Hill]], one of the [[Guildford Four]], who, after having his conviction quashed and then released, later campaigned against Brown's miscarriage of justice. The case was again referred to the [[Court of Appeal]] in 2002 by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (CCRC).&lt;ref name=":BBC2:" /&gt;

==Release==
An appeal court in November 2002 decided that Brown should be allowed to go free after declaring his conviction unsafe. The appeal was due to be heard over two days, but the judges at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in [[London]], quashed the conviction within minutes when the Counsel for the Crown explained that he could not argue the case on the evidence presented before the court; the appeal lasted only 18 minutes before it was deemed an 'unsafe conviction'.&lt;ref name=":TS2:" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Find who really did kill Annie'|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/find-who-really-did-kill-annie-1181470|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=4 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The appeal court had heard evidence that the fibres on Walsh's coat had not matched to Brown, but to another man who was questioned about the murder at the same time. This evidence was not given in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Corrupt police behind false conviction'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2463523.stm|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=13 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic analysis of Brown's confession was given in evidence stating that it could not have been dictated to the police officers by Brown as the police had said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conviction quashed – after 25 years in jail|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/conviction-quashed-after-25-years-in-jail-1-2443708|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=13 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coulthard|first1=Malcolm|last2=Johnson|first2=Alison|title=An introduction to forensic linguistics : language in evidence|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-32023-8|page=212|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of blood-soaked jeans had also been used against Brown in his interrogation with the police claiming they were the ones that Brown had used in the murder. In fact, they belonged to a woman who had suffered a miscarriage in them and the police knew this.&lt;ref name=":TG1:" /&gt; The sight of the jeans being presented in court made Brown burst into tears as he had known the woman who had had the miscarriage in them; this was misinterpreted as guilt of the murder on his part by the people in the court.&lt;ref name=":TS:" /&gt;

The three judges presiding over Brown's 2002 appeal heard evidence which, in their summing up, prompted them to describe the arresting officers in Brown's case to be part of a "culture of corruption and a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naughton|first1=Michael|title=The innocent and the criminal justice system : a sociological analysis of miscarriages of justice|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-230-21690-7|page=28|chapter=2: Perspectives and Definitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Detective Superintendent]] [[Peter Topping (police officer)|Peter Topping]] of Greater Manchester Police had written a report in the 1980s detailing corruption practices within the force during the 1970s and beyond. Despite the report containing circumstantial evidence that could have alleviated Brown's time in prison, it was not made available to his legal team until a few days before the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction because of a [[Public-interest immunity|Public-Interest Immunity]] certificate concerning the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Run for freedom|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/run-for-freedom-1143644|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=10 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":HS3:"&gt;{{cite news|title=Free at last from the abyss of hell Robert Brown served 25 years for murder he did not commit|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11910594.Free_at_last_from_the_abyss_of_hell_Robert_Brown_served_25_years_for_murder_he_did_not_commit/|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=HeraldScotland|date=14 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Since his release, Brown has been campaigning for reforms to the legal system.&lt;ref name=":BBC4:"&gt;{{cite news|title=Justice victims call for support|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4668176.stm|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also given compensation for his 25-year prison sentence, of which the government demanded back £100,000 for which they deemed payment for bed and board whilst he was in prison.&lt;ref name=":HS2:" /&gt; Brown is believed to be one of the longest serving victims of a miscarriage of justice in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New hunt for killer in 1977 case|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/new-hunt-for-killer-in-1977-case-1137355|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=9 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathy Shaw, Brown's girlfriend in 1977, died in 1992 at the age of 35 from alcohol poisoning. Brown and Shaw's family both attribute her death to how his conviction affected her.&lt;ref name=":BBC:" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":TS:" /&gt;

It was later revealed that Brown could not take legal action against any of the police officers who were responsible for his fake confession or beatings. An investigation found "insufficient evidence" of misconduct in relation to Brown's detention, interviews or arrest.&lt;ref name=":BBC4:" /&gt; Detective Chief Inspector Jack Butler was sentenced to four years in jail after being found guilty of accepting bribes and perverting the course of justice in 1983, but that was in relation to another case not related to Robert Brown's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calls to reopen murder probe|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/calls-to-reopen-murder-probe-1183610|accessdate=28 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening|date=7 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Brown's Court of Appeal hearing in 2002, his defending counsel said of Butler that "not only was he involved in corruption himself but he presided over a conspiracy of corruption amongst other officers at Platt Lane police station [in [[Fallowfield]], Manchester] between 1973 and 1979."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pook|first1=Sally|title=Victim of corrupt police freed after 25 years in jail|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1413114/Victim-of-corrupt-police-freed-after-25-years-in-jail.html|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=14 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court quashes murder conviction|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/court-quashes-murder-conviction-1182715|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=30 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler resigned from the police force in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wrongly jailed for 25 years unhappy with police inquiry|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/man-wrongly-jailed-for-25-years-unhappy-with-police-inquiry-1-650963|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=6 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) informed Robert Brown that there would be no prosecution of the police officers involved in his arrest and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allison|first1=Eric|title=No action on police corruption|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/29/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation1|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Channel 4]] screened a documentary about Brown's case which was entitled ''Picking Up the Pieces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heartbreak in justice battle|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/heartbreak-in-justice-battle-1115843|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Manchester Evening News|date=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ciallella|first1=Rebecca|title=Picking Up the Pieces: Robert|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2090588/|website=imdb.com|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in The Guardian described it as "searing stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banks-Smith|first1=Nancy|title=The Real Bangkok Hilton {{!}} Picking Up the Pieces|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/23/television.artsfeatures|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=23 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2137">'''Sequah Medicine Company''' began in 1887 as the '''Sequah Medicine Co Ltd''' selling [[patent medicines]] such as prairie flower and Indian oil using traveling salesman, known as Sequahs.  The traveling salesmen were [[Quackery|quack doctors]]. The original Sequah was William Henry Hartley, who sold supposed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] remedies in Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name="hartley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wellcomelibrary.org/2016/02/the-rise-and-fall-of-sequah/ |title=The rise and fall of Sequah |publisher=Wellcome Library |accessdate=September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful pitch quickly drew imitators, to the annoyance of Hartley.&lt;ref name="hartley"/&gt; One such example is Peter Alexander Gordon, who went under the [[pseudonym]] James Kaspar.  Gordon sold the Sequah Patent Medicine in [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] and [[United States|North America]] and South Africa.

Sequah products were sold using the device of a traveling medicine show.  These shows consisted of a warm-up act of music and other entertainments which attracted a crowd in order for the traveling salesman to begin his pitch.  The British version, introduced in 1890, was made up of a [[Funfair|fairground]] [[Organ (music)|steam organ]].  The Government soon declared the practice of selling patent medicines in such a fashion illegal.  The company went into [[liquidation]] in 1895 and was liquidated on March 26, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kmgW9kCwiWwC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=%22sequah+medicine+company%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=YnUsneQY1I&amp;sig=k2bjZOBNc_Ff7wKbYuKd7VVu9Oo#PPP9,M1 |title= The Excruciating History of Dentistry |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work= |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |location= |isbn= 0-312-26319-8 |pages= |first= James | last= Wynbrandt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shaphee Lanphee''' is a traditional textile fabric woven and embroidered, usually as a shawl, with embroidered motifs with cotton threads generally by [[Meitei people|Meitei]] women of Manipur. The fabric was, in the past, presented as a gift of honour (''Mana Phee'') to the soldiers for their bravery in a successful war, and to the praise-worthy chiefs of the [[Naga people|Nagas]] of Manipur by the king of Manipur. It is a product which is protected under the [[List of Geographical Indications in India|GI registration]] and is now made throughout  the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]]  of [[Manipur]].&lt;ref name= Ngangbam&gt;{{Cite news|last= Ngangbam|first=mukhomba|url=http://www.manipurtimes.com/the-artisan-embracing-family-legacy-in-shaphee-lanphee-maisanam-nalini/|title=The artisan embracing family legacy in Shaphee Lanphee – Maisanam Nalini|date= 9 July 2014|accessdate=8 May 2016|newspaper=Manipur Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cloth&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/journal/Journal_55.pdf|format=pdf|title=:Geographical Indications Journal No. 55|date=29 November 2013|accessdate=8 May 2016|publisher=Government of India|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802121108/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/journal/Journal_55.pdf|archivedate=2 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical indication==
The fabric has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. It was registered as "Shaphee Lanphee" under the [[Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999|Geographical Indications Act 1999]] of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Class – 25 – Clothing vide application number 371 dated 19 December 2011,&lt;ref name= Ngangbam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt; and also for [[Wangkhei  Phee]] (GI no.372) and [[Moirang Phee]] (GI no.373). The [[Government of Manipur]] was expected to register 1,000 weavers in respect of manufacturing Shaphee Lanphee within six months from the date of registration as per decision of the Consultative Committee meeting.&lt;ref name= Ngangbam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Manipur&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manipurtimes.com/gi-registration-for-shaphee-lanphee-moirang-phee-wangkhei-phee-officially-handed-over-to-the-state|title=GI registration for Shaphee Lanphee, Moirang phee, Wangkhei Phee officially handed over to the state|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=Manipur Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The literal meaning of the fabric 'Shaphee' is "the fabric of animal and war".&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt; It is exclusivity a product of Khoisnam lineage. It is said that the king saw a man of Khoisnam clan wearing this Shaphee Lanphee and riding a horse. The king then adopted it as a form of honouring  brave Naga Chiefs of Manipur. According to manuscript titled ''Loiyumba Silyen'', King Loiyumba (1074–1122 AD) authorised this product to be woven by the Khoisnam family.&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt; The product was revived in the 20th century with the efforts of Maisnam Nalini Devi, a weaver from Wangkhei Yonglan, her sister Maisnam Anita and their mother Keinahanbi who had both won the state award in 1992 for promoting this product. Nalini also won the  Master Crafts Person award in 2009 for promoting this craft.&lt;ref name= Ngangbam/&gt;

==Details of product==
Shaphee Lamphee embroidery is done over a black coloured cloth with red border. The motifs embroidered on the fabric consists of several designs, and some of the common designs adopted are: of animals such as "''shamu''" (elephant), "''shagol''" (horse), "''iroichi''" (buffalo horn),  "''wahong''" (peacock), and "''Nga''" (fish); planets such as "''numit''" (sun), ''tha'' (moon); ''Thawanmichak'' (star) ; and also ''phantup'' (magical seat, ''ta'' (spear) &amp;ndash; these designs are done in a set pattern and sequence of operation. The embroidery is done by hand using needle and yarns of cotton. It has a width of 110–132 cm and length of 225–230 cm and generally weighs 1854 grams. The yarn used are 2/20S cotton and 2/34S acrylic with wrap made with 2/20S cotton and weft woven from 2/20S cotton. The yarn used in embroidery is 2/20S cotton, mercerized and 2/40S.&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt;

The fabric is revered for its religious significance in view of the motifs crafted on them.&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt; The core part of the fabric has red colour representing sun, the white strips at both borders denoting the cosmos of sky and the stars, and symbols of moon and sun assigned to mother and father. Some of these motifs are indicative of relationship between the celestial bodies and the Meitei King; particularly the magical seat and the elephant linked to  the royalty and the spear heads and the fishes indicative of the mythology of king Naothingkhong (663–763 AD).&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt;

The yarn used to make the fabric is a derivative of "Lashing" (Cotton ball) and “Kabrang” (Mulberry cocoon). These are also extracted from the bark of the tree species locally known as "Santhak" (''[[Urtica pilulifera|Urtica sp.]]''). The local fibre is then made into threads by spinning and then dyed using plants and bark. The dyed yarn is subject to sizing by applying starch made of rice, and then stretched across using a bamboo rod which is followed by winding into [[bobbin]].&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt;

Weaving of the fabric is done on a "Loin and Frame Loom" and motifs are made with needle work without frame using Manipuri cotton or occasionally silk threads.&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt;

In order to exercise quality control of the product made by weavers, following the GI registration of the fabric, an inspection agency has been instituted with nine members drawn from the government departments, societies and master craftsmen.&lt;ref name=Cloth/&gt;

'''South Korean nationality law''' defines who is a [[South Korea]]n citizen, as well as the procedures by which one may be [[naturalization|naturalized]] into South Korean citizenship or [[renunciation of citizenship|renounce it]].

==Acquisition of nationality==
South Korean nationality is automatically acquired in a number of ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneclick.law.go.kr/CSM/OvCnpRetrieveP.laf?csmSeq=505&amp;ccfNo=2&amp;cciNo=1&amp;cnpClsNo=1|title=Acquisition of nationality|work=OneClickLaw Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*By being born to either a South Korean national father or South Korean national mother after 13 June 1998, or to a South Korean national father before then.
*By being born in South Korea to parents who are stateless, or being found abandoned within the territory of South Korea as a child.
*By being acknowledged by a South Korean national parent while still a minor (under 20 years of age).
*By meeting the requirements for naturalization.
*A minor (under 20 years of age) can apply with a foreigner parent who is applying for naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=464&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=399&amp;showMenuId=377|title=Dependent acquisition|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Those who were born to a South Korean national mother and a foreign national father between 13 June 1978 and 13 June 1998, were able to apply for Korean nationality until 31 December 2004, by notification. (Unlike naturalization, there were no residency requirements and no need to apply from within South Korea.) This is known as Article 7 of the Addenda (Special Cases of Acquisition of Nationality for Persons of Maternal Line By Adoption of Jus Sanguinis to Both Lines of Parents). Those that fail to apply by the deadline may still be able to acquire South Korean nationality by applying for Special Naturalization.

Under the [[Constitution of South Korea]], North Korean citizens are also recognized as South Korean nationals. However, in practice, a formal evaluation needs to take place which requires documentary proof of [[Nationality Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|North Korean nationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=471&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=401&amp;showMenuId=377|title=Evaluation for nationality|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, North Korean citizens do not have automatic protection from South Korea per se, since those with criminal histories are not accepted as South Korean citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vtncankor.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/admitting-north-korean-refugees-a-canadian-perspective/|title=Admitting North Korean Refugees: A Canadian Perspective|work=CanKor|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean diaspora==
Separate from the Nationality Law, the Overseas Koreans Law defines the term "Overseas Korean" as referring to South Korean nationals who reside overseas as well as "Koreans with a Foreign Nationality." The latter group is composed of former South Korean nationals who gave up their South Korean nationality (but barring those who did so to deliberately evade military service, at least until age 36) and children and grandchildren of former South Korean nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/%EB%B2%95%EB%A0%B9/%EC%9E%AC%EC%99%B8%EB%8F%99%ED%8F%AC%EB%B2%95|title=재외동포의 출입국과 법적 지위에 관한 법률 (약칭: 재외동포법) {{bracket|시행 2017.1.20.}} {{bracket|법률 제13797호, 2016.1.19., 타법개정}}|trans-title=Act on the Immigration and Legal Status of Overseas Koreans (short name: Overseas Koreans Law) (implemented 20 January 2016) (Law No. 13797, 19 January 2016, amending the whole law)|website=law.go.kr|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneclick.law.go.kr/CSM/CcfMain.laf?csmSeq=505&amp;ccfNo=1&amp;cciNo=1|title=Overseas Koreans|work=OneClickLaw Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=407&amp;showMenuId=378|title=Change of Status for Overseas Koreans|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that not every descendant of a South Korean can be counted as an "Overseas Korean" or "Korean with a Foreign Nationality" under this law. For example, a 25-year-old man who was born a South Korean national overseas but whose birth was unreported will have no documentation to prove his status as a former South Korean national, and can only gain status as an Overseas Korean if one of his parents or grandparents gave up South Korean nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneclick.law.go.kr/CSM/OvCnpRetrieveP.laf?csmSeq=505&amp;ccfNo=3&amp;cciNo=2&amp;cnpClsNo=2|title=Status of sojourn as overseas koreans|work=OneClickLaw Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, those who fall under Article 7 of the Addenda (Special Cases of Acquisition of Nationality for Persons of Maternal Line By Adoption of Jus Sanguinis to Both Lines of Parents) but failed to acquire South Korean nationality are not able to gain the status of an Overseas Korean unless the mother or a maternal grandparent has lost South Korean nationality.

[[Koreans in Japan]] who have South Korean nationality and Special Permanent Residence in Japan do not have a [[Resident registration number]] and cannot apply for a new passport from a South Korean embassy while outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryang|first=Sonia|title=Diaspora without Homeland: Being Korean in Japan|publisher=University of California Press|date=April 2009|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturalization==
There are three types of naturalization under South Korean law:

#General naturalization
#:An applicant:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=399&amp;showMenuId=377|title=General Naturalization|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#:*Must have had domicile in South Korea for more than five consecutive years.
#:*Must be a legal adult (over 20 years of age).
#:*Must be of good conduct.
#:*Must have the ability to maintain a living on his/her own assets or skills, or be a dependent member of a family capable of such.
#:*Must have basic knowledge befitting a South Korean national, such as an understanding of the Korean language, customs, and culture.
#Simple naturalization
#:An applicant:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=456&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=399&amp;showMenuId=377|title=Simple Naturalization|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#:*Must be legally adult (over 20 years of age).
#:*Must be of good conduct.
#:*Must have the ability to maintain a living based on their own assets or skills, or be a dependent member of a family capable of such.
#:*Must have basic knowledge befitting a South Korean national, such as an understanding of the Korean language, customs, and culture.
#:*Must have had domicile in South Korea for more than three consecutive years.
#:*Be either:
#:**Those whose either parent have been a South Korean national in the past, but have since abandoned it for a foreign nationality.
#:**Born in South Korea, whose either parent was also born in South Korea.
#:**Adopted children of a South Korean national, who was of a legal adult age according to Korean Civil Law at the time of adoption.
#:**Foreign spouse of a South Korean national who either for the past two or more consecutive years, maintained marriage status with the spouse and kept residence in Korea, or for the past three or more consecutive years, maintained marriage status and have spent more than one year in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=457&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=399&amp;showMenuId=377|title=Simple Naturalization (Marriage)|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Special Naturalization
#:There are many forms of special naturalization, with different requirements. However, the basic requirements are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=461&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=399&amp;showMenuId=377|title=Special Naturalization (Underage foster children)|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#:*Must be of good conduct.
#:*Must have basic knowledge befitting a South Korean national, such as an understanding of the Korean language, customs, and culture.
#:*Foreigners with at least one parent of South Korean nationality, except foster children who were adopted after they have become adults according to South Korean civil law.

Those who acquire South Korean nationality by naturalization normally must give up foreign nationality within six months or forfeit South Korean nationality. An exception to this is draft-age males, who must complete or be exempted from military service before being allowed to forfeit Korean nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneclick.law.go.kr/CSM/OvCnpRetrieveP.laf?csmSeq=505&amp;ccfNo=2&amp;cciNo=1&amp;cnpClsNo=3|title=Nationality loss|work=OneClickLaw Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to naturalize as a South Korean citizen was a Taiwanese immigrant in 1957. From then until 2000, there were an average of just 34 naturalizations per year. In the decade that followed, these numbers increased sharply to an average of 9,816 per year, and by January 2011 the cumulative number of naturalized citizens over the years had reached 100,000. [[Chinese people in Korea|Chinese immigrants]] formed 79% of these, followed by [[Vietnamese people in Korea|Vietnamese]] (9.2%), [[Filipinos in South Korea|Filipinos]] (5.2%), and Taiwanese (2.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/02/113_80216.html|title=Number of naturalized Korean citizens passes 100,000|work=Korea Times|date=2011-01-24|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former South Korean nationals can reacquire South Korean nationality by applying for reacquisition of nationality. However, this will reinstate the military service duty, if applicable to the national, and also requires forfeiting any foreign nationality within 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hikorea.go.kr/pt/InfoDetailR_kr.pt?catSeq=&amp;categoryId=2&amp;parentId=400&amp;showMenuId=377|title=Restore nationality|work=Hi Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visa free travel==
{{Main|Visa requirements for South Korean citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for South Korean citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for South Korean citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for [[South Korea]]n citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Republic of Korea]]. In 2014, South Korean citizens have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 172 countries and territories, ranking the South Korean passport 3rd in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

==Dual citizenship==

===Current policy===
In 2010, the South Korean government legalized dual citizenship for some South Koreans who have acquired another nationality/citizenship, as well as foreigners who lived in South Korea for five years (two years if married to a South Korean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/south-korea-permanent-dual-nationality-allowed-after-60-years/|title=South Korea: Permanent Dual Nationality Allowed after 60 Years|date=August 24, 2010|publisher=The Library of Congress|work=Global Legal Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revised nationality law passed on 21 April 2010, by the [[National Assembly of South Korea]] and in effect since 1 January 2011, granted a limited number of persons dual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/116_64629.html|title=Dual Citizenship to Be Allowed|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These persons include:

*South Koreans with multiple nationalities who has vowed his/her intention not to exercise his/her foreign nationality in South Korea. (According to Constitution of South Korea, Chapter II Article 39, male citizens shall have the duty of national defense under the conditions as prescribed by Act.)&lt;ref name="People with multiple nationalities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneclick.law.go.kr/CSM/OvCnpRetrieveP.laf?csmSeq=505&amp;ccfNo=2&amp;cciNo=1&amp;cnpClsNo=2|title=People with multiple nationalities|work=OneClickLaw Korea|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205402187_text|title=South Korea: Permanent Dual Nationality Allowed after 60 Years|work=Law Library of Congress|accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Foreign marriage migrants&lt;ref name=loc /&gt;
*Foreigners of outstanding talent who are naturalized as South Koreans&lt;ref name=loc /&gt;
*Persons who have their South Korean citizenship reinstated by meeting certain qualifications.&lt;ref name=loc /&gt;
*Foreigners who are married to South Koreans and acquired Korean nationality from 2 July 2010, or later
*Children born in South Korea or abroad with one South Korean parent
*Foreigners who acquired South Korean citizenship through marriage
*Foreigners with exceptional talent
*Foreigners with an important contribution to South Korea
*"Overseas Koreans" at least 65 years of age
*Overseas South Korean adoptees

There are transitional provisions for those who fit under the first category but had already forfeited one nationality.

*Those who failed to make a choice and automatically lost South Korean nationality can apply to have it restored before May 4, 2012;&lt;ref name="People with multiple nationalities"/&gt;
*Those who choose South Korean nationality have until 2016 to reacquire their foreign nationality.&lt;ref name="People with multiple nationalities"/&gt;

As of December 2010, an application for dual citizenship can only be made inside the Republic of Korea and requires the applicant to currently hold an F-series visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goal.or.kr/citizenship|title=Dual Citizenship|work=G.O.A.'L|accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would normally be an F-5 visa (Permanent Residency) or an F-4 visa (for former Korean nationals and their descendants, including Korean adoptees) or F-2 or F-6 visa (for spouses of Korean nationals). In the case of South Korean adoptees living abroad (e.g., in the U.S.), application to restore Korean citizenship, and thus obtain dual nationality, shall only be made while living in the Republic of Korea.

Dual citizenship holders:
* Must report to the South Korean government within six months after acquisition of another country's citizenship and follow the Nationality Act. Otherwise, he/she will lose his/her Korean citizenship automatically.
* Cannot have jobs that are related to the government or national security. He/she must renounce his/her foreign citizenship before working as a government official.

==History==
South Korea's first nationality law, Law No. 16, was enacted by the [[List of members of the South Korean Constituent Assembly, 1948–50|1st Constituent Assembly]], and took effect on 20 December 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=4319&amp;ancYd=19481220&amp;ancNo=00016&amp;efYd=19481220&amp;nwJoYnInfo=N&amp;efGubun=Y&amp;chrClsCd=010202#0000|title=국적법 {{bracket|[시행 1948.12.20.}} {{bracket|법률 제16호, 1948.12.20., 제정}}|trans-title=Nationality Law (implemented 20 December 1948) (Law No. 16, 20 December 1948, enactment)|website=law.go.kr|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent total amendment of the law, Law No. 8435, was enacted by the [[List of members of the National Assembly (South Korea), 2000–04|17th National Assembly]] and took effect on 17 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=79037&amp;ancYd=20070517&amp;ancNo=08435&amp;efYd=20080101&amp;nwJoYnInfo=N&amp;efGubun=Y&amp;chrClsCd=010202|title=국적법 {{bracket|시행 2008.1.1.}} {{bracket|법률 제8435호, 2007.5.17., 타법개정}}|trans-title=Nationality Law (implemented 1 January 2008) (Law No. 8435, 17 May 2007, amending the whole law)|website=law.go.kr|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2011, the South Korean government did not permit [[dual citizenship]] after the age of 21. Koreans with dual citizenship under South Korean law who work or study in [[South Korea]] were legally obliged by South Korea to choose one or the other citizenship soon after reaching that age.

In addition, South Korean men over the age of 18, including men born overseas to a parent with South Korean citizenship, were subject to [[conscription|compulsory military service]] in the South Korean armed forces. From a law that was effective since 2005, a male dual citizen could not be allowed to abandon his South Korean citizenship until he finished his military service, or had received a special exemption from military service. In several cases, American men of South Korean descent had been drafted into the South Korean army upon visiting the country, despite having never been to South Korea before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1018.html#special_circumstance |title=Consular Information Sheet:Korea, Republic of |work=Archive of Travel.state.gov as of 2010-01-01 |accessdate=2013-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101194501/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1018.html |archivedate=1 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two of the aforementioned cases had involved individuals whose names had, without their knowledge, been recorded in the [[Hoju]], the [[Family register|South Korean Family Census Register]], which does not automatically remove the names of former South Korean citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1018.html|title=Consular Information Sheet:Korea, Republic of|work=Travel.state.gov|accessdate=2008-04-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101194501/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1018.html|archivedate=1 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vagabonds Act of 1530''' (22 Henry VIII c.12) was an act passed under [[Henry VIII]] and is a part of the [[Tudor Poor Laws]] of England.  In full, it was entitled an "Act how aged, poor and impotent Persons, compelled to live by Alms, shall be ordered; and how Vagabonds and Beggars shall be punished.”

Under this act, [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]] were subject to the harsher punishment of [[Flagellation|whipping]], rather than the stocks.  However, it also created provisions for those who were unable to work due to sickness, age, or disability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intriguing-history.com/statute-punishment-of-beggars-vagabonds/&lt;/ref&gt;  These "impotent" beggars could become licensed to beg by their local [[Justice of the peace#History|Justices of the Peace]].  For this reason, this statute is recognized as the first English poor law to be at least partially aimed at providing relief, rather than punishing vagrancy, because it made the Justices of the Peace responsible for the licensed poor within their district.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney &amp; Beatrice Webb, ''English Local Government: English Poor Law History'' Part 1, pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of violations of law include:
* [[Moving violation]], any violation of law committed by a driver while the vehicle is in motion
* [[Parking violation]], parking a motor vehicle in a restricted place or an unauthorized manner
* [[Willful violation]], in U.S. law an act with intentional disregard for a regulation, statute and policy
* [[Infraction]], in United States law, minor or petty offenses that do not require jury trial
* [[Infringement (disambiguation)|Infringement]], various violations of laws or rights, usually used in the context of intellectual property

'''Voluntary collective licensing''' is an alternative approach to solve the problem of [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]] using [[file sharing]] technologies. The idea is to make file sharing networks subscribe-only for a small fee and then distribute the collected money among the artists based on the popularity of their work. It has been endorsed since 2003 by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]. 

Arguably [[Spotify]] is an implementation of this idea, although it is not marketed as a file-sharing network and also allows ad-supported free use in addition to paid use.
