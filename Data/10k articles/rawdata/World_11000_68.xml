'''Absolute Xtreme''' was a [[digital radio]] station broadcasting in the [[United Kingdom]], which played new alternative music.

==History==

'''Virgin Radio Xtreme''', as it was initially branded, launched at 12.15am on 5 September 2005 by then [[Virgin Radio]] DJ, Steve Harris. Its music policy aimed at playing [[modern rock]] for a youth audience.

Since the departure (to rival station [[Xfm London]]) of Steve Harris at the end of 2006, the channel played non-stop music 24 hours a day. The station had carried shows which included The Edge with Steve Harris, "Hippies for an Hour" (an acoustic music show), and The Xtreme Mix with "Silent" Dave Lambert.

Originally part of the [[Virgin Radio]] network of stations, it was wholly owned by [[STV Group plc]], until 30 May 2008 when Virgin Radio was purchased by the TIML Golden Square Ltd, a subsidiary of the [[Times of India]] group, for £53.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/telecoms/article4036887.ece|title=Virgin Radio is sold to Absolute for £53.2m|last=Andrews|first=Amanda|date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the sale of the Virgin Radio stations and the rebranding of Virgin Radio to [[Absolute Radio]], on 1 September 2008, it was announced that Virgin Radio Xtreme would be rebranded as Absolute Xtreme on 29 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/842893/Plans-revealed-rebrand-Virgin-Radio-Absolute/|title=Plans revealed to rebrand Virgin Radio as Absolute|last=Barnett|first=Emma|date=2008-09-01|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=Brand Republic| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907014531/http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/842893/Plans-revealed-rebrand-Virgin-Radio-Absolute/| archivedate= 7 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, it was announced that Absolute Xtreme would be replaced on DAB and digital TV by an all-1980s music station, [[Absolute Radio 80s]], with listeners seeking alternative music redirected to new user-controlled station [[dabbl]], which itself closed in 2010.

'''African nationalism''' is an [[umbrella term]] which refers to a group of political ideologies, mainly within [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], which are based on the idea of [[national self-determination]] and the creation of [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=talktalk&gt;[http://www.talktalk.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029558.html African nationalism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221122620/http://www.talktalk.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029558.html |date=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology emerged under [[Western European colonialism and colonization|European colonial rule]] during the 19th and 20th centuries and was loosely inspired by nationalist ideas from Europe. Originally, African [[nationalism]] was based on demands for self-determination and played an important role in forcing the process of [[decolonisation of Africa]] ({{circa}} 1957–66). However, the term refers to a broad range of different ideological and political movements and should not be confused with [[Pan-Africanism]] which may seek the [[federalism|federation]] of several or all nation states in Africa.{{sfn|Rotberg|1966|p=33}}

==History==
{{Pan-African|expanded=Ideology}}

Nationalist ideas in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] emerged during the mid-19th century among the emerging black middle classes in [[West Africa]]. Early nationalists hoped to overcome ethnic fragmentation by creating [[nation-states]].&lt;ref name=Berman&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berman|first=Bruce J.|year=1998|title=Ethnicity, Patronage and the African State: The Politics of Uncivil Nationalism |jstor=723213 |journal=African Affairs|volume=97|pages=305–341|via=EBSCOhost|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a007947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest period, it was inspired by [[African-American]] and [[Afro-Caribbean]] intellectuals from the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] who imported [[nationalism|nationalist ideals]] current in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] at the time.{{sfn|Davidson|1978|p=165}} The early African nationalists were elitist and believed in the supremacy of [[Western culture]] but sought a greater role for themselves in political decision-making.{{sfn|Davidson|1978|pp=166-7}} They rejected [[Traditional African religion|African traditional religions]] and [[Tribal chief|tribalism]] as "primitive" and embraced western ideas of [[Christianity]], [[modernity]], and the [[nation state]].{{sfn|Davidson|1978|p=167}} However, one of the challenges faced by nationalists in unifying their nation after European rule were the divisions of tribes and the formation of ethnicism.
[[File:Ghanas 50th Independence Anniversary national parade.jpg|thumb|[[Ghana]]ian nationalists celebrating the 50th anniversary of national independence in 2007]]
African nationalism first emerged as a [[mass movement]] in the years after [[World War II]] as a result of wartime changes in the nature of colonial rule as well as social change in Africa itself.{{sfn|Davidson|1978|p=202}} Nationalist political parties were established in almost all African colonies during the 1950s and their rise was an important reason for the [[decolonisation of Africa]] between {{circa}}1957 and 1966. However, African nationalism was never a single movement and political groups considered to be African nationalists varied by economic orientation and degrees of radicalism and violence.{{sfn|Rotberg|1966|p=33}} Nationalists leaders struggled to find their own social and national identity following the European influence that controlled the political landscape during the colonial occupation.

African nationalism in the colonial era was often framed purely in opposition to colonial rule and was therefore frequently unclear or contradictory about its other objectives.{{sfn|Davidson|1978|p=374}} According to historian [[Robert I. Rotberg]], African nationalism would not have emerged without colonialism.{{sfn|Rotberg|1966|p=37}} Its relation to [[Pan-Africanism]] was also ambiguous with many nationalist leaders professing Pan-African loyalties but still refusing to commit to [[supranational union]]s. African nationalists of the period have also been criticised for their continued use of ideas and policies associated with colonial states.{{sfn|Davidson|1978|p=374}} In particular, nationalists usually attempted to preserve [[Border|national frontiers]] created arbitrarily under colonial rule after independence and create a national sense of national identity among the heterogeneous populations inside them.{{sfn|Rotberg|1966|p=37}}

== Tribalism and ethnic nationalism ==
African nationalism exists in an uneasy relationship with [[tribalism]] and sub-national [[ethnic nationalism]] which differ in their conceptions of political allegiance. Many Africans distinguish between their ethnic and national identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/30/065.html|title=Tribalism in Africa |last=Isabirye |first=Stephen |date=April 30, 1995 |website=hartford-hwp.com |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nationalists have argued that tribes were a colonial creation.&lt;ref name=Illusion&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation |chapter=The Illusion of Tribe |last=Southall |first=Aiden |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-9060-2|location=Chichester|page=3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in African nationalism ==
During the late 1950s and 1960s, scholars of African nationalist struggles have primarily focused on the Western-educated male elites who led the nationalist movements and assumed power after independence. The history of studies of women's involvement in African nationalist struggle, mobilization, and party politics can be traced along intellectual and political paths that initially followed, later paralleled, but have seldom deviated from or led the course of Africanist historiography. The goal of these women involved in the African nationalism movement was to recover Africa's past and to celebrate the independent emergence of independent Africa. It was necessary to raise awareness of this cause, calling to the new emerging generation of African women, raised in a better, more stable society. Although, the challenges they faced seemed increasingly more significant, they however had it better than past generations, allowing them to raise awareness of the African Nationalist moment. Whereas women's historians interested in effecting changes in the process and production of American or European history had to fight their way onto trains that had been moving through centuries on well-worn gauges, the "new" Africanist train had barely left the station in the early '60s. With a few exceptions, scholars have devoted little more than a passing mention of the presence of African women as conscious political actors in African nationalism. [[Anne McClintock]] has stressed that "all nationalisms are gendered."&lt;ref&gt;A. McClintock, ‘“No Longer in Future Heaven”: Gender, Race and Nationalism,’ in Dangerous Liaisons: Gender, Nation and Postcolonial Perspectives ed. A. McClintock, A. Mufti, E. Shohat (United States, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Undoubtedly, women played a significant role in arousing national consciousness as well as elevating their own political and social position through African nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;S. Geiger, J.M Allman and N. Musisi, Women in African Colonial Histories (Bloomington, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; It is with this in mind, that both feminism and the research of these women become critical to the re-evaluation of the history of African nationalism. In 1943, a prominent organization called the African National Congress Women's League used its branches throughout the country to build a national campaign.

===Women in national organisations===
As leaders and activists, women participated in African nationalism through national organisations. The decade of the 1950s was a landmark because of the significant number of women who were politically involved in the nationalist struggle. A minority of women were incorporated and affiliated into male-dominated national organisations. Founded by women in 1960, The [[National Council of Sierra Leone]] was to become, in 1968, the women's section of the ruling [[All People's Congress]] and dedicated primarily to the vigorous support of head of state, President Stevens. Women activists extended and conveyed militant behaviours. Nancy Dolly Steele was the organizing secretary and co-founder of the Congress, and has been noted for her militant political and nationalist activities. 
In the same way, throughout Africa, the influence of trade union movements, in particular, became the spawning ground for women organisers as such.  South African women, for instance, emerged as primary catalysts for protests against the Apartheid regime. These women first participated in resistance movements through women’s branches of the larger male dominated liberation organizations, as through the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). Nevertheless, in 1943, the ANC adopted a new constitution which included a new position for women to become full members of the national movement. Women also formed their own national organisations, such as the Federation of South African Women in 1954, which boasted a membership of 230,000 women. Though at the time women viewed themselves primarily as mothers and wives, the act of their joining in political organisations illustrated a kind of feminist consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Frates, ‘Women in the South African National Liberation Movement, 1948 – 1960: An Historiographical Overview,’ Ufahamu: A Journal of African Studies Vol. 21, No. 1-2 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women as national leaders===
Women were fundamental nationalist leaders in their own right. Under the inspiration of [[Bibi Titi Mohammed]], a former singer in Dar es Salaam who became a Tanganyikan nationalist, Tanzanian women were organised into a Women’s Section of the Tanganyikan African National Union. Mohammed, who was semi-illiterate, was an impressive orator and later combined her nationalist work in the 1950s with her political ambitions. She was one of the most visible Tanganyikan nationalists during the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;S. Geiger, “Women in Nationalist Struggle: Tanu Activists in Dar es Salaam,” The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 20, No. 1, (1987), 1 – 26.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only nationalist leader, besides [[Julius Nyerere]], who was recognized across the country at the time of Tanzanian independence.  Her legacy as a leader, speaker, organiser and activist is testimony to the pivotal role played by many uneducated women in spreading a national consciousness, a political awareness and securing independence from British rule in Tanzania.

===Women and Informal Methods of Protest===
Whilst some female-oriented initiatives may have been conceived and presented to women by male party-leaders, others were clearly created by women themselves. These women used nationalism as a platform to address their own concerns as wives, mothers, industrial workers, peasants, and as women affiliated to the ANC. The 1940s Anti-tax protest in [[Tanzania]] involved the women of Peasant Pare, where women employed methods of direct confrontation, provocative language and physical violence. Explicit use of sexual insult was also central to the powerful Anlu protest of the [[Cameroon]] in 1958, where women refused to implement agricultural regulations that would have undermined their farming system.&lt;ref&gt;Jean O'Barr, ‘African Women in Politics,’ in African Women South of the Sahara, ed. M. J. Hay and S. Stichter (London, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, women used music, dance and informal methods to convey their solidarity for African nationalism. The production of Tanganyikan nationalism in Tanzania can be seen as “woman’s work,” where women evoked, created and performed nationalism through their dances and songs.&lt;ref&gt;S. Geiger, ‘Women and African Nationalism,’ Journal of Women’s History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 – 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Equally, women were considered the best sloganeers, as traditional story-tellers and singers using ideas, images and phrases that appealed to the non-elite population. Market women in coastal Nigeria and Guinea also used their networks to convey anti-government information.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schmidt, ‘Top Down or Bottom Up? Nationalist Mobilization Reconsidered, with Special Reference to Guinea (French West Africa,’ American Historical Review (October, 2005), 975 – 1014.&lt;/ref&gt;  ‘Ordinary’ women themselves had transformed "traditional" methods for networking and expressing disapproval against individuals, into mechanisms for challenging and unsettling the local colonial administration. However, although these women contributed to African nationalist politics, they had limited impact as their strategies were concerned with shaming, retaliation, restitution and compensation, and were not directly about radical transformation. This problem was a reflection of the extent to which most African women had already been marginalized politically, economically and educationally under colonial regimes in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;S. Geiger, ‘Women and African Nationalism,’ Journal of Women’s History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 – 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[The Gambia|Gambia]], one of the prominent Gambian nationalists and [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanists]] during the colonial era was [[Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof]]. From the 1950s up to [[Gambia Independence Act 1964|Gambia's independence]], Cham Joof (as he is commonly referred to), held a series of campaigns against the [[British Empire|British colonial]] administration. In 1958, he spearheaded the All Party Committee - the purpose of which was for self-governance and to determine the political direction of the Gambia free from European colonialism and neo-colonialism. In 1959, he organised the Bread and Butter demonstration from outside his house in Barthurst now [[Banjul]], and led his followers to Government House to lobby the British colonial administration. Following that demonstration, Cham Joof and his associates Crispin Grey Johnson and M. B. Jones were indicted as "inciting the public to disobey the laws of the land" and charged as political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Foroyaa]] : [https://web.archive.org/web/20111003130110/http://www.foroyaa.gm/modules/news/article.php?storyid=6832 Exclusive interview with Foroyaa Panorama] (''TRIBUTE TO ALHAJI A.E.

The '''Albanenses''' were a group of [[Manichaeans]] who lived in [[Albania]], probably about the eighth century.

Little is known about them, except that they were one of the numerous sects through which the original Manichaeism continued to flourish. (cf. [[Bogomils]], [[Cathars]], and [[Paulicians]].) They appear to have professed a very strict and uncompromising form of Manichaeism, rejecting all doctrinal modifications as to the eternity of the evil principle, and its absolute equality with the good principle.

'''Barynya''' is a fast [[Russia]]n [[folk dance]] and [[music]]. The word ''barynya'' (Russian: Барыня, landlady) was used by simple folk as a form of addressing to a woman of higher class, a feminine form for the word ''"barin"'', landlord. 

A number of Russian folkloric dance ensembles bear the name.

The Barynya dance is an alternation of [[chastushka]]s and frenetic dancing. 

The Barynya chastuskas used to have the refrain, kind of "Барыня, барыня, сударыня-барыня", "Barynya, barynya, sudarynya-barynya", or "Барыня ты моя, сударыня ты моя". The content was often humoristic, even lewd.

The dancing was without special choreography and consisted mainly of fancy stomping and traditional Russian squatwork – knee bending ("вприсядку", vprisyadku).

There are a number of scenic, more refined versions of the dance.

'''Casterman''' is a publisher of [[Franco-Belgian comics]], specializing in [[comic books]] and [[children's literature]]. The company is based in [[Tournai]], Belgium.

The company was founded in 1780 by [[Donat-Joseph Casterman]], an editor and bookseller originally from Tournai.&lt;ref name="Herge"&gt;Bocquet, José-Louis, and Fromental, Jean-Luc. ''The Adventures of Hergé'' (Drawn and Quarterly, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Casterman was originally a printing company and [[publishing house]]. In 1934, Casterman took over the ''[[Le Petit Vingtième]]'' editions for the publication of the albums of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', from the 4th album of the series, ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''. From 1942, Casterman published reworked versions and colored versions of the previous Tintin albums.

Strengthened by the success of [[Hergé]]'s comics, shortly after Casterman proposed new series with new authors such as [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]], [[François Craenhals]] and [[C. &amp; V. Hansen]]. From 1954 on, Casterman published children's books as well, including the successful ''[[Martine (book)|Martine]]'' books by [[Marcel Marlier]] and [[Cadet- Rama]] books written by [[Alain Gree]] (units [[Achille et Bergamote]] and [[Petit Tom]]).

Keen to appeal to a more mature market, Casterman decided in 1973 to publish the first albums of ''[[Corto Maltese]]'' by the [[Italy|Italian]] author [[Hugo Pratt]]. Furthermore, in 1978 Casterman established its monthly magazine ''[[A suivre|A Suivre]]'', which was to influence the comics revival of the 1980s. Casterman ceased the publication of ''A Suivre'' in 1997.

Casterman is now part of [[Groupe Flammarion]].

Casterman's [[manga]] series are published under the imprint [[Sakka (publisher)|Sakka]].

'''Cold-weather warfare''', also known as '''Arctic warfare''' or '''winter warfare''', encompasses military operations affected by [[snow]], [[ice]], thawing conditions or cold, both on land and at sea. Cold-weather conditions occur year-round at high elevation or at high latitudes, and elsewhere materialise seasonally during the [[winter]] period. [[Mountain warfare]] often takes place in cold weather or on terrain that is affected by ice and snow, such as the [[Alps]] and the [[Himalayas]]. Historically, most such operations have been during winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Some have occurred above the [[Arctic Circle]] where snow, ice and cold may occur throughout the year. At times, cold or its aftermath—thaw—has been a decisive factor in the failure of a campaign, as with [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in 1812 and the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Russia]] during [[World War II]].

==History==

Northern and Eastern Europe were the venues for some well-documented winter campaigns. During World War II several actions took place above the Arctic Circle. Recent cold-weather conflicts have occurred in the Himalayas.

===Pre–1800===
[[Image:Tåget över stora bält.jpg|thumb|The [[March Across the Belts]] in the [[Second Northern War]].]]
In 1242, the [[Teutonic Order]] lost the [[Battle on the Ice]] on [[Lake Peipus]] to Novgorod. In 1520, the decisive [[Battle of Bogesund]] between Sweden and Denmark occurred on the ice of lake [[Åsunden (Västergötland)|Åsunden]].&lt;ref name="Nicolle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolle|first=David|authorlink=David Nicolle|title=Lake Peipus 1242: Battle of the Ice|year=1996|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=9781855325531|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden and Denmark [[Dano-Swedish war (disambiguation)|fought several wars]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. As a great deal of Denmark consists of islands, it was usually safe from invasion, but in January 1658, most of the Danish waters froze. [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] led his army [[March across the Belts|across the ice of the Belts]] to besiege [[Copenhagen]]. The war ended with the [[treaty of Roskilde]], a treaty very favorable to the Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Lindqvist (journalist)|Herman Lindqvist]], ''När Sverige blev stormakt''. Stockholm: Norstedt, 1996. {{ISBN|978-91-1-932112-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Northern War]], Swedish king [[Charles XII]] set off to invade Moscow, but was eventually defeated at the [[Battle of Poltava]] after being weakened by cold weather and [[scorched earth]] tactics. Sweden suffered more casualties during the same war as [[Carl Gustaf Armfeldt]] with 6,000 men tried to invade [[Trondheim]].  Three thousand of them died of exposure in the snow during the [[Carolean Death March]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Stewart P. ''War and Peace in the Baltic, 1560-1790'' (Routledge, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Night Bivouac of Great Army.jpg|thumb|The Night [[Military camp|Bivouac]] of Napoleon's Army during retreat from Russia in 1812.]]
During the [[Finnish War]], the Russian army unexpectedly crossed the frozen [[Gulf of Bothnia]] from [[Finland]] to the [[Åland Islands]] and, by 19 March 1809, reached the Swedish shore within 70&amp;nbsp;km from the Swedish capital, [[Stockholm]]. This daring maneuvre decided the outcome of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mattila |first1=Tapani |title=Meri maamme turvana |trans-title=Sea safeguarding our country |year=1983 |publisher=K.

===20th century===

[[File:Tanks and Infantrymen on the way.jpg|thumb|right|US Army tanks and infantry during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].]]
The [[Finnish Army]] used [[ski troops]] during the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War|Second World War]], where the numerically dominant Soviet forces had a hard time fighting mobile, white-clad ski soldiers.&lt;ref name=Clemmesen&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Clemmesen |editor1-first=Michael H. |editor2-last=Faulkner |editor2-first=Marcus |title=Northern European Overture to War, 1939–1941: From Memel to Barbarossa| year=2013 |publisher=Brill |page=76 |isbn=978-90-04-24908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Operation Barbarossa]] in 1941, both Russian and German soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the [[Russian winter]]. The German-Finnish joint offensive against Murmansk (Operation Silver Fox) in 1941 saw heavy fighting in the Arctic environment. Subsequently, the [[Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation]] conducted by the [[Red Army]] against the Wehrmacht in 1944 in northern Finland and Norway drove the Germans out of there. In late 1944, Finland turned against their former [[cobelligerent]]s, Nazi Germany, under the Soviet Union's pressure and pressured the Germans to withdraw in the ensuing [[Lapland War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahto|first=Sampo|year=1980|pages=|language=Finnish|title=Aseveljet vastakkain – Lapin sota 1944–1945|trans-title=Brothers in Arms Opposing Each Other – Lapland War 1944–1945|publisher=Kirjayhtymä|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-951-26-1726-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While use of [[ski infantry]] was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only [[1st Ski Division (Germany)|one division]] for movement on skis.&lt;ref name=Clemmesen/&gt;
From June 1942 to August 1943, the United States and Canada fought the Japanese in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in the [[Alaska Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hays|first=Otis|authorlink=|author2=|year=2004|chapter=|title=Alaska's Hidden Wars: Secret Campaigns on the North Pacific Rim|publisher=University of Alaska Press|location=|isbn =1-889963-64-X|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]] was a stark example of cold affecting military operations in the [[Korean War]]. There were many cold injuries and malfunctions of [[materiel]], both vehicles and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*''Tactics'' – Defensive positions are highly advantageous because of the ability to maintain warmth and protection, compared to attacking in extreme cold. Mobility and logistical support are often restricted by snow, requiring plowing or compacting it to accommodate wide-tracked vehicles or sleds. [[Infantry]] movement in deep snow requires skis or snowshoes to avoid exhaustion. Sound carries well over crusted snow, diminishing the element of surprise. Explosives are useful for excavating foxholes and larger shelters in frozen ground. Attacking field kitchens and encampments deprives the enemy of food and shelter. Rapid removal of the wounded from the battlefield is essential to their survival in the cold.
*''Materiel'' – Weapons and vehicles require special lubricants to operate at low temperatures. Mines are unreliable in winter, owing to deep snow that may cushion the fuse or form an ice bridge over the detonator.
*''Personnel'' – Proper winter clothing is required to maintain body heat and to avoid such cold injuries as frostbite. Troop efficiency and survival requires either making use of available shelter or providing portable shelter.

==Operational factors – land==
Operational factors encompass planning for the climate and weather in which military operations are required with snow, ice, mud and cold being the primary considerations. [[Military tactics]], [[materiel]], [[combat engineering]] and [[military medicine]] all require specialized adaptations to the conditions encountered in cold weather. The Red Army was an early adopter of a protocol for winter warfare.&lt;ref name = RedArmy&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Mountain regions of the world - US Army Mountain Warfare and Cold Weather Operations Techniques Publication No. 3-90.97.png|thumb|The principal mountain ranges of the world.]]
In its 2016 "Mountain Warfare and Cold Weather Operations" manual, the [[US Army]] defines ''cold regions'' as "where cold temperatures, unique terrain, and snowfall have a significant effect on military operations for one month or more each year." It describes regions that are either ''severely cold'' or ''moderately cold'', each comprising about approximately one quarter of the Earth's land mass.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;
*''Severely cold'' – Where mean annual air temperatures stay below freezing, maximum snow depths exceed {{Conv|60|cm|0}}, and ice covers lakes and rivers for more than 180 days each year.
*''Moderately cold'' – Where the mean temperatures during the coldest month are below freezing.

The manual also delineates the principal mountain ranges of the world, which lie along the broad belts, which encircle the Pacific basin and then lead westward across Eurasia into North Africa. Secondarily, rugged chains of mountains lie along the Atlantic margins of the Americas and Europe.
[[File:Wind chill chart - US Army Mountain Warfare and Cold Weather Operations Techniques Publication No. 3-90.97.png|thumb|Cooling power of wind, expressed as an equivalent chill temperature under calm conditions.]]

===Weather conditions===
Temperature, wind, snow, and thaw are the primary conditions that affect the winter battlescape.

====Temperature====
The US Army groups cold temperatures using categories. The temperature categories are (with quoted summaries):&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;
*''Wet cold'' – From {{conv|39|to|20|F|C|0}}. Wet cold conditions occur when wet snow and rain often accompany wet cold conditions. This type of environment is ''more dangerous to troops and equipment'' than the colder, dry cold environments because the ground becomes slushy and muddy and clothing and equipment becomes perpetually wet and damp.
*''Dry cold'' – From {{conv|19|to|-4|F|C|0}}. Dry cold conditions are easier to live in than wet cold conditions. Like in wet cold conditions, proper equipment, training and leadership are critical to successful operations. Wind chill is a complicating factor in this type of cold. The dry cold environment is the easiest of the four cold weather categories to survive in because of low humidity and the ground remains frozen. As a result, people and equipment are not subject to the effects of the thawing and freezing cycle, and precipitation is generally in the form of dry snow.
*''Intense cold'' – From {{conv|-5|to|-25|F|C|0}}. This temperature range can affect the mind as much as the body. Simple tasks take longer and require more effort than in warmer temperatures and the quality of work degrades as attention-to-detail diminishes. Clothing becomes more bulky to compensate for the cold so troops lose dexterity. Commanders consider these factors when planning operations and assigning tasks.
*''Extreme cold'' – From {{conv|-25|to|-40|F|C|0}}. In extreme cold the challenge of survival becomes paramount as personnel withdraw into themselves. Weapons, vehicles and munitions are likely to fail in this environment.
*''Hazardous cold'' – From {{conv|-40|F|C|0}} and below. Units require extensive training before operating in these temperature extremes.
The combined cooling effect of ambient ''temperature and wind'' ([[wind chill]]) is an important factor that affects troops.

====Snow====
[[File:Chinook helicopter near Bagram, Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|Airborne security detachment of US troops exiting [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47 Chinook]] helicopter in [[Afghanistan]].]]
{{See also|Snow}}
For military purposes, the US Army categorizes snow as light, moderate, or heavy. Each classification affects visibility and ground movement due to accumulation and is quoted below:&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;
*''Light snow'' – Visibility is equal to or greater than {{conv|5/8|mile|m|-2}} in falling snow. A trace to {{conv|1|in|cm|spell=in}} per hour accumulates.
*''Moderate snow'' – Visibility is {{conv|5/16|to|1/2|mile|m|-2}} in falling snow.  {{conv|1|to|3|in|cm|spell=In}} per hour accumulates.
*''Heavy snow'' – Visibility is less than {{conv|1/4|mile|m|-2}} in falling snow. {{conv|3|in|cm|spell=In}} or more inches per hour accumulates.
Snow and snowdrifts can create advantages on the battlefield by filling in ditches and vehicle tracks and flattening the terrain. It also creates hollows on the downwind side of obstacles, such as trees, buildings, and bushes, which provide observation points or firing positions. Snowdrifts may provide cover for soldiers to approach an objective.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt; Soviet doctrine cited {{conv|30|cm}} as the threshold snow depth that impairs mobility for troops, [[cavalry]] and vehicles, except tanks for which the threshold was {{conv|50|cm}}.&lt;ref name = RedArmy/&gt;

====Thaw====
{{See also|Rasputitsa}}
[[File:T-80U (6).jpg|thumb|right|Russian [[T-80]] main battle tank maneuvering in thawing conditions.]]
Thawing conditions can impair mobility and put soldiers at risk of trench foot by creating mud on the ground and by the weakening and breakup ice cover on bodies of water. Maintaining roads becomes more difficult during spring thaw run off and requires mud removal by heavy equipment. Slushy and muddy ground causes clothing and equipment to become wet, damp and dirty.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt; Muddy conditions greatly inhibited Napoleon's ability to maneuver in Russia&lt;ref name="Adolphe Thiers, 1864, p. 234"&gt;{{Cite book |title=History of the Consulate and the Empire of France under Napoleon |author=M.

===Tactics===
{{See also|Military tactics|Ski warfare}}
[[File:Hagglunds Bv206 25th US Marines 2.jpg|thumb|A Norwegian [[Bandvagn 206]] small unit support vehicle.]]
[[File:Foot travel chart- US Army Mountain Warfare and Cold Weather Operations Techniques Publication No. 3-90.97.png|thumb|Rates of march for unit movement in snow.]]
The dominant tactical concern in cold conditions is the ability to maneuver in vehicles or on foot. Additionally, during winter, night operations become the norm at higher latitudes with their long periods of darkness.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt; Snow enhances night vision because of high reflectivity and the visibility of combatants against the white background.&lt;ref name = RedArmy/&gt;

''Mounted movement'' –  Over snow-covered terrain vehicles may be employed to establish and maintain trails by establishing a well concealed track with the first vehicle, followed by a vehicle traveling offset from the track of the first, to flatten the trail, and subsequent vehicles widening and flattening the trail. Marked trails avoid obliteration in snowstorms or drifting conditions.  In mountainous terrain, tracked vehicles, including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and cavalry fighting vehicles, rarely accompany dismounted infantry in the assault.  Instead, they assist forces by occupying positions where they can use their firepower to isolate enemy objectives.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;

''Dismounted movement'' – Troops moving in a wedge-like "column" formation travel more slowly, with no one breaking the trail in undisturbed snow, than the in-line file formation. Therefore, column formation is reserved for imminent enemy contact. As slope angle increases, the amount of travel time is likely to increase substantially.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;

''Water crossings'' – According to the US Army, rivers found in cold regions may be major obstacles. Subarctic rivers usually have many braided channels and swift currents. During spring and early winter, rivers may become impassable due to freezing or thawing ice flows. Once firmly frozen, rivers may offer routes for both mounted and dismounted movement. Some swampy areas do not freeze solidly during the coldest periods of winter to support troop movements. Nonetheless, it is possible to construct "ice bridges" to thicken an iced-over waterway, using pumps or some other means of flooding the ice-covered area, when temperatures are below {{convert |10|°F|order=flip}} and the pre-existing natural ice is thicker than 10 centimeters (four inches) to support the construction activity.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt; Red Army doctrine suggested the use of frozen lakes and rivers as expeditionary airfields, located close to the front to take advantage of short daylight hours in winter.&lt;ref name = RedArmy/&gt;

Soviet doctrine emphasized the importance of [[camouflage]] over positions and the need to remove telltale signs of artillery actions, such as smoke stains or shell casings. It also cited the usefulness of [[Military dummy|decoy targets]]. It describes the establishment of [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] made from snow {{conv|2|to|3|m|ft|0}} thick, ice {{conv|1.5|m|ft|0}} thick or soil and wood {{conv|0.9|m|ft|0}} thick.&lt;ref name = RedArmy/&gt;

===Materiel===

Snow, ice and cold temperatures affect [[munitions]] and military vehicles.

''Munitions'' – Snow, ice, frozen ground, and low temperatures affect mine-laying operations. Burying mines in a frost layer may be difficult, requiring mines to be placed on top of the ground and then camouflaged. Snow or ice may prevent detonation, owing to freezing the firing device or isolating from pressure above. This can be mitigated with plastic laid over the top of the mine.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;

''Vehicles'' – Adaptations of military vehicles to winter operations include [[tire chain]]s for maintaining traction of wheeled vehicles. Diesel engines start less well in cold and may require pre-heating or idling during cold periods.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt; A variety of military vehicles have been developed for over-snow travel, including the [[Sisu Nasu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Military engineering===
{{See also||Combat engineering|Military Engineering|Military engineering vehicle}}
[[Military engineering|Military engineers]] design and construct transportation and troop-support facilities.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt; Red Army doctrine gave them the responsibility to establish build and maintain routes, including water crossings, build and destroy obstacles that require special equipment, construct and maintain airfields, and to build shelter for personnel. Operations that didn't require special equipment were left to other troops.&lt;ref name = RedArmy/&gt;

In cold climates frozen ground can make digging difficult. It's often necessary to use local materials, if suitable, for construction. Engineers must provide roadways, landing zones, shelter, water supply and wastewater disposal, and electrical power to encampments. Roadway and landing zones require heavy equipment, which is more fatiguing to operate in the cold and necessary to protect from freezing. Snowstorms require cleanup and spring thaw requires management of thawed soil. Landing zones require stabilization of dust and snow to avoid blinding helicopter pilots. The US Army has cold-weather adaptive kits for providing water and electrical utilities. The tactical engineer has limited options for providing a water supply; they are in order of ease of provision:  drawing water from rivers or lakes, melting ice or snow, or drilling wells.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;

Water supply and treatment is especially challenging in the cold. US Army tactical water purification systems require a winter kit operate between {{Convert|32|and|-25|F}}. Water storage may require heating. Water source exploitation may require angering through ice, if shaped charges are not available. The water distribution system can be subject to freezing and clogging from [[frazil ice]]. Where chemical treatment is used, it takes longer to dissolve in the treated water.&lt;ref name=ArmyCold/&gt;

Three types of cold injury can occur in the theater, [[hypothermia]], [[trench foot]], and [[frostbite]] in ascending amount of exposure to cold temperatures.

==== Hypothermia====
Hypothermia occurs when the body [[core temperature]] drops below {{convert|35|C|F}}. Symptoms depend on the temperature and range from [[shivering]] and [[mental confusion]] to increased risk of the [[cardiac arrest|heart stopping]]. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia heating blankets and warmed [[intravenous fluid]]s are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO) or [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] may be useful. In those without a [[pulse]] [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than {{convert|32|C|F}}. Adequate insulation from clothing is the best way to avoid hypothermia in the field.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=DJ|last2=Brugger|first2=H|last3=Boyd|first3=J|last4=Paal|first4=P|title=Accidental hypothermia.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=Nov 15, 2012|volume=367|issue=20|pages=1930–8|pmid=23150960|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1114208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trench foot====
Trench foot is a medical condition caused by prolonged exposure of the feet to damp, unsanitary, and cold conditions at temperatures as warm as {{Conv|16|C}} for as few as 13 hours. Exposure to these environmental conditions causes deterioration and destruction of the [[capillary|capillaries]] and leads to morbidity of the surrounding flesh.&lt;ref name = Mann&gt;{{Citation

As the condition worsens, feet may also begin to swell. Advanced trench foot often involves [[blister]]s and [[open sore]]s, which lead to [[fungus|fungal]] infections. If left untreated, trench foot usually results in [[gangrene]], which may require [[amputation]]. If trench foot is treated properly, complete recovery is normal, though it is marked by severe short-term pain when feeling returns. Trench foot affected tens of thousands of soldiers engaged in [[trench warfare]] in [[World War I]]. Keeping feet warm and dry, or at least changing into warm and dry replacement footgear, is the best way to avoid trench foot.&lt;ref name = Tactical&gt;

====Frostbite====
Frostbite is localized damage to [[skin]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] due to [[freezing#Freezing of living organisms|freezing]]. At or below {{Conv|0|C}}, [[blood vessels]] close to the skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities. The same response may also be a result of exposure to high winds. This constriction helps to preserve core body temperature. In extreme cold, or when the body is exposed to cold for long periods, this protective strategy can reduce blood flow in some areas of the body to dangerously low levels. This lack of blood leads to the eventual freezing and death of skin tissue in the affected areas. Frostbite was responsible for over one million casualties in wars in the [[20th century]]. Adequate insulation from clothing is the best way to avoid hypothermia in the field.&lt;ref name = Tactical/&gt;

Subfreezing conditions have significant implications for naval operations. The 1988 ''US Navy Cold Weather Handbook for Surface Ships'' outlines effects on: icing on the topsides of ships, ship systems, underway replenishment, flight operations, and personnel. It also discusses preparations for cold-weather fleet operations.&lt;ref name = SurfaceShips&gt;{{Citation

===Topside icing on ships===
Topside icing is a serious hazard to ships operating in sub-freezing temperatures. Thick layers of ice can form on decks, sides, superstructures, deck mounted machinery, antennas and combat systems. The presence of topside ice has many adverse effects, principally it:&lt;ref name = SurfaceShips/&gt;
*Increases [[Displacement (ship)|ship displacement]]
*Decreases [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]]
*Impairs operation of deck machinery
*Impedes personnel movement on deck
*Restricts [[helicopter]] operations
*Disrupts operation of radio and radars

===Combat systems degradation===
Icing may prevent a warship from conducting any type of offensive operations, including restraining the doors of a vertical launch systems, binding gears, shafts, hinges and pedestals. Other effects include sluggish performance of lubricants, increased failure rate of seals, plugs and [[O-rings]], frozen [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]] [[sprinkler system]]s, excessively long warm-up times for electronics or weapon system electronics, and freeze up of compressed-air-operated components.&lt;ref name = SurfaceShips/&gt;

===Arctic operations===
[[Global climate change]] has opened the waters of the Arctic along the northern shores of Alaska, Russia and Canada. The region is rich in natural resources. Countries abutting the Arctic Ocean have shown greater military patrol activity. The ''Military Times'' reported in 2015 that Russia had reactivated ten military bases, had increased surface ship and aircraft patrols of its [[Northern Fleet]], and had conducted missile tests in the region. The US Navy plans to have sufficient assets by 2030 to respond militarily in the Arctic. As of 2015, it conducted regular submarine patrols, but few air or surface ship operations. Russia had twelve [[ice breaker]]s versus two for the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1304">The '''Democratic Alliance for Change''' ({{Lang-pt|Aliança Democrática para a Mudança}}, ADM) was a [[political alliance]] in [[Cape Verde]] in the early 2000s.

==History==
The ADM was established in the buildup to the [[Cape Verdean parliamentary election, 2001|January 2001 parliamentary elections]] as an alliance of the [[Democratic and Independent Cape Verdean Union]] (UCID), the [[Democratic Convergence Party (Cape Verde)|Democratic Convergence Party]] (PCD) and the [[Labour and Solidarity Party]] (PTS). The alliance received 6% of the vote, winning two seats in the [[National Assembly (Cape Verde)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name=HDCV&gt;Richard A Lobban Jr &amp; Paul Khalil Saucier (2007) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cape Verde'', Scarecrow Press, p23&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cape Verdean presidential election, 2001|presidential elections]] a month later, ADM candidate [[Jorge Carlos Fonseca]] finished third of the four candidates with 3% of the vote.

The parties contested the [[Cape Verdean parliamentary election, 2006|next elections]] in 2006 separately, with UCID winning two seats.

'''Ekwensu''' is a [[Trickster|Trickster God]] (an evil [[Alusi]]) of the [[Igbo people]] who serve as the [[Alusi]] or God of [[Bargaining|Bargain]]s and the tortoise. Crafty at trade and negotiations, he is often invoked for guidance in difficult mercantile situations. The deity was a force of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and Change, thus in his more violent aspects, Ekwensu was also revered as a God of War and Victory who ruled over the wicked spirits and the chaotic forces of nature. He is perceived as a spirit of violence that incites people to perform violent acts.&lt;ref name="AsanteNwadiora2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Molefi Kete Asante|author2=Emeka Nwadiora|title=Spear Masters: An Introduction to African Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QS3Y93DBe4QC&amp;pg=PA108|year=2007|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-3574-5|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ekwensu is said to be interested only in accomplishing evil deeds in the world.{{cn|date=October 2018}} His companion was [[Ogbunabali|Death]]. 

Although he is an evil Alusi, he was not originally regarded as the devil.&lt;ref name="AsanteNwadiora2007"/&gt; With the rise of Christianity, the more beneficent aspects of the deity were supplanted by [[missionaries]] who came to represent Ekwensu as [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Bewaji, John. [http://web.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v2/v2i1a1.htm "OLODUMARE: GOD IN YORUBA BELIEF AND THE THEISTIC PROBLEM OF EVIL."], ''University of Florida'', Gainesville, April 03, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the testing force of [[Chukwu]], and along with [[Ala (mythology)|Ani]] the Earth goddess, and Igwe, the Sky God, make up the three highest Arusi's of the ancient Igbo people.  During the colonial enslavement-missionary period Ekwensu was transcribed to become the [[Igbo language|Igbo]] word for Satan.

'''FARICE-1''' is a [[submarine communications cable]] connecting [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Scotland]].  The cable has been in use since January 2004 without a fault and is 100% owned by [http://www.farice.is/about-us/shareholders/ Icelandic shareholders]. {{fact|date=October 2015}} The cable had an initial design capacity of 720 Gbit/s and is a two fibre pair design. The length of the cable is 1205 km for the direct route between Iceland and Scotland. The cable structure and repeaters were made by Pirelli and the terminal equipment was supplied by TYCO.  In the year 2013 the terminal equipment was [http://www.farice.is/media-center/press-releases/nr/327 upgraded by Ciena] (100Gbit/s technology)  bringing the total capacity of the submarine cable to 11 Tbit/s. The cable has service access points in Reykjavik and [http://verneglobal.com Keflavik Airport] as well as in London Telehouse East. The company [[Farice|Farice ehf]] sells services over the FARICE-1 cable. FARICE-2 was never built. [[Danice|DANICE]] is the complementary submarine cable. 

The [[cable landing point|landing points]] are:
* 1. [[Seyðisfjörður]], Iceland, [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhauled]] to Reykjavík and KEF Airport
* 3. [[Funningsfjørður]], Faroe Islands, backhauled to 4. [[Tórshavn]]
* 5. [[Dunnet Bay]], [[Caithness]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], Scotland, backhauled to London Telehouse (previously Edinburgh)

[[File:Malta - Valletta - Xatt Lascaris - Customs House 04 ies.jpg|thumb|The [[Customs House (Valletta)|Customs House]] in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]

'''Giuseppe Bonici ''' (1707–1779) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] architect&lt;ref name="gaul"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaul|first=Simon|title=Malta, Gozo and Comino|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=Fevix8jSqg0C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=%22castellania+Valletta%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjck_q9_MPQAhUGWhQKHX_uCN4Q6AEINDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22castellania%20Valletta%22&amp;f=false|publisher=New Holland publishers|date=2007|page=325|isbn=9781860113659}}&lt;/ref&gt; and military engineer. He held the post of ''Capomastro delle Opere della Religione'' and was the principal architect of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] from 1761 until his death. He designed several notable buildings; his masterpiece was the [[Customs House (Valletta)|Customs House in Valletta]].

==Biography==
Bonici began drawing architectural plans at a young age, and he was apprenticed to the Maltese architect [[Giovanni Barbara]] and later the French military engineer [[René Jacob de Tigné]]. He made plans for the [[St. Publius Parish Church]] in [[Floriana]] in 1734, which solidified his fame as a master of religious architecture. His masterpiece is the Customs House in [[Valletta]], which he designed in 1774.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. 1 A-F|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090312/opinion/one-world-protecting-the-most-significant-buildings-monuments-and.248419 |title=One World - Protecting the most significant buildings, monuments and features of Valletta - The Old Customs House and statue of St Publius|newspaper=Times of Malta|date=2 March 2009 |author=&lt;!--not stated--&gt;|accessdate= 2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonici mainly designed buildings in the [[Maltese Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], even when the style was being superseded by [[neoclassical architecture]] in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bugeja|first1=Lino|title=Valletta – vibrant city of many styles|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150104/business-news/Valletta-vibrant-city-of-many-styles.550626|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=4 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060745/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150104/business-news/Valletta-vibrant-city-of-many-styles.550626|deadurl=no|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonici held a number of positions throughout his career, including a substitute engineer at the ''Commissari Domorum'', an examiner of those aspiring to be land surveyors, and ''Capomastro delle Fortificazioni della Fondazione Cotoner''. Most notably, he held the post of ''Capomastro delle Opere della Religione'', being the principal architect of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], from 1761 to his death in 1779. Bonnici was also a member of the [[Monte della Redenzione degli Schiavi]] and a [[Donat of the Order of Saint John|donat]] of the Order.&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;

The '''Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration''' ('''GCM''') is a politically binding "intergovernmentally negotiated agreement, prepared under the auspices of the [[United Nations]], [that covers] all dimensions of [[international migration]] in a holistic and comprehensive manner".&lt;ref name="Compact for migration"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/migration-compact|title=Compact for migration|date=2017-04-05|work=Refugees and Migrants|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations conference to adopt the compact will be held in [[Marrakesh]], Morocco, on 10–11 December 2018.&lt;ref name="Compact for migration"/&gt; Austria negotiated the GCM on behalf of the EU. The Global Compact is not an [[Treaty|international treaty]], and it will not be formally binding under [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Anne|date=21 November 2018|title=The Global Compact for Migration: to sign or not to sign?|url=https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-global-compact-for-migration-to-sign-or-not-to-sign/|journal=EJIL:Talk!|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

On 19 September 2016, the nations of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. The Declaration recognized a need for more cooperation between nations to manage migration effectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iom.int/global-compact-migration&lt;/ref&gt;. The declaration set off a process leading to the negotiation of the Global Compact for Migration.

A resolution was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 April 2017, which decided on the modalities and timeline for the compact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iom.int/sites/default/files/our_work/ODG/GCM/A-71_280-E.pdf Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 April 2017], International Organization for Migration&lt;/ref&gt; The agreed upon process consisted of the following three phases:
# Consultations (April—November 2017): six sessions in [[Geneva]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Vienna]]
# Stocktaking (December 2017—January 2018), leading to a first draft ("zero draft")
# Intergovernmental negotiations (February—July 2018) at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]] in New York

On 9 March 2017, [[Louise Arbour]] was appointed by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres|Guterres]] as his Special Representative for International Migration and was thus tasked with working with the nations and stakeholders to develop the compact.

==Substance of the agreement==

There are 23 objectives listed in the draft agreement. These include collecting and using accurate and anonymized data to develop evidence-based migration policy, ensuring that all migrants have proof of identity, enhancing availability and flexibility for regular migration, encouraging cooperation for tracking missing migrants and saving lives, ensuring migrants can access basic services, and making provisions for both full inclusion of migrants and social cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/12/government-won-t-commit-to-pulling-out-of-controversial-un-migration-agreement.html|title=Government won't commit to pulling out of controversial UN migration agreement|date=2018-12-01|work=Refugees and Migrants|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] did not participate in the negotiation of the agreement, at the behest of President [[Donald Trump|Trump]].&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;

The Chancellor of Austria, [[Sebastian Kurz]], stated that the compact would reduce Austria's sovereignty and mix up the difference between illegal and legal immigration as well as that between [[Economic migrant|economic]] and humanitarian immigration.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apa.at/Site/News.de.html?id=6245223664 |title=Österreich zieht sich aus globalem UNO-Migrationspakt zurück |last= |first= |date=31 October 2018 |website=apa.at |publisher=[[Austria Presse Agentur]]| language = German |access-date=31 October 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister of Israel [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] commented tersely: "We have a duty to protect our borders against illegal infiltrators.

On the 28 November 2018, the Romanian Foreign Minister has been authorized by the Romanian president, [[Klaus Iohannis]], to sign the Migration Pact. Sources say that negotiations were carried out secretly for a long time before news broke out to the public. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Președintele Iohannis a aprobat propunerea Guvernului pentru susținerea de către România a pactului ONU pentru migrație |url=https://www.b1.ro/stiri/politica/presedintele-iohannis-a-aprobat-propunerea-guvernului-pentru-sustinerea-de-catre-romania-a-pactul-onu-pentru-migratie-251247.html |accessdate=29-Nov-2018 |agency=B1.ro |publisher=B1.ro |date=28-Nov-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lungu |first1=Vasile-Cristian |title=Pactul Global pentru Migraţie sau cum să anulezi Constituţia României |url=https://adevarul.ro/news/societate/pactul-global-migratie-anulezi-constitutia-romaniei-1_5bfe55badf52022f75e26bc1/index.html |accessdate=29-nov-2018 |agency=adevarul.ro |publisher=adevarul.ro &amp; V.C.

There has also been some opposition in the German parliament, led by [[Alternative for Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knight |first1=Ben |title=German parliament rows over UN Migration Compact |url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-parliament-rows-over-un-migration-compact/a-46213002 |date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Finland]], the opposition [[Finns Party]] opposes the treaty and demands a vote in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.suomenuutiset.fi/perussuomalaiset-kyselytunnilla-gcm-siirtolaissopimus-tuotava-eduskunnan-paatettavaksi/&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions disputed by the Finns in parliament are that both legal and illegal immigrants would be bestowed many of the same rights such as rights to basic services, that the treaty would not allow categorical detention of illegal immigrants,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iltalehti.fi/politiikka/a/a3405347-bf8f-458f-a25a-d64f80068569&lt;/ref&gt; and that the treaty would make migration a human right.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.suomenuutiset.fi/poliittinen-suunnittelija-purra-gcm-sopimus-tulee-varmasti-vaikuttamaan-suomen-maahanmuuttopolitiikkaan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.suomenuutiset.fi/asiantuntija-yk-ajaa-gcm-sopimuksella-eteenpain-radikaalia-ajatusta-siita-etta-siirtolaisuus-on-ihmisoikeus/&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Government of Estonia]] remained divided on the issue&lt;ref&gt;Ott Ummelas, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/dispute-over-migration-sends-estonian-government-into-crisis Dispute Over Migration Sends Estonian Government Into Crisis], Bloomberg News (November 16, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; and the country's position was to be decided by the [[Riigikogu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vahtla |first1=Aili |title=To solve government crisis, let Riigikogu decide on UN compact, says SDE |url=https://news.err.ee/878149/to-solve-government-crisis-let-riigikogu-decide-on-un-compact-says-sde |website=news.err.ee |publisher=ERR |date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, Riigikogu passed a declaration which supported the compact.

[[Switzerland]] will not attend the conference for the formal adoption of the framework in December 2018. The decision was made because the parliament demanded a final say on whether the country would approve the compact, which would require more time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swiss backtrack on support for UN migration pact |url=https://www.thelocal.ch/20181121/swiss-backtrack-on-support-for-un-migration-pact |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 November, the Danish Prime Minister [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] stated that he was supportive of the agreement, but that his government would form a coalition of European countries to create an opt-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Løkke hælder DF af brættet: Forsvarer omstridt FN-pagt |url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/politik/ECE11033617/loekke-haelder-df-af-braettet-forsvarer-omstridt-fnpagt/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |agency=Jyllandsposten |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, [[Michel Government|government]] party [[N-VA]], including its Secretary of State for Migration [[Theo Francken]], is against participating, while the three other government parties are in favour, creating a political deadlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20181202_04004269|title=Michel heeft verzoeningsvoorstel omtrent Migratiepact|publisher=[[De Standaard]]|date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3613">'''Heini Dittmar''' (March 30, 1912, [[Bad Kissingen]], [[Unterfranken]], [[Germany]] &amp;ndash; April 28, 1960 near [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]], West Germany) was a record-breaking [[Germans|German]] [[glider pilot]].

Inspired by the example of his glider flying brother Edgar, Dittmar took an apprenticeship at the German Institute for Gliding (DFS). In 1932, flying his self-built glider ''[[Dittmar Condor|Kondor]]'', he won a first prize at the [[Wasserkuppe|Rhön Glider Competition]].

Dittmar then became a research pilot. In 1934, he, [[Hanna Reitsch]], [[Peter Riedel]], and [[Wolf Hirth]] were members of Professor Georgii's South American Glider Expedition,&lt;ref name=Reitsch&gt;Reitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, {{ISBN|1853672629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}} where in Argentina he achieved a new world gliding altitude record (about {{Convert|4350|m}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segelflugmuseum.de/index.php?id=4288&amp;psid=36acea5862043b7b5f446800cda5e2eb Heini Dittmar] at the [[Deutsches Segelflugmuseum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, he achieved a new world record for long-distance using a ''[[DFS Fafnir|Fafnir II]]'' and was awarded the [[Hindenburg Cup]]. In 1936, he achieved the first crossing of the [[Alps]] in a glider. He then crowned his career as a glider pilot by becoming the first [[World Gliding Championships|Gliding World Champion]] after his victory at the first Rhön International Gliding Competition in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport-komplett.de/sport-komplett/sportarten/f/flugsport/hst/32.html] First gliding world champion&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the [[Second World War]], Dittmar worked as an aircraft designer and [[test pilot]]. On 2 October 1941, flying the [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Messerschmitt Me 163A V4 KE+SW]], he became the first human to fly faster than {{Convert|1000|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Reitsch/&gt;{{rp|175}} This record was achieved over the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]]-specified 3-km distance and was measured using an [[Askania]] theodolite. Later, on 6 July 1944, he reached a speed of {{Convert|1130|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Later versions|the Me 163B V18]] bearing the ''Stammkennzeichen'' code of VA+SP, nearly losing the complete rudder surface in the process to flutter.&lt;ref&gt;(in German) Käsmann, Ferdinand C.W., ''Die schnellsten Jets der Welt'' (Berlin: Aviatic-Verlag GmbH, 1999, {{ISBN|3-925505-26-1}}), pp. 17, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Bie, Rob.

The '''Home Army 5th Wilno Brigade''' (also known as the ''Brigade of Death'') was a unit of the [[Poles|Polish]] [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|anti-Nazi resistance]] organization [[Home Army]], active in the [[Vilnius Region]] during [[World War II]]. The main commander of the brigade was [[major]] [[Zygmunt Szendzielarz]], nom de guerre "''Łupaszko''".

During the [[German occupation of Poland]] the brigade found itself in particularly difficult circumstances as it faced off against three different foes; the German [[Nazis]], Lithuanian units which were collaborating with them, as well as [[Soviet partisans]] who generally fought against Home Army units in the region. In July 1944, the brigade numbered around 500 partisans.

'''ITN''', is a file format designed as an itinerary data format for TomTom devices.

It can be used to describe itineraries using support [[waypoint]]s. The format is proprietary for TomTom. Its data store location, name, and waypoint type and can in this way be used to interchange data between GPS devices and software packages. Such computer programs allow users, for example, to create and modify itineraries.

==Data types==
The file format assumes that each line in it holds a supporting waypoint:
&lt;pre&gt;longitude|latitude|description|type|&lt;/pre&gt;
The type specifies whether how to handle this waypoint:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type
! Meaning
|-
| 0
| Regular waypoint
|-
| 1
| Waypoint is disabled (will be skipped when navigating the itinerary, appears dimmed in the itinerary overview)
|-
| 2 
| Stopover or destination
|-
| 3 
| Stopover is disabled (will be skipped when navigating the itinerary, appears dimmed in the itinerary overview)
|-
| 4 
| Departure point (should only be set for the first item in the itinerary file)
|}

==Units==
Latitude and longitude are expressed in fixed point integer numbers using the [[World Geodetic System#A new World Geodetic System: WGS 84|WGS 84 datum]]. Please note these numbers are the floating point values times 100,000, e.g. the latitude 52.493601 will be shown as 5249360.

It is allowed to prefix these numbers with + or -.

== Sample ITN document ==
The following is an ITN file produced by a [[TomTom]] hand-held GPS unit. This document does not show all functionality which can be stored in the ITN format but its purpose is to serve as a brief illustration.

&lt;pre&gt;490843|5237653|Amsterdam Central Station|4|
496283|5226712|Abcoude Park and Ride|0|
507226|5208633|Stadsbaan Utrecht|0|
509797|5199465|Company in Vianen|2|&lt;/pre&gt;

== Limitations ==
TomTom devices as of 2014 will only accept at most 255 waypoints. Devices before that allow 32 or 48 at most, with an exception for the Rider product range, allowing 100 waypoints.

It is unknown what the maximum length of the description field is allowed to be, most applications assume 64 characters. The character encoding of the description is assumed to be [[Windows-1252]] (the Latin alphabet), sometimes called ANSI. This character set allows 224 different characters to be used, supporting most European languages.

TomTom decided in 2015 to deprecate the ITN format in favour of the more versatile [[GPS Exchange Format|GPX]] format. ITN is still supported as an import format.

==News==

In May 2011, the national Gambia Police Force (GPF) gave a substantial donation to the Foundation.  The GPF, in a ceremony at 
Police Headquarters in Banjul, donated 31 bags of farm produce, including 7 bags of groundnuts, 7 bags of coos, 11 bags of maize and 6 bags of rice.&lt;ref&gt;Omar Wally, [http://allafrica.com/stories/201105200053.html “Gambia: Police  Force Gives to JFP”], ''[[The Daily Observer|The Daily Observer (Banjul)]]'', 19 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[Ameera al-Taweel|Saudi Arabian Princess Ameera bint Aidan bin Nayef Al-Taweel]] visited the Gambia and toured the Foundation. The Foundation donated $500,000 for the construction of a health [[Medical imaging|diagnostic]] center.

'''''Langile [[Abertzale]]en Batzordeak''''' ('''LAB,''' [[Basque language|Basque]] for '''"Nationalist Workers' Committees"''') is a [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] [[left-wing nationalism|left-wing nationalist]] and [[separatism|separatist]] [[trade union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=José M. |last=Faraldo |title=Spain: The Common Experience of Transition and a Military Coup |work=Solidarity with Solidarity: Western European Trade Unions and the Polish Crisis, 1980–1982 |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2010 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating mainly in Spain currently led by [[Garbiñe Aranburu]].

It was created in 1974 by [[Jon Idigoras]] among others. They are part of the [[Basque National Liberation Movement]], an aggregation of leftist [[Basque nationalist]] forces including the illegal paramilitary organization [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna]] (ETA) and the illegal parties [[Batasuna]] and [[Segi (organization)|Segi]]. It is supported by around 45.000 affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gara.net/paperezkoa/20120617/347429/es/LAB-sera-pilar-fundamental-cambios-politicos-sociales 'LAB será un pilar fundamental en los cambios políticos y sociales'], Gara, June 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The union is legal and it is one of the four major of its kind in the Basque Country. In the last decades it has been working mostly with the other nationalist union, [[Basque Workers' Solidarity|ELA]], while both have been opposed often by the Spanish-wide trade unions, [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] and [[CC.OO.]], that make up their own bloc.

In 2011 it had the 16.2%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.labsindikatua.org/es/sindicato-lab/101-hauteskunde-sindikalak/641-lab-izan-da-2011-urtean-hego-euskal-herrian-ordezkaritza-gehien-igo-duen-sindikatua-&lt;/ref&gt; of the labor delegates in the [[Southern Basque Country]].

{{Politics of Malta}}

The '''Leader of the Opposition of Malta''' is by convention the leader of the most powerful party in the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] not in [[Government of Malta|government]]. The Leader of the Opposition is appointed by the [[President of Malta]], with the President making his or her decision based on the situation within the [[House of Representatives of Malta|Maltese parliament]]. 

The Office is constitutional in nature and the Leader of Opposition is normally viewed as an alternative [[Prime Minister]], and must be a member of the [[House of Representatives of Malta]]. The post did not exist in the period between 1933 and 1947 or the period between 1958 and 1962.

The '''Organization of World Heritage Cities''' (OWHC) is an international non-profit, non-governmental organization of 250 cities in which sites of the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] list are located. It was founded in 1993 in [[Fez, Morocco]], during the second International Symposium of World Heritage Cities. The headquarters of the OWHC are located in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], Canada. Altogether the 250 member cities of the OWHC have a population of more than 130 million.

== History ==
During the first International Symposium of World Heritage Cities in Québec City in 1991 the participating 41 cities adopted the Québec City Declaration. This declaration states the desire to build a network of World Heritage Cities.

At the second International Symposium of World Heritage Cities in Fez, Morocco, the OWHC was founded in 1993. 56 participating cities decided on the mission, goals and powers of the organisation. At the Founding General Assembly the member cities elected the first Board of Directors and Secretary General.

Since the first General Assembly the member cities have been meeting every two years. Listed below are the years, locations and topics of the previous General Assemblies.
* 1995 Bergen (Norway): Communication between World Heritage Cities
* 1997 Evora (Portugal): Tourism and World Heritage – Challenges and Opportunities
* 1999 Santago de Compostela (Spain): Innovation in the Management of World Heritage Cities
* 2001 Puebla (Mexico): Prevention and Protection Measures for World Heritage Cities in Case of Disaster
* 2003 Rhodes (Greece)
* 2005 Cusco (Peru): Heritage of Humanity, Heritage with Humanity
* 2007 Kazan (Russian Federation): Heritage and Economics
* 2009 Quito (Ecuador): The revitalization of historic centres: how to involve all social actors?
* 2011 Sintra (Portugal): World Heritage Cities and Climate Change
* 2013 Oaxaca (Mexico): Heritage Cities, Sustainable Cities
* 2015 Arequipa (Peru): World Heritage Cities, Resilent Cities
* 2017 Ahmedabad  (India): World Heritage cities
* 2017 Asmara (Eritrea): World Heritage cities, Africa's Modernest city

== Organization ==
Any city may become a member of the OWHC if it possesses the following two characteristics. Firstly the city has to be the location of a living urban fabric of historic or contemporary interest. Its outstanding universal value has been recognized by the UNESCO and therefore has been registered in the World Heritage List. Secondly the city has to adhere to the values of the OWHC.

The General Assembly is the paramount authority of the OWHC. In it the member cities are represented by their mayor. To be able to take part in the General Assembly and have the right to vote the city has to be a member in good standing (pay the annual membership fee). The General Assembly meets every two years. Special Assemblies may be called by members or the Board of Directors.

At the General Assembly the mayors discuss issues concerning the mission and objectives of the OWHC and formulate relevant recommendations to the Board of Directors. The Assembly guides the activities of the Organization, studies and approves the Organization’s work program and controls the financial policy of the Organization.

The Board of Directors consists of eight mayors of members in good standing. It is elected by the General Assembly for two years. Directors may be elected two more times and therefore be directors for a maximum of six consecutive years. The Board of Directors meets at least once a year.

Among its duties are the implementation of the requests formulated and the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the planning of the organizations activities according to set up priorities. Furthermore, the Board of Directors examines the financial reports, authorizes the annual budget plan, prepares budget estimates and proposes their adoption to the general assembly. The Board of Directors also draws up the organization chart, the recruiting criteria and standards for the personnel of the General Secretariat and performs any other duty that could be assigned to it by the General Assembly. It is empowered to take all the measures required for the administration of the Organization and the attainment of its objectives.

The Board of Directors elects the President of the OWHC from among themselves. He is the chief executive officer of the OWHC and is tasked with the supervision, administration and management of the affairs of the Organization. He represents the OWHC at the national and international levels and binds the Organization in official acts.

The General Secretariat is headed by the Secretary General who is appointed by the General Assembly for a four-year term. He oversees the execution of mandates by the members, the day-to-day administration and personnel management and hiring. He also coordinates the activities of the OWHC, prepares the budget and the financial reports and ensures that the decisions of the Board of Directors and those of the members taken at the General Assembly are carried out.

The General Secretariat is supported in its duties by seven Regional Secretariats. They are groupings of cities that share cultural, linguistic or geographical affinities and/or have the same concerns and needs. Every member city of the OWHC is allowed to be part of one or more regions. The members of one region have to choose a city from among themselves as domicile for the Regional Secretariat, choose a Regional Coordinator and meet at least once a year. They serve as a link between the member cities of their particular region and the General Secretariat.

The seven Regional Secretariats are
* Regensburg (Germany) for the North-West European Region
* Budapest (Hungary) for the Central and Eastern European Region
* Córdoba (Spain) for the South-European and Mediterranean Region
* Valparaiso (Chile) for the Latinamerican and Caribbean Region
* Kazan (Russian Federation) for the Euro-Asian Region
* Tunis (Tunisia) for Africa and the Middle East
* Gyeongju (South Korea) for the Asia-Pacific Region

To support the General Secretariat the Regional Secretariats assist in producing documents intended for members, data collection and the organization of relevant events. They aim to make it possible for each member to participate more extensively in the activities of the Organization, to foster communication and the exchange of information amongst themselves and to promote the development of the Organization and its presence and influence. To accomplish those aims the Regional Secretariats organize activities intended to promote the Organization´s values and objectives.

The OWHC has five official languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. Of those English, French and Spanish are working languages.

== Goals ==
During the founding of the OWHC in 1993 the member cities defined the goals and mission the Organization should have in the future. At the fourth General Assembly in Evora (Portugal) in 1997 the OWHC confirmed the Organization´s association with the UNESCO and their joint efforts regarding World Heritage Cities in the UNESCO-OWHC agreement.

The OWHC aims for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention (''Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage adopted by the UNESCO in 1972''). It encourages cooperation and exchange of information and expertise among its member cities on both regional and international levels. The OWHC works in close collaboration with other organizations pursuing similar goals while promoting action likely to support the efforts of cities located in developing countries. It assists members to adapt and improve their management methods in relation to the specific requirements of having a site inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Moreover, the organization ensures better links between research undertaken by specialists and the needs of the local managements. In addition the Organization intends to help develop a sense of solidarity among its member cities and to sensitize the populations to heritage values and their protection.

== Tasks and projects ==
The OWHC organizes meetings on international and regional levels. In addition to the biennial General Assemblies there are World Congresses, conferences, seminars and workshops. All those meetings deal with the challenges in the realm of management and strategies pertaining to the preservation and development of historic cities. To accomplish its goals the OWHC additionally offers various activities, programs and projects which aim to promote and support the maintenance, recognition and development of world heritage.

Current projects include ''Youth on the Trail of World Heritage'', ''City2City'', ''The Jean-Paul-L’Allier Prize for Heritage'', an International Video Production Competition, the ''Solidarity day of World Heritage Cities'', ''Mayors&amp;Heritage'' and ''Case Studies.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12030">The '''Pacific Economic Cooperation Council''' ('''PECC''') is a network of member committees composed of individuals and institutions dedicated to promoting cooperation across the Asia Pacific region, headquartered in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pecc.org/about/pecc-international-secretariat|title=PECC - PECC :: The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council - International Secretariat|website=www.pecc.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; PECC has 23 full member committees [[Australia]]; [[Brunei Darussalam]]; [[Canada]]; [[Chile]]; [[China]]; [[Colombia]]; [[Ecuador]]; [[Hong Kong]]; [[Indonesia]]; [[Japan]]; [[Korea]]; [[Malaysia]]; [[Mexico]]; [[Mongolia]];  [[New Zealand]]; [[Peru]]; the [[Philippines]]; [[Singapore]]; [[Taiwan]]; [[Thailand]]; the [[United States]]; [[Vietnam]] and the Pacific Island Forum, one associate member: [[France]] (Pacific Territories), and 2 institutional members: [[Pacific Trade and Development Conference]] (PAFTAD) and the [[Pacific Basin Economic Council]] (PBEC).

==History==

The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) was founded in 1980 at the initiative of Mr Masayoshi Ohira and Mr Malcolm Fraser, then Prime Ministers of Japan and Australia respectively. Its founding name was the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference with the final word changed to Council years later. The Council brings together leading thinkers, and decision makers from government and business in an informal setting to discuss and formulate ideas on the most significant challenges facing the [[Asia pacific|Asia Pacific]]. It regularly develops and advocates regional policy initiatives to aid in the stable economic development of the region.

PECC’s regional community building efforts led to the establishment of the official APEC process in 1989, the Council is one of the three official observers of the APEC process.

Participation in the PECC Process depends on a commitment to economic cooperation in the Pacific. PECC participants, seek to achieve increased, open regional economic cooperation and interaction, while recognizing both the realities of, and the benefits accruing from, global interdependence and continuing to encourage increased economic cooperation and interaction with other nations and regions.

PECC organizes an annual General Meeting to develop strategic perspectives to promote the Pacific Community. Participants in the PECC General Meeting are delegates from PECC member committees and observers.

There is a Standing Committee, the PECC's governing body, which consists of all of the full member committees, and two institutional members and invited associate member committees in a limited capacity. this SC meets once a year.&lt;ref&gt;PECC SC http://www.pecc.org/resources/doc_download/593-annex-4-pecc-standing-committee-members&lt;/ref&gt;

The Co-chairs are elected for 3-year terms, Dr Charles E. Morrison, President of the East West Center and Mr Jusuf Wanandi, Senior Fellow and Vice-Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies are the current co-chairs.

Task Forces are the primary mechanisms for PECC work program. Each work group is composed of representatives from member committees and, where applicable, other invited institutions and/or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;PECC Task Force http://www.pecc.org/about-us/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

The PECC International Secretariat is located in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;PECC Structure http://www.pecc.org/about-us/structure&lt;/ref&gt;

PECC’s priority areas for research are decided by its governing body, the Standing Committee composed of the chairs of PECC’s member committees. PECC’s research is freely available on its website: www.pecc.org.

Prior to 2005, the chair of the Standing Committee was the chair of the host of the next General Meeting. In 2005, PECC amended its charter to provide more continuity in its work. Dr Charles Morrison was elected as chair of the Standing Committee. In 2009, the PECC charter was further amended to introduce a co-chair system. The co-chairs are elected by consensus for a period of 3 years and may stand for re-election once. The co-chairs should provide continuity in leadership and should provide leadership for the organization from both sides of the Pacific (Article 3.5.7 of the PECC Charter). At its meeting in Singapore in April 2012, the Standing Committee re-elected Mr Jusuf Wanandi of Indonesia term and elected Ambassador Donald Campbell of Canada as its co-chairs. In 2015, the Standing Committee re-elected Ambassador Campbell for a second term and Ambassador Tang Guoqiang was elected as co-chair, succeeding Mr Wanandi. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pecc.org/pecc/205-member-updates/648-co-chairs-of-pecc-amb-tang-guoqiang-cncpec-and-amb-don-campbell-cancpec&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st General Meeting of PECC (PECC XXI) was hosted by CANCPEC (Canada committee) in Vancouver on June 3–5, 2013. It was held in conjunction with Canada-Asia 2013 and organized by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.

The opening plenary session, 'Key Trends Shaping the Asia-Pacific" examined the latest economic, political, and social trends in the Asia-Pacific, identifying the emerging opportunities and uncertainties in the region. Will slower economic growth be the norm in Asia over the next few years and how will this affect both the regional and global economy? What will be the impact of a rapidly growing urban population—particularly one with an increasing middle class with evolving needs and expectations? Given the two on-going regional trade negotiations, what will be the future of trade in the Asia Pacific?

The opening plenary session was followed by concurrent breakout sessions which  covered diverse topics including: infrastructure deficit in the Asia-Pacific, creativity and innovation in Asia, promoting inclusive growth and resilient societies in Asia, green growth, and risks to growth in the Asia-Pacific.

Later plenary sessions covered Canada's Asia strategy and how economies are responding to the rise of Asia. Thereafter, breakout sessions addressed Canada's contribution to sustainable growth in the Asia-Pacific, and preparation of Canada's next generation to compete in an international environment increasingly influenced by developments in Asia.

The last time PECC GM was held in Vancouver was in November 1986 when Mr. Eric Trigg served as the International Chair of PECC. PECC General Meetings are open to the wider public and attended also by youth delegates who have been selected by their respective PECC member committees.&lt;ref&gt;Upcoming Official Schedule http://www.pecc.org/images/stories/events/2013/PECC_GM_Program_22Mar2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=May 2011}}

The word '''''plenipotentiary''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''plenus'' "full" and ''potens'' "powerful") has two meanings.  As a noun, it refers to a person who has "[[full powers]]". In particular, the term commonly refers to a [[diplomat]] fully authorized to represent a [[government]] as a [[prerogative]] (e.g., [[ambassador]]).  As an adjective, ''plenipotentiary'' refers to something—an edict, assignment, etc.—that confers "full powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plenipotentiary|title = Dictionary.com - plenipotentiary|date = |accessdate = |website = Dictionary.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomats==
Before the era of rapid international transport or essentially instantaneous [[communication]] (such as [[telegraph]] in the mid-19th century and then [[radio]]), diplomatic mission chiefs were granted full (''plenipotentiary'') powers to represent their government in negotiations with their host nation. Conventionally, any representations made or agreements reached with a plenipotentiary would be recognized and complied with by their government.

Historically, the common generic term for high diplomats of the crown or state was ''minister''. It therefore became customary to style the chiefs of full ranking missions as '''Minister Plenipotentiary'''. This position was roughly equivalent to the modern [[Ambassador]], a term that historically was reserved mainly for missions between the great powers and also relating to the dogal (city) state of [[Venice]].

Permanent missions at a bilateral level were chiefly limited to relations between large, neighboring or closely allied powers, rarely to the very numerous small [[Principality|principalities]], hardly worth the expense. However, diplomatic missions were dispatched for specific tasks, such as negotiating a treaty bilaterally, or via a conference, such as the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In such cases, it was normal to send a representative minister empowered to cast votes. For example, in the Peace [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]], ending the American Revolution, [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Jay]] were named "minister plenipotentiary of the United States" to the Netherlands, France and Spain, respectively.

By the time of the [[Vienna Congress]] (1814–15), which codified diplomatic relations, [[Ambassador]] had become a common title, and was established as the only class above Minister Plenipotentiary. Ambassadors gradually became the standard title for bilateral mission chiefs, as their ranks no longer tended to reflect the importance of the states, which came to be treated as formally equal.

In modern times, heads of state and of government, and more junior [[Diplomatic minister|ministers]] and officials, can easily meet or speak with each other personally. Therefore, ambassadors arguably do not require plenipotentiary powers. However they continue to be designated and accredited as ''extraordinary and plenipotentiary''.

==Administration==
Outside of  diplomatic plenipotentiaries, some permanent administrators are also given plenipotentiary powers. Central governments have sometimes conferred plenipotentiary status (either formally or de facto) on territorial governors. This has been most likely to occur when the remoteness of the administered territory made it impracticable for the central government to maintain and exercise its policies, laws and initiatives directly.

There have been instances where a mandate was conferred publicly on a senior official, such as a minor member of the ruling house (sometimes with the title of [[viceroy]]) but with secret instructions drastically limiting the position's power by conferring plenipotentiary status on a more junior administrator, possibly of lower social class or caste. Thus, the formal position an individual holds has not always been a reliable indicator of actual plenipotentiary authority.

Even in modern times, the Plenipotentiary title has been revived sometimes, for example for the administrators of protectorates or in other cases of indirect rule.

Examples of plenipotentiary administration are given below.

===Colonial era===
* In 1879 - 1884, the explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] (b. 1841 - d. 1904) was styled Plenipotentiary of the [[Committee for the Studies of Upper Congo]] (CEHC) (from 1882, renamed International Association of the Congo [AIC], a front for the ambitions of Belgian King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]], not supported by the Belgian government) in Equatorial Africa, while military command lay with four consecutive Commandants of the (leading) station at [[Karema, Tanzania|Karema]]; on 22 April 1884 the International Association of the Congo became the independent [[Congo Free State]], under regular authorities (headed, strictly personal, by Belgian king Leopold II), at first styled Administrator-general.

===Pre-World War II Europe===
* On the Greek island of [[Crete]], after the President of the Executive Commission of the Cretan Assembly, [[Ioannis Sfakianakis]] (b. 1848 - d. 1924), had exercised executive power 20 March - 21 December 1898 after evicting the last Ottoman ''[[Wāli]]'' (Ottoman governor), a Supreme Plenipotentiary Commissioner of the (Christian protecting) Powers headed the official administration of the 20 March 1898 instituted [[Cretan State]] (formally under Ottoman suzerainty until union with Greece was unilaterally declared on 6 October 1908):
**21 December 1898 - 30 September 1906 [[Prince George of Greece]] (b. 1869 - d. 1959)
**1 October 1906 - 30 September 1911 [[Alexandros Zaimis]] (b. 1855 - d. 1936); then, 30 September 1911 - 30 May 1913, the post remained vacant but was not abolished until the island was officially incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]] in December 1913.
*During the [[Russian Civil War]], Karl Lander was named Plenipotentiary of the Northern Caucasus and the Don by the Soviet government to exercise this power for prosecution of rebellious Cossacks.
* In [[Slovakia]], 15 January 1927 - 28 June 1928 {{Interlanguage link multi|Jozef Kállay|cs}} (b. 1881 - d. 1939) was Minister Plenipotentiary and Administrator of the Czechoslovak government
* In [[Ireland]], October 1921, the [[Second Dáil|revolutionary parliament of Ireland]] gave [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[Arthur Griffith]] and Robert Barton positions of plenipotentiary to negotiate the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] with Britain.

===Nazi Germany===
* in [[Slovakia]], July 1939 - 4 April 1945, three consecutive German Envoys and Ministers Plenipotentiary (the old diplomatic style) formally represented the Reich in the fascist [[puppet state]] (14 March 1939 - 3 April 1945) of [[Jozef Tiso]] (b. 1887 - d. 1947; former Czechoslovak Ministers for Slovak Affairs 6 October - 28 November 1938) HSLS (acting to 26 October 1939; from 1942 self-styled ''Vodca'' "Leader", a typical extreme right nationalist [[Führer]]-imitation)
* in the occupied [[Netherlands]], the Dutch being a Germanic people, under a ''[[Reichskommissar]]'' ("Reich Commissioner"), German Plenipotentiaries were appointed during 1940-45 at the provincial level by the side of the regular Dutch Provincial Commissioners in [[Drenthe]], [[Friesland]] (Frisia, i.e. west and south of Germany's own East Frisia), [[Gelderland]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[North Holland]], [[Overijssel]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[South Holland]], and during 1940-1944 in [[North Brabant]] and [[Zeeland]] .
* in [[Denmark]], another Germanic country under Nazi-German occupation (9 April 1940 - 5 May 1945), initially a German protectorate was established, led by a '''''Reichsbevollmächtigter''''' ("Reich Plenipotentiary"). On 29 August 1943, the German Nazis took over direct administration under military commander [[Hermann von Hanneken (soldier)|Hermann von Hanneken]] after declaring a state of military emergency.
* in mid 1944, [[Joseph Goebbels]] was named Reich Plenipotentiary for [[Total War]] on the home front (''Reichsbevollmächtigter für den totalen Kriegseinsatz an der Heimatfront''), as other Nazi personalities earned Plenipotentiary titles inside the Reich's government. [[Heinrich Himmler]] held the title of ''Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung'' or general plenipotentiary for the entire Reich's administration. His aide, [[Walter Schellenberg]], held the title of ''Sonderbevollmächtigter'' or special plenipotentiary to Himmler. Granting absolute power over a particular or general governmental matter to a single individual was a pervasive practice among the top Nazis.
* the German de facto military takeover of Italy, its major European [[Axis powers|Axis]]-ally, after Mussolini's military and political collapse (he was ''pro forma'' restyled Provisional Head of State and Prime minister of the "[[Italian Social Republic]]", i.e. the fascist Counter Government at [[Salò]]) was headed 12 September 1943 - 28 April 1945 by a German Plenipotentiary: [[Rudolf Rahn]] (b. 1900 - d. 1975); there were separate military commanders.

===In Africa===
* When the empress of [[Ethiopia]], [[Zauditu]], succeeded to her throne, her relative Ras [[Tafari Makonnen]] was installed as her  [[crown prince]]. As he subsequently became the effective ruler of the country, however, his title was seen as being insufficient. As a result, Zauditu then gave him the further position of ''regent plenipotentiary''. By virtue of it, he continued to serve as the most powerful man in Ethiopia until he was given another title, that of [[Petty king|king-under-the-empress]]. He held this new title until Zauditu died and he was proclaimed emperor in his own right with the [[regnal name]] of Haile Selassie.

===Since 1945===
====South Africa====
It may be impractical to hold a new referendum for each step of series of negotiated changes, and thus ministers might ask an electorate for plenipotentiary powers in advance, as in the [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992]].  Prior to the referendum, the state president [[F. W. de Klerk]] had already implemented extensive reforms e.g. removing the [[Group Areas Act]].  However, his right to negotiate these reforms was questioned by other parties e.g. [[Andries Treurnicht|Andries Treurnicht's]] [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]], particularly in response to the National Party's [[Potchefstroom]] by-election defeat in February 1992. Given how heavily entrenched apartheid was in the South African legal system at the time, Mr. de Klerk needed to nullify many previous bills and pass many new ones, making a series of individual referenda impractical. Consequently,  as a practical solution to the political deadlock, Mr. de Klerk held a referendum on 17 March 1992 to ask the white South African electorate to give him plenipotentiary powers.

====Russia====
On May 18, 2000, in the post-Soviet [[Russia|Russian Federation]] the title Plenipotentiary of the President was established for the appointees of the [[President of the Russian Federation|President of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]], in each of the seven [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]] created on May 13: Dalnevostochny (Far Eastern), Privolzhsky (Volga Region), Severo-Zapadny (North Western), Sibirsky (Siberian), Tsentralny (Central), Uralsky (Ural) and Yuzhny (Southern).

'''Politihjemmeværnet''' is a [[Danish Home Guard]] unit, which can support the [[Police of Denmark|Danish police]] in various tasks.

==Operation==
The Danish police can call upon the assistance from a section of the [[Danish Home Guard|Danish home guard]]; the ''police home guard''. The police home guard consists of 47 companies, each led by professional police officers.

The volunteers are mainly used for traffic control at [[festival]]s, [[Missing person|searches for victims]] and guarding community installations and are never used where there are risks of direct confrontation with civilians ([[riot control]] or planned [[arrest]]s). The companies are part of the Army Home Guard.

They are dressed in the branch-common daily battle dress uniforms, green berets and bright yellow wests with the text "POLITI HJEMMEVÆRNET".

The police home guard can have slightly more legal authority than other citizens, when the service they provide calls for it, but are always under the supervision of the civilian police.

'''Rote Island''' ({{lang-id|Pulau Rote}}, also spelled ''Roti'') is an [[island]] of [[Indonesia]], part of the [[East Nusa Tenggara]] [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. According to legend, this island got its name accidentally when a lost [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailor arrived and asked a farmer where he was. The surprised farmer, who could not speak Portuguese, introduced himself, "Rote". 

== Geography ==
Rote lies {{convert|500|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of the [[Australia]]n coast and {{convert|170|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]]. The island is situated to the southwest of the larger island of [[Timor]]. To the north is the [[Savu Sea]], and to the south is the [[Timor Sea]]. To the west is [[Savu]] and [[Sumba]]. The uninhabited [[Pamana Island|''Pamana'' (or ''Ndana'') island]], just south of Rote, with an area of {{convert|14|km²|0|abbr=on}}, is the southernmost [[island of Indonesia]]. Along with some other nearby small islands, such as [[Ndao island]], it forms the [[regency (Indonesia)|kabupaten (regency)]] of [[Rote Ndao Regency]], which in 2010 decennial census recorded a population of 119,711.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntt.bps.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=120%3Ahasil-sensuspenduduk-2010&amp;catid=1%3Aberita&amp;Itemid=8 BPS Provinsi NTT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rote island has an area of {{convert|1200|km²|0|abbr=on}}.

The main town, [[Ba'a]], is located on the northern side of the island. Rote has a good [[Surfing|surf]] area in the south around the village of [[Nembrala]].

== Transportation ==
There is a daily [[ferry]] to the island from [[Kupang]], the provincial capital on [[West Timor]], which provides transport for local passengers and goods as well as tourists. The trip between Kupang and Ba'a takes around two hours. The ferry leaves at 8.30 AM and costs 80,000 IDR. &lt;ref&gt;http://west-timor.info/index.php/rote-island-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wings Air]] operates daily flights between Rote's [[David Constantijn Saudale Airport]] and Kupang's [[El Tari International Airport]]. Flight time is about 30 minutes.

Rote consists of rolling hills, terraced plantations, acacia palm, savanna and some forests.

== Economy ==
[[File:Baa_Market_Rote.jpg|thumb|Town Market in Baa, Rote]]

The Rotinese depend, like the [[Savu Island|Savunese]], on the [[Borassus flabellifer|lontar palm]] for basic survival but also as a supplement to their income from fishing and jewelry making.

[[Agriculture]] is the main form of employment. Fishing is also important, especially in the eastern village of ''[[:id:Papela, Londalusi, Rote Timur, Rote Ndao|Papela]]'' (east of ''Londalusi'' in the map), which has led to disputes with Australia over the water between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Elliott, 1996, "Fishing in Australian Waters," ''Inside Indonesia'' vol. 46 http://www.insideindonesia.org/fishing-in-australian-waters; Richard Tanter, 2000, "After fear, before justice: Indonesia and Australia over the long haul, as if ethics mattered." ''Inside Indonesia'' vol. 61 http://www.insideindonesia.org/after-fear-before-justice-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourist attractions ==
Rote has many historical relics including fine antique [[Chinese porcelain]], as well as ancient arts and traditions. Several prominent Indonesian figures were born in Rote. A popular music instrument, [[Sasando]], is made of palm leaves.

In the eastern part of the island is a pond in [[Landu (village)|Landu]] Village that has non-poisonous [[jellyfish]]. The pond also has a white sandy beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kakaban.co.id/detail_artikel/20/Tujuh--Danau-Ubur-Ubur-Unik-di-Indonesia- |title=Tujuh Danau Ubur-Ubur Unik di Indonesia |accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The ti'i langga is a traditional hat with a horn-like protrusion at the top that is a symbol of Rote cultural identity.

There are many languages spoken on the island, all related to the languages on nearby Timor island. These languages are: [[Bilba language|Bilba]], [[Dengka language|Dengka]], [[Lole language|Lole]], [[Ringgou language|Ringgou]], [[Dela-Oenale language|Dela-Oenale]], [[Termanu language|Termanu]], and [[Tii language|Tii]] 

== Trivia ==
The critically endangered [[Roti Island snake-necked turtle|Rote Island snake-necked turtle]] is endemic to Rote Island. 

The US-born Australian scholar, Prof James J Fox, has written extensively about Rotinese culture.

'''WWCR''' is a [[shortwave radio|shortwave]] [[radio station]] located in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in the [[United States]]. WWCR uses four 100 [[kW]] transmitters to broadcast on about a dozen frequencies.

WWCR mainly leases out its four transmitters to religious organizations and speakers. However, it does air a few hours of original programming per week.

F.W. Robbert Broadcasting also owns the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] ([[mediumwave]]) stations [[WNQM]] in Nashville, [[WMQM]] and [[WLRM]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[WITA]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], and [[WVOG]] in [[New Orleans]]. Some of WWCR's programming is also broadcast on these local stations.

== History ==
Originally known as 'World Wide Country Radio,' WWCR began broadcasting a country format but quickly switched to a standard [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] format, also selling leased airtime. Because of the station's policy of leasing airtime, WWCR acquired an early reputation for carrying an eclectic mix of political and entertainment programming in addition to the religious programs. Among those, past as well as present, making their shortwave debut on WWCR, are:
* "Essentials of Life &amp; Wellness" hosted by Dr. Will Wong
* ''Radio Free America'' hosted by Tom Valentine, sponsored by ''Carotec Health'' newspaper
* ''For the People'' hosted by [[I.E. America Radio Network|Chuck Harder]]
* ''Newswatch Magazine'' hosted by David J. Smith
* ''[[Radio Newyork International]]'' hosted by [[Allan Weiner]]
* ''World of Radio'' hosted by [[Glenn Hauser]]
*Rich Salzer Show
*Conservative Preterist Church
* ''[[LaPorte Church of Christ|Scriptures for America]]'' hosted by [[LaPorte Church of Christ|Peter J. Peters]]
* [[Gene Scott|Dr Gene Scott]], with "The University Network" from California
* [[Mark Koernke]], a self-proclaimed militia leader, aka "Mark From Michigan," host of "The Intelligence Report"
* ''[[Unshackled]]'', the show of the [[Pacific Garden Mission]]
* [[Rick Tyler]], the Voice of Liberty
* John Anderson, the Voice of Reason, Preterist Christian show
* Jack McLamb, founder of "Police Against the New World Order"
* ''Freedom Call" hosted by Lt. Col. James (Bo) Gritz
* [[Rollye James]], [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]]
* Pat Kiley, hosting "Follow the Money" with cohost Robert Chapman who became Melody Cedarstrom's cohost in the same timeslot after Kiley was indicted for complicity in a [[Ponzi scheme]]&lt;ref&gt;
http://tcbmag.com/News/Recent-News/2013/July/Radio-Host-Pat-Kiley-Gets-20-Yrs-In-Cook-Ponzi-Sch
&lt;/ref&gt;
* James McCanney, hosting his revisionist ''Science Hour At the Crossroads'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jmccsci.com/sh12-09-10-7meg-MP3.ram&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dave Mooney, host of World Wide Country music show.

WWCR is also notable for a December 1997 broadcast by [[Ted Gunderson]] which later became the subject of a court case. In that case, lawyers for [[Art Bell]] claimed that the broadcast had implied he had been charged with [[Child sexual abuse|child molestation]]. A defamation lawsuit against the station was settled in October 2000 and Art Bell claimed that WWCR had apologized for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20001202164100/http://www.coasttocoastam.com/F0005.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Gunderson disputes that any apology was ever made and asserts that the case was entirely baseless.&lt;ref&gt;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=137884152254825718&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the political commentary on the station is of a [[right wing|conservative]] or [[far right|ultra-conservative]] nature with extensive discussion on [[conspiracy theories]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.carlabrooksjohnston.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=138%3Aalias-hate-radio&amp;catid=60%3Aarticles&amp;Itemid=68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.adl.org/presrele/dirab_41/2655_41.html,&lt;/ref&gt;.
