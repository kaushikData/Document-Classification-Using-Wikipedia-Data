'''ABC Stores''' is a  chain of [[convenience store]]s based in [[Honolulu]] owned by MNS Ltd. The chain operates 73 stores, 57 of which are located in the state of [[Hawaii]], with the remaining locations in the [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Las Vegas]]. The company now generates more than $230 million in annual profits and employs over 1500 staff, and is described as the 37th largest company in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=ABCExpandswithDukesLane&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/September-2017/ABC-Stores-Ventures-into-Upscale-Dining-with-Dukes-Lane-Market-and-Eatery/|title=ABC Stores Ventures into Upscale Dining with Dukes Lane Market &amp; Eatery|work=[[Honolulu Magazine]]|date=September 26, 2017|author=Mari Taketa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also has 7 stores operating under the Island Deli brand, with a focus on groceries and fresh foods.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abcstores.com/island-deli-hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 they opened a restaurant and [[food hall]] known as the Dukes Lane Eatery in Waikiki.&lt;ref name="ABCExpandswithDukesLane" /&gt;

==Products==
The stores sell convenience items such as groceries, as well as tourist items and [[souvenir]]s. The chain's best-selling items are tourist-oriented products such as [[Macadamia nuts]], [[sunscreen]] and [[sunglasses]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History==
The chain was started by Sidney Kosasa, who opened his first store in [[Waikiki]] in 1964.  The stores were originally named "Mister K."  Later, in order to make the store name easier to remember, the name of the stores were changed to "ABC Stores." The last Mister K was changed to ABC in 2009.

The son of a first generation Japanese immigrant, Sidney Kosasa (or rather ‘Mr. K’-  known by his ABC Stores ‘Ohana’ or family) was born in Palolo Valley, Hawaii in December 1919.  His first experiences in retail began while working in his parents’ grocery store in [[Palolo, Hawaii|Palolo]].

In 1949, Mr. and Mrs. K. opened their first pharmacy/convenience store in Kaimuki, Hawaii – known later as Thrifty Drugs.  As business grew, his entrepreneurial and business philosophies resulted in the opening of four locations within 10 years. While attending a business convention in Miami Beach, Florida, Mr. K noticed all the tourists near the large hotels and had a vision to build a chain of resort stores in Hawaii. The first ABC Store was opened on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki, Hawaii in 1964.

==Locations==
The stores are now ubiquitous in the tourist-oriented Waikiki neighborhood. There are 35 store locations within a one-mile radius of Waikiki alone and consequently many of these sit in close proximity to one another. The intersection of Kalakaua and Seaside Avenue alone has four ABC Stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595068073,00.html|title=Ubiquitous ABC Stores score well with Hawaiian tourists|last=Song|first=Jaymes|work=Deseret Morning News|date=2004-06-04|accessdate=2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many retail analysts believe this is an attempt to block other convenience stores from entering the Waikiki market and thus prevent competition{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In total, there are 37 stores on [[O'ahu]], 12 on [[Maui]], five on [[Hawaii (island)|The Big Island]] and three on [[Kauai]].

There are eight stores in [[Las Vegas]], currently the franchise's only [[Mainland United States|mainland]] location.

There are also ten stores in the [[Mariana Islands]], eight in [[Guam]] (in [[Tumon]]) and two in [[Saipan]] (in [[Garapan]]).

== Career ==
=== CarDomain ===
In 1998, Algard and Simon Han co-founded CarDomain, an online community for auto enthusiasts to share information about cars.&lt;ref name=GeekWire2012&gt;{{cite news |title=CarDomain sold to Source Interlink Media |first=Liz |last=Murtaugh Gillespie |date=September 7, 2012 |work=GeekWire |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/cardomain-network-sold-to-source-interlink-media/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 to 2006, Algard left his position as CEO of Whitepages in order to focus his attention on CarDomain.&lt;ref name=GeekWire16 /&gt; He remained CEO of CarDomain until 2012, when he sold the company to Source Interlink Media, a company that owns a number of other car-oriented publications.&lt;ref name=GeekWire2012 /&gt; (Source Interlink was subsequently renamed [[TEN: The Enthusiast Network]].)

=== Whitepages ===
Algard founded Whitepages in 1996 after purchasing the domain name for $900. He began the business by developing an online database of phone numbers. The website began to generate significant revenue through advertisements, hitting $66 million a year by 2008.&lt;ref name=PugSoundBJ07&gt;{{cite news |title=Founder returns to Whitepages.com |first=Brad |last=Broberg |date=September 30, 2007 |work=GeekWire |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2007/10/01/focus10.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, two venture capital firms invested $45 million in the company. In 2013, Algard bought out the investors for $80 million, citing a desire for the company to be free of pressure from outside investors. In 2016, he stepped down as CEO of Whitepages to run Hiya full-time.&lt;ref name=GeekWire13&gt;{{cite news |title=WhitePages CEO Alex Algard: Not having VCs will allow a 'cleaner' focus |first=John |last=Cook |date=October 22, 2013 |work=Geek Wire |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2013/whitepages-ceo-alex-algard-vcs-business-cleaner-focus/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitepages provides fraud screening and identity verification for businesses, as well as public record background checks and directory services for consumers.

=== Hiya ===
In April 2016, Whitepages spun out its caller ID and spam-blocking service into a separate company, Hiya, of which Algard is the CEO. The service provides consumers insight into who is behind the numbers that are calling them&lt;ref name=TechCrunch16&gt;{{cite news |title=Whitepages spins out its caller-ID business as Hiya to take on TrueCaller |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |date=April 27, 2016 |work=TechCrunch |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/whitepages-hiya/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also protects against unwanted spam and scam calls.

In August 2016, Hiya entered into a contract with [[Samsung]] to integrate its caller ID and spam protection services into Galaxy S7 phones.&lt;ref name=IntlBizTimes16&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Galaxy Note 7 To Ship With Hiya For Robocall, Spam Protection |first=Himanshu |last=Goenka |date=August 2, 2016 |work=International Business Times |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/samsung-galaxy-note-7-ship-hiya-robocall-spam-protection-2396826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, the company announced the launch&lt;ref name=FierceWireless16&gt;{{cite news |title=Hiya launches network-level caller ID and call-blocking offering |first=Colin |last=Gibbs |date=August 3, 2016 |work=Fierce Wireless |url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/hiya-launches-network-level-caller-id-and-call-blocking-offering }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Hiya Cloud, a network based solution designed to help wireless carriers protect consumers from unwanted robocalls.

Atienza, his mother Virginia Atienza and brother Alfredo Atienza, he was released at [[Pasig City]], [[Metro Manila]] on March 27, 1997 upon payment of P 2.2 million [[ransom]] and P 1.5 million after several days. Atienza Jr. sought the assistance of [[police]] operatives (who created a special [[task force]] under Joseph Cabato, Military Intelligence Group, under PTFIC). CIG [[Chief of police|Chief]] [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]] Efren Fernandez arrested 2 suspects (at the [[Meycauayan]] [[gas]] [[Filling station|station]]): Felipe Montaos and Eduardo Soriano who pointed to Gerardo Roperez [[Pseudonym|alias]] Boy Sabater, as mastermind. The other 3 suspects were later caught: Armando Pablo @ Mando, Rudy Depas @ Rudy Bigote and Pablo Anora. In July 1997 and March 2001, [[Criminal]] cases were filed with the [[Office]] of the [[Province|Provincial]] [[Prosecutor]] of [[Bulacan]], and the case was docketed as "''People versus Armando Pablo, Rudy Depas and Roperez, et al.''" for kidnapping with ransom and robbery in band. Meanwhile, Atienza Jr., his wife Connie and all their children [[human migration|migrated]] to [[Australia]] due to the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. The remaining 2 other suspects were later arrested. 
On April 19, 2007, the [[Philippine Court of Appeals]] rendered a Decision penned by Justices Mariflor Castillo, Rodrigo Cosico and Rosemarie Carandang, affirming with modification the September 3, 2003 judgment of the [[Malolos City, Bulacan]] Court. Felipe Montaos and Eduardo Soriano were released for lack of evidence while Gerardo Roperez was acquitted and ordered released. Accused Pablo, Depas and Anora were found guilty of the crimes of kidnapping with ransom and simple robbery and meted the capital punishment of Reclusion Perpetua or life imprisonment and indeterminate penalty of 6 months as minimum to maximum of six years, respectively. They were ordered to pay Atienza Jr. P 3.7 million as actual damages.&lt;ref&gt;Crim.

'''August Anheuser Busch III''' (born June 16, 1937) is a great-grandson of [[Anheuser-Busch]] founder [[Adolphus Busch]] and was the company's Chairman until November 30, 2006. August Busch III is informally known as "Auggie" and as "'''The Third'''" or '''"Three Sticks"''' by subordinates and employees at Anheuser-Busch.

He is the father of [[August Busch IV]].

==Early life==
August Anheuser Busch III was born in St. Louis, Missouri on June 16, 1937. He attended the [[University of Arizona]], but dropped out after failing. His father then gave him an ultimatum, and he began working in an entry-level position in Anheuser Busch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43704785/ns/business-us_business/t/fall-house-busch/|title=The fall of the House of Busch|date=2011-07-17|website=msnbc.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
August Busch III served as President of the [[Anheuser-Busch]] Companies, Inc. (ABC) from 1974 until June 2002, and Chief Executive Officer of ABC from 1975 until June 2002. He was Chairman of the Board of Directors of ABC from 1977 to 2006.

He was succeeded as the day-to-day operational head of Anheuser-Busch by Patrick Stokes. Stokes' tenure marked the first time in the history of the company that a non-Busch family member ran the day-to-day operations. Busch also conferred the chairmanship to Stokes effective December 1, 2006. He retired from their executive functions at the company on November 30, 2006.

He has been a director of [[AT&amp;T Inc.]] since October 1983. He served as a Director of [[Southwestern Bell Telephone Company]] from 1980 to 1983. The CEO of SBC/AT&amp;T, Ed Whitacre, simultaneously served on the board of A-B. They were joined on both boards by Charlie Knight, the CEO of Emerson Electric. Whitacre also served on the board of Emerson. Busch voted to approve $115 million of pay for Whitacre in a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/static/execpay2005/LIRT9T4.html?passListId=12&amp;passYear=2005&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=T9T4&amp;datatype=Person|title=Edward E Whitacre Jr, CEO of SBC Communications (SBC), Earns $17.4 mil|website=www.forbes.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Busch is Chairman of the Anheuser-Busch Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and a member of the Corporate Development Committee and the Executive Committee.

As of 2007, Busch remains a Director of [[Emerson Electric Co.]].

==Personal==
He has been married twice. His first wife, Susan, is the mother of his two older children [[August Busch IV|August Anheuser Busch IV]] and Susan Busch-Transou. His second wife, Virginia, who is a practicing attorney, is the mother of his younger two children, Steven Busch and Virginia "Ginny" Busch.

Unlike his father [[Gussie Busch]], August III has been a lifelong supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and a friend, ally, and financial supporter to Senator [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) and President [[George W. Bush]]. August III's eldest son, [[August A. Busch IV]], is a strong supporter of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics, just like his grandfather Gussie.

All four of his children are involved in the business functions of Anheuser-Busch to varying degrees: August IV was the president and CEO of the Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc.; Susie Busch-Transou and her husband, Tripp, own Tri-Eagle Sales, a distributorship near [[Tallahassee, Florida]]; Steven Busch was his father's executive assistant and now owns Krey Distributing Company in St. Peters, Missouri; and Ginny Busch is employed by [[Busch Entertainment Company]] (BEC), working closely with A-B's [[SeaWorld]] and [[Busch Gardens]] family theme park businesses. Both August A. Busch III and August A. Busch Jr. were inducted into the [[Junior Achievement]] U.S. Business Hall of fame in 2005.

August Anheuser Busch III was responsible for the donation of Mike IV, the live Bengal Tiger mascot of [[Louisiana State University]] in 1974. Mike IV, originally Jerry, was born at [[Busch Gardens Tampa|Busch Gardens]] in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1534">'''Basel IA''' was proposed as an intermediate between the current [[Basel I]] accord and the [[Basel II]] accord that is being implemented. Basel IA would have been more risk sensitive than Basel I but would not be as complex as the advanced approach under Basel II.

On July 20, 2007 by a deal between the various US banking regulators ([[The Federal Reserve]], the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]], the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]) it was decided to drop the proposed Basel IA and allow Basel II Standardised in its place.

The US initially proposed that banks would need to use the advanced approach only if they were to implement Basel II. The idea of Basel IA was to enable smaller US banks to adopt a methodology that is more risk sensitive than Basel I that they are currently using for calculating capital adequacy. The Fed chairman mentioned that smaller banks who do not wish to move to Basel II Advanced or Basel IA could continue to operate under Basel I.

{{stack|float=left|{{South Ferry (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|color=Lexington}}}}
The station has two tracks and two platforms in service: a center [[island platform]] that serves [[Brooklyn]]-bound trains, and a [[side platform]] that serves uptown trains. An abandoned and walled off island platform and track on the west side of the station were formerly used by the [[Bowling Green–South Ferry Shuttle]] to the inner platform at South Ferry.

South of the station, the tracks diverge into two sets. One set (the inner tracks) enter the [[Joralemon Street Tunnel]] to travel to Brooklyn: this route is used by the '''4''' train at all times and the '''5''' train on weekdays until 8:45pm. The outer tracks continue to the closed [[South Ferry loops (New York City Subway)|South Ferry]] inner loop station, which is used by the '''5''' train when it [[short turn]]s at this station during weekends and late weekday evenings.

== History ==
When the station opened on July 10, 1905, there was as yet no [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] service to Brooklyn, and all Lexington Avenue trains terminated at South Ferry, using the outer-loop platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/07/10/101363643.pdf|title=SUBWAY TRAINS RUNNING FROM BRONX TO BATTERY; West Farms and South Ferry Stations Open at Midnight. START WITHOUT A HITCH Bowling Green Station Also Opened -- Lenox Avenue Locals Take City Hall Loop Hereafter.|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Joralemon Street Tunnel]] opened in 1908, some Lexington Avenue trains continued to terminate at South Ferry, even during [[rush hour]]s, while others went to Brooklyn. This service pattern was soon found to be inadequate for the high volume of Brooklyn riders.

Just three months after the Joralemon Street Tunnel opened, construction began on the third track and the western island platform at Bowling Green. Once they were completed in 1909, all rush-hour trains were sent to Brooklyn, with a two-car [[Bowling Green–South Ferry Shuttle]] train providing service to South Ferry during those times. Even after the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] local service ({{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh South Ferry|bold}}) began to South Ferry in 1918, the shuttle remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1977 due to budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transit Cuts Approved by M.T.A.; Reductions Will Begin Next Month |first=Ralph |last=Blumenthal |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/01/15/75261767.pdf |newspaper=New York Times |date=1977-01-15 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shuttle platform was renovated in 1978 along with the rest of the station. The 1978 renovation covered over the original [[Heins &amp;amp; LaFarge]] mosaic "tapestries" that were along the walls.

The 1970s renovation also led to the construction of the eastern side platform, again due to high passenger volume on the island platform. Additional exits were requested and an underpass was built, funneling some of the traffic away from the [[headhouse]] exit at the south end. This led to the station's current configuration, with uptown trains using the side platform, and [[Brooklyn]]-bound trains using the island platform (similar to the configuration at [[Broadway Junction (BMT Canarsie Line)|Broadway Junction]] on the [[BMT Canarsie Line]]). A fence is located along the edge of the island platform, preventing northbound trains from releasing passengers onto the island platform. The [[fare control]] now consists of the restored headhouse entrance at the south end, which serves only the island platform, and various other entrances that lead to the eastern side platform and down to a large fare control area in the underpass.

Two elevators make the station [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]]. One connects street level with the fare control area below the platforms and tracks with an intermediate stop at the main northbound fare control area while the other connects the Brooklyn-bound platform with the fare control area below.

==Exits==
The station has three street stairs, an elevator, a set of escalators, and an original [[head house|control house]]. At the station's north end at [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]], two street stairs are located at the northwestern corner of the T-intersection of State Street and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. The elevator is at the northeastern corner of said intersection. There is a glass-canopied stairs-and-escalator entrance in front of the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]]'s north elevation, just around the corner from two entrances to the [[Whitehall Street–South Ferry (BMT Broadway Line)|Whitehall Street–South Ferry]] station on the [[BMT Broadway Line]] (which are set into the building's eastern elevation).&lt;ref name=MTA-LowerManhattan-2014&gt;{{cite NYCS map|Lower Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Control House}} Control house===
At the south end of the station is the original head house, known as the '''Bowling Green IRT Control House''' or '''Battery Park Control House''', on the west side of State Street south of Broadway.

Along with its twin, the old control house for the [[72nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|72nd Street]] station, this building is a reminder of the glory of [[Early history of the IRT subway|New York's first subway company]], the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]], predecessor to the current numbered routes. Although most of the original subway's entry points had steel and glass kiosks (for example, [[Astor Place (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Astor Place]]), important stations like this one were marked with a brick and stone control house, which were referred to as such because they helped control the passenger flow. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Comerica Park''' is an open-air [[baseball park|ballpark]] located in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]]. It serves as the home of the [[Detroit Tigers]] of [[Major League Baseball]], replacing [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in 2000.

The park is [[naming rights|named]] after [[Comerica|Comerica Bank]], which was founded in Detroit and was based there when the park opened. While Comerica has since moved its headquarters to [[Dallas]], the bank still retains a large presence in the Detroit area. The stadium's seating capacity is 41,083. Downtown public transportation for the park is available via the [[Detroit People Mover]] station at [[Grand Circus Park station|Grand Circus Park]], and the [[QLine]] at the [[Montcalm Street station]]. Comerica Park sits on the original site of the [[Detroit College of Law]].

==History==

===Construction===
Founded in 1894, the Tigers had played at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull Avenues in Detroit's [[Corktown, Detroit|Corktown]] neighborhood since 1896, when [[Bennett Park (Detroit)|Bennett Park]] opened. In 1911, new Tigers owner [[Frank Navin]] ordered the construction of a new ballpark to be built on the same site. Opening in 1912, the ballpark, which eventually became known as [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], served as the Tigers' home for the next 88 seasons. By the mid-1990s, it had become apparent that the much-beloved ballpark had become obsolete and could not be renovated any further.&lt;ref name="Storied"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Groundbreaking]] for a new ballpark to replace Tiger Stadium was held on October 29, 1997.&lt;ref name="Ballpark information"/&gt; At the time of construction, the scoreboard in left field was the largest in Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Beck|title=New scoreboard in works at Comerica Park|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120215&amp;content_id=26706422&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|website=MLB.com|date=February 16, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120229065113/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120215&amp;content_id=26706422&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|archivedate=February 29, 2012|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, Comerica Bank agreed to pay $66&amp;nbsp;million over 30&amp;nbsp;years for the naming rights for the new ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMERICA ALL YE FAITHFUL: TIGERS INK NAMING RIGHTS DEAL|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1998/12/22/Facilities-Venues/COMERICA-ALL-YE-FAITHFUL-TIGERS-INK-NAMING-RIGHTS-DEAL|website=SportsBusiness Daily|date=December 22, 1998|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Shea|title=Comerica signs sponsorship deal for new Red Wings arena|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160224/NEWS/160229897/comerica-signs-sponsorship-deal-for-new-red-wings-arena|website=Crain's Detroit Business|date=February 24, 2016|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was part of a downtown revitalization plan for the city of Detroit, which included the construction of [[Ford Field]], adjacent to the ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nichole M.|last=Christian|title=Detroit Sees Park as Star Player in Redevelopment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/us/detroit-sees-park-as-star-player-in-redevelopment.html|website=The New York Times|date=April 11, 2000|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game was held on April&amp;nbsp;11, 2000, against the [[Seattle Mariners]].&lt;ref name="First game"/&gt; Upon its opening, there was some effort to try to find a nickname for the ballpark, with the abbreviation '''CoPa''' suggested by many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Terry|last=Foster|title=Terry Foster Disagrees With Fans Who Dislike Little Caesars Arena Name|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2016/04/29/terry-foster-calls-out-fans-who-disagree-with-little-caesars-arena-name/|website=CBS Detroit|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often referred to simply as '''Comerica'''.&lt;ref name="St. John's"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lori|last=Higgins|title=Fans pray for Tigers at Easter service

At the left-center field concourse there are statues of all of the players whose numbers have been retired by the Tigers (with the exception of [[Jackie Robinson]], whose number was retired in every MLB park in 1997 and is located on the wall in right-center field).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tigers Retired Numbers|url=http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/history/retired_numbers.jsp|website=Tigers.com|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of [[Ty Cobb]] is also there, but he does not have a number, as he played baseball before players began to wear numbers on their uniforms. These players' names, along with the names of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] players and broadcasters who spent a significant part of their career with the Tigers, are also on a wall in right-center field.

The field itself features a distinctive dirt strip between home plate and the pitcher's mound. This strip, sometimes known as the "keyhole", was common in early ballparks, but it's very rare in modern facilities (the only other current major league park to feature one is [[Chase Field]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]).&lt;ref name=Rinehart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlapp/&gt; Additionally, the home plate area is in the shape of the home plate itself, and not as a standard circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Lukas|title=Some Thoughts About Infield Design|url=https://uni-watch.com/2015/09/03/some-thoughts-about-infield-design/|website=Uni Watch|date=September 3, 2015|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the northeastern corner of the stadium behind the stands from the third base line is a Ferris wheel with twelve cars designed like baseballs.

The flagpole located between center and left fields was originally in play, as was the flagpole in Tiger Stadium.&lt;ref name=Rinehart/&gt; However, the left field wall was moved in front of the pole before the 2003 season.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; A ball that hits the pole is now ruled a home run.&lt;ref name=Rinehart/&gt; The right field of the stadium features the [[Pepsi]] Porch, a picnic deck between the 100 and 200 level seating bowls.&lt;ref name=Renovation/&gt; Also in right field, and part of the 100 level seating bowl, is an area of seats known as "Kaline's Corner", an homage to Hall of Fame right fielder Al Kaline, who once played for the Tigers when the team played in Tiger Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Kaline's Corner|url=https://www.kalinescorner.com/history-of-kalines-corner.html|website=Kaline's Corner|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[LED]] scoreboard was added to the right-center field wall, and the upper deck [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]] for the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]].&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt;

Directly behind the fountain is the [[Detroit Athletic Club]].]]

A giant fountain is located behind center field. [[General Motors]] sponsored the fountain from 2000 to 2008, and used the area to showcase GM manufactured vehicles as well. While GM dropped its sponsorship for the 2009 season due to [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|financial issues]], the GM branding was not removed from the fountain. Instead, signs for [[Chrysler]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] were also added to the display, along with the message "The Detroit Tigers support our automakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Klayman|title=Tigers give free signs to struggling U.S. automakers|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/retire-us-baseball-automakers/tigers-give-free-signs-to-struggling-u-s-automakers-idUSTRE53E73V20090415|website=Reuters|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, GM returned to sponsoring the display, now known as the [[Chevrolet]] Fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Shea|title=GM renews sponsorship of Comerica Park's outfield fountain|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20100412/FREE/100419980/gm-renews-sponsorship-of-comerica-parks-outfield-fountain|website=Crain's Detroit Business|date=April 12, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A completely redesigned and upgraded left field video display debuted for the [[2012 Major League Baseball season|2012 season]].&lt;ref name=Shea/&gt; The serif "TIGERS" letters were removed, replaced by cursive lettering that can also display graphics and video.&lt;ref name=Shea/&gt; An analog clock below the Tigers letters and above the Comerica Park lettering was removed completely. A high-definition LED display was installed, which was much larger than the three displays that had existed there previously.&lt;ref name=Shea/&gt; The previous scoreboard utilized light bulbs - still a popular scoreboard technology around the time the park opened, though they were quickly aging as LED displays became available and were installed around other [[List of Major League Baseball stadiums|Major League ballparks]].&lt;ref name=Shea/&gt; The scoreboard was also raised 16 feet in an effort to address complaints that the scoreboard was too far left and thus obstructed by the left field upper deck.&lt;ref name=Shea/&gt; Along with the replacement scoreboard, all remaining bulb fascia scoreboards were also upgraded to LED.&lt;ref name=Shea/&gt;

In 2014, the Tigers announced a $4 million renovation to Comerica Park's Pepsi Porch. This renovation included the removal of the bleachers that once occupied this space and the addition of new stadium seats. The plan also included new high top tables, a new bar in the middle of the porch, couches and lounge chairs, as well as a fire pit. The bleachers that once occupied this area was moved to the space above The Jungle restaurant and bar.&lt;ref name=Renovation/&gt;

In contrast to Tiger Stadium, which had long been considered one of the most hitter-friendly parks in baseball, Comerica Park is considered to be extremely friendly to pitchers. Except for dead center field—420 feet (128 m) versus Tiger Stadium's 440 feet (134 m)—the outfield dimensions were more expansive than those at Tiger Stadium. This led to complaints from players and fans alike. Most famously, [[Bobby Higginson]] sarcastically referred to the venue as "Comerica National Park".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Romano|title=Williams goes deep for dramatic catch|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/041600/news_pf/Sports/Williams_goes_deep_fo.shtml|website=St. Petersburg Times|date=April 16, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221080703/http://www.sptimes.com/News/041600/news_pf/Sports/Williams_goes_deep_fo.shtml|archivedate=February 21, 2001|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2003 MLB season]], the club moved the distance from left-center field from {{convert|395|to|370|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt; This also removed the flagpole from the field of play, originally incorporated as an homage to Tiger Stadium.&lt;ref name=Dimensions/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rinehart/&gt; Two years later, the [[bullpen]]s were moved from right field to an empty area in left field created when the fence was moved in. In place of the old bullpens in right field, about 950 seats were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Beck|title=Comerica Park to see alterations|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20050114&amp;content_id=931277&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;fext=.jsp|website=MLB.com|date=January 14, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012044411/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20050114&amp;content_id=931277&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;fext=.jsp|archivedate=October 12, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made one of the most pitcher-friendly ballparks transform into the third most batter-friendly (with extra bases also taken into account).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2022901-ranking-mlbs-most-hitter-friendly-ballparks-by-the-numbers/page/15 Bleacher Report - Ranking MLB's Most Hitter-Friendly Ballparks, by the Numbers - 3. Comerica Park]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of note, the current layout of the playing field at Comerica Park means that when a player is at bat, the direction he is facing looks farther to the south than at any other Major League Baseball park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Craig|title=Ballpark Orientation: Direction the Batter is Facing at all MLB Parks|work=Flip Flop Fly Ball|publisher=Bloomsbury|url=http://www.flipflopflyin.com/flipflopflyball/info-orientation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseball===
In [[2005 in baseball|2005]], Comerica Park hosted the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|76th MLB All-Star Game]], the first to be played in Detroit since 1971. In the [[Home Run Derby (Major League Baseball)|Home Run Derby]], held the day before, [[Bobby Abreu]] slammed 24 home runs in the first round, breaking the previous record of 15. Abreu won the Derby over Tiger [[Iván Rodríguez]], hitting a then record 41 homers during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abreu shatters Home Run Derby records|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/allstar05/news/story?id=2105813|website=ESPN.com|date=July 12, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the All-Star Game, the American League won 7&amp;ndash;5 with [[Miguel Tejada]] winning the game's [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tejada homers, named All-Star MVP|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/allstar05/news/story?id=2106569|website=ESPN.com|date=July 13, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first playoff game at Comerica Park was played on October 6, 2006 against the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2006 American League Division Series (ALDS) Game 3, Yankees at Tigers, October 6|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200610060.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gambler outduels Unit; Tigers take 2-1 lead vs. Yanks|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/recap?gameId=261006106|website=ESPN.com|date=October 7, 2006|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 2006, Comerica Park hosted the first [[World Series]] game in the history of the ballpark (Game 1 of the [[2006 World Series]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2006 World Series Game 1, Cardinals at Tigers, October 21|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200610210.shtml|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2007, the first [[no-hitter]] was thrown at Comerica Park by [[Justin Verlander]]. The Tigers won the game 4–0 against the [[2007 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. It was also the first no-hitter thrown by a Tiger in the city of Detroit since [[Virgil Trucks]] accomplished the feat in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christoper D|last=Thomas|title=Justin Verlander's best moments with the Detroit Tigers|url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2017/09/01/detroit-tigers-justin-verlander-top-moments/623941001/|website=Detroit Free Press|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2008, the Tiger statue at the main entrance to the ballpark was dressed with a [[Detroit Red Wings]] jersey as the Red Wings were playing against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the [[2008 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] during that time. Detroit defeated Pittsburgh in 6 games for the [[Stanley Cup]]. The jersey is usually worn by the [[Spirit of Detroit]], but it was undergoing restoration during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-23-2008/0004820191&amp;EDATE=|title=Hockeytown Mania in Detroit as Red Wings Battle for the Stanley Cup|first=Detroit Red|last=Wings|date=|website=www.prnewswire.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2011, [[Minnesota Twins]] slugger [[Jim Thome]] became the 8th player in baseball history to hit 600 career home runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Thome hits 600th home run|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/6864854/minnesota-twins-slugger-jim-thome-clubs-600th-career-homer|website=ESPN.com|date=August 15, 2011|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC News]] described Crenshaw as a multitasking expert, and wrote that Crenshaw says that to be productive it is best not to multi-task at all. Crenshaw is described by Mark Lewis in [[Forbes]] as a productivity consultant, and wrote that Crenshaw says that multitaskers think they are doing two or more things simultaneously, when actually they are switching rapidly back and forth between tasks.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt; Joyce E.A. Russell wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Crenshaw says that multitasking should be called switchtasking because if you really examined what you are doing you would see that people are just rapidly switching from one task to another, and as we are not very good at it, it can have some consequences, actually hurting our [[productivity]] because of the time lost making even fast switches.&lt;ref name=TWP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/28/AR2011012805971.html |title=Career coach: Move beyond the multi-tasking badge |author=Joyce E.A.

'''Domenico Scala''' (born 1965 in Basel, Switzerland) is a Swiss-Italian manager in the [[biopharmaceutical]] industry, and the former chairman of the [[FIFA]] Audit &amp; Compliance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fifa-wer-ist-der-neue-boss-domenico-scala-a-1036840.html|title=Interimschef Domenico Scala: Dieser Mann soll jetzt die Fifa führen|publisher=Spiegel Online|work=spiegel.de|date=2015-06-02|language=German|accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Scala has a university degree in economics from the [[University of Basel]]. After his studies he worked for Nestlé, Panalpina and Roche, where he held various senior leadership positions.

==Dental appointments==
In 2003, he became CFO of Syngenta AG and in 2007 CEO of the Swedish-Swiss dental company [[Nobel Biocare]], specializing in dental implants. He is on the advisory board of [[Tufts University]] in Boston, the second largest dental faculty in North America. Since November 2011 he is Vice-Chairman of [[Basilea Pharmaceutica|Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd.]] and since January 2015 Chairman of i-net innovation networks Switzerland. In 2004, he was one of a selected few executives to be named "Young Global Leader" by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

== Football ==
In May 2013 the FIFA congress elected Scala as chairman of the Audit &amp; Compliance Committee of [[FIFA]], [[association football]]'s international governing body. The committee has the task of overseeing FIFA's business practices. In June 2, 2015, he assumed the oversight/leadership of a reform program within FIFA. On September 10, 2015, he published a comprehensive governance reform report on FIFA. On February 26, 2016 the FIFA congress approved significant governance reforms, which have largely been devised by Domenico Scala along his reform "blueprint" published in September 2015. Scala's proposals are essentially looking to reshape FIFA along the lines of a modern corporation. Scala's most significant reforms are to introduce term limits and to split the governing executive committee along the lines of large corporations. They have a board to set strategy and oversee the work of an executive board, which conducts the day-to-day business. Domenico Scala has also called for the six confederations to themselves undergo reforms, including integrity checks for their officials along the lines of those introduced at FIFA for all elected officials.

In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Scala stated that [[Russia]] and [[Qatar]] would possibly no longer be eligible to host the [[FIFA World Cup]] competitions in 2018 and 2022 if evidence of bribery was proven, saying "Should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33041467|title='Russia &amp; Qatar may lose World Cups' - Fifa official|publisher=BBC News|date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/07/russia-qatar-lose-world-cups-if-bribery-found-fifa|title=Russia and Qatar may lose World Cups if evidence of bribery is found|author=Owen Gibson|date=7 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scala resigned from his position at FIFA on May 14, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36293324&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6137">'''Doubling''' is a [[textile]] industry term synonymous with combining. It can be used for various processes during [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]]. During the carding stage, several sources of [[roving]]  are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=557}} It is used for embroidery threads and [[sewing thread]]s, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun [[cotton count|60s cotton]] are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is [[mercerised cotton|mercerised]], [[Gassing (textile process)|gassed]] (AKA flamed) and [[wound]] onto a bobbin. {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=567}}

==Processing of cotton==
{{Cotton processing flowchart}}
===Doubling in the carding process===

In a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of [[willowing]], lapping, [[carding]] and drawing.  During willowing the fibres are loosened; in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres. Carding combs the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, and removes the shorter fibres creating a stronger yarn.

During the carding process the staples are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow).
The carders line up the staples to prepare them for spinning. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=66,67}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In drawing,  4 slivers are combined into one. Repeated drawing decreases the quality of the sliver drastically, disabling finer counts from being spun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each sliver will have thin and thick spots. By combining, or doubling several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. The slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil. The rovings are collected in a drum and proceed to the '''slubbing frame''' which adds twist, and winds onto bobbins. '''Intermediate Frames''' are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn, and then the '''roving frames''' reduces it to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masson Mills WTM 20 Derby Doubler 1902 Platts 5907.JPG|thumb|left|Derby Doubler:Masson Mills]]
Over time the processes were refined. At [[Masson Mill]] and at [[Helmshore Mills Textile Museum|Helmshore]], there are Derby Doublers. The Masson machine, built by Platts of Oldham in 1902, doubled rovings from the breaker cards into card lap. This was then passed through the finisher card to produce the rovings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massonmills.co.uk/Museum/M/form.html.php?linknam=Derby_Doubler Masson Mill Derby Doubler]&lt;/ref&gt; This process was known as double carding. The Derby Doubler was patented by [[Evan Leigh]] of Ashton-under-Lyne (21 December 1810 - 2 February 1876) and, though superseded, still continued in service in condensing coarse counts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oneguyfrombarlick.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=359&amp;t=7270 One guy from Barlick: Evan Leigh and the Derby Doubler] Stanley Graham&lt;/ref&gt;

===The doubling process===
Doubling of yarn where two or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many purposes where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of these threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.{{sfn|Naismith|1896|pp=58}}
The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a ''doubling winding machine'', and two or more of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights [[Water frame]]s, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the doubling of warp thread {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=564}}
High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes

'''Employment testing''' is the practice of administering written, oral, or other [[Test (student assessment)|tests]] as a means of determining the suitability or desirability of a job applicant.  The premise is that if scores on a test correlate with [[job performance]], then it is economically useful for the employer to select employees based on scores from that test.

== Legal context (United States) ==

The [[United States Supreme Court]] has decided several cases clarifying the place of employment testing in the context of discrimination law. In particular, these cases have addressed the discriminatory use of tests when promoting employees by requiring tests beyond the education required for the job. A central finding in [[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]] was that the employer must demonstrate (or be prepared to demonstrate) that its selection process is related to the job being filled.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs v. Duke Power Co. :401 U.S. 424 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Test types used ==

Different types of assessments may be used for employment testing, including personality tests, intelligence tests, work samples, and assessment centers. Some correlate better with job performance than with others; employers often use more than one to maximize predictive power.

=== Performance assessment tests ===
Performance-based assessment testing is a process to find out if applicants can do the job for which they are applying. It is done through tests, which are directly administered and judged by Hiring Managers who will be supervising the potential hire. 
Performance assessments can be used as a pre-screening tool to test applied knowledge, skills-job match and commitment of the applicant towards the job position.&lt;ref&gt;Imperica. [http://www.imperica.com/features/into-the-gap "Into the Gap"], March 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The tests are peer-to-peer and reflect real business tasks that candidates have to perform, should they be selected for the role. The tests are open ended, time bound, business related questions which applicants need to submit their responses for in order to prove their abilities.&lt;ref&gt;New Empire Builders: Discover Startups, Nonprofits, + Companies making the world better. [http://www.newempirebuilders.com/2012/07/10/bridging-the-gap-between-college-and-the-real-world/ "Bridging the Gap between College and the Real World"], July 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important question that performance testing, seeks to answer is: How would you solve this problem?&lt;ref&gt;Lou Adler. [http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130228212434-15454-the-complete-2-question-interview?trk=prof-post "The Complete 2-Question Interview"], The Essential Guide for Hiring &amp; Getting Hired, ASIN B00B9JZMKE.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality tests ===
[[Personality test]]s may potentially be useful in personnel selection. Of the well-known [[Big Five personality traits]], only conscientiousness correlates substantially with traditional measures of job performance, and that correlation is strong enough to be predictive.&lt;ref&gt;Barrick, M. R., &amp; Mount, M. K. (1991). The big five personality dimensions and job performance: A meta-analysis. ''Personnel Psychology'', ''44'', 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other factors of personality can correlate substantially with non-traditional aspects of job performance, such as leadership and effectiveness in a team environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, R. (2006). ''Personality and the fate of organizations.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI) is also used.

The [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI) is a highly validated psychopathology test that is generally used in a clinical psychology setting and may reveal potential mental health disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychcorp.pearsonassessments.com/HAIWEB/Cultures/en-us/Productdetail.htm?Pid=MMPI-2&amp;Mode=summary Official MMPI-2 Description]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be considered by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] as the employer having knowledge of a medical condition prior to an offer of employment. This is an illegal basis for a hiring decision in the United States. Employers considering [[personality tests]] should focus on tests designed for job purposes and do not provide any information regarding an applicant's mental health or stability.

Notable situations in which the MMPI may be used are in final selection for police officers, fire fighters, and other security and emergency personnel, especially when the employees are required to carry weapons. An assessment of mental stability and fitness can be reasonably related and necessary in the performance of the job.

[[Employment integrity testing]] is used to determine an applicant's [[honesty]] and [[integrity]].&lt;ref name="U.S. Congress"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Use of Integrity Tests for Pre-Employment Screening | publisher=Office of Technology Assessment | date=1990 | accessdate=13 February 2015 | pages=1–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive ability tests ===

Tests of cognitive ability can assess [[general intelligence]] and correlate very highly with overall job performance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F.L., &amp; Hunter, J. (2004). General Mental Ability in the World of Work: Occupational Attainment and Job Performance. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86''(1), 162–173.[http://www.psychology.org.nz/industrial/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%20(2004).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals with higher levels of cognitive ability tend to perform better on their jobs. This is especially true for jobs that are particularly intellectually demanding.

=== Job-knowledge tests ===

Employers administer job-knowledge tests when applicants must already possess a body of knowledge before being hired.&lt;ref&gt;[[Office of Personnel Management|U.S. Office of Personnel Management]] [http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-07 "Assessment Decision Guide"]. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Job-knowledge tests are particularly useful when applicants must have specialized or technical knowledge that can only be acquired through extensive experience or training. Job-knowledge tests are commonly used in fields such as computer programming, law, financial management.and electrical or mechanical maintenance.

Licensing exams and certification programs are also types of job-knowledge tests. Passing such exams indicates competence in the exam's subject area. Tests must be representative of the tested field, otherwise litigation can be brought against the test-giver.

=== Situational judgment tests ===

Situational judgment tests are commonly used as employee-selection and employee-screening tools and have been developed to predict employment success.&lt;ref&gt;Ployhart, R. E. (2006). Staffing in the 21st century: New challenges and strategic opportunities. ''Journal of Management'', ''32'', 868-897.&lt;/ref&gt; These tests present realistic hypothetical scenarios in a multiple-choice format. Applicants are asked to state what they would do in a difficult job-related situation.&lt;ref&gt;Lievens, F., Peeters, H., &amp; Schollaert, E. (2008). Situational judgment tests: A review of recent research. ''Personnel Review'', ''37'', 426-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

Situational judgment tests measure the suitability of job applicants by assessing attributes such as problem solving, service orientation, and striving for achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Whetzel, D. L., &amp; McDaniel, M. A. (2009). Situational judgment tests: An overview of current research. ''Human Resource Management Review'', ''19'', 188-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Engine Alliance''' ('''EA''') is an American [[aircraft engine]] manufacturer based in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="ea_bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/Research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=7917458 |title=Engine Alliance, LLC: Private Company Information |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is a 50/50 joint venture between [[GE Aviation]], a subsidiary of [[General Electric]], and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]],&lt;ref name="ea_bloomberg"/&gt; a subsidiary of [[United Technologies]]. Engine Alliance was established in August 1996 to develop, manufacture, sell, and support a family of modern technology aircraft engines for new high-capacity, long-range [[aircraft]].&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;[http://www.enginealliance.com/en/about/default.aspx About Us | Engine Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314175424/http://www.enginealliance.com/en/about/default.aspx |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main application for such an engine, the [[Engine Alliance GP7000|GP7200]], was originally the [[Boeing 747]]-500/600X projects, before these were cancelled due to lack of demand from [[airlines]].

Instead, the GP7000 has been re-optimized for use on the [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo. In that market it is competing with the [[Rolls-Royce Trent 900]], the launch engine for the aircraft. The two EA variants are the GP7270 and the GP7277.

On September 30, 2017, an [[Engine Alliance GP7000#Notable Incidents|Engine Alliance GP7270]] engine suffered from an uncontained failure during a passenger flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11928312 Air France plane loses engine cover above the Atlantic Ocean, New Zealand Herald, October 1 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/world/plane-engine-explodes.html Engine Explodes on an Air France Plane, Forcing an Emergency Landing.

Although the youngest of his brothers, he was the first in his family to become involved with the [[tobacco]] trade. Along with his brother Sotirios he founded the '''[[Papastratos|Papastratiou Brothers]]''' firm, one of the biggest tobacco companies in [[Greece]] until the rise in foreign cigarette imports in the 1970s and the 1980s. Papastratos also wrote a book called ''I douleia kai o kopos tis'' (''Η δουλειά και ο κόπος της'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13754">The '''"Faces of Freedom"''' photo exhibition is a collection of photographs captured by [[photo-journalist]], [[filmmaker]] and [[human rights]] [[educator]] [[Robin Romano|U. Roberto (Robin) Romano]], during his travels to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]]. Romano explores the exploitation of [[child labor]] in the production of handmade rugs in coordination with multiple international organizations, such as the [[World Bank]], [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] and others to reduce the number of child laborers in that industry.  The exhibit has been shown in many United States cities since its first exhibit in 2009.  Faces of Freedom has been included in [[CNN]] Freedom Projects of [[Slavery#Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]].

==Child labor==
To combat exploitation of [[Child labour|child labor]], [[The World Bank]] with [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and Understanding Children's Work Initiative to bring awareness of the scope of the problem.  The World Bank estimates that there are 218 million children who are victim to unfair child labor practices.  The children's ages range from five to seventeen years of age.  The handmade rug industry is one of industries involved in exploitation of child labor.  The World Bank works with country-based and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in an effort to "combat child labor."&lt;ref name=TWB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://go.worldbank.org/CLQNYOJEE0 |title=Faces of Freedom - Visions of Hope for Child Laborers |author= |date=2009-12-16 |work=Topics, Children and Youth |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=2011-05-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and the [[International Labour Organization]] consider child labor exploitative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Worst Forms of Child Labor Recommendation, 1999 |work=International Labour Organization |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?R190 |accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=2006-10-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN stipulating, in article 32 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''...States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''  Although globally there is an estimated 250 million children working.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the census in 1990 nearly 18% of all the children in America are working in different organizations. The Supreme Court banned child labor in 1916 but the law became visible in 1941. The labor department is also not paying attention to the child labor in USA therefore children are still employed in the organizations. The age of the children who are employed is between 15 years to 17 years. They are nearly 3.7 million children who work in different factories. There is an interesting fact that more than 600 children died in work related accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/child-labor-in-usa|title=Child Labor in USA|publisher=What is USA News|date=15 April 2013 | accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit==
U. Roberto Romano, a photographer, filmmaker and humans right activist, traveled to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]] to record the plight of child laborers in the handmade rug industry.  He also gathered photographs and stories of children who have been rescued by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] organization, previously known as Rugmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?p=55 |title=Rugmark |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?page_id=1027 |title=Faces of Freedom |year=2011 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faces of Freedom exhibit is a collection of photos by U. Roberto Romano that provides insight into the lives, poor living conditions and faces of child rug-weavers of South Asia. Messages of hope are portrayed in the photographs and stories of children that were assisted by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] program to attain school education. A selection of handmade rugs made without child labor is also exhibited.&lt;ref name=TWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=STC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southtexascollege.edu/milagros/virtual_library.html |title=Photographic Documentaries, U.

After initial showings in San Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C., the collection has been exhibited in major cities across the United States since 2009.&lt;ref name=TWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNICEF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fieldnotes.unicefusa.org/2009/08/faces_of_freedom_photo_exhibit_1.html |title=Faces of Freedom photo exhibit |author=Kate Weber, UNICEF |year=2011 |work=Field Notes |publisher=United States Fund for UNICEF |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facesoffreedom.goodweave.org/ |title=Past Events |work=Faces of Freedom |publisher=GoodWeave |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==News media==
In late 2010, the Faces of Freedom exhibit was featured the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network]] show [[Good Morning America]].  On April 18, 2011, Faces of Freedom was covered in CNN Freedom Project’s of [[Slavery#Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]]. The piece appears on [[CNN]] [http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/ website] with a slideshow of images of [[Rugmark|GoodWeave’s]] Faces of Freedom photo exhibition.

The Harvest, however, is told from a child’s perspective as we meet 4 of the more than 400,000 children between the ages of 5 and 16 who labor in fields and factories to feed us, lacking the protections offered by the Fair Labor Standards Act that all other American children enjoy.&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shineglobal.org/?page_id=19 | title=The Harvest/La Cosecha, The Story of the Children Who Feed America | publisher=Shine Global | year=2010 | accessdate=2011-05-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, [[Eva Longoria]] signed on as an Executive Producer of the project.&lt;ref name="broadcastingcable.com"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/189904-Eva_Longoria_Parker_to_Executive_Produce_Child_Farm_Worker_Documentary.php | title=Eva Longoria Parker to Executive Produce Child Farm Worker Documentary | author=Tanklefsky, D | date=Mar 13, 2009  | publisher=Bay Media, LLC | accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Harvest premiered at the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|IDFA]] festival in Amsterdam in November 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=e1433bf7-c2fa-4160-806d-b169fdce01aa |title=The Harvest |work=IDFA 2010 |publisher=IDFA |accessdate=2011-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126211653/http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=E1433BF7-C2FA-4160-806D-B169FDCE01AA# |archive-date=2010-11-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will premier in the US in early 2011.{{update inline|date=February 2014}}

'''Ferran Soriano i Compte''' (born June 16, 1967 in [[Barcelona]]) is the Chief Executive Officer of the [[Premier League]]'s [[Manchester City F.C.]], [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[New York City F.C.]], and the [[A-League]]'s [[Melbourne City FC]]. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the Vice-President and General Manager of [[FC Barcelona]].

==Education==
Ferran Soriano is an MBA and Business studies graduate at [[ESADE]], the New York [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] and [[Université Catholique de Louvain]] of Belgium.

He speaks Catalan, Spanish, English, French and Portuguese.

==Career==
Soriano has held a number of positions in companies in a variety of industries, such as consumer products, telecommunications and entertainment, and has held senior positions at The Mac Group, [[Reckitt Benckiser]], and Cluster Consulting, a management consulting firm he co-founded in 1993.

Between 2003 and 2008, Soriano was Economy Vice President of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], having been elected with the [[Joan Laporta]]’s [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] to the club's [[Board of Directors]]. He also acted as interim CEO. Barcelona's revenues, during Soriano's tenure, increased from €123 million to €308m, while a €73m loss was turned into an €88m profit.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;{{cite news |title=Ferran Soriano is the man to match Manchester City's ambitions |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/ferran-soriano-is-the-man-to-match-manchester-citys-ambitions |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6th, 2008, Soriano and seven other Board Members resigned, after a vote of non-confidence against the Board, amidst growing disagreement with Laporta’s "leadership style."

In April 2009, Soriano was elected Chairman of the [[Catalonia]]-based  airline [[Spanair]], rescued by the [[Government of Catalonia|Catalan government]] from SAS with the objective of creating a hub in the Barcelona airport. Revenue improved and the company started cutting costs, but, on 27 January 2012, after a deal with [[Qatar Airways]] fell through, the airline ceased operations.&lt;ref name="UPI-Jan28"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2012/01/28/Spanair-shutdown-strands-23000-travelers/UPI-53921327727191/?spt=hs&amp;or=bn|title=Spanair shutdown strands 23,000 travelers |publisher=United Press International |date=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2012, Soriano was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.]] [[CEO]]. In the first year and months of his tenure, Manchester City has cut its losses in half &lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City Halves Annual Loss as Revenue Rises to Record |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-29/manchester-city-halves-annual-loss-as-revenue-rises-to-record.html |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=30 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he claims the club will break even in the 2013-14 season.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite news |title=City confident they can break even next year and comply with financial fair play rules |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2548265/Manchester-City-confident-break-year-comply-financial-fair-play-rules.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=29 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soriano replaced Manager [[Roberto Mancini]] with [[Manuel Pellegrini]] and tasked him to win “five trophies in five years”.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City tell Manuel Pellegrini 'win five trophies in five years' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/24/manchester-city-manuel-pellegrini-trophies |work=[[The guardian]] |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the same period City has bought an MLS franchise in New York to create [[New York City FC]] and an existing football club in Australia ([[Melbourne Heart FC]]) initiating the club’s expansion strategy.&lt;ref name=expansion&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City Football Club to acquire Melbourne Heart FC in partnership with owners of Melbourne Storm |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/club-news/2014/january/club-announcement-22-january-2014 |work=[[Manchester city|Manchester City]] |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In January 2013, Barcelona president [[Sandro Rosell]] claimed that "Manchester City have attempted to entice a number of staff from the [[Camp Nou]]", but added "there were no fish left".&lt;ref name=fish&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/01/15/manchester-city-fishing_n_2477802.html "Manchester City 'Fishing' For Barcelona Staff, Says Sandro Rosell"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Rosell alleged that the Manchester club tried, in an "offensive" approach, to sign players "from all levels of Barcelona's structure," and also other employees of the Catalan side.&lt;ref name=fish/&gt; These allegations were not pursued.

In February 2013, Soriano was accused by the FC Barcelona board, led by Rosell, of authorising a £1.7 million e-mail surveillance of club employees suspected of "working against" Barca's then president [[Joan Laporta]].&lt;ref name=spy&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/20/ferran-soriano-spying_n_2722218.html "Ferran Soriano, Manchester City Chief Executive, Accused Of 'Spying' At Barcelona"], ''Huffington Post'', 20 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, a judge cleared Soriano of these allegations.&lt;ref name=cleared&gt;{{cite news |title=City chief Soriano makes leap to clearing name over Barca 'spying' allegations |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2575984/City-chief-Soriano-makes-leap-clearing-Barca-spying-allegations.html |work=[[Daily mail|Daily Mail]] |date=7 March 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosell resigned from the post of Barcelona president in January 2014, one day after a Spanish court opened an investigation into Barca's €57.1 million signing of Brazilian [[Neymar]], for an alleged "misappropriation of funds."&lt;ref name=resigns&gt;{{cite news |title=FC Barcelona president Rosell resigns |url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/24/fc-barcelona-president-rosell-resigns/ |work=[[Euronews]] |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Rosell was jailed without bail after being accused of misappropriation of funds from the €57m signing of Neymar.&lt;ref name="ESPN coverage"&gt;[http://www.espnfc.com/barcelona/story/3133849/ex-barcelona-chief-sandro-rosell-held-without-bail-in-money-laundering-probe Ex-Barcelona chief Sandro Rosell held without bail]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Soriano was found guilty in Spanair’s bankruptcy case and fined with £8.6 million.  In May 2016, the decision was overturned by the appeal court judges who concluded that [[Spanair]]’s executives were acting in trying to "save the company," and its subsequent bankruptcy was “fortuitous”.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy&gt;[http://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/man-city-ceo-ferran-soriano-7879804 "Man City CEO Ferran Soriano is free to practise business in Spain again after having judgement overturned"], Irish Mirror, 2 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco Seeber was born in [[Buenos Aires]] to Sophia Taut and Magnus Seeber, both [[German Argentine]] immigrants.&lt;ref name=alcurnia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogiafamiliar.net/getperson.php?personID=I23414&amp;tree=BVCZ|title=Francisco Seeber Taut|publisher=Genealogía Familiar}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his studies in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], and returned in 1859. He joined the [[Argentine Army]], and fought in the [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)]] and as a Captain in the [[Paraguayan War]] in 1865 and 1866. Upon his return, he joined the editorial board of ''La Libertad'', and was elected to the [[Buenos Aires Province]] Legislature. He married Fanny Agrelo in 1868, and they had nine children.&lt;ref name=alcurnia/&gt;

Seeber established a construction firm, Catalinas Warehouses and Pier Company, Ltd., in 1872.&lt;ref name=nuevo&gt;Cutolo, Vicente. ''Nuevo Diccionario Biográfico Argentino''. Buenos Aires: Editorial Elche, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm obtained a municipal contract to construct the Catalina Docks (located along what later became the [[Catalinas Norte]] office park). Needing a large and steady supply of soil to level and grade the hitherto flood-prone site for the wharf, Seeber bought land in the then-desolate northwest end of the city with the intent of hauling soil to Catalinas for [[land reclamation]]. He recruited his workers mostly from [[Entre Ríos Province]]; they established a neighborhood ([[Villa Urquiza]]) there in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.clarin.com/elrincondevillaurquiza/2008/8/26/historia-villa-urquiza/ Historia de Villa Urquiza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109035415/http://blogs.clarin.com/elrincondevillaurquiza/2008/8/26/historia-villa-urquiza |date=2009-11-09 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeber was named President of the [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]] in 1887. He commissioned the construction of the important [[Rail transport in Argentina|rail link]] between [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. He invested in the city's first large-scale [[department store]], ''[[Galerías Pacífico|Bon Marché]]'', and was appointed Mayor of [[Buenos Aires]] on May 10, 1889, by President [[Miguel Juárez Celman]].&lt;ref&gt;Rögind, William. ''Historia del Ferrocarril del Sud. 1861-1936''. Buenos Aires, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued his immediate predecessors' emphasis on [[public works]], having 400 blocks of city streets paved, installing sanitation services in the impoverished [[La Boca]] district, establishing [[right-of-way (traffic)|right-of-way]] ordinances for the city's growing traffic, and initiating the development of what later became [[Florida Street]] (today Buenos Aires' best known [[pedestrianized street]]). He also approved plans for what, during the 1920s, became [[Diagonal Norte]] Avenue as part of larger (never realized) design for a series of diagonal avenues downtown. Another plan approved during his tenure ultimately became [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]] in the 1930s, and his administration also began or completed the creation or improvement of numerous [[city park]]s and recreational and cultural sites, among them the [[Buenos Aires Zoo]] and the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]].&lt;ref name=nuevo/&gt;

The [[Panic of 1890]] led to Seeber's resignation on June 4, and on June 22, he traveled to [[Germany]]. He represented Argentina in the 1894 [[Universal Peace Congress]] in [[Antwerp]], where he was an early advocate for [[free trade]]. Seeber returned that year and took part in a commission to organize the nation's far-flung territories in [[Patagonia]] and the far north. Following an 1897 stay in Europe to study the organization of the [[Quartermaster]] Corps, he toured [[South America]] for an appreciation of prevailing conditions, about which he wrote in his 1903 survey, ''Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Uruguay, Perú, Bolivia y Paraguay: estudios comparativos''. Seeber, who also wrote numerous articles on his military studies in Europe, was named head of the Quartermaster's Advisory Board in Argentina.&lt;ref name=nuevo/&gt;

Francisco Seeber retired in Buenos Aires, and died there in 1913 at age 72.&lt;ref name=nuevo/&gt; He was interred in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=alcurnia/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5453">'''Lawrence Gavin Bertran Robinson''' (25 October 1935 – 2002) was a South African model agent in London's [[Old Bond Street]] in the 1960s and 70s who was part of the [[Swinging London]] scene. His show at Mare Moda in Capri in 1969 was described by ''The Times'' as "as zippy, as nippy and as hippy as anything seen in London's West End",&lt;ref name=capri/&gt; while a show for Harrods in 1970 was noted for his technique of making his models move to music like machines.

==Early life==
Lawrence Robinson was from Durban, South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;"Diary notes", ''Southern Africa'', Volume 260 (1967), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; born on 25 October 1935.&lt;ref name=family&gt;[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVZJ-Q744 Lawrence Gavin B Robinson England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837–2007.] Family Search. Retrieved 10 April 2018. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a male model early in his life.&lt;ref name=castle&gt;Castle, Charles. (1977) ''Model Girl''. Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles. pp. 146-147. {{ISBN|0715374125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Capri BW 2013-05-14 10-41-55 DxO.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the Certosa di San Giacomo, Capri]]
In the mid 1960s, Robinson established a business as a model agent at 30 [[Old Bond Street]] in London where he traded as Gavin L. B. Robinson. According to the memoirs of [[Jo Wood]], who was signed to the agency as a teenager in the mid 1960s, it was  "one of the hottest" in London at the time and Robinson was "very slim, trendy and had startlingly blond hair".&lt;ref name=wood&gt;Wood, Jo. (2013) ''Hey Jo''. London: HarperCollins. pp. 26-28. {{ISBN|978-0007458462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood recalled that she "couldn't work out why he was so flamboyant, so ...''feminine''".&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; Other models on Robinson's books in the 1960s included [[Nikki Sievwright|Nikki Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modelscomposites.com/getlist.php?list=mod&amp;choice=Nikki+Ross&amp;year=all&amp;id= Model Nikki Ross.] The Model Archives of Marlowe Press. Retrieved 9 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sonia Pugin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modelscomposites.com/fullsize.php?count=6&amp;imgno=46486 Model Archives of Marlowe Press.] Retrieved 10 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Molyneux claimed that the first ever [[Head shot|head sheet]] was created for Robinson by Peter Marlowe by 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modelscomposites.com/press.php The Marlowe Press Story.] Barbara Molyneux, Model Archives of Marlowe Press. Retrieved 9 April 2018. Originally published in ''Model Journal'', No. 6, April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Robinson put on a show for 1,000 people in the courtyard of the [[Certosa di San Giacomo]], a [[Carthusian monastery]] in [[Capri]], for the finale of the [[Mare Moda]] festival. It was described by [[Antony King-Deacon]] of ''The Times'' as "as zippy, as nippy and as hippy as anything seen in London's West End".&lt;ref name=capri&gt;"Capri caprices", Antony King-Deacon, ''The Times'', 17 October 1969, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; According to King-Deacon, [[Maria Antonelli (fashion designer)|Maria Antonelli]]'s models "were thrashing about with their arms and legs in a sort of frenzied apathy. On they ran, harem-scarem, wiggle, scream and they were gone." No one really saw or remembered the clothes, he complained.&lt;ref name=capri/&gt; Robinson also produced the finale for the 1970 Mare Moda.&lt;ref&gt;"Revels with the ravioli set", Prudence Glynn, ''The Times '', 29 September 1970, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1970, he put on a show at the [[Harrods]] department store titled "Return of the Blues" that King-Deacon saw as unusual in giving a major role to men's clothes, although the female models still outnumbered the men. King-Deacon praised Robinson for his ability to put on "without apparent effort a fashion show of unparalleled chic" and noted his technique of using models "as though they were machines by making them walk, turn, bend and even bat their eyelids to the beat of the music".&lt;ref&gt;"Showing fashion", Antony King-Deacon, ''The Times'', 13 March 1970, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;Gavin continued to produce Harrods Fashion Shows throughout the 70's using many of the same models, Christer, Greg Sherriff, Brian King, Ian Buchanan, Alan McVie, Georgie, Iona Skye, Charlie Brown (former Miss South Africa) and Christian Fletcher. He Drove an old Bentley and held weekends for his models and a few photographers at his retreat "the Barn" in Horsmonden near Goudhurst, Kent. He loved cooking, collecting Owls (ceramic etc) and renovating his various houses in the Chelsea area. [11]

Robinson later traded as Gavin's Models.&lt;ref&gt;"Confessions of a Champagne supermodel", Helen Williams, ''Birmingham Post'', 18 February 1999, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1970s, the male models at Gavin's were run by the former male model [[Gil Barber]].&lt;ref name=castle/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Robinson died in Camden, London, in 2002.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; In 2013, he featured as a character in Raymond Russell's novel ''Deadly Endings''.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell, Raymond.|title=Deadly Endings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJhdDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT51|year=2013|publisher=Raymond Russell|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-1-62675-447-8|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Graduate Management Admission Test''' ('''GMAT''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|m|æ|t}} ({{respell|JEE|mat}}))) is a [[Computerized adaptive testing|computer adaptive test]] (CAT) intended to assess certain analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in written English for use in admission to a graduate management program, such as an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/the-gmat-advantage.aspx|title=The GMAT Advantage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires knowledge of certain specific grammar and knowledge of certain specific algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. According to the test owning company, the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/learn-about-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Learn About the GMAT Exam|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taken up to five times a year.  Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-exam-policies.aspx| title =GMAT Exam Policies| website =MBA.com| publisher =GMAC| access-date =March 8, 2016| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part of the selection criteria for their programs. [[Business schools]] use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate [[management]] programs, including [[MBA]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Finance]] programs and others. The GMAT is administered in standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is still the number one choice for MBA aspirants despite the increasing acceptability of [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-26/study-few-mba-applicants-consider-taking-the-gre |title=Study: Few MBA Applicants Consider Taking the GRE |author=Alison Damast |date=April 26, 2012 |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, it has continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that the exam predicts success in business school programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/about-the-gmat-exam/validity-reliability-fairness.aspx|title=Validity, Reliability and Fairness|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1953, the organization now called the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC) began as an association of nine [[business schools]], whose goal was to develop a standardized test to help business schools select qualified applicants. In the first year it was offered, the assessment (now known as the Graduate Management Admission Test), was taken just over 2,000 times; in recent years, it has been taken more than 230,000 times annually.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|title=GMAC Statistics Video|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504061935/http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|archivedate=May 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used in admissions by 54 schools, the test is now used by more than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; On June 5, 2012, GMAC introduced an integrated reasoning section to the exam that aims to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/integrated-reasoning.aspx | title =Integrated Reasoning Section | website =MBA.com | publisher =GMAC | access-date =March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The intended purpose of the GMAT is to predict student success in graduate business programs.  According to GMAC, there is a .459 correlation (21% variance) between total GMAT scores and mid-program student grades based on data it collected between 1997 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmac.com/market-intelligence-and-research/research-library/validity-and-testing/research-reports-validity-related/gmat-validity-study-summary-report-for-1997-to-2004.aspx |title=GMAT Validity Study Summary Report for 1997 to 2004 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent research has shown significantly different results.  Independent research has shown that the GMAT can explain only 4.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA (Grade Point Average) while undergraduate GPA can explain 17.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bedsole |first=Charles B. |url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/bedsole_charles_b_201312_edd.pdf |title=Apples to Apples?: Comparing the Predictive Validity of the GMAT and GRE for Business Schools and Building a Better Admissions Formula |publisher=University of Georgia. |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, more recent independent research has shown that the GMAT does not add predictive validity after undergraduate GPA and work experience have been considered and that even undergraduate GPA alone can be used in lieu of considering the GMAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pratt |first=William R. |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08832323.2015.1027164 |title=Predicting MBA Student Success and Streamlining the Admissions Process |publisher=Journal of Education for Business |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and timing==
The GMAT exam consists of four sections: an analytical writing assessment, an integrated reasoning section, a quantitative section, and a verbal section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/us/gmat-adds-new-thinking-cap.html?_r=1&amp;ref=education |title=GMAT Adds New Thinking Cap|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total testing time is three hours and seven minutes. Test takers have 30 minutes for the analytical writing assessment and another 30 minutes to work through 12 questions, which often have multiple parts, on the integrated reasoning section and are given 62 minutes to work through 31 questions in the quantitative section and another 65 minutes to get through 36 questions in the verbal section.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Section !! Duration in minutes !! Number of questions
|-
| Analytical writing assessment || 30 || 1 essay
|-
| Integrated reasoning || 30 || 12
|-
| Quantitative || 62 || 31
|-
| Verbal || 65 || 36
|}

The quantitative and verbal sections of the GMAT exam are both multiple-choice and are administered in the computer-adaptive format, adjusting to a test taker’s level of ability. At the start of the quantitative and verbal sections, test takers are presented with a question of average difficulty. As questions are answered correctly, the computer presents the test taker with increasingly difficult questions and as questions are answered incorrectly the computer presents the test taker with questions of decreasing difficulty. This process continues until test takers complete each section, at which point the computer will have an accurate assessment of their ability level in that subject area and come up with a raw score for each section.

On July 11, 2017, the GMAC announced that from now on the order in which the different parts of the GMAT are taken can be chosen at the beginning of the exam.

Three options will be available at the test center:
* Analytical Writing Assessment, Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative, Verbal (original order)
* Verbal, Quantitative, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment
* Quantitative, Verbal, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing.aspx|title=GMAT changes order of sections.|last=|first=|date=|website=GMAT Exam Format and Timing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the GMAC officially shortened the test by half an hour, shortening the verbal and quant sections from 75 minutes each to 65 and 62 minutes, respectively, and shortening some of the instruction screens.

===Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)===
The AWA consists of one 30-minute writing task—analysis of an argument. It is important to be able to analyze the reasoning behind a given argument and write a critique of that argument. The essay will be given two independent ratings and these ratings are averaged together to determine the test taker's AWA score. One rating is given by a computerized reading evaluation and another is given by a person at GMAC who will read and score the essay themselves without knowledge of what the computerized score was. The automated essay-scoring engine is an electronic system that evaluates more than 50 structural and linguistic features, including organization of ideas, syntactic variety, and topical analysis. If the two ratings differ by more than one point, another evaluation by an expert reader is required to resolve the discrepancy and determine the final score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gmac.com/gmat/understand-gmat-exam-scores/how-to-use-the-analytical-writing-assessment-score.aspx |title=How to use the Analytical Writing Assessment Score|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytical writing assessment is graded on a scale of 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) in half-point intervals (a score of zero means the answer was gibberish or obviously not written on the assigned topic or the test taker failed to write anything at all on the AWA).

===Integrated reasoning===
Integrated Reasoning (IR) is a section introduced in June 2012 and is designed to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate data presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The skills being tested by the integrated reasoning section were identified in a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for today’s incoming students.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-21/the-new-gmat-gets-put-to-the-test|title=The GMAT gets put to the Test|publisher=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integrated reasoning section consists of 12 questions (which often consist of multiple parts themselves) in four different formats: graphics interpretation, two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning. Integrated reasoning scores range from 1 to 8. Like the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), this section is scored separately from the quantitative and verbal section. Performance on the IR and AWA sections do not contribute to the total GMAT score.

The integrated reasoning section includes four question types: table analysis, graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, and two-part analysis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In the table analysis section, test takers are presented with a sortable table of information, similar to a spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false, yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with pull-down menus; test takers must choose the options that make the statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the relevant information, which may be a combination of text, charts, and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible answers are given in a table format with a column for each component and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one response per column.

===Quantitative section===
The quantitative section of the GMAT seeks to measure the ability to reason quantitatively, solve quantitative problems, interpret graphic data, and analyze and use information given in a problem. Questions require knowledge of certain algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. There are two types of quantitative questions: problem solving and data sufficiency. The use of calculators is not allowed on the quantitative section of the GMAT. Test takers must do their math work out by hand using a wet erase pen and laminated graph paper which are given to them at the testing center.  Scores range from 0 to 60, although GMAC only reports scores between 6 and 51.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Rudner|title=Demystifying the GMAT: Scale Scores|url=http://www.gmac.com/~/media/Files/gmac/Research/validity-and-testing/demystifyingthegmat_scalescores.pdf|publisher=GMAC|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem solving questions are designed to test the ability to reason quantitatively and to solve quantitative problems. Data sufficiency is a question type unique to the GMAT designed to measure the ability to understand and analyze a quantitative problem, recognize what information is relevant or irrelevant and determine at what point there is enough information to solve a problem or recognize the fact that there is insufficient information given to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/understanding-your-score-report.aspx|title=Understanding Your Score Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal section===
The verbal section of the GMAT exam includes the following question types: reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction. Each question type gives five answer options from which to select. Verbal scores range from 0 to 60; however, scores below 9 or above 44 are rare.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

According to GMAC, the reading comprehension question type tests ability to analyze information and draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere from one to several paragraphs long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-reading-comprehension-question.aspx | title =Sample Reading Comprehension Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-critical-reasoning-question.aspx | title =Sample Critical Reasoning Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the sentence correction question type tests grammar and effective communication skills. From the available answer options, the test taker should select the most effective construction that best expresses the intent of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2011/sep/idioms-sentence-correction-and-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Idioms, Sentence Correction, and the GMAT Exam|work=The Official GMAT Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-sentence-correction-question.aspx|title=Sample Sentence Correction Question|work=The Official GMAT Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.).

The score distribution conforms to a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] with a [[standard deviation]] of approximately 120 points, meaning that about 68% of examinees score between 430 and 670.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; More precisely, over the three-year period 2014--2017 the mean score was 556.04 with a standard deviation of 120.45 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/what-your-percentile-ranking-means.aspx|title=What Your Percentile Ranking Means. Retrieved October 5th, 2017.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final score is not based solely on the last question the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions). The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that. The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee misses the first question his score will not necessarily fall in the bottom half of the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talento-Miller|first1=Eileen|title=The CAT in the GMAT|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2010/jan/the-cat-in-the-gmat.aspx|website=MBA.com|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After previewing his/her unofficial GMAT score, a GMAT test taker has two minutes to decide whether to keep or cancel a GMAT score at the test center.  A test taker can also cancel a score online within the 72 hours after the scheduled exam start time.  A cancelled score can be reinstated for 4 years and 11 months after the date of the test for a fee of $50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-scores-and-score-reports.aspx|website=MBA.com|title=GMAT Scores and Score Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling and preparing for the exam==
Test takers may register for the GMAT either online at mba.com or by calling one of the test centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/schedule-a-gmat-appointment/scheduling-information.aspx|title=Scheduling Information|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To schedule an exam, an appointment must be made at one of the designated test centers. The GMAT may not be taken more than once within 16 days but no more than five times in a rolling 12-month period and no more than eight times total, even if the scores are canceled. Official GMAT exam study materials are available on the mba.com online store and through third-party vendors. The cost of the exam is $250. All applicants are required to present valid ID when taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/prepare-for-the-gmat-exam/plan-for-test-day/presenting-proper-identification.aspx |title=Presenting proper Identification}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of the test, test takers have the option of canceling or reporting their scores.  As of July 2014, test takers were allowed to view their score before making this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-scoring/your-score-report/preview-your-gmat-score.aspx |title=Preview Your GMAT Score  |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation and early years ===
In 1976, a group of six engineers, all former employees of [[Delhi Cloth &amp; General Mills]], led by [[Shiv Nadar]], started a company that would make personal computers. Initially floated as Microcomp Limited, Nadar and his team (which also included [[Arjun Malhotra (entrepreneur)|Arjun Malhotra]], Ajai Chowdhry, D.S. Puri, Yogesh Vaidya and Subhash Arora) started selling teledigital calculators to gather capital for their main product. On 11 August 1976, the company was renamed  Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/jun/09bspec1.htm|title=The amazing story of the birth of HCL|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327031922/http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/jun/09bspec1.htm|archivedate=27 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 1991, a company called HCL Overseas Limited was incorporated as a provider of technology development services. It received the certificate of commencement of business on 10 February 1992 after which it began its operations. Two years later, in July 1994, the company name was changed to HCL Consulting Limited and eventually to HCL Technologies Limited in October 1999.

HCL Technologies is one of the four companies under HCL Corporation, the second company being [[#HCL Infosystems|HCL Infosystems]]. In February 2014 HCL launched HCL Healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HCL enters healthcare business with Rs 1,000 crore|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/HCL-enters-healthcare-business-with-Rs-1000-crore/articleshow/29965199.cms|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=The Times of India|date=7 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707095322/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/HCL-enters-healthcare-business-with-Rs-1000-crore/articleshow/29965199.cms|archivedate=7 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCL TalentCare is the fourth and latest venture of HCL Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HCL launches TalentCare to bridge supply gap in IT, Healthcare, Banking|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-05-15/news/62192105_1_hcl-ceo-roshni-nadar-supply-gap|accessdate=29 August 2015|work=The Economic Times|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principio III  The club attracted many big-name national acts, but also showcased many rising stars in the music world. The bands ranged from [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Glam rock|glam]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] acts most commonly associated with the venue (e.g., [[Guns n Roses]], [[Kix (band)|Kix]], [[Ratt]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] or [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]]) to pop (e.g., [[Badfinger]]) and alternative rock groups (e.g., [[Goo Goo Dolls]]). The club was often frequented by hard core patrons and musicians donning big hair, leather, lace, spandex, and heavy makeup, and was considered a "hard rock shrine." &lt;ref name="hard rock shrine"&gt;Piccoli, S.

==Since closing==
As of July 2, 2011, the [http://tess2.uspto.gov/ Trademark Electronic Search System] (TESS) listed five different records pertaining to the trademark "Hammerjacks." The only active application for the trademark was by Hammerhouse Designs LLC. The attorney of record was Lawrence E. Laubscher, Jr. The resident agent was listed as Kevin Butler.&lt;ref name="mdtax"&gt;[http://www.dat.state.md.us/sdatweb/charter.html Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation.] Retrieved July 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The application for this trademark was filed January 27, 2011 and published for opposition April 19, 2011. The other records pertain to abandoned applications and registrations.&lt;ref name="trademark"&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/ The Trademark Electronic Search System] (TESS), United States Patent and Trademark Office. Retrieved July 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Official merchandise can still be purchased on the [http://www.hammerjacksonline.com Hammerjacks' website], which is operated by Hammerhouse Designs. In 2010 Kevin Butler acquired the lapsed trademark. Kevin Butler has made extensive plans and investment to open a new 57,000 sq. foot nightclub nearby the old location.

On Saturday 11/7/15 at the “Hammerjacks Rocks the Red Carpet” party held at Game, Hammerjacks Entertainment Group (HEG) Owner and Anne Arundel County resident Kevin Butler, along with partner Andy Hotchkiss, announced that the music venue and club will open at 1300 Russell St. across from M&amp;T Bank Stadium. The 48,000 sq. ft. club will take the place of Paradox as well as a currently vacant warehouse facing Ostend St. that was most recently the home to a ceramic tile company. Paradox recently announced it will be closing.

Hammerjacks originally announced a $20 million new-construction project for the club at Lot N by M&amp;T Bank Stadium. However, as the city was studying the impacts to the adjacent Carroll-Camden Industrial Area to change the zoning at the property, a better opportunity across the street at 1300 Russell St. came about. The site already had the zoning needed for a liquor license and live entertainment. The new project is expected to cost $8 million to complete.

The new Hammerjacks will feature a 2,500-person concert area that can be modified down for smaller shows, a club/sports bar area that will feature smaller 300-person live music shows, and an outdoor courtyard area. Butler told SouthBMore.com he has been contacted by several national entertainment companies interested in booking shows at Hammerjacks. The club can also be modified to various sizes for corporate events, business meetings, high school reunions, weddings, and private events. HEG will also be leasing 4,000 sq. ft. of retail space on the property that will face Ostend St. Butler said “plenty” of parking will be available.

There will also be what Butler is calling “a large outdoor courtyard for seasonal events, sports events, and tailgating” at the venue.

“The process that led up to this announcement has been long and, at times, tedious,” said Butler in a press release, “but that was all part of the effort, by myself and our partners, to make the new Hammerjacks an entertainment facility and a destination that is worthy of the name. I know that our fans and the area business community will be impressed and excited by our plans as we write the next chapter of our long, successful story.”

Butler added that Hammerjacks will be “a cornerstone” of the new Warner St. entertainment corridor.

Lots H and J at M&amp;T Bank Stadium are a tribute to the former Hammerjacks music venue that once stood at its second and most popular location at 1101 S. Howard St. Hammerjacks’ original location was at 1024 S. Charles St. in Federal Hill, the current home of Nobles Bar and Grill, and a later version opened at 316 Guilford Ave. downtown. Butler was unaffiliated with either of the previous three locations, but obtained the rights to the Hammerjacks trademark in 2009 for $1,000.

Hammerjacks’ heyday was from 1987 to 1990 according to Butler when it garnered the title of one of VH1’s Top 5 rock venues. Butler was there for many shows in that era, seeing Guns N’ Roses, The Ramones, L.A. Guns, Warrant, Joan Jett, KIX, and more. “Hammerjacks was so popular that bands like Journey and Def Leppard would hang out there when they were in town for bigger shows,” said Butler. Iron Maiden even had a picture of Hammerjacks in their record sleeve at one point, Butler noted.

To honor Hammerjacks’ former glory, Butler told SouthBMore.com that a large dedication piece with pictures and items from the old venue will be well represented and that they are definitely planning some 1980s events. While honoring its roots, the new Hammerjacks will be a venue for all genres of music.

Butler is very excited about the future of the area. “In one area you are going to have a world-class baseball stadium, a world-class football stadium, a world-class casino and, now, a world-class concert venue,” he said.

Butler has developed a good relationship with Caesars Entertainment (Horseshoe Baltimore) and believes the public will soon see many new taverns and developments joining them in the area as well.

Construction is expected to start in early 2016 and Hammerjacks is slated to open in time for a New Year’s Eve celebration next year.

The original  owner, Louis J. Principio Jr, is not affiliated in any way with the new Venture, the new Majority owner is Kevin Butler.

'''''Human Events''''' was a [[Conservatism|conservative]] American political news and analysis newspaper and website. Founded in 1944 as a print newspaper, ''Human Events'' became a digital-only publication in 2013.

==Overview==
''Human Events'' takes its name from the first sentence of the United States [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]: "When in the course of human events...".&lt;ref name=washtimes/&gt;

The magazine was published in [[Washington, D.C.]], most recently by Eagle Publishing, the owner of [[Regnery Publishing]], a subsidiary of [[Phillips Publishing]]. [[Thomas Winter (newspaperman)|Thomas S. Winter]] was editor-in-chief and Cathy Taylor was editorial director of the print edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/author/cathy-taylor/|title=Cathy Taylor's Articles - Human Events|website=Human Events|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular writers included [[Robert Novak]], [[Ann Coulter]], [[Terence P. Jeffrey]], [[Pat Buchanan]], and [[John Gizzi]], its chief political editor. Occasional contributors have included [[Sean Hannity]], [[Newt Gingrich]], and [[Paul Craig Roberts]], and [[Cliff Kincaid]]. Many prominent conservative journalists wrote for ''Human Events'' before moving on to other publications, such as Neil W. McCabe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanevents.com/search/neil+mccabe/|title=Search for "neil mccabe"|website=Human Events|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; now a national political reporter at [[Breitbart News]] and Brian H. Darling, who wrote the very influential "Legislative Lowdown" column, and is now a columnist at ''[[The New York Observer]]''.

==History==
''Human Events'' was founded in 1944 by [[Felix Morley]], who was from 1933 to 1940 the editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]''; [[Frank Hanighen]], veteran journalist James [https://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/08/archives/james-wick-dies-publisher-was-67-editor-of-human-events-a.html Wick] and former [[New Deal]]er&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Henry Regnery, 84, Ground-Breaking Conservative Publisher |author=Robert McC. Thomas Jr. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 23, 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/us/henry-regnery-84-ground-breaking-conservative-publisher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Regnery]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Peele, 'American Conservatism in Historical Perspective', in ''Crisis of Conservatism? The Republican Party, the Conservative Movement, &amp; American Politics After Bush'', Gillian Peele, Joel D. Aberbach (eds.), Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2011, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1949, ''Human Events'' published a letter written by [[Josée Laval]], the daughter of Vichy France Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]] and wife of attorney [[René de Chambrun]], addressed to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="ofhumanpegler54"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pegler|first1=Westbrook|title=Of 'Human Events'|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/84046442/?terms=%22Rene%2Bde%2BChambrun%22|accessdate=August 2, 2016|work=The Monroe News-Star|location=Monroe, Louisiana|date=July 23, 1954|page=4|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tellsfrancescase"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pegler|first1=Westbrook|title=Pegler Tells France's Case Against Britain, U.

In 1951, [[Frank Chodorov]], former director of the [[Henry George]] School of Social Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrygeorgeschool.org/|title=hgsss.org – Henry George School of Social Science|website=www.henrygeorgeschool.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City|New York]], replaced Morley as editor, merging his newsletter, ''analysis'', into ''Human Events''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Steeleman |first=Aaron |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title=Chodorov, Frank (1887–1966) |url=  https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412965811.n41 |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications]], [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=62–63 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1953 [[Freda Utley]] wrote an article for the publication where she criticized the awarding of the [[Sudetenland]] to [[Czechoslovakia]], stating: "all that much-abused [[Neville Chamberlain]] did was agree to the self-determination of the people of the Sudentenland...which never would have been awarded to the Czechs if [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson's]] [[Fourteen Points]] had been adhered to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Human Events |date=June 24, 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, Allan Ryskind (son of [[Morrie Ryskind]]) and Winter had acquired the publication.&lt;ref name="Shirley 2005 337"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reagan's revolution: the untold story of the campaign that started it all |last=Shirley |first=Craig |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Thomas Nelson, Inc. |location= |isbn=0-7852-6049-8 |page=337 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPWPDH-0TZYC |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors to ''Human Events'' from the 1960s to the 1980s included [[Spiro Agnew]], [[James L. Buckley]], [[Peter Gemma]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Ralph de Toledano]], [[Russell Kirk]], [[Phyllis Schlafly]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Henry Hazlitt]].&lt;ref name="hea"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Advertisement for ''Human Events'' |magazine=[[The American Spectator]] |date=February 1974 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' noted although ''Human Events'' did not have a large readership outside the Washington D.C. area, "the tough little tabloid enjoys an impact out of all proportion to its circulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Newsweek |date=September 6, 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human Events'' backed US military intervention in the [[Vietnam War]]; after the war ended, the publication blamed [[Modern American liberalism|American liberals]] for the collapse of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;"The liberal betrayal of Vietnam" ''Human Events'' editorial, reprinted in  David L Bender and Gary E McCuen, ''The Indochina War : why our policy failed''.  Opposing Viewpoints series, v. 11. Greenhaven Press, 1975. {{ISBN|0-912616-36-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human Events'' gave qualified support to  [[Apartheid]] South Africa, describing the country as "a pro-[[Western world|Western]] bulwark that provides more in the way of freedom and wealth to its blacks than the vast majority of black African states".&lt;ref&gt;"Why Did Conservatives Join the Anti-South Africa Brigade?" ''Human Events'', December 29, 1984. Cited in Thomas Bodenheimer and Robert Gould, ''Rollback!: Right-wing Power in U.S. Foreign Policy''. Boston, MA : South End Press, 1989. (p. 86)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Such arch-conservative magazines as ''Human Events'' usually take the South Africa point of view in various controversies, or defend that country against criticism from American and other sources". Alfred O. Hero, Jr., and  John Barratt ''The American people and South Africa : publics, elites, and policymaking processes''.  Lexington Books, MA, .1981. {{ISBN|0669043206}} (p.  41)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Human Events'' also described [[Nelson Mandela]] as the main obstacle to peace in South Africa: "While President Botha is moving at a fast and furious pace to end the apartheid system, Mandela remains as adamant a revolutionary as ever. He's still a Marxist, still a man of violence, still a supporter of the Communist-run ANC". It was not without sympathy for the plight of blacks under the system however, giving black power activist [[Steve Biko]] a thoughtful obituary. The perspective offered throughout was that Marxist rule in South Africa was the worst option, however bad others might be.&lt;ref&gt;''Human Events'' July 6, 1985, Cited in  Piero Gleijeses, ''Visions of freedom : Havana, Washington, Pretoria and the struggle for Southern Africa, 1976–1991''. Chapel Hill : The University of North Carolina Press, 2013. {{ISBN|9781469609683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eagle Publishing placed the magazine up for sale in February 2013, when it announced that it would close the publication if no buyer could be found.&lt;ref name="forsale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/02/conservative-mag-human-events-for-sale-157574.html |title=Conservative magazine Human Events up for sale, could close |publisher=[[Politico.com]] |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, 2013, ''Human Events'' announced that, after 69 years, it would halt publication of the print edition but would continue to maintain the websites HumanEvents.com and [[RedState]].com with original reporting. Eagle Publishing, which acquired the magazine in 1993, said that it had been subsidizing the publication for several years but could no longer afford to do so: "the realities of the [[24-hour news cycle]] and the brutal economics of a weekly print publication have become insurmountable."&lt;ref name=washtimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=washtimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/27/human-events-shutter-newspaper-after-70-years/|title=Valerie Richardson, "Stop the Presses! Human Events to shutter newspaper after 70 years," February 27, 2013|work=[[Washington Times]]|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human Events'' printed 40,000 copies per week and had a staff of 15 full-time employees. A "restructuring" plan that involved layoffs had already been attempted but was insufficient to allow continuation of the print edition.&lt;ref name=washtimes/&gt;

In January 2014, Eagle Publishing was acquired by [[Salem Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com:8080/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/60615-salem-communications-buys-eagle-publishing.html|title= Salem Communications Buys Eagle Publishing|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Ronald Reagan==
''Human Events'' was former [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "favorite reading for years," writes biographer [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination |last=Reeves |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Reeves (American writer)|year=2005 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-8230-2 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMKgNOytMWIC |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A loyal subscriber since 1961,&lt;ref name="Shirley 2005 337"/&gt; Reagan said it “helped me stop being a liberal Democrat,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee Edwards |date=February 5, 2011 |title=Reagan’s Newspaper |journal=Human Events |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=Eagle Publishing |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=41609 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it "must reading for conservatives who want to know what is really going on in Washington, D.C."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagleinteractive.com/card_heprint_print.htm |title=HUMAN EVENTS: The Conservative Weekly |author= |date= |work=Conservative Advertising Network |publisher=Eagle Interactive |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan contributed some articles to ''Human Events'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="hea" /&gt; During the 1980 presidential campaign, Democrats released a document entitled "Ronald Reagan, Extremist Collaborator—An Exposé," in which, according to biographer Lee Edwards, "[a]mong the proofs of Reagan's extremism was that he read the conservative weekly ''Human Events''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The essential Ronald Reagan: a profile in courage, justice, and wisdom |last=Edwards |first=Lee |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location= |isbn=0-7425-4375-7 |page=57 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dSvWrJ6ooAC |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being elected President, Reagan would occasionally write or call Winter or Ryskind.&lt;ref name="Shirley 2005 337"/&gt;

"''Human Events'', however, was no favorite of the new men around Reagan," writes Reeves. "Baker and Darman, and Deaver too, did their best each week to keep it out of the reading material they gave the President."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination |last=Reeves |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Reeves (American writer)|year=2005 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-8230-2 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMKgNOytMWIC |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When he discovered White House aides were blocking its delivery, President Reagan arranged for multiple copies to be sent to the White House residence every weekend," writes Edwards, who adds that Reagan took care "marking and clipping articles and passing them along to his assistants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee Edwards |date=February 5, 2011 |title=Reagan’s Newspaper |journal=Human Events |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=Eagle Publishing |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=41609 |accessdate=5 February 2011}} Cf. {{cite book |title=President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination |last=Reeves |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Reeves (American writer)|year=2005 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-8230-2 |page=25, fn. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMKgNOytMWIC |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before his 1982 tax hike, Reagan met with what he called "some of my old friends from ''Human Events''" (he mentioned Ryskind and [[M. Stanton Evans]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1= Kiron K. |last2=Anderson |first2=Annelise |last3=Anderson |first3=Martin |authorlink3=Martin Anderson (economist) | authorlink1=Kiron Skinner |title=Reagan: A Life in Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrRc_ABenS8C |accessdate=2010-07-24 |year=2004 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-7642-6 |page=595}}&lt;/ref&gt; who warned him about "disloyal" [[White House]] staff (in particular [[James Baker]]) who favored making a deal on taxes with the Democratic Congress. (Reagan subsequently made such a deal, in which for each $1 in higher taxes Congress promised $3 in spending cuts. Ultimately, both taxes and spending increased.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution, 1980–1989 |last=Hayward |first=Steven F. |authorlink=Steven F.

At the 1986 [[Reykjavík Summit]], Reagan told [[USSR|Soviet]] [[Premier]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] that he could not give up the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] because "'...the people who were the most outspoken critics of the [[Soviet Union]] over the years’—he mentioned his favorite paper, ''Human Events''," according to Reeves, "‘They’re kicking my brains out’."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination |last=Reeves |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Reeves (American writer)|year=2005 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-8230-2 |pages=351–52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMKgNOytMWIC |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Most Harmful Books" list==

In the collaboration implemented company's management model is able to increase efficiency in the management of organizational / structural unit without their conversion. The model is a value-enhancing, integrated, networked, three-dimensional complex -internal value-based- control system, which allows for more efficient management.

== Abstract ==
In the [[management]]'s world the principles, basic competences and basic priority's identifications are the key-importance, because these determine the values of [[internal relations]] and concepts, which derive a reasonable activities of the organizations and ultimately the company's earnings.
The management researchers over the past several decades, the theoretical concept have been created, which model-like-uses given much impetus to the perception of [[business manager]]s, the value of corporate processes and more accurate perceptions of the various interests involved in a more realistic choice. This thesis presents a new [[management model]] theoretical concept's which is eliminates the main mistakes of the previous models and combining the management's resources in a radically new integrated system oriented approach, while allowing the management's higher level control ever then before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bogel | first = György |author2=Salamonné Huszty Anna | title = Vállalatvezetés felsőfokon | year = 1998 | publisher = Kossuth kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-09-4049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Csath | first = Magdolna | title = Stratégiai tervezés a és vezetés a 21. században | year = 2004 | publisher = Nemzeti Tankönyvkiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-19-5251-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = E.Porter | first = Michel | title = Competitive Advantage | year = 1985 | publisher = The free press | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The theoretical foundation of model ==
The I-VMS management model would like to do to central idea the value-creating process therefore it remain be competitive, however would be built to an advanced, integrated networked-system-model. The developed management model fit to the most modern challenges and demands with the following requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Salamonné Huszty | first = Anna | title = Jövőkép és stratégiaalkotás | year = 2000 | publisher = Kossuth kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-09-4194-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marosán | first = György | title = A 21. század stratégiai menedzsmentje | year = 2003 | publisher = Műszaki kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-16-6008-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For value relation ===
# keep the [[value creation]] process is a central, system-forming role;
# keep the value creation process’s progression logic;
# keep the double value creation’s philosophy.

=== For functional structure ===
* applicability: like the earlier [[value-chain model]]s to be able to cooperate with traditional functional and hierarchical [[organizational structure]] without to eliminate them;
* interoperability: i.e. to assist in dismantling the too rigid and too-positioned functional structure and to assist in disbanding the organizational barriers;
* expandable-ity: i.e. when appear new features or change the strategy to be able to accommodate to the new functional elements.

=== For linear, chain-like structure and process approach ===
* network structure: i.e. for chain-like structure instead of a new more flexible networked structure to appear in the process approach and it disappears the functional walls;
* complex process approach: continue to preserves the complexity of the process approach on overall process's performance;
* focus point: the value creation not be a process's outcome but the process to build itself around the values and focus point.

=== For integration ===
* integration: i.e. in the coordination of function allows the higher level of integration as a chain-like model;
* information relations: i.e. the high level of integration allows the [[information]]’s free flow and the allows more extensive information relations;
* synergy: i.e. in organizational function’s performance be creating a high level of [[synergy]].

=== System approach ===
* granularity: i.e. the created [[logical data model|logical model]] be resolvable - optionally - to same built logical sub-systems by test criteria;
* synthesize-able: i.e. the system-forming elements can be able to other logic incorporate with other elements or additional elements may be incorporated therein;
* variability: i.e. the system components can be varied to thereby provide a new perspective for management.

Summary: the new management model for the linear functional approach instead of to be function as a network, system approach model, which is much more advanced in the present age is much better suited to the challenges of the management approach lends perspective. The main advantages of the new management concept can be allow the cooperation between organization's traditional structures and can help to remove the organization's functional barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Johnson G. |author2=Scholes K. | title = Exploring corporate strategy | year = 1997 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Europe|isbn=0-13-525619-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Husti | first = István | title = Innováció menedzsment elemei | year = 2010 | publisher = Szent István egyetem | location = Gödöllő }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = E.

== The model’s presentation ==
The integrated value-creating and value-adding management system’s (as I-VMS) essence is: do not concentrate to value-creating activities chain but allows a new three pillar system-approach which is realize the activities integrated conception.

The system-model is finding basic- and support focus areas synergy.

''„This technology place the conscious management to center and give back the control to management’s hands overall values and processes more in [[complex system]]s too.”''

In the model applied an integrated systematic-approach is breaking the previous function-approach so it allows the cooperation of certain areas activity without domination, competing in cooperation of the value-dimension increase, but some areas set to center (to focus point) and creates increase and concentration of the value-dimension. In the presented model system approach's advantages is the [[multi-granularity]], which has a result of all the system-constituents with the same of modeling technique to analyze further in the desired depth. The subsystems are integrated into broader scheme, while are exploring the inner structure and are set up network connections.
The synthesizable advantage is that the individual components are building as blocks, or molecular way to more complicated structures to form, while its preserves in the simply a transparent structure through the focus-triples.

On demand developed dynamic relationships are shaping the model's variability, i.e. is built a logical system which is adapt to the testing organization or it is give a new approach and new perspectives to management in the value's coordination.

The basic idea of the [[model structure]] can be traced back to the so-called focus triplets. All of system unit based on three core-functions (i.e. the main or primary focus-area), and three support operations (i.e., complementary or supporting focus-area).The core and supporting activities are not linked to the chain-like, but targeted to the same focus areas. The core and supporting activities can be represents by two interlocked triangles, which are constitute goal-directed focus-triplets.

=== The 1&lt;small&gt;st&lt;/small&gt; level of model (management control) ===
The management is on the [[focus point]] of model's first level which performance can be primarily maximized. The management function's maximize is means the management can be able to understand and recognizing the [[consumer]] needs, so can be able to convert to optimized organization-function, so that during the process generate maximum customer-value.

=== The 2&lt;small&gt;nd&lt;/small&gt; level of model (basic activities as sub-systems) ===
The model's second level is based on the main-function's analysis which primarily contributes to the management's performance.

''The effective innovation’s bases:''
* functions which can be able to perception the consumer needs;
* the given performance to the needs of perception parts by customer;
* realization’s functions which define the performance.

''The effective human resource’s bases:''
* the features which to allow detection of psychic factors (personal goals);
* motivation and incentive function-system;
* regular education and training, which makes it possible to achieve new levels.

''The bases of effective financial:''
* [[market strategy]] development and application-awareness in the organization;
* monitoring of financial transaction processes and their function;
* material sense, transaction monitoring processes and their functions.

The [[functional analysis]] in an integrated approach to provide an interesting perspective which are legible and explore from dimension of support-activities links. Some of the functions multiple appearance attention at [[multifunctionality]] and multi-dimensional goal-system.

=== The 3&lt;small&gt;rd&lt;/small&gt; level of model (support activities, as sub-systems) ===
The model's third level based on the support activity’s deeper analysis which is themselves contribution greatly to the base-activities core power level or through the base-activities edges of triangles manifested synergy.

Complex model (total dimensional of [[ganglion network]] structure): 
Although the new model is not directly intended, but it can be the complex system's system elements integrity and complex representation which provides profitable links and management perspectives through the analysis.

=== The 4&lt;small&gt;th&lt;/small&gt; level of model (the logistics or model’s extension) ===
The model is suitable to show the complex network of activities and the management can be find more useful interfaces with their analysis. Further modeling aspect can be realize points represent the modeling aspect, if we step out of a two-dimensional representation's  constraint and we will create a real three-dimensional network model.

Possible to show the [[logistics]] functions with three-dimensional shift which is overlap with management's previously shown support activities. The resulting layout highlights is shows the necessary central role of the logistics management which is gives projection of entire organization operational material and information flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dobák | first = Miklós | title = Szervezeti Magatartás és Vezetés | year = 2013 | publisher = KJK-KERSZOV jogi és Üzleti Kiadó Kft. | location = Budapest }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dobák | first = Miklós | title = Folyamatok fejlesztése és változásvezetés | year = 1999 | publisher = Harvard Business Manager, vol. 1999 / 3, pp. 69-76 Budapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem GTK | location = Budapest }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fülöp | first = Gyula | title = A globális vállalati stratégiák | year = 2001 | publisher = Aula kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-9345-54-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logistics and I-VMS.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Logistics management for the VMS-I Model]]

== Logistics has a prominent role in the I-VMS Model ==
The integrated system-approach management model has a primary merit: central role of [[logistics]] in the Model by I-VMS's structural advantage.
Management, as managing, organizing and strategic focus area, cannot function without adequate information and support. Management needs to have a basic support, but at the same time cooperating organizational units, such as logistics, which is driving the quality and strategic value of information set will perform.

– Over the logistics function, focus-triplet model's examination we are obtaining the management's projection, which is the same as the support functions of management's extension. In other words, the management's support activities are consistent with logistics core functions.

By placing the logistics into a high priority, i.e. key position the model can be properly manage the interoperability between the value dimensions. The model is can be capable to mapping the complex activity-network and with analysis of interfaces the management can be found for further valuable intervention points. The aforementioned three-dimensional network model provides give additional modeling aspect to analysis.

A graphical spatial offset representation of the logistics function can be possible, which is overlap by the logistics core functions over the management's previously shown support functions. The received layout is necessarily highlights the central role of logistics management, which can be representing the overall organizational financial and operational information flow. In other words, the logistics can be integrating the other management (information and financial) functions.
This approach in practice is useful because it helps to understand the real value-formation and flow structure, while avoiding the previously mentioned value torsion, which stems from some features (for example: [[marketing]]) excessive emphasis.

The logistics department has a central role in the management to give a new approach to management which the information and material type of market structure in a useful gain first mover advantage. A new kind of light will be on strategic planning, which includes not only the material things in management, but also the values and surplus-value recognition and also deal with the integration strategy.
According to the model are often rated at the bottom of logistics has no longer a secondary role in a company by strategic planning and key performing unit, but also has serious and formers harmony-creator function.

The model's innovation is that: over the two-dimensional can be increase the value dimensions and with endowed key-position role can be bring new concept into the company management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Szegedi | first = Zoltán |author2=Prezenszki József | title = Logisztika-menedzsment | year = 2003 | publisher = Kossuth kiadó | location = Budapest|isbn=963-09-4434-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''ISO 15022''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard for [[messaging]] used in transactions between financial institutions.  Participants in the [[financial industry]] need a common representation of the [[financial transaction]]s they perform and this standard defines general message [[Ontology (information science)|schema]], which in turn are used by organizations to define messages in a complete and unambiguous way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 15022 | url=http://www.iso15022.org}}(official website)&lt;/ref&gt; This results in efficiency, lower costs, and the avoidance of errors.  Prior to standardization in this area, there were overlapping standards, or [[ad hoc]] approaches where there was a functional gap and no standard.

== Transition from ISO 7775 to ISO 15022 ==
ISO 15022 replaces the previous securities messaging standard [[ISO 7775]]. It provides two syntaxes: one compatible with the preceding standards, and one fairly compatible with [[EDIFACT]]. [[ISO 20022]] is the successor to ISO 15022.
[[SWIFT]] is the Registration Authority for ISO 15022. In SWIFT Financial messages, the standard is applied to variety of [[SWIFT:Message Types|message types]].

ISO 15022 was developed in 1995 to provide the securities industry with a better tool to create message standards. The previous standard ISO 7775 contained the actual message standards themselves (like the SWIFT message types MT 520 or MT 534), which did not make it easy to make changes to these standards (because each time one needs to pass a number of time-consuming standard cycles). To avoid this, ISO 15022 does not contain the actual messages, but contains a set of rules and guidelines to build messages. If these rules and guidelines are adhered to (checked by the registration authority) the resulting message (format) is automatically an ISO 15022-compliant standard. Examples are the [[MT103]], [[MT202 Cov]], MT540, MT542, MT548, etc.

==Parts==
ISO 15022 is split into two parts:

*ISO 15022-1:1999 ''Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 1: Data field and message design rules and guidelines''
*ISO 15022-2:1999 ''Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 2: Maintenance of the Data Field Dictionary and Catalogue of Messages''

'''(George) Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl''' [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (19 June 1931 – 27 February 1996), known as ''Wee Iain'', was a Scottish peer and landowner.

==Background and education==
Murray was the only surviving child of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] George Anthony Murray (1907–1945), who was killed in action in the [[Second World War]], and the Honourable Angela Pearson (1910–1981), daughter of [[Weetman Pearson, 2nd Viscount Cowdray]]. He was a great-grandson of [[George Murray (civil servant)|Sir George Murray]], grandson of the Right Reverend [[George Murray (bishop of Rochester)|George Murray]], son of the Right Reverend [[Lord George Murray (bishop)|Lord George Murray]], second son of [[John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl]] who in turn was eldest son of renowned Scottish Jacobite [[Lord George Murray (general)|Lord George Murray]]. Through his American great grandfather [[General]] [[Daniel Frost]] he was a descendant of the Winthrop family and a distant cousin to former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]].

He attended both [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], before succeeding the 9th duke, his fourth cousin twice removed [[James Stewart-Murray, 9th Duke of Atholl]], as 10th [[Duke of Atholl]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p2204.htm thepeerage.com George Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl]&lt;/ref&gt; With a height of six feet, five inches, he was one of the tallest Scottish peers, leading to the whimsical name of "Wee Iain".&lt;ref name="11thDuke"&gt;
{{cite news|title=The Duke of Atholl|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9272670/The-Duke-of-Atholl.html|date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
Atholl inherited an estate of approximately 120,000 [[acre]]s (496&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)—although this was a decline from the 190,000 acres (769&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the 19th century, it was still a smaller decline than many other Scottish estates. Under his stewardship, the estate in and around [[Blair Castle]] became a significant area for [[tourism]] and [[forestry]], on which he was an acknowledged expert and spoke many times in the [[House of Lords]], having been [[Scottish representative peer election, 1958|elected]] a [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt; In addition, he resurrected the [[Atholl Highlanders]], the ceremonial private army of the dukedom composed of estate workers and family friends, as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name="11thDuke"/&gt;

He was an active member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Copping, Robert, ''The Monday Club—Crisis and After'' May 1975, page 25, published by the Current Affairs Information Service, Ilford, Essex, (P/B).&lt;/ref&gt; He also held several business appointments, notably as Chairman of BPM Holdings between 1972 and 1983 and of Westminster Press Group between 1974 and 1996 and as a director of [[Pearson Longman]] between 1975 and 1983. In 1980 he was appointed a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Perth and Kinross]].&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Atholl died unmarried in February 1996, aged 64, with the titles passing to his second cousin, once removed [[John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl|John Murray]], a [[South Africa]]n land surveyor.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt; The day before the death of the 10th Duke, it was announced that he had given [[Blair Castle]] and most of his estates to a [[charitable trust]], thus effectively disinheriting his heir. The new duke had indicated he had little interest in leaving South Africa, and though he honoured the land of his origins, felt "I am a South African, not a Scotsman." &lt;ref name="11thDuke"/&gt;

'''Mayer Lehman''' (January 9, 1830 – June 21, 1897) was a German-born American businessman, banker, and philanthropist. He was one of the three founding brothers of the investment bank [[Lehman Brothers]].

==Early life==
Mayer Lehman was born in 1830 to a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] family in the small [[Franconia]]n town of [[Rimpar]] near [[Würzburg]]. He was the son of a cattle merchant, Abraham Löw Lehmann.&lt;ref name=Bernhard1&gt;Bernhard, William, L., Birge, June Rossbach Bingham, Loeb, John L., Jr..  '' Lots of Lehmans – The Family of Mayer Lehman of Lehman Brothers, Remembered by His Descendants''. [[Center For Jewish History]], 2007, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Henry ''America's successful men of affairs. An encyclopedia of contemporaneous biography (1895)'' [https://archive.org/download/cu31924072688090/cu31924072688090.pdf] p 390-392&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and life in the United States==
In 1850, Mayer emigrated to the United States, joining his brothers, [[Henry Lehman]] (b. 1822) and [[Emanuel Lehman]] in  [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]]. His brother Henry had left Germany in 1844 and opened a dry goods store named "H. Lehman".&lt;ref name="lehman_bios"&gt;[http://www.lehman.com/who/index.htm Lehman Brothers.com]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Emanuel left Germany in 1847 and joined Henry in his business endeavor, which they renamed "H. Lehman and Bro."  With the arrival of Mayer in 1850, it became [[Lehman Brothers]].&lt;ref name=Birmingham47&gt;Birmingham, Stephen.  ''[[Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York]]''. Harper and Row, 1967, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[cotton]] was the most important crop of the [[Southern United States]] and global demand led to profitable  business, the Lehman brothers became [[cotton factor]]s, accepting cotton bales from customers as payment for their merchandise.&lt;ref name="lehman_bios" /&gt;  Cotton trading eventually became the main thrust of their business. Mayer was also one of twenty men who established the first important iron furnace in the South before the war.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

Mayer Lehman supported the Southern cause during the [[American Civil War]].  Mayer was listed as the owner of seven slaves ("three males and four females ranging in age from 5 to 50") in the [[U.S. Census of 1860]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/general/2002/02/21/slave-lehman-bros.htm USA Today: "Lehman Bros: 1 brother owned 7 slaves in 1860"] February 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the [[Governor of Alabama]], [[Thomas H. Watts]], appointed Mayer as a Commissioner to visit and look after the interests of Alabama [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers being held as prisoners of war in the North. Other offers of public position were made to him but he declined.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

In 1855, his brother Henry died from [[yellow fever]] while travelling in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;Archibald, Robert. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=20 "Mayer Lehman."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 2, edited by William J. Hausman. German Historical Institute. Last modified May 07, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1867, Mayer and Emanuel moved the company's headquarters to [[New York City]], eventually building it into an important American [[investment bank]], which was in operation for over 150 years until its September 2008 collapse.

Mayer Lehman was one of the organizers of the [[New York Cotton Exchange]], the oldest commodities exchange in New York City, and served as its director. Mayer Lehman concentrated on the railroad, land, industrial and mining enterprises of the business. He served as the director of The Hamilton Bank, The American Cotton Oil Company, The Union Oil Company of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and [[N. K. Fairbank|The N.K. Fairbank Company]] of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dromo.info/lehmanmbio.htm Biography of Mayer Lehman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301003358/http://www.dromo.info/lehmanmbio.htm |date=2005-03-01 }} retrieved April 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Mayer Lehman took an active interest in philanthropic work and was a trustee of [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Emanu-El]] as well as a generous giver to the [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York City.
He was also a member of the [[Harmonie Club]].&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1858, Mayer Lehman married Babetta Newgass, the daughter of Isaac Newgass. Together they had eight children of which seven survived childhood:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/614 [[New York Social Diary]]: "Lots of Lehmans"] March 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Herbert H. Lehman]] - the 45th [[Governor of New York]] (1933-1942) and [[US Senator]] from New York (1949-1956).

The couple were [[Reform Jews]] who, although they always observed the religious holidays, frowned on many other religious traditions and practices, instead focusing on educating their children in language, history and culture. The one tradition that Mayer emphasized was the Jewish tradition of [[tsedaka]] or the joy of giving. In order to instill the importance of charity into his children, Mayer would take his three youngest — Arthur, Irving and Herbert — to Mount Sinai Hospital every Sunday to see the great needs of the less fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/614 New York Social Diary: "Lots of Lehmans"] March 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayer Lehman died in 1897.

He supported financially several issues of the ''[[Hermes o Logios]]'' ({{lang-el|Λόγιος Ερμής}}) literary newspaper, published in [[Vienna]] as well the Greek translation of the ''French codex for merchants'' ({{lang-el|Γαλλικός κώδιξ για εμπόρους}}, in 1817).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zosimaia.gr/?page=article&amp;id=78 Νεοελληνικός Διαφωτισμός και η Ήπειρος] Σύλλογος Αποφοίτων Ζωσιμαίας Σχολής Ιωαννίνων.

'''Olive oil extraction''' is the process of extracting the oil present in olive [[drupe]]s, known as [[olive oil]]. Olive oil is produced in the [[mesocarp]] [[plant cell|cells]], and stored in a particular type of [[vacuole]] called a lipo vacuole, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;every cell contains a tiny olive oil droplet. Olive oil extraction is the process of separating the [[oil]] from the other fruit contents (vegetative extract liquid and solid material). It is possible to attain this separation by physical means alone, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;oil and water do not mix, so they are relatively easy to separate. This contrasts with other [[Vegetable oil| oils]] that are extracted with chemical [[solvents]], generally [[hexane]].&lt;ref&gt;F. D. Gunstone, ''Vegetable Oils in Food Technology: Composition, Properties, and Uses'', 2002, CRC Press, 351 pages {{ISBN|0-8493-2816-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first operation when extracting olive oil is washing the olives, to reduce the presence of [[contaminant]]s, especially [[soil contamination|soil]] which can create a particular [[flavor]] effect called "soil taste".

== Olive presses ==

People have used olive presses since Greeks first began pressing olives over 5,000 years ago.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} Roman olive presses survive to the present time, with a notable collection present at [[Volubilis]] in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megaoithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; An olive press works by applying pressure to olive paste to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard [[decantation]].

This basic method is still widely used today, and it is still a valid way of producing high quality olive oil if adequate precautions are taken.

First the olives are ground into an olive paste using large [[millstone]]s at an [[oil mill]]. The olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30‑40&amp;nbsp;minutes. This has three objectives:
* Ensure that olives are well ground
* Allow enough time for the olive drops to join to form the largest droplets of oil
* Allow the fruit [[enzymes]] to produce some of the oil aromas and taste

Olive oil mills very rarely use a modern crushing method with a traditional press.

After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other, then placed into the press. Traditionally the disks were made of hemp or coconut fiber, but in modern times they are made of synthetic fibers which are easier to clean and maintain.

These disks are then put on a hydraulic piston, forming a pile. Pressure is applied on the disks, thus compacting the solid phase of the olive paste and percolating the liquid phases (oil and vegetation water). The applied hydraulic pressure can go to 400&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. To facilitate separation of the liquid phases, water is run down the sides of the disks to increase the speed of percolation. The liquids are then separated either by a standard process of decantation or by means of a faster vertical [[centrifuge]].

The traditional method is a valid form of producing high-quality olive oil, if after each extraction the disks are properly cleaned from the remains of paste; if not the leftover paste will begin to ferment, thereby producing inconsistencies of flavors (called defects) that will contaminate the subsequently produced olive oil. A similar problem can affect the grindstones that, in order to assure perfect quality, also require cleaning after each usage.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
Proper cleaning produces higher-quality oil. Grindstones, while ancient in design, are a suitable way to grind olives, because this method breaks up the [[drupe]]'s pulp while only slightly touching the nut and the skin. This reduces the release of the oil [[Rancidification|oxidation]] enzymes present in these organs. In addition, in this extraction method, the introduction of water is minimal when compared to the modern one, thus reducing the washing-off of the [[polyphenol]]s. The exhausted paste, called [[pomace]], has a low content of water, making it an easier residue to manage.

'''Advantages'''
* Better grinding of the olives, reducing the release of oil [[Rancidification|oxidation]] enzymes
* Reduced added water, minimizing the washing of polyphenols
* Pomace with a low content of water easier to manage

'''Disadvantages'''
* Difficult to clean
* Non-continuous process with waiting periods thus exposes the olive paste to [[oxygen]] and light
* Requires more manual labor
* Longer production time from harvest to pressing

== Decanter centrifugation ==
The modern method of olive oil extraction uses an industrial decanter to separate all the phases by [[centrifugation]]. In this method the olives are crushed to a fine paste. This can be done by a hammer crusher, disc crusher, depitting machine or knife crusher. This paste is then [[malaxation|malaxed]] for 30 to 60 minutes in order to allow the small olive droplets to agglomerate. The aromas are created in these two steps through the action of fruit [[enzyme]]s.

Afterwards the paste is pumped into an industrial decanter where the phases will be separated. Water is added to facilitate the extraction process with the paste.

The decanter is a large capacity horizontal [[centrifuge]] rotating approximately 3,000&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], the high [[centrifugal force]] created allows the phases to be readily separated according to their different densities (solids &gt; vegetation water &gt; oil). Inside the decanter's rotating conical drum there is a coil that rotates more slowly, pushing the solid materials out of the system.

[[Image:Decanter.gif|center|500px|thumb|Diagram of a working decanter. The three phases are separated according to their densities.]]

The separated oil and vegetation water are then rerun through a vertical centrifuge, working around 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] that will separate the small quantity of vegetation water still contained in oil and vice versa.

=== Three, two, and two and a half phases decanters ===
With the '''three phases''' oil decanter, a portion of the oil polyphenols is washed out due to the higher quantity of added water (when compared to the traditional method), producing a larger quantity of vegetation water that needs to be processed.

The '''two phases''' oil decanter was created as an attempt to solve these problems. Sacrificing part of its extraction capability, it uses less added water thus reducing the phenol washing. The olive paste is separated into two phases: oil and wet pomace. This type of decanter, instead of having three exits (oil, water, and solids), has only two. The water is expelled by the decanter coil together with the pomace, resulting in a wetter pomace that is much harder to process industrially. Many pomace oil extraction facilities refuse to work with these materials because the energy costs of drying the pomace for the hexane oil extraction often make the extraction process sub-economical. In practice, then, the two phases decanter solves the phenol washing problem but increases the residue management problem. This residue management problem has been reduced by the collection of this wetter pomace and being transported to specialized facilities called extractors which heat the pomace between 45ºc and 50ºc and can extract up to a further 2&amp;nbsp;litres per 100&amp;nbsp;kilos of pomace using adapted two-phase decanters.

The two-and-a-half-phase oil decanter is a compromise between the two previous types of decanters. It separates the olive paste into the standard three phases, but has a smaller need for added water and also a smaller vegetation water output. Therefore, the water content of the obtained pomace comes very close to that of the standard three-phase decanter, and the vegetation water output is relatively small, minimizing the residue management issues.

Depending on the olives and processing, the [[Decanter]] or Tricanter can extract between 85 and 90% of the olive oil in the 1st extraction. The yield from olive oil manufacture can be increased even further with a 2nd extraction. The olive oil yield increases to as much as 96% by combining the 1st and 2nd extractions. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flottweg.com/applications/edible-fats-and-oils-biofuels/olive-oil/ Higher Yield due to the 2nd Extraction in Olive Oil Manufacture]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
'''Advantages'''
* Compact machinery: only one decanter required
* Continuous and automated
* Limited labor required
* Highest percent of oil extraction
* Vegetable water disposal less of a problem
* Olive oil from two-phase centrifugation systems contains more phenols, [[tocopherol]]s, trans‑2‑hexenal, and total aroma compounds and is more resistant to oxidation than oil from three-phase ones and from hydraulic presses

'''Disadvantages'''
* Expensive
* More technical labor required
* High energy consumption
* Pomace may end up moist
* Greater amount of vegetable water to be disposed of
* Reduced antioxidants due to added water
* Subject to wear from rocks, grit

== Sinolea method ==
The Sinolea method to extract oil from the olives was introduced in 1972;&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrios Boskou, ''Olive Oil: Chemistry and Technology'', Contributor American Oil Chemists Society, 2006, AOCS Press, 268 pages {{ISBN|1-893997-88-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this process, rows of metal discs or plates are dipped into the paste; the oil preferentially wets and sticks to the metal and is removed with scrapers in a continuous process. It is based on the different [[surface tension]] of the vegetation water and the oil, these different physical behaviors allow the olive oil to adhere to a steel plaque while the other two phases remain behind.

Sinolea works by continuously introducing several hundreds of steel plaques into the paste thus extracting the olive oil. This process is not completely efficient leaving a large quantity of oil still in the paste, so the remaining paste has to be processed by the standard modern method (industrial decanter).

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
'''Advantages'''
* Higher polyphenol content of oil
* Low temperature method
* Automated
* Low labor
* Oil/water separation step is not needed
* Low energy requirement

'''Disadvantages'''
* Often must be combined with one of the above methods in order to maximize oil extraction which requires more space and labor
* Large surface areas can lead to rapid [[oxidation]] of the olive product
* Sale of future machines currently outlawed in the [[European Union]] due to difficulty in cleaning large surface areas

== First cold pressed – cold extraction ==
Many oils are marketed as first cold pressed or cold extraction. "Cold" means no heat is added during extraction. "Pressed" means that the olives are crushed in a mill to extract the oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olive Oil Origin &amp; Production|url=http://aboutoliveoil.org/olive_oil_world/origin.html|website=About Olive Oil|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the EU, these designations are regulated by Article&amp;nbsp;5 of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002R1019:EN:NOT Commission Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 of 13 June 2002 on marketing standards for olive oil]. This article states that in order to use these designations the olive oil bottler must prove that the temperature of [[malaxation]] and extraction was under 27&amp;nbsp;°C (80&amp;nbsp;°F).

For olive oil bottled outside EU&amp;nbsp;countries, this regulation does not apply, and thus the consumer has no assurance that these statements are true.

The temperature of malaxation and extraction is crucial due to its effect on olive oil quality. When high temperatures are applied, the more volatile aromas are lost and the rate of oil oxidation is increased, producing therefore lower quality oils. In addition, the chemical content of the polyphenols, [[polyphenol antioxidant|antioxidants]], and [[vitamin]]s present in the oil is reduced by higher temperatures. The temperature is adjusted basically by controlling the temperature of the water added during these two steps. High temperatures are used to increase the yield of olive oil obtained from the paste.

== Alternative configurations ==
Some producers, in order to maximise product quality, choose to combine the traditional grinding method, the stone mill, with a modern [[decanter]]. This technique produces more selective grinding of the olives, reduces the malaxation time olive paste, and avoids the complicated cleaning of the olive press fibre disks. Because the use of the stone mill requires a loading and unloading phase, this extraction method is discontinuous, i.e., there are times when all the machinery is stopped, therefore it is generally not used on a large commercial scale, being applied only by small scale olive mills producing high quality olive oil.

== Consumer point of view ==
High quality olive oil can be obtained by all the methods if proper measures are taken. Olive oil quality is equally dependent on the quality of the olives themselves and on the time they have to wait from harvesting to extraction, in addition to the extraction method itself.

The two main agents that cause the degradation of olive oil are oxygen and light. Once an olive is harvested, it should be pressed within 24 hours. Oxidation begins immediately upon harvesting. In the period between harvest and grinding, the fruits' enzymes are very active and increasingly degrade the [[endogenous]] oil, and therefore oil obtained after a longer wait is of lower quality, presenting higher [[Olive oil acidity|acidity]] ([[free fatty acids]] percentage).

In addition, if additional oxygen is allowed to interact with the olive paste during the extraction process, the acidity level will increase further. Sealed extraction methods are best to prevent the continued introduction of oxygen, as well as light to the oil.

After extraction is complete, in most cases [[unfiltered olive oil]] appears somewhat cloudy, mainly due to the presence of minute amounts of water and suspended solids of olive pulp and seed. This type of oil is therefore sometimes called ''cloudy'' or ''veiled olive oil''.

It is common practice that unfiltered olive oils are then "racked" for a time, i.e. stored in cool [[stainless steel]] silos with a conical bottom that are pumped free of oxygen to enable the precipitation and separation of the two phases and facilitate later [[filtration]]; it will also contribute in the integrity and stability of the oil.

== Future prospects ==
The future of olive extraction points to reducing the negative aspects of the present methods, decreasing the degradation oil produced by the extraction process in itself.
* Reducing the oxidation by performing part of the process of malaxation and the extraction under a controlled [[nitrogen]] atmosphere
* Extracting the nut of the olive before grinding, this will reduce the release of [[oxidative enzyme]]s present in this organ, and yield a [[pomace]] that is free from wood residues, making it possible to be used in animal feeding
* Reducing the addition of water to minimize the washing of polyphenols
* Improving the sinolea method, through an increase in the efficiency of the [[adsorption]] of the oil to the plates, thus reducing the need for the use of standard methods of extraction

'''Opposition to [[Trade union|trade unions]]''' comes from a variety of groups in society and there are many different types of argument on which this opposition is based.

==Economic effects==

===Unemployment===
The economist [[Milton Friedman]], advocate of [[laissez-faire]] capitalism, believed that unionization frequently produces higher wages at the expense of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while others are not, wages will decline in non-unionized industries.&lt;ref&gt;Milton &amp; Rose Friedman, ''[[Free to Choose]]''. Chicago Press, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

By raising the price of labor, the [[wage rate]], above the [[equilibrium price]], unemployment rises. This is because it is no longer worthwhile for businesses to employ those laborers whose work is worth less than the minimum wage rate set by the unions.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Anderton, ''Economics'', Fourth edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unions often benefit ''insider'' workers, those having a secure job and high productivity, at the cost of  ''outsider'' workers, consumers of the goods or services produced, and the shareholders of the unionized business. The ones who are likely to lose the most from a trade union are those who are unemployed or at the risk of unemployment or who are not able to get the job that they want in a particular field.&lt;ref&gt;''Economics'', 16th edition, Samuelson Nordhaus&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}}

===Harm to ununionized labor===
Advocates of unions claim that the higher wages that unions demand can be paid for through company profits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} However, as Milton Friedman pointed out, profits are only very rarely high enough. 80% of national income is wages, and only about 6% is profits after tax, providing very little room for higher wages, even if profits could be totally used up. Moreover, profits are invested leading to an increase in capital: which raises the value of labor, increasing wages. If profits were totally removed, this source of wage increase would be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Milton &amp; Rose Friedman, ''Free to Choose'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The New York Times, wages in 2012 fell to a record low of 43.5 percent of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sunday-review/americas-productivity-climbs-but-wages-stagnate.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency===

[[Friedrich Hayek]] argued that the effect of union activities to influence pricing is potentially very harmful, making the market system ineffective.&lt;ref name="Hayek"&gt;F. A. Hayek, ''The Constitution of Liberty'', 1960 Routledge Classics&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}}

===Cost-push inflation===

By causing wage increases above the market rate, unions increase the cost to businesses, causing them to raise their prices, leading to a [[inflation|general increase in the price level]].&lt;ref name="Hayek"/&gt; [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] such as [[Robert P. Murphy]], however, dispute this, arguing that the increase in the cost of labor simply means that less of other goods can be bought. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If unions succeed in wage hikes, and employers raise the prices they charge consumers to maintain their own profit margins, and the supply of money remains the same, then something else has to "give." Either the prices of goods and services in nonunion sectors have to fall and offset the union sector hikes, or people's cash balances need to fall, in terms of their purchasing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert P. Murphy |url=http://www.mises.org/story/2839 |title=Can Unions Cause Price Inflation?  |publisher=[[Mises Institute]] |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Corruption===

Some trade unions, such as the [[Teamsters#Influence of organized crime|Teamsters]], have been criticized for involvement with [[organized crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fitch|first=Robert|title=Solidarity for Sale: How Corruption Destroyed the Labor Movement and Undermined American Promise|year=2006|publisher=PublicAffairs|pages=134–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General response to economic arguments===
The argument that unionized workers raise their own wages above their natural rate at the expense of their businesses or other workers assumes that unions never raise productivity to compensate for higher wages. Unions are capable of raising productivity by reducing turnover, by increasing coordination between workers and management, and by increasing workers' motivation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://cep.lse.ac.uk/people/vanreenen/lecture_notes/handbook_metcalf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aflcio.org/joinaunion/why/uniondifference/uniondiff8.cfm |title=Unions Are Good for Business, Productivity and the Economy |publisher=Aflcio.org |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211064646/http://www.aflcio.org/joinaunion/why/uniondifference/uniondiff8.cfm |archivedate=11 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1153/is_v108/ai_3579390/ |title=Union productivity effects &amp;#124; Monthly Labor Review |publisher=Find Articles |accessdate=18 October 2011 |year=1985 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107232744/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1153/is_v108/ai_3579390/ |archivedate= 7 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many unions raise the productivity of their workers, and some even raise it enough to make up for wage increases.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Another argument raised by union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving economic growth and creating new jobs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2009/02/efca_factsheets.html&lt;/ref&gt; Union opponents respond that this is an example of the [[broken window fallacy]]; union supporters assume that money is more valuable in the hands of unionized workers than in the hands of whoever else would obtain it in the union's absence. There is some evidence that this is not a fallacy, as greater [[wealth equality]] seems to be correlated with greater economic growth.&lt;ref name=OstryBerg&gt;Andrew Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry, 2011, "[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin]?" IMF Staff Discussion Note SDN/11/08, [[International Monetary Fund]]&lt;/ref&gt; Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages are legitimate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;http://c4ss.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/C4SS-Labor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social disruption===
[[Trade unions]] take strike actions that result in the disruption of public services&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/10489/11328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiatogether.org/combatlaw/vol2/issue6/strike.htm |title=Critique of SC's ruling on the right to strike, from Volume 2, Issue 6, of Combat Law |publisher=Indiatogether.org |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as demonstrated in the British [[Winter of Discontent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |author=Colin Hay |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446–70 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, where applicable, this may be logically inferred to be the very purpose of strike action ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaiifreepress.com/main/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1360/Furlough-negotiations-50M-ransom-offered-but-unions-balk-at-releasing-hostages.aspx |title=Furlough negotiations: $50M ransom offered, but unions balk at releasing hostages |publisher=Hawaii Free Press |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/letters/unions-will-hold-us-all-to-ransom-1820400.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Unions will hold us all to ransom | date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, unions' strike have led to violent clashes with police and with strikebreakers.  See the article on the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)#Violence|UK miners' strike of the 1980s]].

==Challenges from affirmative action perspectives==

===Racist policies in the past===
A consequence of unions' zeal to guard their special interests is that some unions have actively lobbied for racist and anti-immigration policies. An example is the creation of the notorious [[Asiatic Exclusion League]], which was composed mainly of the various labor unions. The ''Pictorial History of American Labor'' observes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The early A.F. of L. did not draw the color line, but expressed an "ideal of solidarity irrespective of race." Before long, however, the feeling changed. Whether a tendency to exclude black workers from craft unions was based more on fear of competition or racial prejudice carried over from slave days, it is difficult to decide. But the developing exclusion of the Negro worker from many neighbor unions brought with it serious problems—not just for the black worker seeking job security, but for the white worker seeking the same end...&lt;br&gt;
The record shows that black workers...have been used to break strikes. This availability has usually ended when the black worker has been shown that the union is open to black as well as white.&lt;ref name="Cahn_160"&gt;''A Pictorial History of American Labor'', William Cahn, 1972, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in a study called ''The Black Worker'', Spero and Harris observe that more strikes [in American labor history] have been broken by white workers than by black workers.&lt;ref name="Cahn_160"/&gt; Most blacks were barred from membership in the AFL not because of their skin color, but because they never had a chance to learn a skill, and "most A.F. of L. unions did not admit unskilled mass-production workers."&lt;ref&gt;''A Pictorial History of American Labor'', William Cahn, 1972, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[AFL-CIO]] is the modern version of the AFL, it is much more open to membership by women, immigrants, and different nationalities. Other unions, such as the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]], were created without regard to race from the very start.&lt;ref&gt;''Solidarity Forever – An oral history of the IWW'', Stewart Bird, Dan Georgakas, Deborah Shaffer, 1985, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government ==
[[File:Illegal Union Firing 1952 - 2007.svg|thumb|280px|Illegal union firing increased during the [[Reagan administration]] and has continued since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1994/b337360.arc.htm "Why America Needs Unions"], ''BusinessWeek''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Specific countries, especially undemocratic countries, while still having unions in ''name'', do not allow for independent trade unions, just as they rarely allow for independent businesses. These state-run trade unions do not function in the same way as independent trade unions and generally do not hold any kind of collective bargaining power, acting to ensure the smooth running of Government industry.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Attempts to reduce the effects of trade unions may include [[union busting]] activities by private [[company|companies]] or state action including governments of authoritarian regimes such as in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Nazi Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/fight/sfeature/sf_nazis_02.html |title=American Experience &amp;#124; The Fight &amp;#124; Nazis in the News |publisher=PBS |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colby.edu/personal/r/rmscheck/GermanyE1.html |title=E: The Third Reich |publisher=Colby.edu |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pmaci.customer.netspace.net.au/ncop.htm |title=The Creation Of A Fascist Dictatorship / Totalitarian State In Germany |publisher=Pmaci.customer.netspace.net.au |date=27 February 1933 |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004121038/http://pmaci.customer.netspace.net.au/ncop.htm |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Burma's military dictator, [[Ne Win]]. Many democratic governments have also attempted to limit the effects of unions, although success has been mixed.

It has been argued, particularly by market anarchists, that government intervention in the economy has been decidedly anti-union, even in economies like the United States or the European Union. [[Kevin Carson]] maintains that the most effective union tactics are either criminalized or displaced by state policy in most countries. Trade unions established themselves through [[sitdown strike]]s, [[sympathy strikes]], [[secondary boycotts]], and hot cargo agreements; these tactics are all illegal in most industrialized countries. Similarly, the original unions doubled as social welfare organization, using union funds to provide healthcare and pensions to workers and welfare to the unemployed. By adopting various welfare-state measures, governments made the populace less dependent on unions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Left critiques of trade unionism==
[[File:Anti-union ASF flyer.jpg|thumb|An [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] flyer exhorting workers to "Give Union Bosses the Flick!"]]
The political left is often associated with support for trade unionism. However, some groups and individuals have taken a less positive view. In the nineteenth century, a belief in the [[iron law of wages]] led some socialists to reject trade unionism and strike action as ineffective. In this view, any increase in wages would lead manufacturers to raise ''prices'' leaving workers no better off in real terms. [[Karl Marx]] wrote a pamphlet, "[[Wages, Price and Profit]]", to counter this idea, which had been put forward in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] by a follower of [[Robert Owen]].

Some early [[social democracy|Social Democrats]] were also skeptical of trade unionism. Usual criticisms were that unions split workers into sections rather than organising them as a class; that they were dominated by relatively privileged skilled workers who were mainly concerned to defend their sectional interests; and that industrial action and organisation were incapable of bringing about fundamental social change. [[H. M. Hyndman]] of the [[Social Democratic Federation]] summed up some of these views when he wrote in ''The Historical Basis of Socialism in England'' (1883):
:"Trade Unions ... constitute an aristocracy of labour who [are] ... a hindrance to that complete organisation of the proletariat which alone can obtain for the workers their proper control over their own labour ... Being also ... unsectarian and unpolitical, they prevent any organised attempt being made by the workers as a class to form a definite party of their own, apart from existing factions, with a view to dominate the social conditions – a victory which ... can only be gained by resolute political action."
Hyndman went on to urge workers to devote "the Trade Union funds wasted on strikes or petty funds" instead to the building up of a strong Socialist Party on the German model. Other social democrats however were more convinced than Hyndman of the utility of Trade Union action.

Trade unionism is criticised by those of [[council communism|council communist]] and [[left communism|left communist]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;"Unions Against the Working Class", International Communist Current http://en.internationalism.org/pamphlets/unions.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Here, trade unionism is seen as being more useful to capitalists than to workers, and as a kind of "safety-valve" that helps to keep working-class discontent within reformist channels and prevent it from evolving into revolutionary action. They consider a global state composed of [[workers' council]]s to be the ultimate union to which all workers in the world belong; unions that organize based on trade further divide the working class and act as a mechanism to allow the working class to vent concerns without actually uniting and becoming revolutionary. In contrast to other left critiques of trade unionism, these tendencies do not accept that the problems they identify could be remedied by changing the structure, leadership or objectives of trade unions. They argue that trade unionism is inherently reformist because it is sectarian and is not founded in the workplace itself and that revolutionary action is possible only if workers act outside trade unionism through [[soviet (council)|workers' councils]] or other channels.

There is also a philosophical difference between the [[craft unionism]] of many AFL-type unions, and the [[industrial unionism]] of organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World. Industrial unionists decry a practice that they call "union scabbing," in which craft unionists are required by the no-strike clause in their contracts to cross the picket lines of other unions.&lt;ref&gt;''Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood''. Peter Carlson, 1983, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the left critique of the tendencies of some labor unions to become [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and for the union leaders and staff to become detached from the needs and interests of the [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] union members, in contrast to the practices of [[union democracy]].  The [[Labor Notes (organization)|Labor Notes]], in the United States, is an example of an organization that attempts to fight this bureaucratic tendency.

'''Petar Matić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Петар Матић}}; born on 3 September 1966) is a Serbian [[businessman]] and the owner of [[MPC Holding]] and MPC Properties. He is believed to be one of the richest people in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/235460/300-najmocnijih-u-Srbiji 300 Most influential people in Serbia] (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Matić was born in Maribor, Slovenia and studied at the Faculty of Hotel Management in Opatija, [[Croatia]]. Before moving to [[Belgrade]], Serbia, he had already developed a business on the Croatian coast mainly involved in retail footwear and apparel.

After moving to Belgrade in 1989 Matić founded the company MPC (incorporating his initials into the name), which went on to be very successful in the following years. In 1991 MPC was transformed into the MPC Group with significant growth and expanded activities. In 2003 it had two main divisions: Real Estate and [[Trade]].

Soon afterwards, Matić went on to establish MPC Holding and MPC Properties, a leading companies in trade and real estate development in the region. In 2007 MPC Properties entered into the strategic partnership with [[Merrill Lynch]] / [[Bank of America]]. This was the first investment made by Merill Lynch in the territory of former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_id=46768 Merrill Lynch co-owns MPC Properties]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matić's companies are now market leaders in that part of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekapija.com/website/sr/page/213011_en "Balkans Real Estate" to invest 1 billion EUR in real estates in Serbia and in region within next five years]&lt;/ref&gt; They currently employ over 1,000 people and are some of the most significant investors in Serbia. The companies have been awarded retail, commercial, residential and logistics projects that are of immense importance in the region for example the [[Ušće Tower|Business Center Ušće]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://filipovic-advisory.com/UserFiles/File/cren/cren-broj-35-eng.pdf MPC Opens the Largest Shopping Centre in the Region]&lt;/ref&gt;, the Usce Shopping Center (the first regional shopping mall), IMMO outlet Centers, Business Center “Tri Lista Duvana” and residential/condominium “OASIS”. 

Matić chooses to stay out of the public eye, as he does not give interviews to the press, and his photographs cannot be found in local [[newspapers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Ekonomija/Nevidljivi-vlasnik-Ushca.lt.html Invisible Usce owner] (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Matić is also a member of ICSC - International Council of Shopping Centres.

[[File:Sale Tags.jpg|thumb|A price tag is a highly visual and objective guide to value]]

'''Pricing''' is the process whereby a business sets the price at which it will sell its products and services, and may be part of the business's [[marketing plan]]. In setting prices, the business will take into account the price at which it could acquire the goods, the [[manufacturing cost]], the market place, competition, market condition, [[brand]], and quality of product.

Pricing is a fundamental aspect of [[financial modeling]] and is one of the [[four Ps]] of the [[marketing mix]], the other three aspects being product, promotion, and [[Distribution (business)|place]]. Price is the only revenue generating element amongst the four Ps, the rest being [[cost center (business)|cost centers]]. However, the other Ps of marketing will contribute to decreasing [[price elasticity]] and so enable price increases to drive greater revenue and profits.

Pricing can be a manual or automatic process of applying prices to purchase and sales orders, based on factors such as: a fixed amount, quantity break, promotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote, price prevailing on entry, shipment or invoice date, combination of multiple orders or lines, and many others. [[Automated pricing]] systems require more setup and maintenance but may prevent pricing errors. The needs of the consumer can be converted into demand only if the consumer has the willingness and capacity to buy the product. Thus, pricing is the most important concept in the field of marketing, it is used as a tactical decision in response to comparing market situations.

==Objectives of pricing==

The objectives of pricing should consider:
* the financial goals of the company (i.e. profitability)
* the fit with marketplace realities (will customers buy at that price?)
* the extent to which the price supports a product's [[positioning (marketing)|market positioning]] and be consistent with the other variables in the [[marketing mix]]
* the consistency of prices across categories and products (consistency indicates reliability and supports customer confidence and customer satisfaction)

Price is influenced by the type of distribution channel used, the type of promotions used, and the quality of the product. Where manufacturing is expensive, distribution is exclusive, and the product is supported by extensive [[advertising]] and [[promotion (marketing)|promotional campaigns]], then prices are likely to be higher. Price can act as a substitute for product quality, effective promotions, or an energetic selling effort by distributors in certain markets.

From the marketer's point of view, an '''efficient price''' is a price that is very close to the maximum that customers are prepared to pay. In economic terms, it is a price that shifts most of the consumer [[economic surplus]] to the producer. A good pricing strategy would be the one which could balance between the price floor (the price below which the organization ends up in losses) and the price ceiling (the price by which the organization experiences a no-demand situation).

==Pricing strategies==

{{See|Pricing strategies}}
Marketers develop an overall pricing strategy that is consistent with the organisation's mission and values. This pricing strategy typically becomes part of the company's overall long-term [[Marketing strategy|strategic plan]]. The strategy is designed to provide broad guidance for price-setters and ensures that the pricing strategy is consistent with other elements of the marketing plan. While the actual price of goods or services may vary in response to different conditions, the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy) remains a constant for the planning outlook period which is typically 3–5 years, but in some industries may be a longer period of 7–10 years. The pricing strategy established the overall, long-term goals of the pricing function, without specifying an actual price-point. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, T., ''Pricing Strategy: Setting Price Levels, Managing Price Discounts and Establishing Price Structures'', Cengage Learning, 2011, pp 270-272&lt;/ref&gt; 

Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature:

: '''Operations-oriented pricing''': where the objective is to optimise productive capacity, to achieve operational efficiencies or to match supply and demand through varying prices. In some cases, prices might be set to de-market.&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"&gt;Dibb, S., Simkin, L., Pride, W.C. and Ferrell, O.C.,''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies,'' Cengage, 2013, Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Revenue-oriented pricing:''' (also known as ''profit-oriented pricing'' or ''cost-based pricing'') - where the marketer seeks to maximise the profits (i.e., the surplus income over costs) or simply to cover costs and [[Break-even (economics)|break even]].&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"/&gt; For example, dynamic pricing (also known as [[yield management]]) is a form of revenue oriented pricing.

: '''Customer-oriented pricing''': where the objective is to maximise the number of customers; encourage cross-selling opportunities or to recognise different levels in the customer's ability to pay.&lt;ref name="Dibb, S. 2013"/&gt;

: '''[[Value-based pricing]]''': (also known as ''image-based pricing'') occurs where the company uses prices to signal market value or associates price with the desired value position in the mind of the buyer. The aim of value-based pricing is to reinforce the overall positioning strategy e.g. premium pricing posture to pursue or maintain a luxury image.&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, T., Hogan, J. and Zale, J., ''The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 1 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, R., Canning,L. and McDowell, R., ''Business-to-Business Marketing,'' 2nd ed., London, Sage, 2011, p.331&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Relationship-based pricing|'''Relationship-oriented pricing''']]: where the marketer sets prices in order to build or maintain relationships with existing or potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;Neumeier, M.,  
''The Brand Flip: Why customers now run companies and how to profit from it (Voices That Matter),''2008, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

:  '''Socially-oriented pricing''': Where the objective is to encourage or discourage specific social attitudes and behaviours. e.g. high tariffs on tobacco to discourage smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin, G., ''Modern Cost-Benefit Methods,'' Macmillan, 1978, pp 137-160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pricing tactics==

When decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. such as the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed in the course of a single planning period or across a single year. Typically line managers are given the latitude necessary to vary individual prices providing that they operate within the broad strategic approach. For example, some premium brands never offer discounts because the use of low prices may tarnish the brand image. Instead of discounting, premium brands are more likely to offer customer value through price-bundling or give-aways.

When setting individual prices, decision-makers require a solid understanding of pricing economics, notably [[Break-even (economics)|break-even analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, T., Hogan, J. and Zale, J., ''The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, pp 207-243&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an appreciation of the psychological aspects of consumer decision-making including [[reservation price]]s, [[ceiling price]]s and [[Price floor|floor prices]]. The marketing literature identifies literally hundreds of pricing tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Tellis, G., "Beyond the Many Faces of Price: An Integration of Pricing Strategies," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 50, October, 1985, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to do justice to the variety of tactics in widespread use. Rao and Kartono carried out a cross-cultural study to identify the pricing strategies and tactics that are most widely used.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, V.R. and Kartono, B., "Pricing Strategies and Objectives: A Cross-cultural Survey," in ''Handbook of Pricing Research in Marketing,''Rao, V.R. (ed), Northampton, MA, Edward Elgar, 2009, pp 9-36&lt;/ref&gt; The following listing is largely based on their work.

===ARC/RRC Pricing===
A traditional tactic used in outsourcing that uses a fixed fee for a fixed volume of services, with variations on fees for volumes above or below target thresholds. Charges for additional resources (“ARC’s”) above the threshold are priced at rates to reflect the marginal cost of the additional production plus a reasonable profit. Credits (“RRC’s”) granted for reduction in resources consumed or provided offer the enterprise customer some comfort, but the savings on credits tend not to be equivalent to the increased costs when paying for incremental resources in excess of the threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Information Technologies Agency, "Pricing Structure Review" March 2015 {{cite web |url=https://www.vita.virginia.gov/uploadedFiles/VITA_Main_Public/About/ITS/PricingStructureReviewMar2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108193008/https://www.vita.virginia.gov/uploadedFiles/VITA_Main_Public/About/ITS/PricingStructureReviewMar2015.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Outsourcing Law on ARC's and RRC's http://www.outsourcing-law.com/pricing-methodology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complementary Pricing===
[[File:Samsung SPP-2040.jpg|thumb|The purchase of a printer leads to a lifetime of purchases of replacement parts. In such cases, complementary pricing may be considered.]]
Complementary pricing is a collective term used to describe `captive-market' pricing tactics. It refers to a method in which one of two or more complementary products (a deskjet printer, for example) is priced to maximise sales volume, while the complementary product (printer ink cartridges) are priced at a much higher level in order to cover any shortfall sustained by the first product.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, {{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/complementary-products-pricing.html |title=What is complementary products pricing? Definition and meaning |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202013212/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/complementary-products-pricing.html |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contingency Pricing ===
[[Contingent fee|Contingency pricing]] describes the process where a fee is only charged contingent on certain results. Contingency pricing is widely used in professional services such as legal services and consultancy services.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Schlissel, M.R. and Chasin, J., "[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02642069100000046 Pricing of Services: An Interdisciplinary Review]", ''The Service Industries Journal,'' vol.11, no. 3, July, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, a contingency fee is known as a conditional fee.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary,'' 8th ed., 2004, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential pricing ===
Differential pricing, also known as ''flexible pricing'', ''multiple pricing'' or ''price discrimination'' , occurs where different prices  are charged to different customers or market-segments, and may be dependent on the service provider's assessment of the customer's willingness or ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Phlips, L., ''The Economics of Price Discrimination'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; There are various forms of price difference including: the type of customer, the geographic area served, the quantity ordered, delivery time, payment terms, etc.

===Discrete pricing ===
Discrete Pricing occurs when prices are set at a level that the price comes within the competence of the decision making unit (DMU).&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardt, D., "Discrete Pricing and the Design of Dealership Markets," ''Journal of Economic Theory,'' Volume 71, Issue 1, 1996, pp 148-182&lt;/ref&gt; This method of pricing is often used in B2B contexts where the purchasing officer may be authorised to make purchases up to a predetermined level, beyond which decisions must go to a committee for authorisation.

===Discount pricing ===
[[File:Sales promotion 2015 0003.JPG|thumb|A discount is any form of reduction in price]]
Discount pricing is where the marketer or retailer offers a reduced price. Discounts in a variety of forms - e.g. quantity rebates, loyalty rebates, seasonal discounts, periodic or random discounts etc.&lt;ref name="Rao, V.R 2009, p.15"&gt;Rao, V.R. and Kartono, B., "Pricing Strategies and Objectives: A Cross-cultural Survey," in ''Handbook of Pricing Research in Marketing,''Rao, V.R. (ed), Northampton, MA, Edward Elgar, 2009, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversionary pricing ===
Diversionary Pricing is a variation of loss leadering used extensively in services; a low price is charged on a basic service with the intention of recouping on the extras; can also refer to low prices on some parts of the service to develop an image of low price.

===Everyday low prices (EDLP)===
[[File:EDLP 2.JPG|thumb|right|"Everyday Low Prices" are widely used in supermarkets]]
[[Everyday low price]]s refers to the practice of maintaining a regular low price-low price - in which consumers are not forced to wait for discounting or specials. This method is used by supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch, S.J., Dreze, X. and Purk, M., "EDLP, Hi-Lo, and Margin Arithmetic",''The Journal of Marketing,'' Volume 58, Number 4, 1994, pp 16-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exit fees ===
Exit Fees refer to a fee charged for customers who depart from the service process prior to natural completion. The objective of exit fees is to deter premature exit.&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia, [Definition], {{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exit_fee.asp |title=Exit Fee |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202013205/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exit_fee.asp |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= |date=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exit fees are often found in financial services, telecommunications services and aged care facilities. Regulatory authorities, around the globe, have often expressed their discontent with the practice of exit fees as it has the potential to be anti-competitive and restricts consumers' abilities to switch freely, but the practice has not been proscribed.&lt;ref&gt;D'Aloisio, T., [Chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission], "Rules on exit fees are clear", Speech given in November, 2010 and also published in the ''Herald-Sun',' 19 November 2010, &lt;Online: {{cite web |url=http://asic.gov.au/about-asic/media-centre/speeches/rules-on-exit-fees-are-clear |title=Rules on exit fees are clear |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202013140/http://asic.gov.au/about-asic/media-centre/speeches/rules-on-exit-fees-are-clear |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience curve pricing===
Experience curve pricing occurs when a manufacturer prices a product or service at a low rate in order to obtain volume and with the expectation that the cost of production will decrease with the acquisition of manufacturing experience. This approach which is often used in the pricing of high technology products and services, is based on the insight that manufacturers learn to trim production costs over time in a phenomenon known as [[Experience curve effects|experience effects]].&lt;ref name="Rao, V.R 2009, p.15"/&gt;

===Geographic pricing ===
: See also [[Big Mac Index]]

[[Geographical pricing|Geographic pricing]] occurs when different prices are charged in different geographic markets for an identical product.&lt;ref name="Rao, V.R 2009, p.15"/&gt; For example, publishers often make text-books available at lower prices in Asian countries because average wages tend to be lower with implications for the customer's ability to pay. In other cases, geographic variations in prices may reflect the different costs of distribution and servicing certain markets. &lt;ref&gt;Phlips, L., ''The Economics of Price Discrimination'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guaranteed pricing ===
Guaranteed pricing is a variant of contingency pricing. It refers to the practice of including an undertaking or promise that certain results or outcomes will be achieved.  For instance, some business consultants undertake to improve productivity or profitability by 10%. In the event that the result is not achieved, the client does not pay for the service.&lt;ref&gt;Schlissel, M.R. and Chasin, J., "[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02642069100000046 Pricing of Services: An Interdisciplinary Review]," ''The Service Industries Journal,'' vol.11, no. 3, July, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High-low pricing===
High-low pricing refers to the practice of offering goods at a high price for a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend to become aware of the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch, S.J., Dreze, X. and Purk, M. E., "EDLP, Hi-Lo, and Margin Arithmetic",''The Journal of Marketing,'' Volume 58, Number 4, 1994, pp 16-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, P., "Deception in retailer high-low pricing: A 'rule of reason' approach," ''Journal of Retailing, '' Volume 70, Issue 2, 1994, pp 115–1383.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honeymoon pricing  ===
Honeymoon Pricing refers to the practice of using a low introductory price with subsequent price increases once relationship is established. The objective of honeymoon pricing is to "lock" customers into a long-term association with the vendor. This approach is widely used in situations where customer [[Switching barriers|switching costs]] are relatively high such as in home loans and financial investsments.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, P., "Be alert and informed and you may pay less," The Age [newspaper], 16 January 2013, &lt;Online: {{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/be-alert-and-informed-and-you-may-pay-less-20130115-2crip |title=Be alert and informed and you may pay less |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202221608/http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/be-alert-and-informed-and-you-may-pay-less-20130115-2crip |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= |date=2013-01-15 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common in categories where a subscription model is used, especially if this is coupled with automatic regular payments, such as in newspaper and magazine subscriptions, cable TV, broadband and cell phone subscriptions and in utilities and insurance.

===Loss leader===
A [[loss leader]] is a product that has a price set below the [[operating margin]]. Loss leadering is widely used in supermarkets and  budget-priced retail outlets where the store as a means of generating store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leadering may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders. Loss leadering is often found in retail, where the loss leader is used to drive store traffic and generate sales of complementary items. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, T., ''Pricing Strategy: Setting Price Levels, Managing Price Discounts and Establishing Price Structures'', Cengage Learning, 2011, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offset pricing===
Offset pricing (also known as ''diversionary pricing'') is the service industry's equivalent of loss leadering. A service may price one component of the offer at a very low price with an expectation that it can recoup any losses by cross-selling additional services. For example, a carpet steam cleaning service may charge a very low basic price for the first three rooms, but charges higher prices for additional rooms, furniture and curtain cleaning. The operator may also try to cross-sell the client on additional services such as spot-cleaning products, or stain-resistant treatments for fabrics and carpets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Parity pricing===
[[Parity pricing (disambiguation)|Parity pricing]] refers to the process of pricing a product at or near a rival's price in order to remain competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, V.R., ''Handbook of Pricing Research in Marketing'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2009, pp 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price bundling===
[[File:Xbox 360 FF XIII Special Ed. bundle price tag at Target, Tanforan.JPG|thumb|Xbox price bundle price]]
Price bundling (also known as [[product bundling]]) occurs where  two or more products or services are priced as a package with a single price. There are several types of bundles: ''pure bundles'' where the goods can only be purchased as package or ''mixed bundles'' where the goods can be purchased individually or as a package. The prices of the bundle is typically less than when the two items are purchased separately.&lt;ref&gt;Guiltnan, J.P., "The Price Bundling of Services," ''Journal of Marketing,'' April, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak and off-peak pricing===
Peak and off-peak pricing is a form of price discrimination where the price variation is due to some type of seasonal factor. The objective of peak and off peak pricing is to use prices to even out peaks and troughs in demand. Peak and off-peak pricing is widely used in tourism, travel and also in utilities such as electricity providers. Peak pricing has caught the public's imagination since the ride-sharing service provider, Uber, commenced using ''surge pricing'' and has sought to patent the technologies that support this approach.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://time.com/3642714/uber-surge-pricing-patent/ Uber Is Trying to Patent Its Surge Pricing Technology]," ''Time,'' 19 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price discrimination===
Price discrimination is also known as [[variable pricing]] or ''[[Pricing#Differential pricing|differential pricing]]''.

===Price lining===
''Price lining'' is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a tradition started in the old [[five and dime]] stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable [[price points]] for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of [[inflation]] or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate racks of men's ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40.

===Penetration pricing ===
[[Penetration pricing]] is an approach that can be considered at the time of market entry. In this approach, the price of a product is initially set low in an effort to penetrate the market quickly. Low prices and low margins also act as a deterrent, preventing potential rivals from entering the market since they would have to undercut the low margins to gain a foothold.&lt;ref name="Dean, J. pp 141"&gt;Dean, J., "Pricing Policies for New Products," ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol 54, No. 6, pp 141–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prestige pricing===
[[File:Absolut Vodka DSC 4631.jpg|thumb|Premium brands rarely discount due to the potential to tarnish the brand. Instead they offer gift packs to provide customers with value]]

Prestige pricing is also known as ''[[premium pricing]]'' and occasionally ''luxury pricing'' or ''high price maintenance'' refers to the deliberate pursuit of a high price posture to create an image of quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W. and Ferrell, O.C., ''Marketing'', Mason, OH, Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 596&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price signalling  ===
Price signalling is where the price is used as  an indicator of some other attribute. For example, some travel resorts promote that when two adults make a booking, the kids stay for free. This type of pricing is designed to signal that the resort is a family friendly operation.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, V.R. and Kartono, B., "Pricing Strategies and Objectives: A Cross-cultural Survey," in ''Handbook of Pricing Research in Marketing,''Rao, V.R. (ed), Northampton, MA, Edward Elgar, 2009, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Price skimming ===
[[Price skimming]], also known as ''skim-the-cream pricing'' is a tactic that might be considered at market entry. The objective is to charge relatively high prices in order to recoup the cost of product development early in the life-cycle and before competitors enter the market.&lt;ref name="Dean, J. pp 141"/&gt;

===Promotional pricing===
Promotional pricing is a temporary measure that involves setting prices at levels lower than normally charged for a good or service. Promotional pricing is sometimes a reaction to unforeseen circumstances, as when a downturn in demand leaves a company with excess stocks; or when competitive activity is making inroads into market share or profits.&lt;ref&gt;Livesay, F., ''Promotional Pricing,'' Macmillan, 1976, pp 77-82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-part pricing ===
[[Two-part tariff|Two-part pricing]] is a variant of captive-market pricing used in service industries. Two part pricing breaks the actual price into two parts; a fixed service fee plus a variable consumption rate. Two- part pricing tactics are widely used by utility companies such as electricity, gas and water and services  where there is a quasi- membership type relationship, credit cards where an annual fee is charged and theme parks where an entrance fee is charged for admission while the customer pays for rides and extras.  One part of the price represents a membership fee or joining fee, while the second part represents the usage component.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, B., "[http://ksmb55a.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/601.pdf Competition and Two-Part Tariffs]," ''Journal of Business,'' Vol. 60, no. 1, 1987, pp 41–54. doi:10.1086/296384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological pricing===
[[File:Fan-Tankstelle von Dynamo Dresden.JPG|thumb|Extensive use of the terminal digit 'nine' suggests that psychological pricing is at play]]
{{main article|Psychological pricing}}
Psychological pricing is a range of tactics designed to have a positive psychological impact. Price tags using the terminal digit "9", ($9.99, $19.99 or $199.99) can be used to signal [[price point]]s and bring an item in at just under the consumer's [[reservation price]]. Psychological pricing is widely used in a variety of retail settings.&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, W., ''Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It),'' NY, Hill and Wang, 2011, pp 184-200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premium pricing===
''[[Premium pricing]]'' (also called prestige pricing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://inevitablesteps.com/marketing/prestige-pricing/ |title=Prestige Pricing: Pros &amp; Cons and Examples |date=March 15, 2016 |publisher=Inevitable Steps |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323003320/https://inevitablesteps.com/marketing/prestige-pricing/ |archivedate=March 23, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the strategy of consistently pricing at, or near, the high end of the possible price range to help attract status-conscious consumers. The high pricing of a premium product is used to enhance and reinforce a product's luxury image. Examples of companies which partake in premium pricing in the marketplace include [[Rolex]] and [[Bentley]]. As well as brand, product attributes such as eco-labelling and provenance (e.g. 'certified organic' and 'product of Australia') may add value for consumers&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John, 2009, [http://orgprints.org/16980/1/16980.pdf The Value of Eco-Labelling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930065908/http://orgprints.org/16980/1/16980.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}, VDM Verlag, {{ISBN|3-639-15495-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attract premium pricing. A component of such premiums may reflect the increased cost of production. People will buy a premium priced product because:
* They believe the high price is an indication of good quality
* They believe it to be a sign of self-worth - "They are worth it;" it authenticates the buyer's success and status; it is a signal to others that the owner is a member of an exclusive group
* They require flawless performance in this application - The cost of product malfunction is too high to buy anything but the best - for example, a heart pacemaker.
The old association of luxury only being for the kings and queens of the world is almost non-existent in today’s world. People have generally become wealthier, therefore the mass marketing phenomenon of luxury has simply become a part of everyday life, and no longer reserved for the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yeoman | first1 = I | year = 2011 | title = The changing behaviours of luxury consumption | url = | journal = Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 47–50 | doi = 10.1057/rpm.2010.43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since consumers have a larger source of disposable income, they now have the power to purchase products that meet their aspirational needs. This phenomenon enables premium pricing opportunities for marketers in luxury markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yeoman | first1 = I | last2 = McMahon-Beattie | first2 = Una | year = 2005 | title = Luxury markets and premium pricing | url = | journal = Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 319–328 | doi = 10.1057/palgrave.rpm.5170155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxurification in society can be seen when middle class members of society, are willing to pay premium prices for a service or product of the highest quality when compared with similar goods. Examples of this can be seen with items such as clothing and electronics. Charging a premium price for a product also makes it more inaccessible and helps it gain an exclusive appeal. Luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci are more than just clothing and become more of a status symbol. (Yeoman, 2011).

Prestige goods are usually sold by companies that have a monopoly on the market and hold competitive advantage. Due to a firm having great market power they are able to charge at a premium for goods, and are able to spend a larger sum on promotion and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kumcu | first1 = E. | last2 = McClure | year = 2003 | title = Explaining Prestige Pricing: An Alternative to Back-Bending  Demand | url = | journal = Marketing Education Review | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 49–57 | doi = 10.1080/10528008.2003.11488811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Han, Nunes and Dreze (2015) figure on “signal preference and taxonomy based on wealth and need for status” two social groups known as “Parvenus” and “Poseurs” are individuals generally more self-conscious, and base purchases on a need to reach a higher status or gain a social prestige value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Han | first1 = Y. | last2 = Nunes | first2 = J. | last3 = Drèze | first3 = X. | year = 2010 | title = Signaling Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 74 | issue = 4| pages = 15–30 | doi = 10.1509/jmkg.74.4.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further market research shows the role of possessions in consumer’s lives and how people make assumptions about others solely based on their possessions. People associate high priced items with success. (Han et al., 2010). Marketers understand this concept, and price items at a premium to create the illusion of exclusivity and high quality. Consumers are likely to purchase a product at a higher price than a similar product as they crave the status, and feeling of superiority as being part of a minority that can in fact afford the said product. (Han et al., 2010).

A price premium can also be charged to consumers when purchasing eco-labelled products. Market based incentives are given in order to encourage people to practice their business in an eco-friendly way in regard to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roheim | first1 = C. | last2 = Asche | first2 = F. | last3 = Santos | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = The Elusive Price Premium for Ecolabelled Products:  Evidence from Seafood in the UK Market | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural Economics | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 655–668 | doi = 10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00299.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Associations such as the MSC’s fishery certification programme and seafood ecolabel reward those who practice sustainable fishing. Pressure from environmental groups have caused the implementation of Associations such as these, rather than consumers demanding it. The value consumer’s gain from purchasing environmentally conscious products may create a premium price over non eco-labelled products. This means that producers have some sort of incentive for suppling goods worthy of eco-labelling standard. Usually more costs are incurred when practicing sustainable business, and charging at a premium is a way businesses can recover extra costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Erdogan|last1=Kumcu|last2=McClure|first2=James E.|date=2003-03-01|title=Explaining Prestige Pricing: An Alternative to Back-Bending Demand|journal=Marketing Education Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1080/10528008.2003.11488811|issn=1052-8008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of setting prices==

===Demand-based pricing===
''Demand-based pricing'', also known as [[dynamic pricing]], is a pricing method that uses consumer demand - based on perceived value - as the central element. These include [[price skimming]], [[price discrimination]] and [[yield management]], [[price points]], [[psychological pricing]], [[product bundling|bundle pricing]], [[penetration pricing]], price lining, [[value-based pricing]], [[Geo (marketing)|geo]] and premium pricing.

Pricing factors are manufacturing cost, market place, competition, market condition, quality of product.

Price modeling using econometric techniques can help measure [[price elasticity]], and computer based modeling tools will often facilitate simulations of different prices and the outcome on sales and profit. More sophisticated tools help determine price at the SKU level across a portfolio of products. Retailers will optimize the price of their [[private label]] SKUs with those of National Brands.

Uber's pricing policy is an example of demand-based [[dynamic pricing]]. It uses an automated [[algorithm]] to increase prices to "surge price" levels, responding rapidly to changes of [[supply and demand]] in the market. By responding in realtime, an equilibrium between demand and supply of drivers can be approached.&lt;ref name="kelly2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=David |title=That time Uber almost charged me $1,099 for a Boston-to-Cambridge trip |date=April 24, 2014 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2014/04/my-1-099-uber-trip-from-boston-to-cambridge.html |work=[[Boston Business Journal]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425130728/http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2014/04/my-1-099-uber-trip-from-boston-to-cambridge.html |archivedate=April 25, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers receive notice when making an Uber reservation that prices have increased.&lt;ref name="kelly2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lockergnome.com/social/2011/10/27/is-uber-really-a-good-alternative-to-taxis/ |title=Is Uber Really a Good Alternative to Taxis? |publisher=Lockergnome |work=LockerGnome |date=October 27, 2011 |author=Clay, Kelly |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102160727/http://www.lockergnome.com/social/2011/10/27/is-uber-really-a-good-alternative-to-taxis/ |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company applied for a [[U.S. patent]] on surge pricing in 2013, though airlines are known to have been using similar techniques in seat pricing for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-18/uber-seeks-to-patent-pricing-surges-that-critics-call-gouging.html|title=Uber Seeks to Patent Pricing Surges That Critics Call Gouging|date=December 19, 2014|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129092406/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-18/uber-seeks-to-patent-pricing-surges-that-critics-call-gouging.html/|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3642714/uber-surge-pricing-patent/|title=Uber Is Trying to Patent Its Surge Pricing Technology|date=December 19, 2014|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221202824/http://time.com/3642714/uber-surge-pricing-patent/|archivedate=December 21, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multidimensional pricing===
''Multidimensional pricing'' is the pricing of a product or service using multiple numbers. In this practice, price no longer consists of a single monetary amount (e.g., sticker price of a car), but rather consists of various dimensions (e.g., monthly payments, number of payments, and a downpayment). Research has shown that this practice can significantly influence consumers' ability to understand and process price information.&lt;ref&gt;Estelami, H: "Consumer Perceptions of Multi-Dimensional Prices", Advances in Consumer Research, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micromarketing===
[[Micromarketing]] is the practice of tailoring products, brands ([[microbrands]]), and promotions to meet the needs and wants of [[microsegments]] within a market. It is a type of market customization that deals with pricing of customer/product combinations at the store or individual level.

===Price/quality relationship===
The ''price/quality relationship'' comprises consumers' perceptions of value. High prices are often taken as a sign of quality, especially when the product or service lacks search qualities that can be inspected prior to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V., "Consumer Perceptions of Price, Quality and Value," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 52, July, 1988, pp 2-22&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding consumers’ perceptions of the price/quality relationship is most important in the case of complex products that are hard to test, and experiential products that cannot be tested until used (such as most services). The greater the uncertainty surrounding a product, the more consumers depend on the price/quality signal and the greater premium they may be prepared to pay.

Consumers can have different perceptions on premium pricing, and this factor makes it important for the marketer to understand consumer behaviour. According to Vigneron and Johnson’s figure on “Prestige-Seeking Consumer Behaviours”, Consumers can be categorised into four groups. These groups being; Hedonist &amp; Perfectionist, snob, bandwagon and veblenian. &lt;ref name="Vigneron, F. 1999 pp. 1-17"&gt;Vigneron, F., &amp; Johnson, W., L. (1999). Interpersonal effects. ''A Review and a Conceptual Framework Of Prestige-Seeking Consumer Behavior,'' pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt; These categories rank from level of self-consciousness, to importance of price as an indicator of prestige. The Veblen Effect explains how this group of consumers makes purchase decisions based on conspicuous value, as they tend to purchase publicly consumed luxury products. This shows they are likely to make the purchase to show power, status and wealth. &lt;ref&gt;Vigneron, F., &amp; Johnson, W., L.W., "A Review and a Conceptual Framework Of Prestige-Seeking Consumer Behavior," ''Academy  of  Marketing  Science  Review,'' No. 1, 1999,  pp 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consumers that fall under the “Snob Effect” can be described as individuals that search for perceived unique value, and will purchase exclusive products in order to be the first or very few who has it. They will also avoid purchasing products consumed by a general mass of people, as it is perceived that items in limited supply hold a higher value than items that do not. (Vigneron &amp; Johnson, 1999). The bandwagon effect explains that consumers that fit into this category make purchasing decisions to fit into a social group, and gain a perceived social value out of purchasing popular products within said social group at premium prices. Research shows that people will often conform to what the majority of the group they are a member of thinks when it comes to the attitude of a product. Paying a premium price for a product can act as a way of gaining acceptance, due to the pressure placed on them by their peers. The Hedonic effect can be described as a certain group of people whose purchasing decisions are not affected by the status and exclusivity gained by purchasing a product at a premium, nor susceptible to the fear of being left out and peer pressure. Consumers who fit into this category base their purchasing decisions on a perceived emotional value, and gain intangible benefits such as sensory pleasure, aesthetic beauty and excitement. Consumers of this type have a higher interest on their own wellbeing. (Vigneron &amp; Johnson, 1999). The last category on Vigneron and Johnson’s figure of “Prestige-Seeking Consumer Behaviours” is the perfectionism effect. Prestige brands are expected to show high quality, and it’s this reassurance of the highest quality that can actually enhance the value of the product. According to this effect, those that fit into this group value the prestige’s brands to have a superior quality and higher performance than other similar brands. Research has indicated that consumer’s perceive quality of a product to be relational to its price. Consumers often believe a high price of a product indicates a higher level of quality.

Even though it is suggested that high prices seem to make certain products more desirable, consumers that fall in this category have their own perception of quality and make decisions based upon their own judgement. &lt;ref name="Vigneron, F. 1999 pp. 1-17"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco-Villanueva, M. A., [http://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/econo/article/view/14336 El Efecto “Pricebo”: Cómo los precios pueden influenciar la percepción sobre la calidad del cannabis y sus implicaciones en las políticas de precios"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307215819/http://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/econo/article/view/14336 |date=2018-03-07 }}, ''Pensamiento Crítico,'' vol. 22, n. 2, pp 175-210&lt;/ref&gt; They may also use the premium price as an indicator of the product’s level of quality.

===Price sensitivity and consumer psychology===
{{Main|Price elasticity of demand}}
In their book, ''The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing'', Thomas Nagle and Reed Holden outline nine laws or factors that influence how a consumer perceives a given price and how price-sensitive s/he is likely to be with respect to different purchase decisions:
&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, Thomas and Holden, Reed, ''The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing,'' Prentice Hall, 2002, pp 84-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mind of Marketing,'' [http://mindofmarketing.net/2008/10/your-pricing-should-be-influenced-by-your-customers-reference-point/ "How your pricing and marketing strategy should be influenced by your customer's reference point"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311040410/http://www.mindofmarketing.net/2008/10/your-pricing-should-be-influenced-by-your-customers-reference-point/ |date=2015-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reference price effect''': Buyer’s price sensitivity for a given product increases the higher the product’s price relative to perceived alternatives.  Perceived alternatives can vary by buyer segment, by occasion, and other factors.
* '''Difficult comparison effect''' Buyers are less sensitive to the price of a known / more reputable product when they have difficulty comparing it to potential alternatives.
* '''Switching costs effect''': The higher the product-specific investment a buyer must make to switch suppliers, the less price sensitive that buyer is when choosing between alternatives.
* '''Price-quality effect''': Buyers are less sensitive to price the more that higher prices signal higher quality. Products for which this effect is particularly relevant include: image products, exclusive products, and products with minimal cues for quality.
* '''Expenditure effect''': Buyers are more price sensitive when the expense accounts for a large percentage of buyers’ available income or budget.
* '''End-benefit effect''': The effect refers to the relationship a given purchase has to a larger overall benefit, and is divided into two parts:
*:'''Derived demand''': The more sensitive buyers are to the price of the end benefit, the more sensitive they will be to the prices of those products that contribute to that benefit. 
*:'''Price proportion cost''': The price proportion cost refers to the percent of the total cost of the end benefit accounted for by a given component that helps to produce the end benefit (e.g., think CPU and PCs). The smaller the given components share of the total cost of the end benefit, the less sensitive buyers will be to the component's price.
* '''Shared-cost effect''': The smaller the portion of the purchase price buyers must pay for themselves, the less price sensitive they will be.
* '''Fairness effect''': Buyers are more sensitive to the price of a product when the price is outside the range they perceive as “fair” or “reasonable” given the purchase context.
* '''Framing effect''': Buyers are more price sensitive when they perceive the price as a loss rather than a forgone gain, and they have greater price sensitivity when the price is paid separately rather than as part of a bundle.

Pricing can be approached at three levels: the industry, market, and transaction level.

* Pricing at the industry level focuses on the overall economics of the industry, including supplier price changes and customer demand changes.
* Pricing at the market level focuses on the competitive position of the price in comparison to the value differential of the product to that of comparative competing products.
* Pricing at the transaction level focuses on managing the implementation of discounts away from the reference, or list price, which occur both on and off the invoice or receipt.

A "price waterfall" analysis helps businesses and sales personnel to understand the differences which arise between the reference or list price, the invoiced sale price and the actual price paid by a customer taking account of contract, sales and payment discounts.&lt;ref&gt;Erasso, A. and Linnenkamp, M., [http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/pdf/bfab692e311c177c63b51d514374bcd9.pdf "Beyond the Price Waterfall"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020150530/http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/pdf/bfab692e311c177c63b51d514374bcd9.pdf |date=2016-10-20 }}, Sales Management Association, 2012, accessed 28 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Propane refrigeration''' is a type of [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|compression refrigeration]]. Propane (R290) has been used successfully in industrial refrigeration for many years, and is emerging as an increasingly viable alternative for homes and businesses. Propane's operating pressures and temperatures are well suited for use in air conditioning equipment, but because of propane’s flammability, great care is required in the manufacture, installation and servicing of equipment that uses it as a refrigerant.

Propane that is supplied for general use – such as in barbeques and patio heaters – is not suitable for use in refrigeration systems because it can contain high levels of contaminants, including moisture and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Only propane produced specifically for use in refrigeration systems – with a purity of at least 98.5% and moisture content below 10ppm (by weight) – should be used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cibsejournal.com/cpd/modules/2016-09-fgas/ ICIBSE Journal Propane as a refrigerant for use in chillers for air conditioning applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

With a global warming potential (GWP) of 3 and an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0, R-290 is of very little threat to the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has listed R-290 as an acceptable refrigerant substitute under its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP), and recently exempted it from the venting prohibition in Section 608 of the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/snap/substitutes-household-refrigerators-and-freezers United States Environmental Protection Agency, Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP), Substitutes in Household Refrigerators and Freezers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Public relations]]''', despite being over a century old across the world, began in [[India]] in the early 1990s. Though there were several individuals and small companies which started even before that, they offered PR with the limited scope of media relations only. It was only natural that the entrepreneurs who began these services came from a background of journalism, seen as a natural hunting ground for the nascent PR industry.

==Agencies that started in India in the 1990s==

India came with many advantages in the context of PR - it showed a consistently high growth rate of the economy; the initial penetration of PR had been low leaving much scope for growth, the internet &amp; traditional media also penetrated exponentially giving rise to the quick rise of PR in India. Though some international PR agencies (usually offshoots of advertising agencies) like [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather|Ogilvy PR]] set base in India in the mid-1980s, they floundered to find a firm footing especially since their core focus remained mainly in advertising services. By the early 1990s, after the opening up of the Indian economy, several other PR agencies started with a core focus on PR alone like Lexicon PR in 1996. This decade also saw the advent of Indian IPO agencies offshoots like Ad factors PR began to offer PR services as a freebee along with their IPO services. These recent past b2p relations has been emerging as a best PR practice in Chennai. And media monitoring across South India is now made possible through b2p relations.

==Agencies that started in India in the 2000s==

If the 90s were the starting block for the Indian PR sector, the next decade was the growth era. Significant in this time was the full buyout of Genesis by [[Burson Marsteller]], and the investment in [Hanmer &amp; Partners]&lt;ref&gt;http://hanmermsl.com/&lt;/ref&gt; by MS&amp;L, a Publicis company. [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]] entered India with by taking over Roger Periera, the grand old man of PR. In 2002, specialist agencies like Blue Lotus Communications took birth with a focus on specialized sectors like Healthcare, Technology, Finance and Brands. With the decade almost coming to a close, 2008 saw the birth of i9 Communications,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i9c.in&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialist in consumer communication, with special focus on Brands, Lifestyle, Entertainment and Hospitality PR. Several such boutique agencies also started in other parts of the country.

After the [[economic slowdown]] and the resultant market crashes worldwide, several international PR agencies suffered enormous losses when clients cut back marketing budgets. This forced these agencies to turn to higher growth markets like [[India]] and [[China]]. India naturally took a higher priority due to its large English-speaking base, stable political governance and consistent legal structure. The color of the market has flowered from grey to blue in this decade and the corporate's need for [[image building]] and strategic PR is very well understood and accepted.

According to the 2007 report on The State of the Public Relations Industry &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huntsworth.co.uk/docs/Paul%20Holmes%20Report%20-%20The%20State%20of%20the%20PR%20Industry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; prepared by Paul Holmes (author of the Holmes Report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holmesreport.com&lt;/ref&gt;), the western growth of PR has almost plateaued to a stable range of 9% to 11%, with the growth geographies being India (as too China) growing at four times the Western pace. To quote the report, "The greatest future in growth is expected to come in China and India, with good prospects for growth in Eastern Europe (particularly those countries recently admitted to the European Union) and in the Middle East (albeit from a very small base)". However, in 2012, the PR market has slowed down due to the overcrowding of the market.
The recession of 2008 &amp;2009 gave birth to another terminology in India -Regional PR and the companies who were once upon a time hooked to pink papers, looking for presence in regional dailies. Regional Public Relations set up country's first such agency where core focus was on Tier-II &amp; Tier-III cities.   
Naturally then, India and similar paced economies have become favored destinations for global PR firms keen to extract their share of growth from this market. The late realization by many global majors that India has an equal or superior potential than China, has left quite a few panting in the race for market-share. However, in 2012, the PR market has slowed down due to the overcrowding of the market with too many fighting for too few.
year 2009 again witness the rising of this industry but more over in tier II markets. Some regional specialist came up very fast to serve the vast PR business in secondary markets. Regional Public Relations was first such PR agency who rolled down from tier-II market only.

Sparkling Stories, a well known Pune based PR agency was also founded in this decade and in small time it took a giant step in the movies and consumer products area.

The first Public Relations agency of North East India, Cabsford PR, was set up in 2002 by Nurul Islam Laskar, former Chief Manager (PR &amp; Community Services Banking) State Bank of India. [[Life's Purple]] is now among one of the big agencies operating from [[Guwahati]], working across [[Northeast India]].

Now PR has started touching the boundaries of advertising &amp; marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/302496|title=The Changing Horizons of PR Industry|last=|first=|date=2017-10-11|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2016, digital consulting company #ARM Worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armworldwide.com/service/pr/|title=PR Consulting Firm|last=|first=|date=|website=armworldwide.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; started their dedicated PR unit and within a year emerged as an organisation for executing most creative PR stunt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketing-interactive.com/pr-awards/sea-2017/winners/|title=Winners {{!}} PR Awards 2017 Southeast Asia|website=www.marketing-interactive.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from getting various accolades from reputed organisation like IPRCA 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.exchange4media.com/Marketing/Adfactors-PR-Value360-Communications-Godrej-big-winners-at-IPRCCA-2016_67026.html|title=Adfactors PR, Value360 Communications, Godrej big winners at IPRCCA 2016|work=Indian Advertising Media &amp; Marketing News – exchange4media|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulcrum Awards 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fulcrumawards.com/winners-2017|title=Winners 2017|last=fluid-digital.com|website=www.fulcrumawards.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; IAMAI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iamaiida.in/lastYearWinners.php|title=IAMAI - India Digital Awards|website=www.iamaiida.in|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a list of top PR agency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-top-PR-agency-in-India/answer/Honey-Singh|title=Details about Top PR agency in India|last=|first=|date=|website=Quora|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which started in 2000s, APCO Worldwide India, Concept, H+K Strategies India, Golinopinion, Cohn &amp; Wolfe Six Degrees, Communincate India, PR Pundit, Aim High Consulting, Madison Public Relations, Integral are few of them.

==PR Crisis in India and its mitigation==

On January 7, 2009, Ramalinga Raju, the erstwhile chairman of Satyam Ltd., India's leading IT firm, made an admission of conscious fraud &amp; misreporting perpetrated by him over several years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livemint.com/2009/01/08205554/Nuts-and-bolts-of-Satyam-saga.html&lt;/ref&gt; The media who had eulogized him till then, suddenly turned on him with a vengeance, conscious that they had also failed in their duty as watchdogs of businesses. This crisis, coincided with the peak of the global crisis and held the potential to snowball into a credibility &amp; trust issue for brand India and its IT firms, where several billion dollars worth of services were being outsourced every year. The crisis also impacted several companies associated with Satyam including EMRI (Emergency Medical Response Insititute &lt;ref&gt;http://www.emri.in&lt;/ref&gt;), a not-for-profit endeavour (for running free ambulance services) in which Satyam had committed 5% of running costs with the balance 95% coming from various state governments.

However, the Indian government took quick action and set up an interim board consisting of industry stalwarts for the company to assess the true worth of Satyam and to seek a suitable investor &amp; management.The swiftly conducted and fiercely contested bid was won by Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Satyam was merged with a group IT company.

== Crisis in the Indian PR industry ==

After the global slowdown that hit Indian Public relation agencies in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/global-crisis-hits-indian-pr-industry/51181/on&lt;/ref&gt; it took a further hit in November 2010 due to what has come to be known as the 'Radiagate' scam. Open Magazine in an exposé, covered the story of Niira Radia's nefarious power-dealings. An Income Tax phone tap collected more than 5000 tapes and hundreds of these tapes were leaked and found their way into Outlook magazine's website. The [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) interrogated Radia several times and as a fallout of the tapes, the Telecom minister, A. Raja, with whom Radia had close links was also forced to resign.  Several prominent journalists like Barkha Dutt and Vir Sanghvi were also in the middle of the quagmire, caught in power-lobbying conversations with Radia.

== Growth of Public Relations in India==

With several initiatives and boost support taking into account the rise in Digital Innovation many Indian PR Agencies started expanding their viewpoint via integrating more expertise with respect to Image Management needs of Indian Corporations seeking PR Support. The Assocham report released in March 2010 shows the growth of the PR industry in India to grow to US$6 billion by end of 2010 with a CAGR of approximately 32%. The study reports the biggest challenges of the PR industry to be the following: 
* Lure of better pay: Skilled manpower is scarce, professionals will be poached for higher salaries.
* Leadership crisis: Not too many established players, presenting a crisis of leadership in middle &amp; smaller firms, which makes people move to larger, more reputed PR agencies.
* Lack of understanding of PR: Most people, even from sibling professions, don’t understand PR.
* Perception issues: Many stakeholders, including media and corporate organizations, consider PR to be similar to that of a spin job.

Considering this, for this fledgling, but fast growing sector to flourish, the need of academic rigor and theoretical pedagogy is essential

'''Reunion Tower''' is a {{convert|561|ft|abbr=on}} [[observation tower]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. Located at 300 Reunion Boulevard in the [[Reunion District, Dallas|Reunion district]] of [[downtown Dallas]], the tower is part of the Hyatt Regency Hotel complex, and is the city's 15th tallest building. A free-standing structure until the construction of an addition to the [[Hyatt Regency Dallas]] in 1998, the tower was designed by architectural firm [[Welton Becket &amp; Associates]].

==History==
Reunion Tower, also known locally as "The Ball,"  was completed on February 2, 1978, along with the Hyatt Regency Dallas at Reunion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallasregency.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html Hyatt Regency Dallas at Reunion]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an [[urban renewal|urban redevelopment]] project that also renovated the historic [[Union Station (Dallas)|Union Station]], which today services [[Amtrak]], [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]], and the [[Trinity Railway Express]] to [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]].

When it first opened, the tower included radio station [[KOAX-FM]], now [[KRLD-FM|KRLD-FM 105.3&amp;nbsp;FM]], once owned by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] ("Live twenty-four hours a day from five-hundred feet above the city"). Because it is not used as a [[broadcast tower]] it is not listed in the [[Federal Communications Commission#FCC broadcasting tower database|FCC Database]].

Reunion Tower reopened its restaurant level on February 9, 2009, after it was closed for major renovations on November 16, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Hyatt’s Reunion Tower and Union Station Receive Complete Transformation | url=http://www.hyatt.com/hyatt/images/hotels/dfwrd/HyattRTUSrenovation07.pdf |format=PDF | publisher=Hyatt Regency Dallas and Woodbine Development Corporation | date=17 September 2007 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observation deck reopened October 5, 2013, just in time for the Tower's 35th anniversary.

The tower is located about 1,000 feet from [[Dealey Plaza]] and the site of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Reunion tower dallas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Reunion Tower rising over the [[Hyatt Regency Dallas]].]]
The tower contains three floors with circular floor plans on top of four shafts of poured-in-place concrete. A central cylindrical shaft houses both stairs and mechanical equipment. Three rectangular shafts, featuring elevators, rise parallel to the central shaft. Each shaft's outfacing wall is made up of glass panels, providing tourists views of the city during the 68-second elevator ride to the top.  Before renovations in 2008, the first level housed the observation deck, the second a [[revolving restaurant]] called ''Antares'', and the third level a club called ''The Dome''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Reunion Tower |url=http://www.dallassky.com/bldg15.htm |publisher=Dallas Skyscrapers |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204005039/http://dallassky.com/bldg15.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The top three floors are encased in an open-air sphere, which is a [[geodesic dome]] formed with aluminum struts. Every one of the struts' 260 intersections is covered by aluminum circles with lights in the center.

At night, the globe at the building's top is illuminated with 259 custom LED fixtures, manufactured by Altman Lighting and [[Philips|Color Kinetics]], a division of [[Philips]] Solid State Lighting. [http://wiedamark.com Wiedamark], a Dallas-based LED lighting company, led the development, installation and programming of the lights. The original lighting fixtures were conventional incandescent and every unit used 130 watts of electricity. Similarly, the new LED lighting system with all of its color and animation capabilities requires less than 1/5 of the electricity of the old system. Each point on the Reunion Tower is, in fact, using as much electricity as an average nightlight and as much 2 nightlights at its brightest setting.

[[File:Reunion Tower Light Fixture Front.jpg|thumb|Front view of a single RGB LED lighting fixture from Reunion Tower in Dallas, TX. Courtesy of Wiedamark.]]
Every fixture has a collaboration of several red, green and blue ([[RGB color model|RGB]]) LED lights that are diffused behind a 3/4-inch thick opaque glass cover. While each fixture is very large at nearly 16 inches in diameter, they function in the exact same way as a [[pixel]] on the screen of a cellular phone. By varying the intensity of red, green and blue, the system is able to create every visible color from pinks and purples to white. By moving these colors around the globe at a fluid rate, animations and movement are [[Persistence of vision|perceived]]. All 259 fixtures are controlled by Color Kinetics hardware to execute various computer-generated patterns and colors along the surface of the sphere. The [[DMX512]] lighting protocol is used to communicate with the fixtures. Each fixture is manufactured from solid cast stainless steel and weighs over 20 pounds. Making the tower an iconic landmark on the Dallas skyline, lighting on the globe is also used for special events and holidays across the city (for example, the winter season will feature seasonal colors and animations; for St. Patrick's Day, it will be illuminated in green; for patriotic events, it will be lit in red, white and blue; etc.) The globe was lit up in rainbow colors on June 26, 2015 to celebrate [[Obergefell v. Hodges|the supreme court ruling which legalized same sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasvoice.com/tag/reunion-tower&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
[[File:View from Reunion Tower August 2015 25.jpg|thumb|A view from Reunion Tower's "GeO-Deck" observation deck]]
[[Celebrity chef]] [[Wolfgang Puck]] opened the fine-dining, revolving restaurant, ''Five Sixty'' on the tower's rotating top level on February 11, 2009. The name is a reference to the restaurant's elevation. The middle floor of the tower is used for special events managed by Wolfgang Puck Catering, which is based at nearby Union Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Five Sixty Wolfgang Puck Dallas | url=http://wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/3917 | publisher=Wolfgang Puck Catering | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Observation level is called the "GeO-Deck". The interior facility includes an interactive digital experience featuring information about Dallas landmarks, Reunion Tower itself, the events of [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|November 22, 1963]], live view high-definition cameras and more. The exterior of the observation deck features telescopes with views in every direction.

The Cloud 9 Cafe is accessible from the observation deck, serving meals and snacks with a 360-degree view from behind glass.

The gift shop at the tower's base features souvenirs related to Reunion Tower, Dallas and Texas and other novelty items.

'''Robert Doucet Boyce''', better known as '''Sluggo''', is a professional skateboarder, snowboarder, break-dancer, gymnast, stuntman, and businessman from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].  Sluggo is best known for his skateboarding.  He is also the first person to perform a back flip to fakie on a vertical skate ramp. Sluggo currently shares ownership of a skateboarding distribution company, Centre Distribution, and oversees the day to day operations of [[RDS Skate Supply]] and [[Red Dragon Apparel]].  He has two children, Liam and Araya.

== Early career ==

Sluggo was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] where he started as a gymnast winning the Western Canadian Championships at age 13.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, John P. (May 3, 2001). "Brothers take flight in 'boarding world", ''[[The Province]]'', p. B24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rob also took up break-dancing where he won several competitions and placed 5th in a North American break-dance contest.

He began his skateboard career at the age of 15 on the advice of a classmate. At age 16, a friend suggested the name ''Sluggo'', because of his supposed resemblance to the character in the comic strip ''[[Nancy (comics)|Nancy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Doug (May 6, 2000). "This weekend, Vancouver is Jam City: Skateboarding's biggest event helps fuel the enthusiasm of B.C.'s red-hot 'boarders", ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Sluggo honed his vertical skateboard skills at the Richmond Skate Ranch, owned by [[Kevin Harris]], a local pro skater for [[Powell Peralta]].  This is where he would also meet his future crew, best friends, and business partners [[Colin McKay]], and [[Moses Itkonen]].  The crew came to be known as the "Red Dragons".

== Mid career ==

Sluggo caught the eye of [[Stacey Peralta]], director of the Dog-town documentary, and owner of Powell Peralta Skateboards.  Stacey introduced Sluggo to [[Henry Hester]], a skateboard legend from Southern California who ran G&amp;S. Sluggo rode for G&amp;S from 1988 till 1990.  Later Sluggo would ride for Real Skateboards owned by [[Tommy Guererro]] and [[Jim Thiebaud]] from Peralta’s world famous "Bones Brigade".

Sluggo turned pro in 1991 and traveled to the World Championships in Munster, Germany and competed for the first time against his childhood heroes [[Chris Miller (skateboarder)|Chris Miller]], [[Tony Hawk]] and a long list of highly regarded veteran skaters.  Sluggo placed 5th in his first international competition.

Skateboarding took a down turn in the public eye from 1993 - 1996. Sluggo still continued to skate and compete all over the world but the industry had down-sized. Vertical skateboarding had fallen out of favor and street skating had taken over.
The Red Dragons have always prided themselves on being well rounded skaters who skated everything that they had at their disposal which was usually downtown Vancouver, the breeding ground for some of the best skateboarders in the world{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}.

In 1992, Sluggo’s younger brother Dave Boyce introduced him to snowboarding, and he quickly rose to success in that sport as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, Dana (May 11, 1995). "Sluggo's a guy for all seasons: Snowboards in winter, skateboards in summer", ''[[The Province]]'', p. B3.&lt;/ref&gt; After two seasons under his belt, he became one of Canada’s most published snowboarders showing up in almost every snowboard magazine that came out in 1994. This opened the doors to many sponsorship deals and trips all over the world to film and shoot photos. Was sponsored by snowboard manufacture, World Industries and had a signature board. Not many boards were produced and are impossible to find in good condition. 

== Later career ==

Sluggo is now a full [[UBCP]] union stunt performer in the Canadian movie industry.  He started his stunt career doubling [[Dean Cain]] in a [[Wesley Snipes]] production, ''Future Sport''.  Sluggo has over 60 TV and feature credits to his name either acting or stunting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101662/&lt;/ref&gt;

He was skate coordinator on the NBC TV series ''[[Sk8 (TV series)|Sk8]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(December 10, 2001). "Hello, Sluggo", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', p. C14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sluggo retired from snowboarding professionally in 2000 but continued to skateboard professionally until 2004. He came out of retirement briefly to compete in the Canadian Half-Pipe Championship in March 2005 and won the event.

The '''Spring Street Financial District''', referred to as the '''Wall Street of the West''',&lt;ref name=NRH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wall&gt;{{cite news|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|title=L.A. Then and Now: 'Wall Street of the West' Had Its Peaks and Crashes|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2000-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a historic district in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].  The historic district includes 23 financial structures, including the city's first skyscraper, and three hotels all located along a stretch of South Spring Street from just north of Fourth Street to just south of Seventh Streets.  In the first half of the 20th Century, this stretch of Spring Street was the financial center of Los Angeles, with the important banks and financial institutions being concentrated there.  At least ten of the buildings in the district were designed in whole or in part by [[The Parkinsons|John Parkinson]], who designed many of the city's landmark buildings in the early 20th Century, including the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], [[Los Angeles City Hall]], [[Bullocks Wilshire]], and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]]. Ten of the buildings in the district have been designated as [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument|Historic-Cultural Monuments]] by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission.

==History==
[[Image:Building at 408 S. Spring St. (Top), Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Continental Building, LA's first skyscraper]]

===Early days===
In the 1890s, the city's business center was further north near South Spring and Temple Streets.  The street can claim credit as the birthplace of the motion picture business in Los Angeles.  In 1898, [[Thomas Edison]] filmed a 60-second film titled "South Spring Street Los Angeles California", mounting a giant camera on a wagon to film the bustling action along South Spring Street.&lt;ref name=Wall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?papr:1:./temp/~ammem_Mbho:: ''South Spring Street Los Angeles California'', Thomas Edison]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall Street of the West===
In the early 1900s, the city center began spreading south, and the city's banks and financial institutions began concentrating along South Spring Street.  The first two important buildings to make the move south were the Hellman and Continental Buildings, with the [[Continental Building]] being considered the city's first skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Sitton (Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History)|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Spring Street Financial District, at page 8|publisher=Los Angeles Conservancy web site|date=July 1977|url=http://www.laconservancy.org/initiatives/Spring%20St%20Nomination%20PDF.pdf|format=PDF}} ("”The Continental Building (first known as the Braly Building) was considered the first ‘skyscraper’ in Los Angeles.”)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|title=L.A. Then and Now: ‘Wall Street of the West’ Had Its Peaks, Crashes|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2000-06-11}} (saying of the Braly/Continental Building: “At 12 stories, it was the city’s first skyscraper…”)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, the ''Los Angeles Times'' boasted about the building boom on Spring Street:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The visitor to this city can at this moment observe skyscrapers in all stages of construction.  It is a study which will provide the most comprehensible kind of answer to the query as to why Los Angeles is leading San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Detroit, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Boston, Buffalo and all other cities of anything near her in building activity as revealed by the monthly expenditures for construction work.&lt;ref name=Sky&gt;{{cite news|title=Millions in Skyscrapers: Staggering Sum Going into Metropolitan Blocks; Downtown Sky Line Daily Grows More Imposing; |publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1911-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The building boom along South Spring Street continued into the 1920s as the population and economy of Los Angeles boomed.  South Spring Street remained the city's financial center even after World War II.

===Decline of the district in the 1970s and 1980s===
[[Image:E.F. Hutton Building (Los Angeles).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Decorations above entrance to E.F. Hutton Building]]
In the 1960s, many of the banks and financial institutions began moving to the western part of the downtown area, along Figueroa Street and Wilshire Boulevard.&lt;ref name=NRH&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Sitton (Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History)|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Spring Street Financial District|publisher=Los Angeles Conservancy web site|date=July 1977|url=http://www.laconservancy.org/initiatives/Spring%20St%20Nomination%20PDF.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1980s, South Spring Street had become known for "transients who sleep in doorways and urinate on sidewalks."&lt;ref name=Eternal/&gt;  In 1982, the ''Los Angeles Times'' commented on the district's decline from "Wall Street of the West" to a blighted area with empty office buildings lining both sides of the street:&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the banks and law firms moved to the 'Gold Coast' typified by [[Arco Towers]], six blocks to the west, Spring Street plummeted to become a neighborhood of hoodlums, derelicts and winos—a neighborhood of echoing buildings full of absolutely nothing above the ground floor."&lt;ref name=Road&gt;{{cite news|author=John Dreyfuss|title=Spring Street: On the Road to Respectability|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1982-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Redevelopment projects and regentrification===
Since the early 1980s, South Spring Street has been the subject of numerous redevelopment projects.  In recent years, numerous art galleries have moved into the old financial district, which is now known as Gallery Row.  Many of the old bank buildings have also been converted into upscale lofts.  As wealthier residents have moved into the district's lofts, older residents and artists have complained about the increased rents.  One artist who had lived in the district for years said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real problem with downtown lately, Gronk and his friends half-jokingly agreed is 'those people.'  Westsiders.  Trust-fund babies.  New tenants who demand their bohemian pleasures be liberally sweetened with suburban amenities.  Landlords who previously recruited artists to help make downtown 'safe' for gentrification, then jacked up their rents so only lawyers and screenwriters could afford it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reed Johnson|title=L.A. at Large: Soul Searching on Spring Street; As developers lure wealthier residents downtown, the historic area's gritty and bohemian past collides with a glossy future|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2001-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Beaux Arts architecture as the district's enduring strength===
[[Image:Title Insurance Building 2 (Los Angeles).jpg|thumb|175px|right|Moderne exterior of the Title Insurance Building]]
The strength of the district remains its period architecture.  Many of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] facades along Spring Street remain virtually intact, making the district a popular shooting location for motion picture and television productions seeking authentic period cityscapes.&lt;ref name=Wall/&gt;  In 1985, noted ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist [[Jack Smith (columnist)|Jack Smith]] pointed to the Spring Street Financial District as proof that "Los Angeles was never the cultural wasteland it was alleged to be."&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|author=Jack Smith|title=Cultural and architectural richness distinguish the old Spring Street financial district|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1985-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He hailed the district's "financial palaces" as "a solid architectural achievement" which give the street "beauty, strength, unity and dignity."&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

==Buildings in the district==
Notable buildings in the district (from north to south) include:&lt;ref name=NRH/&gt;

; The Hellman Building:  NE corner of 4th and Spring – Built in 1902, the Hellman and Continental Buildings were the first major structures to anchor the Spring Street Financial District.  The Hellman Building, now known as Banco Popular, is an eight-story brick and concrete structure designed by Alfred Rosenheim.  In 1998, Gilmore Associates announced plans to convert the Hellman Building, the Continental Building, and the [[San Fernando Building]] into 230 lofts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Melinda Fulmer|title=Rental Units Are Proposed for Downtown; Housing: Gilmore Associates wants to turn a mostly vacant stretch of 4th Street into 250 market-rate apartments|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert A.

; [[Continental Building|The Continental Building]]: 408 S. Spring Street – Built in 1902, the Continental Building was originally known as the '''Braly Building'''.  The 12-story building was designed by [[The Parkinsons|John Parkinson]] and is considered the first "skyscraper" in Los Angeles.  It was the tallest building in Los Angeles until 1907.  It is known for its highly ornamental cornice and bands. The Continental Building was converted into lofts as part of Tom Gilmore's Old Bank District lofts project.  It was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #730) in 2002.

; El Dorado Hotel: 416 S. Spring Street – Originally known as the '''Hotel Stowell''', the 12-story  hotel was built in 1913 and designed by Frederick Noonan with a highly stylized and brightly colored facade, enameled brick and terra cotta. [[Ernest A. Batchelder|Batchelder]] tiles are used extensively in the hotel and lobby.  Shortly after the hotel opened, [[Charlie Chaplin]] lived at the Stowell, which he described as "a middle-rate place but new and comfortable."  Chaplin later told a story about receiving a telephone call while there concerning an appearance for which he was to be paid $25,000.  Chaplin recalled: "My bedroom window opened out on the well of the hotel, so that the voice of anyone talking resounded through the rooms. The telephone connection was bad, 'I don't intend to pass up twenty-five thousand dollars for two weeks’ work!' I had to shout several times. A window opened above and a voice shouted back: 'Cut out that bull and go to sleep, you big dope!'"  In 2008, the building was converted into lofts under the name "El Dorado Lofts."

; Title Insurance Building: 433 S. Spring Street – Built in 1928, the Title Insurance Building is a ten-story building designed by [[The Parkinsons|John and Donald Parkinson]] in the Zig-Zag [[Art Deco|Moderne]] style.  The marble lobby includes a mural by [[Hugo Ballin]].  The Title Insurance Building was the subject of the district's first major redevelopment project.  Architect-developer Ragnar C. Qvale acquired the building in 1979.  He took the impressive Art Deco shell and converted the building into the Design Center of Los Angeles, which he leased to wholesale household furniture showrooms. Early 2011, the ground floor of the building became an art gallery and coffee shop, and took the logical name of Groundfloor Gallery &amp; Café.&lt;ref name=Road/&gt;  The Title Insurance Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #772) in 2003.

; Crocker Bank: 453 S. Spring Street – Built in 1914, the 10-story building was designed by [[The Parkinsons|Parkinson and Bergstrom]]. The building was once the Los Angeles headquarters of Crocker Citizens National Bank.  Now known as the Spring Arts Tower, the building is part of a movement to convert the old financial district into the city's "Gallery Row."  The building's interior features original Art Deco designs, Art Nouveau details, sculptured brass, Italian marble, Batchelder tile, California alder and tiger oak.  The building's tenants include artists, designers, architects, film production companies, and law firms. A nightclub called the "Crocker Club" is scheduled to open on the vault floor in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Spring Arts Tower|publisher=Spring Arts Tower|url=http://www.springartstower.com/default2.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Rowan Building: 131 W. 5th Street – Built in 1910, the 11-story Rowan Building was originally known as the '''Chester Building''', designed by Parkinson &amp; Bergstrom in a mix of Beaux Arts and Classical styles.  Ornate cast iron rosettes hang from the building's cornice, and elegant glazed terra cotta panels cover the facade.  During its construction, the ''Times'' described it as a "mammoth" structure being built with the most massive steel girders and beams ever used on the West CoaStreet  The building, built from 3000 tons of steel, was the largest office in Los Angeles in 1911.&lt;ref name=Sky/&gt;  During its construction, hundreds of people lined the street "to see the huge crane swinging these titanic metal units of the structural plan into place for the workmen with the air riveters."&lt;ref name=Sky/&gt; Built by developer Robert A. Rowan, the Rowan Building once housed many of the city's prominent law offices and stock brokerage firms. It has been known over the years as the Central Fire Proof Building Company and the Chester Building and has been converted into 206 live/work condominium units with retail space on the ground floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rowan-lofts.com/history.html The Rowan Building History - ROWAN LOFTS - Los Angeles Downtown&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many interior features including Carrara marble corridor walls and floors, mahogany windows, and detailed Art Deco elevator doors have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowan Building|publisher=Killefer Flammang Architects|url=http://kfarchitects.com/housing.php?nStartLinks=0&amp;projID=149&amp;catID=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Alexandria Hotel]]: 210 W. 5th Street – Built in 1906, the eight-story Alexandria Hotel is another building designed by [[The Parkinsons|John Parkinson]].  With 500 rooms, an elaborate wood lobby, and the glamorous Palm Court with its stained glass dome, the Alexandria was the most luxurious hotel in Los Angeles from the time it opened until the Biltmore opened in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref name=Alex&gt;{{cite news|author=Terence M. Green|title=Alexandria Hotel Changes Owners|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1975-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movie stars and other celebrities, including [[Mae West]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Jack Dempsey]] were guests.  [[Charlie Chaplin]] kept a suite at the Alexandria and did improvisations in the lobby where [[Tom Mix]] reportedly rode his horse.&lt;ref name=Wall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alex/&gt;  The carpet in the lobby was called the "million-dollar carpet", because there was purportedly a $1 million worth of business done there every day.&lt;ref name=Alex/&gt;  It was there that [[D.W.

Originally known as the "Mercantile Arcade Building," it was modeled on the [[Burlington Arcade]] in [[London, England]].  Is three-level, skylighted arcade has been called a space "as regal as almost any other interior space in the city."&lt;ref name=Road/&gt;  The tower on top of the building once supported the antenna of the radio station KRKD ("RKD" = Arcade), from which [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] preached her message.&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.usc.edu/geography/la_walking_tour/historic_core/arcade_building.html USC Geography : LA Walking Tour : Historic Core : Arcade Building&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ups and downs of the district were reflected in the sales of the Arcade Building.  As the area fell into decline, it sold in 1977 for $300,000.  Five years later, as redevelopment projects fueled speculation in Spring Street properties, it sold for $4.5 million—15 times its 1977 sale price.&lt;ref name=Road&gt;The {{convert|195000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building was converted into 142 loft apartments as part of a $15-million renovation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arcade Building to Be Turned Into Loft-Style Apartments |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2002-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/apr/09/business/fi-lofts9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Lloyd's Bank: 548 S. Spring Street – Built in 1913, the 12-story Lloyd's Bank was designed in the Commercial style by William Curlett &amp; Son.

; Pacific Southwest Bank: NW corner of 6th and Spring – Built in 1910, the 11-story Pacific Southwest Bank was designed by [[The Parkinsons|Parkinson &amp; Bergstrom]] in the Classical style with fluted columns.  The building has been converted into lofts and is now known as SB Manhattan.

; United California Bank: 600 S. Spring Street – Built in 1961 and designed by [[Claud Beelman]] &amp; Associates, this contemporary glass and concrete building is one of the few nonconforming intrusions in the Spring Street Financial District.  It was the first skyscraper to be built after the city's building height limit was lifted.  City planners hoped it would solidify Spring Street as the city's financial center, but an exodus of banks and financial institutions began in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ray Hebert|title=No Tall Buildings: Aesthetics, Not Quakes, Kept Lid On|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1985-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David M.

; Hotel Hayward: 601 S. Spring Street – Built in 1905, the nine-story Hotel Hayward was designed by [[Charles Whittlesey (architect)|Charles Whittlesey]].  There is a 14-story addition on the western side that was added in 1925 and designed by [[The Parkinsons|John and Donald Parkinson]].  The Hotel Hayward plays a part in the 2007 movie "[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]," as the climactic battle between "[[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]" and "[[Optimus Prime]]" takes place on the street in front of The Hotel Hayward.

; [[Los Angeles Stock Exchange Building]]: 618 S. Spring Street – Built in 1929, the eleven-story exchange building was designed by Samuel Lunden in the [[Streamline Moderne|Moderne]] style.  Ground was broken in October 1929, just as the Great Depression hit, and when the Los Angeles Stock Exchange opened its doors there in 1931, the country was deep into the Depression.  There are three bas-relief panels carved by Salvatore Cartaino Scarpitta into the granite above the building's entrance.  The panels portray the elements of a capitalist economy.  The large central panel, "Finance", displays capitalists.  The "Production" panel shows an aircraft engine, a steel worker pouring molten metal and a worker stirring it. The "Research and Discovery" panel shows oil derricks, factories, a chemist conducting an experiment and a man kneeling in a library reading a book. The interior is wonderfully preserved, and has ancient Near East and Native Indian influences by the designer Julian Ellsworth Garnsey. On the entrance lobby's ceiling the Wilson Studio created four sculpted figures representing: Speed (Mercury), Accuracy (the archer), Permanence (a figure contemplating the universe), and Equality (the figure bearing scales). The highlight of the interior was its massive 90' x 74' balconied trading floor with a forty-foot ceiling and sixty-four booths. On fifth floor was a clearing-house with a statistics department, an auditorium, and a lecture room. Offices occupied floors six through nine, and the top two floors included: a club with a library, a card room, a billiard room, and reading rooms. The basement held a 2,660-sq. ft. printing room and a vault. In 1986, the exchange (by then part of the Pacific Stock Exchange) moved out of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Angeles Stock Exchange: Finance; Research and Discover; Production|publisher=Public Art in Los Angeles|url=http://www.publicartinla.com/Downtown/Broadway/stock_exchange.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1980s, the Community Redevelopment Agency helped fund a night club that opened in the Exchange Building—called the Stock Exchange, but the club did not survive the 1980s. In late 2008, the building underwent extensive renovations and reopened in 2010 as Exchange LA nightclub.  The visually dynamic building and interiors are frequently used for location filming, and has been featured in The Big Lebowski, The Social Network, and numerous television shows and commercials. Special events include corporate parties, product debuts, and fashion shows. The Stock Exchange Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #205) in 1979.

; E.F. Hutton Building: 623 S. Spring Street – Built in 1931, the 12-story Zig-Zag [[Streamline Moderne|Moderne]] E.F. Hutton Building once housed E.F. Hutton's big board.

; Banks &amp; Huntley Building: 632 S. Spring Street – Built in 1930, the Banks &amp; Huntley Building was designed by [[The Parkinsons|John and Donald Parkinson]] in the [[Streamline Moderne|Moderne]] style.

==Mission and goals==
''The Prague Post'' was an English-language information source in the [[Czech Republic]] through its newspaper, and related products and services.

''The Prague Post'' newspaper was published by Prague Post, spol. s r.o. (spol. s r.o. = Ltd.).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==History==
In July 1991, Lisa Frankenberg and Kent Hawryluk, two employees of ''Prognosis'', an English-language monthly newspaper in [[Prague]] which began publication in March 1991,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mattwelch.com/prognosis.html Matt Welch | Prognosis]". http://www.mattwelch.com. Retrieved 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; came to the realization that there was a ripe market in the then [[Czechoslovakia]] for a weekly broadsheet newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/2010.html Special Report - Dynamic Women in Business 2001- The Fast Track to the Top]". http://hbswk.hbs.edu. Retrieved 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;" Zaitchik, Alexander (2001) [http://www.thinkexpats.com/component/content/article/85-publications/190-let-the-kazoos-sound-a-decade-of-english-press-in-prague.html Let The Kazoos Sound A Decade of English Press in Prague]" http://www.thinkexpats.com Retrieved 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Monroe Luther, an investor from [[Houston]], [[Texas]], they formed Lion’s Share Group, a privately held, Czech limited-liability company (spol s r.o.) that was created to be the information leader in the region. Kent Hawryluk served as Founding Publisher and Lisa Frankenberg as Founding General Manager. Other programs introduced at that time were the Business Network, Lion’s Share Group Publishing and the Prague Post Foundation (set up separately as a Czech-registered, non-profit foundation, and which later became The Prague Post Endowment Fund with the change in Czech nonprofit laws).

The mission of ''The Prague Post'' was simple and direct: to publish the best possible English-language newspaper for and about the rapidly changing Czechoslovakia and more broadly, Central Europe. The aim was to place particular emphasis on news, business, and cultural listings.

[[Alan Levy]], a foreign correspondent for the [[International Herald Tribune]] and author of ''So Many Heroes'', an eyewitness account of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, was hired as the Founding Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thinkexpats.com/component/content/article/309.html Alan Levy, The Pen of Prague]". http://www.thinkexpats.com. Retrieved on 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The original staff hired by Levy included former reporters and editors from a wide range of magazines and daily newspapers, including the ''Sacramento Bee'', ''Sacramento Union'', ''The New York Review of Books'', ''Business International'', the ''Grinnell Herald-Register'', ''Fortune'' magazine and the ''Tampa Tribune''.

Lion’s Share Group established the wholly owned subsidiary company Prague Post s.r.o. in March 1994 to take over the publishing of the newspaper, while Lion’s Share Group became a holding company.

===Chronological history===
'''1991'''

''The Prague Post'', located in a small room off Old Town Square in [[Prague]], debuted with a 12-page issue on 1 October 1991. The first paper covered news and business, offered a weekly calendar of listings and included a regular pub guide.

In late 1991, the paper moved to larger offices on Politických vězňů, off [[Wenceslas Square]], and increased to 16 pages.

'''1992'''
In February 1992, "Night &amp; Day", a redesigned and enlarged cultural listings section, was introduced. A regular features page concentrating on in-depth news, culture and lifestyle articles debuted in early May 1992.

The paper underwent extensive redesign, increased to 24 pages, switched street delivery days from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and moved printing operations to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], on 18 November 1992. This enabled it to offer color capability to advertisers, higher quality print resolution and more timely international distribution. Several new regular sections appeared at this time including sports, "The Big Picture", a page devoted to news from Central and Eastern European regions and "East View", a column of material from other English-language newspapers in Central and Eastern Europe.

Kent Hawryluk’s day-to-day involvement with the newspaper ended in December 1992, and Lisa Frankenberg took over the responsibilities of publisher.  An additional suite of rooms was added to the offices at Politických vězňů and the staff continued to expand, along with the company’s investment in computers and publishing equipment.

'''1993'''
A monthly supplement devoted to special news coverage about [[Slovakia]] and entertainment listings for [[Bratislava]] was introduced in January, 1993, but was later curtailed as reporting became more difficult in Slovakia. In July 1993, "Summer in the City" was published as a tabloid insert for the remaining weeks of the summer. The tabloid included up-to-the-minute travel information for tourists, filling in where the guidebooks left off.

''The Prague Post'' launched special pullout sections on 1 September 1993: "Money &amp; Markets," "Travel &amp; Leisure" and "Real Estate." These sections, aimed at providing expert, specialized coverage, appeared on the first, second and third weeks of the month, respectively. The remaining week(s) of each month were filled with a series of special topics, including "Computers &amp; Technology", "The Modern Office", "Human Resources" and "Fashion." The special sections have changed and evolved over the years in response to readers’ needs.

The newspaper moved into newly reconstructed offices in the historic YMCA building at Na Poříčí 12 on 1 December 1993.

'''1994'''
''The Prague Post'' underwent a significant redesign on January 19, 1994, transforming the second section into the tabloid-size pullout "Night &amp; Day". This newly designed pullout consisted of articles detailing culture, features, listings, and a Prague Profile. It also introduced several new additions such as the Service Page, Ask Eva (an advice column), My Gene Pool (a cartoon strip) and reviews. The front section of the paper, consisting of news, business, sports and opinion also received a design improvement at this time.

Later in 1994, "Night &amp; Day" increased in size to include the classifieds section. At this time, the business editorial department also began publishing weekly researched industry lists that are included in the annual Book of Lists.

'''1995'''
The 1995 ''Book of Lists'', under development throughout 1994, was published in early 1995. An updated version of the ''Book of Lists'' was published annually until 2000.

In 1995 the paper continued to grow in all areas as advertising revenue increased. The Prague Post began sponsoring two well-known events: the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and the Valtice Arts Festival.

'''1996'''
''The Prague Post'' celebrated its 5th Anniversary on 28 September 1996, with a black-tie, gala evening at Národní Dům na Vinohradech, attended by over 1,000 guests with dignitaries, including five ambassadors, past and present employees and clients. This Gala event was a memorable evening, aptly marking a significant occasion in the life of the newspaper and its importance in the market.

''The Prague Post'' added sponsorship of the Prague International Marathon in the summer of 1996, and published a 12-page, four-color tabloid Holiday Shopping Guide for the month of December.

'''1997'''
In April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' was awarded first place for ‘Excellence in Newspaper Marketing’ by the International Newspaper Marketing Association for an in-house marketing campaign.

On 1 April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' launched its website at www.praguepost.cz (today it is "[http://www.praguepost.com www.praguepost.com]"). The initial site offered several top stories from the weekly newspaper as well as information for tourists and relocation information for people planning to move to Prague. It quickly gained a significant following, particularly with readers based outside the [[Czech Republic]].

'''1998'''
In May, 1998, Lisa Frankenberg returned from business school to resume an active role in the day-to-day operations of the newspaper as President and Publisher.

'''1999'''
The newspaper underwent another significant redesign near the end of 1999. Randy Stano, winner of two Pulitzer prizes for design, was recruited to undertake the process of re-designing the newspaper. ''The Prague Post'' was granted an Award of Excellence for re-design by the Society of News Design.

The offices of ''The Prague Post'' were relocated to a two-story office space at Štěpánská 20 in Prague 1.

'''2000'''
Since its strong debut, ''The Prague Post'' has attracted much international media coverage, with articles about the paper and its staff appearing in ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Smithsonian'', ''Fortune'', ''The Columbia Journalism Review'', ''Advertising Age'', ''The European'' and ''Telegraph'' of London. In addition, the newspaper was profiled on [[BBC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] ([[60 Minutes]] and the [[CBS Evening News]]) and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (Prime Time Live and the ABC Evening News).

''The Prague Post'' was re-launched with its new design and format on 19 January 2000. Printing of the newspaper was moved from [[Frankfurt]] to a printing house in [[Prague]].

'''2001'''
