'''A Broadband Imaging X-ray All-sky Survey''', or '''ABRIXAS''' was a [[satellite|space-based]] [[Germany|German]] [[X-ray]] [[telescope]]. It was launched on 28 April 1999 in a [[Cosmos]] launch vehicle from [[Kapustin Yar]], [[Russia]], into [[Earth orbit]]. The orbit had a [[periapsis]] of {{convert|549.0|km|mi}}, an [[apoapsis]] of {{convert|598.0|km|mi}}, an [[inclination]] of 48.0° and an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.00352, giving it a period of 96 minutes.&lt;ref name="abrixas2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1999-022A | title=NASA - NSSDC - Spacecraft - Details (ABRIXAS) | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abrixas_trajectory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftOrbit.do?id=1999-022A | title=NASA - NSSD - Spacecraft - Trajectory Details (ABRIXAS) | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The telescope's battery was accidentally overcharged and destroyed three days after the mission started. When attempts to communicate with the satellite when its solar panels were illuminated by sunlight failed, the $20 million project was abandoned.&lt;ref name="abrixas_end"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/abrixas.htm | title=ABRIXAS | publisher=Astronautix.com | accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each is calculated from the [[weighted averages]] of the values of their category of [[stock]].  A third index value, the All Company Index, is derived from a weighted average of the two indices.  On the Botswana Stock Exchange, a company that is designated as a "foreign company" is a company that is "dual-listed", meaning that it is also listed on another stock exchange.

'''Casparus Bernardus Oorthuys''' (November 1, 1908 – July 22, 1975), known as Cas, was a Dutch photographer and designer active from the 1930s until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Auer, Michèle | author2=Auer, Michel | title=Encyclopédie internationale des photographes de 1839 à nos jours = Photographers encyclopaedia international 1839 to the present | publication-date=1985 | publisher=Editions Camera obscura | isbn=978-2-903671-06-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Casparus Bernardus (Cas) Oorthuys, born 1908 in [[Leiden]], was the fourth child and first son of Dorothea Catherina Helena Christina de Stoppelaar (1875-1948) and Reverend Gerardus Oorthuys (1876-1959), who started his career as a pastor in [[Brakel]]. In 1909 the family moved to [[Amsterdam]] where from 1921 Oorthuys attended the [[Amsterdams Lyceum|Amsterdam Lyceum]] for three years before enrolling in&amp;nbsp;the technical school in the Timorplein in Amsterdam. From 1926-30 he studied architecture at the School for Architecture, Decorative Arts and Art Crafts in [[Haarlem]] and, after the closure of this school in 1927, in the architecture department of the Haarlem MTS, during which time he joined the free-thinking Dutch Association of Abstinent Students, and first took up photography.

==Career==
In 1930 Oorthuys joined the municipality of Amsterdam as a [[structural engineer]] and was involved, among other things, in the design of the market halls on the [[Jan van Galenstraat metro station|Jan van Galenstraat]]. In 1932 he, with many others, lost his job as a result of the [[Great Depression|economic crisis]]. Unemployed, he came into contact with the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Communist Party of Holland]], which he joined. Oorthuys sought work as a graphic designer and photographer and with the painter [[Jo Voskuil]] started an advertising agency OV 20 ("Oorthuys-Vos 20") from 1932 to 1935. 

Oorthuys was involved with and a member of various left-wing organisations in his field. In 1936 he became permanent photographer at [[De Arbeiderspers]]. He produced photography and graphics for [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisations and in the tradition of "workers' photography" he documented poverty, police violence, the unemployed, homeless people and evictions for magazines, book illustrations and book covers and exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Ensel, R. (2003). Hollandse Heimat: nationalisme en de fotografie van het landschap in het Interbellum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henkes, B. (2005). Personalities. Groniek (168).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance work during WW2==

During the war Oorthuys helped forge identity papers and photographed clandestinely for the Underground Camera to document the activities of the [[Reichskommissariat Niederlande|German occupiers]], and also the awful [[Dutch famine of 1944–45|Hongerwinter]], the Dutch Famine of 1944/45. During the postwar recovery he recorded the [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg war crimes trials]] and the rebuilding of his homeland. 

On August 5, 1938 Oorthuys had divorced teacher Gezina Broerse (1910-1997) whom he had married on August 31, 1932 and with whom he had two children. He married scriptwriter Lydia Krienen on April 3, 1940, just before the war broke out in May.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.trouw.nl/home/-cas-was-geen-lolbroek-~ad0d95e4/ Marie Louise Schipper, 'Cas was geen lolbroek': interview with Lydia Oorthuys, Trouw, December 1, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; During the Occupation, Oorthuys became involved in the Personal Identification Centre established in 1942 and made passport photos for fake ID cards, while earning a bare living on an assignment from Contact publishing company for a book about agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

(2016). Capturing time. Trade journal Social Work , 17 (4), 23-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Unexpectedly, he was released again in August, presumably at the interposition of [[Nico de Haas]] who, despite having been with Oorthuys one of the founders in 1936 of the ‘photo and film’ group of the Association for the Defense of Cultural Law (BKVK) in preparation of the anti-fascist exhibition De Olympiade Onder Dictatuur (DOOD),&lt;ref&gt;Langfeld, G.

== Post-war ==
After the war Oorthuys had maintained the left-wing convictions&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Warren, Lynne | title=Encyclopedia of twentieth-century photography | publication-date=2006 | page=1149 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-57958-393-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that had prompted his joining the worker-photographer movement Vereeniging van Arbeiders-Fotografen in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;Jay, B. (1993). Album: A Memoir. History of Photography, 17(1), 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; and with his equally idealistic friends Carel Blazer, [[Eva Besnyö]], and [[Emmy Andriesse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Roosens, Laurent | author2=Salu, Luc, 1948- | title=History of photography : a bibliography of books | publication-date=1989 | publisher=Mansell | page=7 | isbn=978-0-7201-2310-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; formed the Vereniging van Beoefenaars der Gebonden Kunsten, the GKf, on September 1, 1945. 

In keeping with his convictions, from January until March 1947, Oorthuys, accompanied by his writer the educationalist Albert de la Court, travelled through Java and Borneo in Indonesia commissioned by ABC-Press and the publishing house Contact. In July 1947 the resultant book ''Een staat in wording'' (A Nascent State), promoted a peaceful solution to the Indonesian struggle for independence, and reviews reveal its impact on changing attitudes to the colony as the Netherlands tried to re-exert its control,&lt;ref&gt;Beb Vuijk, 'De Republik Indonesia: een staat in wording', In De Vrije Katheder, June 25, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; but before the book appeared, a [[Indonesian National Revolution|violent revolution]] was in full swing.

From 1945-75 he produced numerous books and reports on the post-war reconstruction&lt;ref&gt;Kempers, B. (1998). De sociale esthetiek van de wederopbouw. Amsterdams Sociologisch Tijdschrift, 25(1), 94-98.&lt;/ref&gt; in Dutch industry, agriculture, regions and cities and undertook reportage in [[Indonesia]] (1947),&lt;ref&gt;Oorthuys, C., &amp; Poeze, H. (2010). Een staat in wording; fotoreportage van Cas Oorthuys over het Indonesië van 1947.

With Lydia, Oorthuys had three children; sisters Fenna and Hansje, and the youngest a son, Frank, born in 1960. Photography became a family concern;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; during the summer holidays from 1951 they traveled to make 28 photo pocketbook in a series for Contact-Photo books, starting with ''Bonjour Paris'' with a cover by Jan van Keulen, each on a different country, promoting tourism for a now more prosperous Dutch population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Crawford, Sally (Sally Elizabeth Ellen), (editor.) | author2=Ulmschneider, Katharina, (editor.) | author3=Elsner, Jaś, (editor.) | title=Ark of civilization : refugee scholars and Oxford University, 1930-1945 | publication-date=2017 | publisher=Oxford University Press | edition=First | isbn=978-0-19-968755-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The compact books were designed around the square format of the Rolleiflex that Oorthuys favoured and several were marketed by foreign publishers in English, French and German language editions. 

During this period he also designed five postage stamps (1951) and two more in 1964. On each of the five stamps, a portrait of a child, among them his own daughter Hansje, is montaged against the background of a typical aspect of the Netherlands, showing the (housing) construction and industry. For the Belgian Ministry of Information he covered the Congo in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;Creemers-Palmers, M. (1992). Tentoonstelling "Cas Oorthuys - Guaranteed Real Dutch - Congo" (Book Review). Afrika Focus, 8(2), 151.&lt;/ref&gt; with further reports on cattle raising in [[Jersey]] (1954), followed by stories on [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Spain]] (1955)

The '''Chamalals''' are an indigenous people of [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]] living in a few villages in the [[Tsumadinsky District]] on the left bank of the [[Andi-Koisu river]]. They have their own language, [[Chamalal language|Chamalal]], and primarily follow [[Sunni Islam]], which reached the Chamalal people around the 8th or 9th century. There are about 5,000 ethnic Chamalals (1999, Kubrik).&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cji Ethnologue report for Chamalal]&lt;/ref&gt; They are culturally similar to the [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]].

Neighboring peoples are the [[Godoberi people|Godoberi]], Avars, [[Bagvalal people|Bagvalals]], and [[Tindi people|Tindis]].

'''Richard D. "Dick" Goddard''' (born February 24, 1931) is a former American television [[meteorologist]], [[author]], [[cartoonist]], and animal activist. For over five decades, he served as the evening meteorologist at [[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]], the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]-affiliated television station in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. He holds the [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness World Record]] for longest career as a weather forecaster.&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-career-as-a-weather-forecaster Longest career as a weather forecaster - Guinness World Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After graduating from [[Green High School (Green, Ohio)|Green High School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox8.com/author/dickgoddardfox8news/ Dick Goddard]. ''Fox8.com''. Retrieved on 2012-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt; in what is now [[Green, Ohio]], in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;WJW-TV, "Fox 8 News at 10" broadcast, 2009-08-12 (personal mention of 60th Reunion).&lt;/ref&gt; Goddard began his weather career while taking classes on meteorology during a stint with the [[United States Air Force]] from 1949 through the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=pd80th/&gt; During this time, Goddard's most notable assignment was forecasting for atmospheric nuclear weapons tests by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=pd80th/&gt;

He then attended [[Kent State University]], where he majored in drama and broadcasting.  While there he had notable success as the lead character, Curly, in the school's production of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Oklahoma!]]''

After graduating from Kent State in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ashley |last=Katona |last2= |first2= |year=Winter 2011 |title=Dick Goddard, '60 |journal=Kent State Magazine |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=28 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.glpublishing.com/digitaleditions/KENT111/pageflip.html |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711101836/http://www.glpublishing.com/digitaleditions/KENT111/pageflip.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the weather team at [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]]-owned [[WKYC|KYW-TV]] (now WKYC-TV) in Cleveland a year later; while at KYW-TV, Goddard worked alongside [[sports commentator|sports anchor]] [[Jim Graner]].&lt;ref name="WKYC History PDF"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|title=History of WKYC-TV 1948-2010|url=http://www.wkyc.com/company/about_us/history_of_wkyc.pdf|work=[[WKYC|WKYC.com]]|publisher=WKYC-TV, Inc|accessdate=August 25, 2010|quote=1961: ...  The news team consisted of anchors Carl Stern and Bud Dancy, weathercaster Dick Goddard and sports talent [[Jim Graner]].|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goddard was one of several employees of KYW-TV who agreed to move to [[KYW-TV|WRCV-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] in June 1965, after Westinghouse was allowed by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] to reverse a station trade with [[NBC]] in 1956 based on coercion in order for Westinghouse to retain their NBC affiliations; the KYW calls also moved back to Philadelphia. However, Goddard did not take a liking to Philadelphia, and returned to Cleveland several months later.  In 1966, Goddard became the chief meteorologist at WJW-TV, where he would work for the remainder of his career.&lt;ref name=pd80th/&gt;

After returning to Cleveland, Goddard also took a job with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Cleveland Browns]] as the team's official [[statistician]] for home games. Then a CBS affiliate, WJW carried Browns games at the time as part of their NFL play-by-play contract until the 1970 [[AFL-NFL merger]] (due to the Browns move to the AFC), at which point the games moved to WKYC – this was a key factor in his having joined the station. He held this position from 1966 to 2011, with the exception of a three-year period from 1996–1999 when the franchise was suspended [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|as the old Browns franchise moved to]] [[Baltimore Ravens|Baltimore]] and Cleveland was given a new team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dick Goddard retires...from Browns broadcast booth |url=http://www.wtam.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=122520&amp;article=10400329 |publisher=[[WTAM|WTAM-AM]] |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2012-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 1977 to January 1979, Goddard also hosted WJW's version of ''[[Bowling for Dollars]]'', a syndicated franchised game show.  He has also appeared in numerous skits on WJW's popular ''[[Big Chuck and Lil' John]] Show'' over the years, and does occasional stage work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.aol.com/video-detail/wjkw-tv8-cleveland-bowling-for-dollars-promo-1978/3768522838 WJKW-TV8 - Cleveland - "Bowling for Dollars" Promo - 1978 - AOL Video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of Goddard's 50 years on Cleveland TV, most of which was spent at WJW, the portion of South Marginal Road (the southern frontage road of the [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]]) in front of the WJW studios was renamed "Dick Goddard Way" on May 23, 2011.&lt;ref name = "DGW"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lindsay |last=Buckingham |coauthors= |title=S.

[[File:Bușteni-train-station2008g.jpg|thumb|5100 kW [[CFR Class EA|CFR Class 41]] Electric locomotive currently in operation by Romanian CFR]]
'''Electroputere S.A.''' (which translates as ''Electropower'' in English) is a company based in [[Craiova]], [[Romania]]. Founded in 1949, it is one of the largest industrial companies in Romania. Electroputere has produced more than 2,400 [[diesel locomotive]]s, and 1,050 [[electric locomotive]]s for the Romanian, Bulgarian, Chinese, and Polish railways, additionally producing other urban vehicles and complex equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electroputere Craiova - Manufacture |url=http://www.electroputere.ro/en/P/production.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404091034/http://www.electroputere.ro/en/P/production.php |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Electroputere are currently manufactures of:
* Industrial electrical parts - [[circuit breaker]]s, [[transformer]]s etc.
* Industrial [[electric motor]]s &amp; Converters
* Heavy duty power [[transformer]]s
* [[Railway]] and [[Tram|Urban vehicles.]]

They also have divisions specialising in:
* [[Forging]] and [[Molding (process)|molding]] metal
* Equipment repairing
* Tools modernisation.

==Electric and diesel-electric locomotives==
{{See also|List of Electroputere locomotives}}
===Export orders===
[[File:56003 at Cheltenham Racecourse.JPG|thumb|right|[[British Rail Class 56]] locomotives were built by Electroputere and [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]]]
A total of 1,105 locomotives were delivered between 1972—1991 to railway companies in the following countries:
*{{Flagicon|Bulgaria}} Bulgaria
*{{Flagicon|China}} China
*{{Flagicon|Greece}} Greece
*{{Flagicon|Iran}} Iran
*{{Flagicon|Poland}} Poland
*{{Flagicon|UK}} United Kingdom
*{{Flagicon|Yugoslavia}} Yugoslavia
&lt;ref&gt;[http://christianferoviarul.blogspot.com/2008/11/locomotive-exportate-de-sc.html Exports between 1972-1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its more notable foreign orders was for the [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56]] locomotives for [[British Rail]]. The 30 locomotives were outsourced to Electroputere because [[Brush Traction]] could not build them at its own plant; however, upon their arrival in the UK, the machines were deemed to be unsuitable for use, as they suffered from poor construction standards, and had to be withdrawn and extensively rebuilt. (However, they were seen as being perfectly reasonable for use in Romania by the Romanian crews who tested them)&lt;ref&gt;"'The Locos that Came in From the Cold" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' (December 2000/January 2001 issues)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The title was a carry over from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, where citizens of various professions were honored by the national and subnational governments for their long contributions to a specific field or to the nation. When it was part of the Soviet Union as [[Byelorussia SSR]], had titles of their own to award their citizens. One those titles was "Honored Educator of the Byelorussia SSR" ({{lang-ru|Заслуженный учитель БССР}}). When Belarus left the Soviet Union in 1991, the awarding of the title was scrapped. The return of the title, with its present name, occurred with the passage of [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] N 3726-XII, titled "System of State Awards for the Republic of Belarus," on April 13, 1995.

== Criteria ==
To qualify for the award, a Belarusian teacher must have been teachering for fifteen or more years and the quality of the education must be above the normal standards required by the state. The teacher can be from any level of schooling and from any type of school, regardless if it is owned by the state or by private institutions. Home school teachers can also qualify for the award.

== Badge ==
The medallion at the bottom of the badge consists of an oak wreath and a shield. On the shield, the rank of "Honored Teacher" is written in Russian. At the top part of the badge, a metal plate is inscribed with the name of the country in Russian. The a red ribbon is placed about the plate. The top plate is 20x18 millimeters and the bottom medallion is 24&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

'''Intelsat 605''', previously named '''Intelsat VI F-5''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1991, it was the fourth of five [[Intelsat VI]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat VI series was constructed by [[Hughes Aircraft]], based on the [[HS-389]] [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

Intelsat 605 was launched at 23:15:13 UTC on 14 August 1991, atop an [[Ariane 4]] 44L carrier rocket, flight number V45.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[ELA-2]] at [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed Intelsat 605 into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]]. The satellite raised itself into its final [[geostationary orbit]] using two liquid-fuelled [[R-4D-12]] engines,&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-6.htm|title=Intelsat-6 (601, 602, 603, 604, 605)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the satellite arriving in geostationary orbit on 20 August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/geo.date|title=Index|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Geostationary Orbit Catalog|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelsat 605 initially operated in a geostationary orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|35756|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|35818|km}}, and 0 degrees of [[inclination]].&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite carried 38 IEEE [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and ten IEEE {{Ku band}} [[transponder]]s, and had a design life of 13 years and a mass of {{convert|4296|kg}}.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

During late 1991, Intelsat 605 was operated at a longitude of 21.5 degrees west. In July 1992, it was placed at 24.5 degrees west, where it operated until November 1997. It subsequently operated at 27.5 degrees west from December 1997 to March 2003; 32.9 degrees east from April 2003 to October 2004; 77 degrees west from December 2004 to January 2005, and 174 degrees east from April 2005 to January 2009. It was placed into a [[graveyard orbit]] and decommissioned in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-satellite.com/tse/online/sat_intelsat_605.html|title=Intelsat 605|publisher=tbs Internet|work=The Satellite Encyclopedia|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mall of Montenegro''' is a shopping mall located in the [[Podgorica]], [[Montenegro]].

The mall is a complex featuring covered [[marketplace]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100612061524/http://www.green-bazaar.co.me/ Green Bazaar]), a [[Ramada]] hotel, and the shopping mall itself. The entire complex was built on the location of former open marketplace, as a [[public–private partnership]] between [[Podgorica Municipality]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] company of [https://web.archive.org/web/20101008015730/http://www.gintas.com.tr/eng/index.asp Gintaş].

The mall is located on ''Bratstva i Jedinstva'' street, which is also main north/south thoroughfare of Podgorica, and is a part of [[European route E65|E65]]/[[European route E80|E80]] European routes.  The entire complex has total floor area of 58,000 m², while [[gross leasable area]] of the shopping mall is 17,000 m².

Besides ''Green Bazaar'', which is a natural [[anchor tenant]], a large [[Mercator (retail)|Mercator]] [[supermarket]] is the largest tenant. Prominent stores in the mall include [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]], [[Sergio Tacchini]], [[Office Holdings|Office Shoes]], [[Intersport]] and others. The mall also features a [[bowling]] alley, cafés, a fast food court, children's playground, and entertainment park. An underground parking garage serves the entire complex.

Although it is the largest shopping mall in Podgorica, in gross built area terms, it has had constant problems with vacancy since its opening, as [[Delta City]] shopping mall has already saturated the small Montenegrin market, and has a stronger presence of international clothing brands. Thus, Delta City is currently considered a more high end shopping mall.

A '''pancake''' (or '''hotcake''', '''griddlecake''', or '''flapjack''') is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a [[Starch|starch-based]] [[batter (cooking)|batter]] that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a [[griddle]] or [[frying pan]], often frying with oil or butter. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, M. Feast; ''Why Humans Share Food'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In Britain, pancakes are often [[leavening agent|unleavened]] and resemble a [[crêpe]].&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{Cite news|title = British desserts, explained for Americans confused by the Great British Baking Show|url = https://www.vox.com/2015/11/29/9806038/great-british-baking-show-pudding-biscuit|accessdate = 3 December 2015|last = Nelson|first = Libby|publisher = Vox|date = 29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically [[baking powder]]). American pancakes are similar to [[Scotch pancake]]s&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; or [[drop scone]]s. A ''crêpe'' is a thin [[Brittany|Breton]] pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or [[crepe maker]] to &lt;!-- Beautiful wording --&gt;achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from [[southeast Europe]] is a ''[[palačinke]]'', a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cheese cream, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used.

When potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a ''[[potato pancake]]''.  Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries. When [[buttermilk]] is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a '''buttermilk pancake''', which is common in Scotland and the US. Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of [[buckwheat pancake]], a category that includes [[Blini]], [[Kaletez]], [[Ploye]], and [[Memil-buchimgae]].
[[File:Hotcake.jpg|thumb|Hotcakes]]
Pancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or fillings including jam, fruit, [[syrup]], [[chocolate chip]]s, or meat, but in America they are typically considered a [[breakfast food]]. Pancakes serve a similar function to [[waffle]]s.  In Britain and [[The Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]], they are associated with [[Shrove Tuesday]], commonly known as "Pancake Day", when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of [[Lent]].

==History==

The [[Ancient Greeks]] made pancakes called τηγανίτης (''tēganitēs''), ταγηνίτης (''tagēnitēs'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtaghni%2Fths ταγηνίτης], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; or ταγηνίας (''tagēnias''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtaghni%2Fas ταγηνίας], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; all words deriving from τάγηνον (''tagēnon''), "frying pan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dta%2Fghnon τάγηνον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested references to ''tagenias'' are in the works of the 5th-century BC poets [[Cratinus]]&lt;ref&gt;Cratinus, [https://archive.org/stream/comicorumatticor01kockuoft#page/52/mode/1up 125], Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Magnes (comic poet)|Magnes]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnes, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJWhUOazBvsC&amp;pg=PA111 ''Meals and recipes from ancient Greece''], J.

Douglas (2011) ''The Learned Banqueters, Volume VII: Books 13.594b-14'', Loeb Classical Library, pp. 277-278&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English]] word ''pancake'' appears in English in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pancake Pancake] - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=p&amp;p=2 Pancake]. Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans called their fried concoctions ''alia dulcia'',  Latin for "other sweets". These were much different from what are known as pancakes today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq2.html#pancakes|title=The Food Timeline--history notes: muffins to yogurt|work=foodtimeline.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional varieties==
{{see also|List of pancakes}}

===Africa===

====Horn of Africa====
[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|right|This meal of ''injera'' and several kinds of ''wat'' or ''tsebhi'' (stew) is typical of [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean cuisine]].]]

Pancakes in the [[Horn of Africa]] ([[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]) are known as ''[[injera]]'' (sometimes [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as ''enjera'', ''budenaa'' ([[Oromo language|Oromo]]), or ''canjeero'' ([[Somali language|Somali]])). ''Injera'' is a yeast-risen [[flatbread]] with a unique, slightly spongy texture. Traditionally, it is made out of [[Eragrostis tef|teff]] flour and is a national dish in Ethiopia and Eritrea. ''Canjeero'', also known as ''lahooh'' or ''[[lahoh]]'', is a similar kind of flatbread eaten in Somalia and [[Yemen]].

[[File:LahohS.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Lahoh]]'' is a [[Staple food|staple]] in [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]] and [[Yemen]].]]

In Eritrea and Ethiopia, ''injera'' are usually served with one or more stews known as ''[[Wat (food)|wat]]'' or with salads (especially, for instance, during periods of [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] fasting) or with other injera (''injera firfir''). The right hand is used to tear small pieces from the ''injera'' to use to pick up and eat the stews or salads. The ''injera'' under these stews soaks up juices and flavours and, after the stews and salads are finished, is also consumed. ''Injera'' thus acts simultaneously as food, eating utensil and plate. When the "tablecloth" formed by the ''injera'' is finished, the meal is over.

''[[Lahoh]]'' is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;Abdullahi, Mohamed Diriye (2001), ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', Greenwood Press, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Elham, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928085026/http://www.yobserver.com/news-varieties/printer-1002499.html Little Business Women Small enterprises supporting Yemen's poorest families], ''News Varieties'', 16 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often eaten along with [[honey]], [[ghee]] and [[tea]]. During lunch, ''lahoh'' is sometimes consumed with [[curry]], soup or stew.

====Kenya====
In [[Kenya]], pancakes are eaten for breakfast as an alternative to bread. They are served plain with the sugar already added to the batter to sweeten them. Kenyan pancakes are similar to English pancakes and French crepes.

====South Africa====
A "pancake" in [[South Africa]] is a [[crêpe]]. In [[Afrikaans]], it is known as a ''[[pannekoek]]'' (plural ''pannekoeke'') and, traditionally, is prepared on gas stoves and eaten on wet and cold days. ''Pannekoeke'' are usually served with cinnamon-flavoured sugar (and, sometimes, lemon juice) that is either allowed to dissolve into and soften them or, if their crispy texture is to be retained, eaten immediately. They are a staple at [[Dutch Reformed Church]] fêtes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080221224502/http://www.landbou.com/LandbouWeekblad/Kos_en_resepte/0,,1294-1317_1737818,00.html Boer op ons werf] at landbou.com (via archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plaatkoekies'' ("flapjacks", or lit. "plate cookies") are American-style [[#Varieties of American and Canadian pancakes|"silver dollar"]] pancakes.

A variation of the ''pannekoek'' is the South African [[crumpet]], made from self-raising flour, eggs, milk and a pinch of salt. The smooth batter is fried in butter to produce a slightly raised flat cake. Crumpets are always served hot, usually for breakfast, with butter and golden syrup.

====Uganda====
In [[Uganda]], pancakes are locally made with bananas (one of the staple foods of the country) and usually served as a breakfast or as a snack option.

===Asia===

[[Banana pancakes]] are a menu item in Western-oriented [[backpacking (travel)|backpacker]]s' cafes in Asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, and China. This has elicited the term ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]''.

====China====
[[Chinese pancake]]s may be either savoury or sweet, and are generally made with dough rather than batter.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite book |last=Liu |first=Junru |title=Chinese Food |year=2011 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521186742 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzAQ2xulj8IC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Chinese+pancakes%22+dough&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vjOjUrKwI-PB7AbmmoH4Ag&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chinese%20pancakes%22%20dough&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dough mostly consists of water, flour, and vegetable oil.&lt;ref name="allrecipes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allrecipes.com/recipe/214564/pan-fried-chinese-pancakes/|title=Pan-Fried Chinese Pancakes Recipe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dish can be served as a side, usually alongside duck, or as a snack, topped with scallions along with hot and sour sauce.&lt;ref name="allrecipes.com"/&gt;

====India====
India has many styles of pancake. Variations range from their taste to the main ingredient used. All are made without the use of added [[Leavening agent|raising agent]]s.

Pancakes prepared using a north Indian cooking style are known as ''cheela''. Sweet ''cheela'' are made using sugar or [[jaggery]] with a wheat flour-based batter. North Indian salty pancakes are made using batter prepared from [[gram flour]] or green gram paste (''moong daal'') and are sometimes garnished with ''[[paneer]]'', a cottage-style cheese. &lt;!--?: Pancakes in north Indian cooking style resemble more with Crepe than American flapjacks due lack of any rising agent.--&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''[[Dosa]]'', ''[[appam]]'', ''[[neer dosa]]'' and ''[[uttapam]]'' are pancakes made in a south Indian cooking style. They are prepared by fermenting [[Batter (cooking)|rice batter]] and split-skinned [[urad bean]] (black lentil) blended with water. ''Meetha pooda'' –&amp;nbsp;sweet pancakes often eaten with pickles and chutney&amp;nbsp;– are a common breakfast food item in [[Punjab region|the Punjab]]. Most of the ''[[Assamese Jolpan#Pitha|pitha]]'' in [[Assam]] are types of pancakes served on occasions such as [[Bihu|Bihu festivals]]. The [[Bengal]]i semi-sweet pancake ''pati-shapta'' is stuffed with grated coconut or thickened milk.

In Western India, the multi-grain ''[[thalipeeth]]'' is popular. In Goa, a traditional [[crêpe]]-like pancake known as ''alebele'' or ''alle belle'' is eaten at tea-time. It is usually filled with jaggery and coconut.

In Eastern India, ''[[malpua]]s'' are sometimes prepared in the form of pancakes.

====Indonesia====
[[File:Serabi-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Serabi]]]]

The [[Indonesia]]n pancake ''[[serabi]]'' is made from rice flour and coconut milk. The dish is often served with kinca, a thick, brown-colored coconut sugar syrup. Other toppings may include [[sugar]], [[Peanut|ground peanuts]], sliced [[bananas]], [[jackfruit]], and other fruits, and [[chocolate]]. Other variations include [[cheddar cheese]], [[corned beef]], [[Chicken as food|shredded chicken]], and [[sausage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aussietaste.recipes/vegetarian_/serabi-indonesian-pancakes/|title=Serabi - Indonesian Pancakes recipe|website=aussietaste.recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
In Japan, ''[[okonomiyaki]]'' are made from flour, egg, cabbage and a choice of ingredients. ''[[Oyaki]]'' are pancakes often stuffed with [[red bean paste|anko]], [[eggplant]], or [[nozawana]]. ''[[Dorayaki]]'' are a sort of sandwich made from Western-style pancakes and anko. Sweet [[crepes]] are also very popular.

====Korea====
In Korea, pancakes include ''[[jeon (food)|jeon]]'', ''[[pajeon]]'', ''[[bindaetteok]]'', ''[[kimchijeon]]'', and ''[[hotteok]]''. These may be served during all times of the day as side dishes or just snacks. Variants of the dish use the batter of the pancake to make deep fried vegetables, meat, or fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maangchi.com/recipes/pancakes|title=Korean pancake recipes from Cooking Korean food with Maangchi|website=www.maangchi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia and Singapore====
The traditional Malay pancake in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] is called ''lempeng''. Cooked very similarly to an American or Canadian style pancake albeit without a rising agent, it is usually served during the breakfast hours with curry, ''[[rendang]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.com/recipe/malay-pancake-lempeng-kelapa-154523|title=Malay Pancake|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[sambal]]''.

====Nepal====
In [[Nepal]], the [[Newar]] have a savoury rice pancake called ''[[chataamari]]'' cooked with meat or eggs on top. This dish is also known as the ''Newari Pizza'', as it is served and eaten similarly to American [[pizza]]. Besides being served with meat or eggs, it can also be served plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegundruk.com/chatamari/|title=Chatamari|date=15 March 2014|work=thegundruk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
In [[Pakistani cuisine]], ''rishiki'' is a pancake, slightly thicker than a crepe, which is made from whole wheat flour, water and eggs and usually served with honey. It is widely consumed in the far north and is a staple of [[Chitrali cuisine]].

====Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], ''[[salukara]]'', a type of ''[[bibingka]]'', is a pancake made from rice flour, eggs, and coconut milk. The batter is placed in a clay pan lined with banana leaves or greased with oil, and is grilled over hot coal.&lt;ref name="uy"&gt;{{cite web |date=1 September 2013|last1=Uy |first1=Amy A. |title=Rice cakes, roscas, and more eats at the Samar Food Fest |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/food/324580/rice-cakes-roscas-and-more-eats-at-the-samar-food-fest/story/ |website=GMA News Online |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savory pancakes also include ''[[tortang talong]]'' (eggplant omelette), ''[[pudpod]]'' (smoked fish flake pancakes), and ''[[okoy]]'' (a pancake made of battered shrimp, pumpkin, or sweet potatoes).

The North American variety of pancakes, or "hotcakes", is also recognized, and despite it being commonly prepared for breakfast, it can also be eaten as an afternoon snack, with street kiosks selling small hotcakes topped with margarine and sugar.

==== Vietnam ====
[[File:Bánh xèo with nước mắm.jpg|thumb|[[Bánh xèo]], the Vietnamese equivalent of a pancake]]

In [[Vietnamese cuisine]] there are a variety of traditional pancakes; these include ''[[bánh xèo]]'' in the north, ''bánh khọt'' in the south, and ''bánh căn'' and ''[[bánh khoái]]'' in [[central Vietnam]].

===Europe===

====Austria, Czech Republic, and Romania, Slovakia, and former Yugoslavia====
[[File:Palatschinke.jpg|thumb|right|''Palacinky'', Slovak pancakes]]

In Austria, the Czech Republic, and [[Slovakia]], pancakes are called ''[[palatschinke]]'', ''palačinka'' and ''palacinka'', respectively (plural: ''palatschinken'', ''palačinky'', and ''palacinky''). ''[[Kaiserschmarrn]]'' is an Austrian pancake including raisins, almonds, apple jam or small pieces of apple, split into pieces, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. In [[Romania]], they are called ''clătită'' (plural: ''clătite''). In countries of [[former Yugoslavia]], they are called ''palačinka'' (plural: ''palačinke''). In these languages, the word derives from the Latin ''placenta'', meaning "cake". These pancakes are thin and filled with apricot, plum, [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberry]], apple or strawberry jam, chocolate sauce, or [[hazelnut]] spread. [[Eurokrem]], [[Nutella]], and Lino-Lada fillings are favourite among the younger population. A traditional version includes filling pancakes with cheese, pouring yoghurt over them, and then baking in an oven.

====Belarus, Russia, Ukraine====

[[File:Russian oladyi, Bob Bob Ricard, Soho, London.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oladyi]] served with [[caviar]] and [[Smetana (dairy product)|smetana]]]]

Eastern-Slavic cuisines have a long tradition of pancake cooking and include a large variety of pancake types. In [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]], pancakes may be [[breakfast]] food, appetizer, main course, or dessert.

''[[Blini]]'' ({{lang-ru|блины}}) and ''mlynci'' ({{lang-ua|млинцi}}) are thin pancakes, somewhat thicker than crêpes, made from wheat or buckwheat flour, butter, eggs, and milk, with yeast added to the batter. Blini/mlynci cooking dates back to pagan traditions and feasts, which are reflected in today's "[[Maslenitsa|pancake week]]" celebrated in the winter before the [[Great Lent]]. In pre-[[Christian]] times, blini and mlynci were symbolically considered by early Slavic peoples as a symbol of the [[sun]], due to their round form.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojc4Uker_V0C&amp;pg=PA57 |title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food |publisher=Wiley |year=2010 |accessdate=18 April 2012 |author=Marks, Gil |pages=56–58 |isbn=9780470391303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blintz]]es ({{lang-ru|блинчики}} ''blinchiki'') are thin crêpes made without yeast. Filled blintzes are also referred to as ''nalysnyky'' ({{lang-ua|налисники}}), ''nalistniki'' ({{lang-ru|налистники}}) or ''nalesniki'' ({{lang-ru|налесники}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langet.ru/html/n/nalesniki.html ''Nalesniki''] in V.V. Pokhlebkin's ''Culinary Dictionary'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A filling such as jam, fruits, [[quark (dairy product)|quark]], or [[cottage cheese]], potato, cooked ground meat or chicken, and even chopped mushrooms, bean sprouts, cabbage, and onions, is rolled or enveloped into a pre-fried blintz and then the blintz is lightly re-fried, sautéed, or baked.

Small thick pancakes are called ''[[oladyi]]'' ({{lang-ru|оладьи}}) or ''oladky'' ({{lang-ua|оладки}}). The batter may contain various additions, such as apple and raisins.

====Denmark====
[[File:Aebleskiver.jpg|thumb|Æbleskiver]]

''[[Æbleskiver]]'' are traditional Danish pancakes made in a distinctive spherical shape. (The name literally means "apple slices" in [[Danish language|Danish]], although apples are not an ingredient.) ''Æbleskiver'' are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special cast iron pan with several hemispherical indentations. Batter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the ''æbleskiver'' begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. ''Æbleskiver'' are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, lingonberry or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

====Finland====
Finnish pancakes greatly resemble ''plättar'' (see the description in the Sweden section below) and are called ''lettu'', ''lätty'', ''räiskäle'' or ''ohukainen''. In Finland pancakes are usually eaten as dessert with whipped cream or pancake-jam, sugar or vanilla ice cream. In Finnish, ''lettu'' and ''pannukakku'' (literally "pancake") have different meanings, the latter having a structurally closer resemblance to a hotcake, and is baked in an oven instead of using a frying pan. ''Ålandspannkaka'', literally "pancake of [[Åland]]", is an extra thick variety of oven-made pancake that includes the addition of cardamom and either rice pudding or semolina porridge to the dough.

====France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland (and Latin America)====
[[File:Crêpe opened up.jpg|thumb|right|Crêpe]]

''[[Crêpe]]s'', popular in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Portugal]], are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin pancakes and are served with a sweet (fruit, ice cream, jam, chocolate spread) or savoury filling (cheese, ham, seafood, spinach). In [[Francophone]] Europe, crêpes are often sold in special stands. In [[Italy]] they are called ''crespelle'' or ''scrippelle''. In [[Brittany]], a ''[[galette]]'' (or ''galette bretonne'') is a large thin pancake made of [[buckwheat]] flour, often cooked on one side only.

Crêpes are popular in many [[South America]]n countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[Chile]]. They are consumed with sweet fillings (marmalade, [[dulce de leche]]) or with salty fillings (ground meat (Brazil), vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese).

They have also become popular [[East Asia]]n countries, including [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]] and [[China]], where they are sold in crêpe stands and kiosks. They are often served with [[whipped cream]] and fruits, or non-sweet spreads such as vegetables.

''[[Farinata]]'' are popular in Mediterranean regions, including Nice. Also called ''socca'', these are pancakes made from chickpea flour and seasoned with black pepper. They are popular street food in Nice.

====Germany====
[[File:2015 0731 Kaiserschmarrn Apfelsoße Edelweisshütte Sölden.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Kaiserschmarrn]]'']]
German pancakes are known as ''Pfannkuchen'' (from the [[German language|German]] ''Pfanne'' and ''Kuchen'' meaning "pan" and "cake") except in Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony, where ''Pfannkuchen'' are [[Berliner (pastry)|Berliner pastries]] and pancakes are known as ''Eierkuchen''. They are generally thicker than French-style crêpes and usually served with sweet or, occasionally, savoury fillings. Usage of a leavening agent or yeast is uncommon. Fried apple rings covered by pancake dough and served with sugar and cinnamon are called ''Apfelküchle''. ''[[Kaiserschmarrn]]'', a thick but light [[Caramelization|caramelized]] pancake popular in [[Bavaria]] and regions of the former [[Austria-Hungary]], is usually split into pieces, filled with fruits or nuts, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a fruit sauce. It is believed{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that this was first prepared for [[Kaiser]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].

In [[Swabia]], sliced pancake strips (''flädle'') are often served in soup.

====Great Britain====

=====England=====

English pancakes have three key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk, though [[Gervase Markham]]'s 1615 version in ''[[The English Huswife]]'' used water instead of milk, and added sweet [[spice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gervase Markham (Pancakes)|url=http://hertesofengland.org.uk/journal/gervase-markham/|publisher=Hertes of England|accessdate=12 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216154746/http://hertesofengland.org.uk/journal/gervase-markham/|archivedate=16 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The batter is runny and forms a thin layer on the bottom of the [[frying pan]] when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to [[French cuisine|French]] [[crêpe]]s and [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] crespelle. They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the traditional topping of lemon juice and sugar, drizzled with [[golden syrup]], or wrapped around savoury stuffings and eaten as a main course. On [[Shrove Tuesday]], it is custom to eat pancakes, and lemon juice and sugar may be added on top. [[Yorkshire pudding]] is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. [[Staffordshire oatcake|Oatcake]]s are a savoury variety of pancake particularly associated with [[Staffordshire]].

=====Scotland=====
&lt;!--"Drop scone" redirects here--&gt;
[[File:Pancake and crumpet.jpg|thumb|right|Pancake and fruit [[Crumpet#Scottish crumpet|crumpet]]]]

Pancakes (also called ''Scotch pancakes'' or ''Scottish pancakes'') are more like the American type. In parts of Scotland they are also referred to as ''drop scones'' or ''dropped scones''.&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;McNeill, F. Marian (1929). ''The Scots Kitchen''.

They can be served with jam and cream or just with butter. In Scotland pancakes are generally served at [[Tea (meal)#United Kingdom|teatime]].

=====Wales=====

[[File:Crempog - Anglesey style.JPG|thumb|[[Crempog]]]]
Welsh pancakes, known as ''[[crempog]]'', ''ffroes'' and other names, vary considerably. Generally, they are thick and layered on top of each other to form a tall mock-Cake, but Some are very much like American pancakes, others may be made with yeast (called ''crempog furum'') or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Bobby (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-gwkXuzJOPQC&amp;pg=PA195 ''First catch your peacock: her classic guide to Welsh food''], Y Lolfa; New edition, {{ISBN|978-0-86243-315-4}} pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tibbit, Sara Minwell (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=xDWTcNpAgcwC&amp;pg=PA13 ''Baking in Wales''], National Museums and Galleries of Wales, {{ISBN|978-0-7200-0346-8}} p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crumpet]]s'' and ''pikelets'' are sometimes considered a variety of pancake.

====Greece====
Greek pancakes are called ''tiganites'' (''τηγανίτες'', from the [[ancient Greek]] ''τηγανίτης'') and are popular across [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]]. They are slightly thicker than crêpes and can be sweet or savoury. Their main ingredients are flour, olive oil or butter, milk and eggs. They are usually drizzled with honey and cinnamon, and sometimes topped with cheese, nuts, fruits or vegetables. Various small shops in Cyprus called creperies sell crepes, either savoury or sweet varieties. Tiganites can be served for breakfast or dessert, and in some places like [[Corfu]] and [[Patras]] are customarily served in the feast days of [[Saint Spyridon]] and [[Saint Andrew]]. In Cyprus the pancake recipe is used for a similar dish such as Genoese canelloni&amp;nbsp;– ground meat with tomato sauce, cheese, and sometimes bechamel sauce&amp;nbsp;– instead of the traditional cannelloni dried pasta sold at supermarkets.

====Hungary====
[[File:Hortobagy palacsinta.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Hortobágyi palacsinta]]'']]

In [[Hungary]], pancakes known as ''[[palacsinta]]'' (derived from the Latin ''placenta'') are made from flour, milk or soda water, sugar, and eggs. Sweet wine is added to the batter. The filling is usually jam, sugared and ground walnuts or poppy seeds, sugared cottage cheese, sugared cocoa, or cinnamon powder, but meat and mushroom fillings are also used (see ''[[Hortobágyi palacsinta]]''). ''[[Gundel#Cuisine|Gundel palacsinta]]'' is a Hungarian pancake stuffed with walnuts, zest, raisins and rum that is served in chocolate sauce and is often [[flambé]]ed. Hungarian pancakes are served as a main dish or as a dessert.

====Iceland====
[[File:Pönnukökur, Markerville, AB.jpg|thumb|Rolled pönnukaka, Historic Markerville Creamery Museum in Markerville, Alberta, Canada.]]

Icelandic crepe-like pancakes are called ''pönnukaka'' (pl. ''pönnukökur''), whereas smaller, thicker and denser pancakes resembling North American pancakes are called ''lumma'' or ''skonsa''. The pancakes are usually a bit browner than traditional Swedish ones. ''Pönnukökur'' are usually cooked on a special Icelandic pancake pan, which is made to get the pancake as thin as possible, which is traditionally never washed or rinsed, not even with water. ''Pönnukökur'' are traditionally served rolled up with sugar or folded with jam and whipped cream, but if eaten at a café they might contain ice cream instead. Pönnukökur are also a popular dessert in North America among people of Icelandic descent.

In Iceland, North American-style pancakes are cut in half and used as [[sandwich bread]], similar to Icelandic [[flatbread]].

====Netherlands====
[[File:The Ultimate Pancake.jpg|thumb|right|Pannenkoek with bacon and Gouda cheese]]

In the Netherlands, pancakes are known as ''[[pannenkoek]]en'' and are mostly eaten at lunch and dinner time. Pancake restaurants are popular with families and serve many sweet, savoury, and stuffed varieties. Pannenkoeken are slightly thicker than crêpes and usually quite large, {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} or so in diameter. The batter is egg-based and fillings include such items as sliced apples, cheese, ham, bacon, and candied ginger, alone or in combination. ''Stroop'', a thick molasses-like sugar beet-based syrup is also popular, particularly in a classic filling of bacon and stroop. ''[[Poffertjes]]'' are another Dutch quick bread, similar to American pancakes but sweeter and much smaller. Made in a specially dimpled copper or [[cast iron]] pan, they are flipped once with a fork. Unlike Dutch pancakes, the batter for poffertjes contains baking powder and therefore they have a softer interior than pancakes. A spekdik is a pancake like-food which is traditionally eaten in the provinces [[Groningen]] and [[Drenthe]] in the Netherlands around [[New Year]]. Unlike pancakes, a spekdik is cooked with a [[waffle iron]]. The main ingredients of a spekdik are syrup, eggs and rye-flour, and some varieties include [[bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpzfNKbixCgC&amp;pg=PT690 |title=Travel Amsterdam: Illustrated City Guide, Phrasebook, and Maps - MobileReference |page=690 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
[[File:Nalesniki.jpg|thumb|right|Home-made Polish ''naleśniki'' filled with sweet white cheese]]

In Poland, thin crêpe-style pancakes are called ''naleśniki'' (pronounced ''naleshniki''). They are usually rolled and served with a variety of savoury or sweet fillings as a main dish or a dessert. Sweet fillings include fresh fruits (e.g. [[bilberry|bilberries]]), jams (often apple jam), and soft white cheese with sugar. Savoury fillings include fried vegetables, fried chicken, minced meat, [[spinach]], and a variety of added ingredients such as potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage or ham. Another Polish dish reassembling pancakes are ''[[racuchy]]''. They are smaller and thicker than ''naleśniki'' and can be stuffed with apple slices.

====Spain====
[[File:Frixuelos-fayuelos.jpg|thumb|right|''Frixuelos'']]

Spanish pancakes are called ''frixuelos'' or ''filloas'' and are very popular in the north-west of Spain. They are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin and are usually served with a large amount of sugar or honey. They are a typical Carnival sweet dessert in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]] and [[Province of León|León]].

===={{visible anchor|Sweden}}, {{visible anchor|Norway}}====
[[File:Heap of pancakes in Sweden.JPG|thumb|right|Nordic pancakes]]

Nordic pancakes are similar to the French-style crêpes. In some Nordic countries, they are served with jam or fruit, especially [[Lingonberry|lingonberries]] (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called ''pannkakor'', which resemble the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with [[pea soup]], the Swedish cuisine also has ''plättar'' — very small pancakes, which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are usually fried in a special pan called a "plättlagg", a sort of frying pan with indentations to allow for several (normally seven) to be made at once. Another type of pancake is the ''ugnspannkaka'' (oven pancake), which is very thick and resembles German pancakes, and is baked in the oven. There is also a variant which includes fried pork in the batter, ''[[fläskpannkaka]]'' (pork pancake). [[Potato pancake]]s called ''raggmunk'' contain shredded raw potato, and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing ''rårakor''). ''Raggmunk'' and ''rårakor'' are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and lingonberry jam. A special Swedish pancake is ''saffron pancake'' from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special "Swedish pancake" is the ''äggakaka'' (eggcake), also called ''skånsk äggakaka'' ([[Scania]]n eggcake), which is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also much more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan, is about 1½ to 2&amp;nbsp;inches thick, and is served with lingonberries and [[bacon]]. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry) or sugar.

===North America===

====Costa Rica====
[[Costa Rican cuisine|Costa Rican]] ''chorreadas'' are similar to ''[[cachapa]]s''.

====Guatemala====
[[Guatemala]]n pancakes are called ''panqueques''. They are made with the same ingredients as American pancakes. The toppings are usually fruits and honey. They are a very popular breakfast meal in Guatemala. Depending on the region, the ''panqueque'' can be thin as a crêpe or as fluffy as a North American pancake.

====Mexico====
Mexican ''hotcakes'' are similar to American pancakes. Crêpes became popular toward the end of the 19th century after their introduction by the French sometime between the First French Intervention (1838) and the [[French intervention in Mexico|Second French Intervention]] in Mexico (1861–67).&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-del-Villar, Miguel Angel and Ruiz-Naufal, Víctor M., ''Mesa Mexicana'' (1993), Fundación Cultural Bancomer, {{ISBN|9789686084948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2139-the-french-influence-on-mexican-cooking-la-comida-afrancescada|title=The French Influence On Mexican Cooking: La Comida Afrancescada|work=mexconnect.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotcakes are often made with cornmeal, as well as, or instead of wheat flour. Hotcakes are popular breakfast items at restaurants throughout the country, and are often sold by street vendors in cities and during the local celebrations of towns through the day. They are also sold during fairs; the vendors sell a single hotcake topped with different sauces such as [[condensed milk]], fruit jam or a sweet goat milk spread called ''[[cajeta]]''.

====United States and Canada====

American and Canadian pancakes (sometimes called ''hotcakes'', ''griddlecakes'', or ''flapjacks'') are usually served at breakfast, in a stack of two or three, topped with real or artificial [[maple syrup]] and [[butter]]. They are often served with sides such as bacon, toast, eggs or sausage. Other popular topping alternatives include [[jam]], [[peanut butter]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit]], [[honey]], [[powdered sugar]], whipped cream, cane syrup, cinnamon and sugar, and [[molasses]]. In addition, when a pancake is occasionally served as a dessert, toppings such as [[ice cream]], [[chocolate syrup]], and various fruits are often used.

The thick batter contains eggs, flour, milk, and a [[raising agent]] such as [[baking powder]]. The batter can have ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], strawberries, bananas, apples, chocolate chips, cheese, or sugar added. Spices such as [[cinnamon]], vanilla and [[nutmeg]] can also be used. [[Yogurt]] may be used to give the pancakes a relatively moist consistency. Pancakes may be ⅓ inch (1&amp;nbsp;cm) thick and about 4 inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter.

=====Varieties of American and Canadian pancakes=====
&lt;!--Linked from above and [[Silver dollar]]--&gt;
''[[Bannock (food)|Bannock]]'' is common to virtually all North America's first peoples. The European version (Scotland) was traditionally made of oatmeal. The bannock of Aboriginal people was made of corn, nut meal and plant bulb meal. Each region had its own variation of flour and fruit. Today, bannock is most often deep-fried, pan-fried and oven-baked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/rsi/fnb/FNB.htm |title= Canadian Ministry of Forests (2000) "Bannock Awareness" | accessdate = 25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Johnnycake]]'' (also ''jonnycake'', ''johnny cake'', ''journey cake'' or ''Johnny Bread'') is a [[cornmeal]] [[flatbread]] that was an early American [[staple food]], and is still eaten in the [[West Indies]] and [[Bermuda]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Porter, Danforth Prince (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SI-AxOABRM8C&amp;pg=PA41 ''Frommer's 2010 Bermuda''], John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; The modern johnnycake is stereotypically identified with today's [[Rhode Island#Food and beverages|Rhode Island]] foods, though they are a cultural staple in all of the [[Northern United States|northern US]].&lt;ref name="necs"&gt;Smith, Peter W. (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IEnJBtqfRsC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s New England Country Store Cookbook], iUniverse&lt;/ref&gt; A modern johnnycake is fried cornmeal [[gruel]], which is made from yellow or white cornmeal mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and frequently lightly sweetened.

''Yaniqueques'' or ''yanikeke'' are a [[Dominican Republic]] version of the johnnycake. They are a fried bread rather than a pancake, and are a popular beach food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoy.com.do/vivir/2010/2/25/315391/Antojos-criollos Uribie, Millizen "Creole Cravings" '''Hoy Digital''' 25 February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301165115/http://www.hoy.com.do/vivir/2010/2/25/315391/Antojos-criollos |date=1 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dr1.com/news/2008/dnews121108.shtml#13|title=DR1 - Daily News Thursday, 11 December 2008|work=dr1.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sourdough]] was used by prospectors and pioneers to make pancakes without having to buy yeast. [[Prospecting|Prospectors]] would carry a pot of sourdough to make pancakes and bread, as it could last indefinitely, needing only flour and water to replenish it.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgwell, Jenny ''Finding Out About Food'' Oxford University Press Oxford (30 June 1983) {{ISBN|978-0-19-832716-5}} p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Sourdough pancakes are now a particular specialty in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;DuFresne, Jim; Aaron Sprizter ''Alaska'' Lonely Planet Publications; 6th Revised edition (1 April 2006) {{ISBN|978-1-74059-991-7}} p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''silver dollar pancake'' refers to a pancake about two to three inches (5 to 7&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, or just a bit bigger than the pre-1979 [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar coins in the United States]]. This is usually made by frying a small spoonful of the same batter as any other pancake. One serving usually consists of five to ten silver dollar pancakes.

''German pancakes'' or ''[[Dutch baby pancake]]s'' served in American pancake houses are bowl-shaped. They are eaten with lemons and powdered sugar, jam, or caramelized apples, as well as fritters. A [[David Eyre's pancake]] is a variation on the German pancake named for the American writer and editor David W. Eyre (1912–2008).

''[[Toutons]]'' are small, tall pancakes traditional in [[Newfoundland]]. They are usually served with dark molasses.

===Oceania===

====Australia and New Zealand====
In Australia and New Zealand, small pancakes (about 75&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) known as ''pikelets'' are also eaten. They are traditionally served with jam or whipped cream, or solely with butter, at afternoon tea, but can also be served at morning tea. They are made with milk, self-raising flour, eggs, and a small amount of [[icing sugar]].

In some circles in New Zealand, very thin, crêpe-like or English pancake-like pancakes (around {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} in diameter) are served with butter, or butter and lemon, sugar, and then rolled up and eaten.

American-style pancakes are also popular. They are eaten for breakfast or as a dessert, with lemon juice and sugar, butter and maple syrup, stewed fruits such as strawberries and cream, ice cream, or [[mascarpone]].

===South America===

====Brazil====
{{lang|pt|[[Tapioca]]}} ({{IPA-pt|tɐpiˈɔkɐ}}), {{lang|pt|beiju}} ({{IPA-pt|bejˈʒu|}}) or {{lang|pt|biju}} ({{IPA-pt|biˈʒu|}}) are cassava (manioc) starch flour unleavened pancakes. They are slightly thicker than crêpes and can be eaten plain or with sweet or savoury toppings. Tapioca flour must be moistened and strained through a sieve to become a coarse flour. The heat of an ungreased hot griddle or pan makes the starchy grains fuse into a flatbread which resembles a grainy pancake. Popular {{lang|pt|tapioca}} toppings include molten butter and dried, shredded coconut.

{{lang|pt|Panquecas}} ({{IPA-pt|pɐ̃ˈkɛkɐs|}}) are generally made from cow's milk and refined wheat flour, and generally eaten with savoury fillings as rolls (although dessert {{lang|pt|panquecas}} also exist). For those with celiac disease, corn starch might substitute for the wheat flour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquinacozinha.com/panqueca-receita-basica-sem-gluten-especial-dia-internacional-dos-celiacos/ Panqueca: Receita básica sem glúten – Especial Dia Internacional dos Celíacos – Aqui na Cozinha]. 20 May 2012. Retrieved 5 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Common fillings include shredded, seasoned chicken breast with tomato paste/sauce, and ground beef, seasoned with fried onion cubes or fried salted smashed garlic ({{lang|pt|[[refogado]]}}), and often bell pepper cubes and tomato paste/sauce. Both kinds are generally topped with Parmesan cheese. Vegan recipes also exist, with texturized soy protein ({{lang|pt|carne de soja}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈkaʁni dʒi ˈsɔʒɐ|}}) being particularly popular. Savoury {{lang|pt|panqueca}} is generally eaten for lunch or dinner, accompanied of white rice and salad, and less often pulses (prominently the beans Brazilian cuisine is famous for).

The exotic Brazilian pancake {{lang|pt|blinis}} ({{IPA-pt|bɫiˈnis|}}) is made from a mixture of coconut milk ({{lang|pt|leite de coco}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈlejtʃi dʒi ˈkoku|}}) and {{lang|pt|[[:pt:Puba|puba]]}} ({{IPA-pt|ˈpuβɐ|}}), a paste extracted from fermented cassava, most prominent in the cuisines of the [[North Region, Brazil|Northern]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] regions and relatively unknown elsewhere. The resulting product is significantly more watery, filling and strongly flavored than the unfermented {{lang|pt|tapioca}}, and care should be taken in rolling the pancakes if desired because it breaks very easily. Common toppings include molten butter and common sorts of savoury {{lang|pt|panqueca}} filling, but creative recipes might arise, such as fake [[lasagne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquinacozinha.com/lasanha-de-panqueca-de-puba-com-carne-seca/ Puba pancake lasagna with beef jerky filling – Aqui na Cozinha]. 30 November 2011.

In the US, Mexico and Canada, the franchised restaurant chain [[IHOP|International House of Pancakes]] (IHOP) serves pancakes all day. [[The Original Pancake House]] is another chain of pancake restaurants across the US, and [[Walker Bros.|Walker Brothers]] is a series of pancake houses in the [[Chicago area]] that developed as a franchised spin-off of The Original Pancake House.

The popularity of pancakes in Australia has spawned the [[Pancake Parlour]] and Pancakes on the Rocks franchised restaurants. In [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], Canada, the restaurant chain De Dutch serves Dutch and Flemish-style pannenkoeken.

[[Pancake syndrome]] is an allergic reaction which some people have after eating pancakes in tropical regions where certain mites can contaminate the flour in pancakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pancake syndrome (oral mite anaphylaxis)|journal = The World Allergy Organization Journal|date = 1 May 2009|issn = 1939-4551|pmc = 3651046|pmid = 23283016|pages = 91–96|volume = 2|issue = 5|doi = 10.1097/WOX.0b013e3181a0db50|first = Mario|last = Sánchez-Borges|first2 = Raúl|last2 = Suárez-Chacon|first3 = Arnaldo|last3 = Capriles-Hulett|first4 = Fernan|last4 = Caballero-Fonseca|first5 = Victor|last5 = Iraola|first6 = Enrique|last6 = Fernández-Caldas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pancakes are traditionally eaten on [[Shrove Tuesday]], which is known as "Pancake Day" in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Presbyterian Church in Canada |work=The Presbyterian Church in Canada |url=http://www.presbyterian.ca/webfm_send/1974 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305031205/http://www.presbyterian.ca/webfm_send/1974 |archivedate=5 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pancake Day (Shrove Tuesday), in the UK |work=British Embassy, Washington DC |url=http://www.britainusa.com/sections/articles_show_nt1.asp?d=0&amp;i=60062&amp;L1=0&amp;L2=0&amp;a=41276| accessdate=17 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223204148/http://www.britainusa.com/sections/articles_show_nt1.asp?d=0&amp;i=60062&amp;L1=0&amp;L2=0&amp;a=41276 &lt;!--Bot-retrieved archive--&gt; |archivedate=23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shrove Tuesday – Pancake Day! |work=Irish Culture and Customs |url=http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/ACalend/ShroveTues.html |accessdate=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, and Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Easter in Australia |work=The Australian Government Culture and Recreation Portal |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/easter/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318003922/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/easter/ |archivedate=18 March 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Pancake Tuesday" in Ireland and Scotland. (Shrove Tuesday is better known in the United States, France, and other countries as [[Mardi Gras]] or [[Fat Tuesday]].) Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fat or lard was used up before [[Lent]]. No meat products should be eaten during Lent.
[[File:EnglishPancakeRace.jpg|thumb|left|A pancake race in England]]
Charity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a "pancake race" each participant carries a pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated in [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney, England]] in 1445 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of [[St Peter]] and [[Saint Paul (apostle)|St Paul]]'s Church calling her to the [[Confession (religion)|Shriving]] Service. Eager to get to church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning, and still wearing her [[apron]] and headscarf.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/lent_1.shtml |title=The origin of pancake racing |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukstudentlife.com/Ideas/Album/Olney-Pancake-Race.htm|title=Olney Pancake Race|work=ukstudentlife.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950, the towns of Olney&lt;ref name="Olney race"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olney100.ning.com/video/pancake-race-2007-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206193125/http://olney100.ning.com/video/pancake-race-2007-1|archivedate=6 February 2010|title=Pancake Race 2007|work=archive.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], [[Kansas]] have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women's race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren and for men.

The Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]), the upper house (the [[House of Lords]]), and the [[Fourth Estate]], contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions.

'''Porridge'''&lt;ref name = "oed" /&gt; (also historically spelled '''porage''', '''porrige''', '''parritch''') is a [[food]] commonly eaten as a [[breakfast cereal]] dish, made by boiling ground, crushed or chopped starchy plants—typically [[grain]]—in [[water]] or [[milk]]. It is often cooked or served with added flavorings such as [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit]] or [[syrup]] to make a sweet cereal or mixed with spices or vegetables to make a savoury dish. It is usually served hot in a bowl.

==Type of grains==
[[File:Cooked oatmeal in bowl (low angle).jpg|thumb|Cooked oatmeal in a bowl]]
The term "porridge" is often used specifically for [[oat]] porridge, which is eaten for breakfast with salt, sugar, fruit, milk, cream or butter and sometimes other flavorings. Oat porridge is also sold in ready-made or partly cooked form as an [[instant breakfast]].

Other grains used for porridge include [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[maize|corn]], [[triticale]] and [[buckwheat]]. Many types of porridge have their own names, such as [[polenta]], [[grits]] and [[kasha]].

==Origins==
Porridge is a [[staple food]] in much of Africa and historically was also a staple in much of [[Northern Europe]] and Russia.

==Conventional uses==
Porridge is easy to digest, so it is traditionally used in many cultures as a food for the sick and is often eaten by [[Sportsperson|athletes]] in training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Roxanne|title=Eat like an athlete - Beckie Herbert|work=[[BBC Food|BBC Good Food]]|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]]|url=http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/eat-athlete-beckie-herbert|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chappell|first=Bill|title=Athletes And The Foods They Eat: Don't Try This At Home|work=The Torch|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=25 July 2012|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetorch/2012/07/25/157370171/athletes-and-the-foods-they-eat-dont-try-this-at-home|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall|first=David|authorlink=David Randall|title=Cursed!

==Nutrition &amp; Health Benefits==
The high nutrition levels in porridge oats have led it to be labelled as a [[superfood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zghqmp3 |title= Is porridge the king of breakfasts? |website= www.bbc.co.uk |publisher= BBC |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porridge oats, as with many whole-grain cereals, are high in fibre – especially [[beta-glucan]], and are a rich source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidans. In fact, whole oats are one of the few known sources of a unique group of antioxidants called [[avenanthramides]], which are believed to have protective effects against heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/oats |title= Oats 101: Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits |website= www.healthline.com|publisher= Healthline |date= 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a daily intake of at least 3 grams of oat β-glucan lowers total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 5-10% in people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21631511|year=2011|author1=Othman|first1=R. A|title=Cholesterol-lowering effects of oat β-glucan|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=69|issue=6|pages=299–309|last2=Moghadasian|first2=M. H|last3=Jones|first3=P.

Porridge oats are also rich in [[B Vitamins]], which are vital for nervous system and brain function, along with [[Selenium]] – an important antioxidant for healthy brain chemistry, DNA repair and is associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer. [[Ferulic acid]], which is also prominent in porridge oats, is also known to be an antioxidant that protects the colon from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/health/real-food-porridge-is-not-sexy-but-it-is-a-superfood-26686680.html |title= Real Food: Porridge is not sexy, but it is a superfood |website= www.independent.ie |publisher= Irish Independent |date= 4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research into the anti-inflammatory effects of porridge oats is ongoing, but there have already been positive indicators that regular consumption could prevent inflammation related to a number of chronic diseases, owing to the high avenanthramide levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/5368076/is-oatmeal-healthy-good-for-you |title= Is oatmeal healthy? Here’s what the experts say |website= www.Time.com|publisher= Time |date= 15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porridge is often recommended for weight loss due to its low calorie count – at 171 calories per bowl – and its low [[glycemic index]] (GI) means they increase blood sugar levels gradually and over a longer period of time, reducing hunger and the likelihood of eating less healthy snacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/06/porridge-breakfast |title= Why porridge is the new power breakfast |website= www.guardian.com|publisher= The Guardian |date= 6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of oats====
[[File:William Hemsley Porridge.jpg|thumb|''Porridge'' by [[William Hemsley (painter)|William Hemsley]] (1893)]]
Oats for porridge may be whole ([[groats]]), cut into two or three pieces (called "pinhead", "steel-cut" or "coarse" oatmeal), ground into medium or fine [[oatmeal]] or steamed and rolled into flakes of varying sizes and thicknesses (called "rolled oats", the largest size being "jumbo"). The larger the pieces of oat used, the more textured the resulting porridge. It is said that, because of their size and shape, the body breaks steel-cut oats down more slowly than rolled oats, reducing spikes in [[blood sugar]] and making the eater feel full longer.&lt;ref name=redmill&gt;{{cite web|title=Steel Cut, Rolled, Instant, Scottish? (Marisa's comment, November 10, 2012 at 9:46 am) |url=http://www.bobsredmill.com/blog/2011/01/20/steel-cut-rolled-instant-scottish/|work=Bob's Red Mill |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' Web site found that the more cooking required, the stronger the oat flavor and the less mushy the texture.&lt;ref name=cu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-nutrition/healthy-foods/cereals/oatmeal/overview/oatmeal-ov.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410215224/http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-nutrition/healthy-foods/cereals/oatmeal/overview/oatmeal-ov.htm|archivedate=10 April 2012|title=For best oatmeal taste, be patient |date=November 2008|accessdate=3 April 2013 |work=[[Consumer Reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oats are a good source of dietary fibre; health benefits are claimed for [[Oat#Soluble fiber|oat bran]] in particular, which is part of the grain.

====Preparation====
The oats are cooked in milk, water or a mixture of the two. [[Scotland|Scottish]] traditionalists allow only oats, water and salt.&lt;ref name=cloake&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/nov/10/how-to-cook-perfect-porridge How to cook perfect porridge], Felicity Cloake, ''The Guardian'', 10 November 2011. An article by an expert who has systematically tried many variants to get the best result.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, it is left overnight on a banked-up (barely alight) cooking range or in smouldering fire ashes, possibly due to religious (sabbatarian) restrictions spreading to daily usage. There are techniques suggested by cooks, such as pre-soaking, but a comparative test documented in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' found very little difference in the end result.&lt;ref name=cloake/&gt;

Various flavorings can be used and can vary widely by taste and locality. [[Demerara sugar]], [[golden syrup]], [[Greek yoghurt]] and [[honey]], and even [[langoustine]] tails and [[scallops]] have been employed for this purpose. A girdle of very cold milk or single cream is believed to be essential by some, traditionally served in a separate bowl to keep it cold.&lt;ref name=cloake/&gt; Glaswegians typically use canned evaporated milk and jam. Use of whisky, rum or sherry have been reported. Cooking time can be adjusted to preference, but simmering for ten minutes is typical for non-instant oatmeal. Instant oatmeal, including flavored instant oatmeal, is common and can be prepared with the application of hot water.

===Rice===

* [[Rice]] porridge:

==History==

===Northern Europe===
Historically, porridge was a [[staple food]] in much of Northern Europe, North Korea, and Russia. It was often made from [[barley]], though other grains and yellow peas could be used, depending on local conditions. It was primarily a savoury dish, with meats, root crops, vegetables and herbs added for flavor. Porridge could be cooked in a large metal [[kettle]] over hot coals or heated in a cheaper [[earthenware]] container by adding hot stones until boiling hot. Until [[Leavening agent|leavened]] bread and baking ovens became commonplace in Europe, porridge was a typical means of preparing cereal crops for the table.

Porridge was also commonly used as [[prison food]] for inmates in the British prison system, and so "doing porridge" became a slang term for a sentence in prison.

'''Iẓnajen'''; {{lang-ar|صنهاجة}}, ''Ṣanhaja'') were once one of the largest North African tribal confederations, along with the [[Zanata|Iznaten]] and [[Masmuda|Imesmuden]] confederations.&lt;ref name=locmorocco&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold D.|title=Morocco, a country study|year=1985|publisher=The American University|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=14|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001298165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanhaja traced their lineage back to the Himyar who are people of Southern Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rySrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60|title=Genealogy and Knowledge in Muslim Societies: Understanding the Past|last=Savant|first=Sarah Bowen|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748644988|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timbuktuheritage.org/people.html|title=Timbuktuheritage.org - People of Timbukru|website=www.timbuktuheritage.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many tribes in Morocco and Mauritania bore and still carry this ethnonym, especially in its Berber form. Other names for the population include  ''Zenaga'', ''Sanhája'', ''Znaga'', ''Sanhâdja'' and  ''Senhaja''. 

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Dansgroep uit de westelijke Sahara tijdens het Nationaal Folkore Festival te Marrakech TMnr 20017655.jpg|thumb|Dance group of Sanhaja from the western Sahara at the National Folklore Festival at [[Marrakech]]]]
After the arrival of Islam, the Sanhaja spread out to the borders of the Sudan as far as the Senegal River and the Niger. From the 9th century, Sanhaja tribes were established in the Middle Atlas range, in the [[Rif Mountains]] and on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. A part of the Sanhaja, such as the Kutâma, settled in central/eastern Algeria and northern Niger. They played an important part in the rise of the [[Fatimids]]. The Sanhaja dynasties of the Zirids and Hammâdids controlled [[Ifriqiya]] until the 12th century.

In the mid-11th century, a group of Sanhaja chieftains returning from the [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to Mecca) invited the theologian Ibn Yasin to preach among their tribes. Ibn Yasin united the tribes in the alliance of the [[Almoravids]] in the middle of the 11th century. This confederacy subsequently established Morocco, and conquered western Algeria and Al-Andalus (part of present-day Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Znaga or Zenaga tribes would remain in roles as either exploited semi-sedentary agriculturalists and fishermen (Znaga tribes), or, higher up on the social ladder, as religious (Marabout or Zawiya) tribes. Though often [[Arabization|Arabized]] in culture and language, they are believed to be descended from the Zenata or Sanhaja Berber population present in the area before the arrival of the Arab [[Maqil]] tribes in the 12th century, which was finally subjected to domination by Arab-descended warrior castes in the 17th century [[Char Bouba war]]&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+mr0052)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018}} according to Mercer, the word "znaga" is thought to be a distortion of "Zeneta and Sanhaja".

==Present day==
[[File:Sanhajas de Srayr.PNG|thumb|Map of the Sanhaja de Srayr tribes and their respective territories]]
The descendants of the Sanhaja are still found today in the [[Middle Atlas]] mountains and eastern Morocco.

The Zenaga, a group believed to be of [[Godala|Gudala]] (the southernmost Sanhaja tribe) origin, inhabit southwestern Mauritania and parts of northern Senegal. However, they are a small population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+mr0052) "Sanhaja tribe"], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">The phrase '''"sick man of Asia"''' or '''"sick man of East Asia"''' (Chinese Simplified: 东亚病夫, dong ya bing fu) originally referred to [[China]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when it was riven by internal divisions and taken advantage of by the [[great powers]]. China was forced to sign a series of [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]], culminating in the Japanese invasion of China during [[World War II]]. The phrase may be considered derogatory, as it mocks Chinese government and the Chinese people for being weak. The phrase was intended as a parallel to "[[sick man of Europe]]", referring to the weakening [[Ottoman Empire]] during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = China and the international system, 1840-1949: power, presence, and perceptions in a century of humiliation| first = David | last = Scott| publisher = [[State University of New York Press]] | year = 2008 | page = 9| isbn = 978-0-7914-7627-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the "sick man of Europe" term, it has also been used to refer to numerous other Asian countries.

In 2014 at the Euromoney Philippines Investment Forum 2014, President [[Benigno Aquino III]] of the [[Philippines]] publicly defended his country from being labelled as the new "sick man of Asia", citing a Japan External Trade Organization survey that showed "the Philippines as the second most profitable among ASEAN-5 countries, next to Thailand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Ron|title=Aquino: Philippines ‘Sick Man of Asia’ no more|url=https://ph.news.yahoo.com/aquino-philippines-sick-man-asia-no-more-125618190.html|accessdate=19 June 2014|agency=Manila Bulletin|date=Feb 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for the perceptions Aquino was defending against include its unequal growth and massive poverty, in which from 2000 to 2006 its nominal income grew by 37% while its [[Gini coefficient]] only fell by 5%.&lt;ref name= EP&gt;NSO. ''Philippines in Figures 2010.'' Philippines: Republic of the Philippines National Statistics Office. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause for the "Sick Man" label includes massive Filipino political corruption scandals such as the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam]].

'''USA-128''', also known as '''GPS IIA-18''', '''GPS II-27''' and '''GPS SVN-30''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the eighteenth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-128 was launched at 08:49:00 UTC on 12 September 1996, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D238, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-128 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1996, USA-128 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20058|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20305|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.94 minutes, and 54.7 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts the PRN 30 signal, and operates in slot 2 of plane B of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}.
