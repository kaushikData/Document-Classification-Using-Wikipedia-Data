'''Adolf Overweg''' (July 24, 1822 &amp;ndash; September 27, 1852) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geology|geologist]], [[astronomy|astronomer]], and traveler from [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/436046/Adolf-Overweg |title=Overweg, Adolf |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |author= |date=June 1, 2014 |accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a member of a mission to fix trade routes in [[Central Africa]] he became the first person of [[Europe]]an origin to circumnavigate [[Lake Chad]] by boat.

In 1849, he joined a 3-man expedition under the command of [[James Richardson (explorer of the Sahara)|James Richardson]] and [[Heinrich Barth]] (who later took command after Richardson's death). They set to leave [[Tripoli]] in the Spring of 1850 in order to help the British government forge relations with central African kingdoms and explore unknown territory there. They crossed the [[Sahara]] carrying a boat on the backs of camels, splitting up in 1851 with Overweg trekking by route of [[Zinder]] to [[Kukawa]], rejoining expedition scientist (now leader) Heinrich Barth.  After 18 months of exploring the [[Adamawa Emirate]], [[Benue River]], and finally completing his most notable feat of circumnavigating [[Lake Chad]], he died of an unknown illness in [[Maduari]], [[Chad]] after swimming in cold waters.&lt;ref name=kemper/&gt;

Barth and Overweg were close friends. Barth wrote of Overweg's great talents as a scientist and observer, but his lack of discipline in keeping orderly notes, and his youthful disregard for his own safety doomed him to obscurity and an early death in the prime of his youth.&lt;ref name=kemper&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=Labyrinth of Kingdoms: 10,000 Miles Through Islamic Africa |publisher=[[W.

'''Agrophysics''' is a branch of science bordering on [[agronomy]] and [[physics]],
whose objects of study are the [[agroecosystem]] - the biological [[Physical body|object]]s, [[biotope]] and [[biocoenosis]] affected by [[human activity]], studied and described using the methods of [[physical science]]s.  Using the achievements of the exact sciences to solve major problems in agriculture, agrophysics involves the study of materials and processes occurring in the production and processing of agricultural crops, with particular emphasis on the condition of the environment and the quality of farming materials and food production.

Agrophysics is closely related to [[biophysics]], but is restricted to the [[biology]] of the [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[soil]] and an [[atmosphere]] involved in [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities and [[biodiversity]]. It is different from biophysics in having the necessity of taking into account the specific features of [[biotope]] and [[biocoenosis]], which involves the knowledge of [[Nutrition|nutritional science]] and [[agroecology]], [[Agricultural Science|agricultural technology]], [[biotechnology]], [[genetics]] etc.

The needs of agriculture, concerning the past experience study of the local complex soil and next plant-atmosphere systems, lay at the root of the emergence of a new branch – agrophysics – dealing this with experimental physics.
The scope of the branch starting from [[soil science]] (physics) and originally limited to the study of relations within the soil environment, expanded over time onto influencing the properties of agricultural crops and produce as foods and [[Postharvest|raw postharvest]] materials, and onto the issues of quality, [[safety]] and [[labeling]] concerns, considered distinct from the field of nutrition for application in food science.

Research centres focused on the development of the agrophysical sciences include the [[Bohdan Dobrzański Institute of Agrophysics|Institute of Agrophysics]], [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in [[Lublin]], and the [[Agrophysical Research Institute]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[St. Petersburg]].

An '''armillary sphere''' (variations are known as '''spherical astrolabe''', '''armilla''', or '''armil''') is a model of [[astronomical object|objects]] in the sky (on the [[celestial sphere]]), consisting of a spherical framework of rings, centred on [[Earth]] or the [[Sun]], that represent lines of [[celestial coordinate system|celestial longitude and latitude]] and other astronomically important features, such as the [[ecliptic]]. As such, it differs from a [[celestial globe]], which is a smooth sphere whose principal purpose is to map the [[constellation]]s. It was invented separately in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient China]], with later use in the [[Islamic world]] and [[Medieval Europe]].

With the Earth as center, an armillary sphere is known as ''[[geocentric model|Ptolemaic]]''. With the Sun as center, it is known as ''[[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Armilla|volume=2|pages=575–576|last=Huggins |first=Margaret Lindsay |authorlink=Margaret Lindsay Huggins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[flag of Portugal]] features an armillary sphere. The armillary sphere is also featured in Portuguese [[heraldry]], associated with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] during the [[Age of Exploration]]. In the flag of [[Empire of Brazil]], the armillary sphere  is also featured.

== Description and use ==
&lt;!-- The following is copied from the first edition of EB, with what are hoped to be minor conversions (contributor hopes "fhewing" is now spelled "showing"). Further editing to current usage is encouraged, as is the removal of this soon-obsoleted comment. --&gt;
''This section refers to labels in the diagram below.''
[[Image:EB1711 Armillary Sphere.png|thumb|upright|left|Armillary sphere diagram]]

The exterior parts of this machine are a compages [or framework] of brass rings, which represent the principal circles of the heavens.

# The equinoctial ''A'', which is divided into 360 degrees (beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in Aries) for showing the sun's [[right ascension]] in degrees; and also into 24 hours, for showing its right ascension in time.
# The ecliptic ''B'', which is divided into 12 signs, and each sign into 30 degrees, and also into the months and days of the year; in such a manner, that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is, on any given day, stands over that day in the circle of months.
# The [[tropic of Cancer]] ''C'', touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Cancer in ''e'', and the [[tropic of Capricorn]] ''D'', touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Capricorn in ''f''; each 23½ degrees from the equinoctial circle.
# The [[Arctic Circle]] ''E'', and the [[Antarctic Circle]] ''F'', each 23½ degrees from its respective pole at ''N'' and ''S''.
# The [[equinoctial colure]] ''G'', passing through the north and south poles of the heaven at ''N'' and ''S'', and through the equinoctial points Aries and Libra, in the ecliptic.
# The [[solstitial colure]] ''H'', passing through the poles of the heaven, and through the solstitial points Cancer and Capricorn, in the ecliptic.  Each quarter of the former of these [[colure]]s is divided into 90 degrees, from the equinoctial to the poles of the world, for showing the [[declination]] of the sun, moon, and stars; and each quarter of the latter, from the ecliptic as ''e'' and ''f'', to its poles ''b'' and ''d'', for showing the [[Celestial latitude|latitude]] of the stars.

In the north pole of the ecliptic is a nut ''b'', to which is fixed one end of the quadrantal wire, and to the other end a small sun ''Y'', which is carried round the ecliptic ''B''—''B'', by turning the nut : and in the south pole of the ecliptic is a pin ''d'', on which is another quadrantal wire, with a small moon ''Ζ'' upon it, which may be moved round by hand : but there is a particular contrivance for causing the moon to move in an orbit which crosses the ecliptic at an angle of 5⅓ degrees, to opposite points called the ''moon's nodes''; and also for shifting these points backward in the ecliptic, as the ''moon's nodes'' shift in the heaven.

Within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe ''I'', fixed on an axis ''K'', which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at ''n'' and ''s'', to those of the celestial sphere at ''N'' and ''S''. On this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian ''L L'', which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe, so as to keep over the same meridian upon it. This flat meridian is graduated the same way as the brass meridian of the common globe, and its use is much the same. To this globe is fitted the movable horizon ''M'', so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe, and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator, which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator. The globe may be turned by hand within this ring, so as to place any given meridian upon it, directly under the celestial meridian ''L''. The horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge, within which are the points of the compass, for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon, both in degrees and points. The celestial meridian ''L'' passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon, as in a common globe: both here, if the globe be turned round, the horizon and meridian turn with it. At the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours, fixed to the rings, and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle, if the globe be turned round its axis.

[[File:Utagawa Kuniyoshi, Portrait of Chicasei Goyô (Wu Yong) (1827–1830).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Chitasei Go Yō ([[Wu Yong]]), by Japanese artist [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] (1798–1861)]]
The whole fabric is supported on a pedestal ''N'', and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint ''O'', to any number of degrees from 0 to 90, by means of the arc ''P'', which is fixed in the strong brass arm ''Q'', and slides in the upright piece ''R'', in which is a screw at ''r'', to fix it at any proper elevation.

In the box ''T'' are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes come out at ''V'' and ''U''; either of which may be turned by the small winch ''W''. When the winch is put upon the axis ''V'', and turn backward, the terrestrial globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun ''Y'', and moon ''Z'', round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis ''U'', and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.

And so, by this construction, the machine is equally fitted to show either the real motion of the earth, or the apparent motion of the heaven.

To rectify the sphere for use, first slacken the screw ''r'' in the upright stem ''R'', and taking hold of the arm ''Q'', move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place be at the side of the stem ''R''; and then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated, so as to stand parallel to the axis of the world, if the machine be set north and south by a small compass: this done, count the latitude from the north pole, upon the celestial meridian ''L'', down towards the north notch of the horizon, and set the horizon to that latitude; then, turn the nut ''b'' until the sun ''Y'' comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic, and the sun will be at its proper place for that day: find the place of the moon's ascending node, and also the place of the moon, by an Ephemeris, and set them right accordingly: lastly, turn the winch ''W'', until either the sun comes to the meridian ''L'', or until the meridian comes to the sun (according as you want the sphere or earth to move) and set the hour-index to the XII, marked noon, and the whole machine will be rectified. — Then turn the winch, and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon, and the hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day.&lt;ref&gt;Elements of the general description incorporate text from the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' First Edition (1771).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout [[China|Chinese]] history, [[astronomer]]s have created '''celestial globes''' ({{zh|s=浑象}}) to assist the observation of the stars. The Chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding [[calendar|calendrical]] computations and calculations.

According to Needham, the earliest development of the armillary sphere in China goes back to the astronomers [[Shi Shen]] and [[Gan De]] in the 4th century BC, as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 343"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 343.&lt;/ref&gt; This would have allowed them to measure the north polar distance (declination) a measurement that gave the position in a ''xiu'' (right ascension).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 343"/&gt; Needham's 4th century dating, however, is rejected by British sinologist [[Christopher Cullen]], who traces the beginnings of these devices to the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Cullen, "Joseph Needham on Chinese Astronomy", ''Past and Present'', No. 87 (May, 1980), pp. 39–53 (45)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Western Han Dynasty]] (202 BC{{snd}}9 AD) additional developments made by the astronomers [[Luoxia Hong]] ([[:zh:落下闳]]), Xiangyu Wangren, and Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution. In 52 BC, it was the astronomer Geng Shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 343"/&gt; In the subsequent [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (23–220 AD) period, the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the elliptical ring by 84 AD.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 343"/&gt; With the famous statesman, astronomer, and inventor [[Zhang Heng]] (张衡, 78–139 AD), the sphere was totally complete in 125 AD, with horizon and meridian rings.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 343"/&gt; The world's first water-powered celestial globe was created by Zhang Heng, who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock (see Zhang's article for more detail).

Subsequent developments were made after the Han Dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere. In 323 AD the Chinese astronomer Kong Ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 343"/&gt; The Chinese astronomer and mathematician [[Li Chunfeng]] (李淳風) of the [[Tang dynasty]] created one in 633 AD with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations, calling them 'nests' (chhung).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 343"/&gt; He was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a sighting tube mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes. However, it was the Tang Chinese astronomer, mathematician, and monk [[Yi Xing]] in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 350"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of Zhou Cong and Shu Yijian in 1050, as well as Shen Kuo's armillary sphere of the later 11th century, but after that point they were no longer employed on Chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the [[Europeans in Medieval China|European Jesuits]].

[[Image:ChineseCelestialGlobe.JPG|thumbnail|upright|Celestial globe from the [[Qing Dynasty]]]]
In 723 AD, Yi Xing (一行) and government official Liang Ling-zan (梁令瓚) combined Zhang Heng's water powered celestial globe with an [[escapement]] device. With drums hit every quarter-hour and bells rung automatically every full hour, the device was also a [[striking clock]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 473–475.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[clock tower]] that the Chinese polymath [[Su Song]] built by 1094 during the [[Song Dynasty]] would employ Yi Xing's escapement with waterwheel scoops filled by clepsydra drip, and powered a crowning armillary sphere, a central celestial globe, and mechanically operated manikins that would exit mechanically opened doors of the clock tower at specific times to ring bells and gongs to announce the time, or to hold plaques announcing special times of the day. There was also the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments: the [[gnomon]], armillary sphere, clepsydra clock, and sighting tube fixed to observe the [[pole star]] indefinitely.&lt;ref name="sivin III 17"&gt;Sivin, III, 17&lt;/ref&gt; When Jamal al-Din of Bukhara was asked to set up an 'Islamic Astronomical Institution' in Khubilai Khan's new capital during the [[Yuan Dynasty]], he commissioned a number of astronomical instruments, including an armillary sphere. It was noted that "Chinese astronomers had been building [them] since at least 1092".&lt;ref&gt;S.

The [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190{{snd}}c. 120 BC) credited [[Eratosthenes]] (276{{snd}}194 BC) as the inventor of the armillary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter William Bryant: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8fFiqPRd1XYC A History of Astronomy]'', 1907, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Ferguson: ''Callimachus'', 1980, {{ISBN|978-0-8057-6431-4}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. King: ''The History of the Telescope'', 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43265-6}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dirk L. Couprie, Robert Hahn, Gerard Naddaf: ''Anaximander in Context: New Studies in the Origins of Greek Philosophy'', 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5537-1}}, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The name of this device comes ultimately from the [[Latin]] ''armilla'' (circle, bracelet), since it has a skeleton made of graduated metal circles linking the [[celestial pole|pole]]s and representing the [[equator]], the [[ecliptic]], [[meridian (astronomy)|meridians]] and [[Circle of latitude|parallel]]s. Usually a ball representing the [[Earth]] or, later, the [[Sun]] is placed in its center. It is used to demonstrate the [[celestial mechanics|motion]] of the [[star]]s around the Earth. Before the advent of the European [[telescope]] in the 17th century, the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions.

[[File:Ptolemy 1476 with armillary sphere model.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Ptolemy]] with an armillary sphere model'', by [[Joos van Ghent]] and [[Pedro Berruguete]], 1476, [[Louvre]], Paris]]

In its simplest form, consisting of a ring fixed in the plane of the equator, the ''armilla'' is one of the most ancient of astronomical instruments. Slightly developed, it was crossed by another ring fixed in the plane of the meridian. The first was an equinoctial, the second a solstitial armilla. Shadows were used as indices of the sun's positions, in combinations with angular divisions. When several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens, the instrument became an armillary sphere.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Armillary spheres were developed by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Greeks]] and were used as teaching tools already in the 3rd century BC. In larger and more precise forms they were also used as observational instruments. However, the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century AD, during the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia britannica armillary sphere"/&gt; Eratosthenes most probably used a solstitial armilla for measuring the [[obliquity]] of the ecliptic. Hipparchus probably used an armillary sphere of four rings.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia britannica armillary sphere"&gt;Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica. (16 November 2006). "[https://www.britannica.com/science/armillary-sphere Armillary Sphere]." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Accessed 14 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographer and astronomer [[Ptolemy]] (c. 100–170 AD) describes his instrument, the ''astrolabon'', in his ''[[Almagest]]''.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia britannica armillary sphere"/&gt; It consisted of at least three rings, with a graduated circle inside of which another could slide, carrying two small tubes positioned opposite each other and supported by a vertical plumb-line.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia britannica armillary sphere"/&gt;

[[Islamic astronomy|Persian and Arab astronomers]] produced an improved version of the Greek armillary sphere in the 8th century, and wrote about it in the treatise of ''Dhat al-Halaq'' or ''The instrument with the rings'' by the Persian astronomer [[Ibrahim al-Fazari|Fazari]] (d.c. 777). [[Abbas Ibn Firnas]] (d.887) is thought to have produced another instrument with rings (armillary sphere) in the 9th century which he gave to Caliph Muhammad I (ruled 852–886).&lt;ref&gt;Al-Makkari, (ed. 1986), ''Nafh Al-Teeb'', Volume 4. Dar Al-Fikre, Egypt, pp. 348–349.&lt;/ref&gt; The spherical astrolabe, a variation of both the [[astrolabe]] and the armillary sphere, was invented during the [[Middle Ages]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]].&lt;ref&gt;Emilie Savage-Smith (1993). "Book Reviews", ''Journal of Islamic Studies'' '''4''' (2), pp. 296–299. {{quote|"There is no evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the spherical astrolabe, but rather evidence so far available suggests that it may have been an early but distinctly Islamic development with no Greek antecedents."}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 550 AD, Christian philosopher John Philoponus wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Modern editions of [[John Philoponus]]' treatise on the astrolabe are ''De usu astrolabii eiusque constructione libellus'' (On the Use and Construction of the Astrolabe), ed. Heinrich Hase, Bonn: E. Weber, 1839, {{OCLC|165707441}} (or id. Rheinisches Museum für Philologie 6 (1839): 127–71); repr. and translated into French by Alain Philippe Segonds, ''Jean Philopon, traité de l'astrolabe,'' Paris: Librairie Alain Brieux, 1981, {{OCLC|10467740}}; and translated into English by H.W.

London: Holland Press, 1976, {{OL|14132393M }} pp. 61–81.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates back to the Persian astronomer [[Al-Nayrizi|Nayrizi]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 892–902). Muslim astronomers also independently invented the celestial globe, which were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy. Today, 126 such instruments remain worldwide, the oldest from the 11th century. The altitude of the sun, or the [[Right Ascension]] and [[Declination]] of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] ring of the globe.

[[File:Représentation ottomane sphère armilaire - XVIe.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] illustration of an armillary sphere, 16th century]]
The armillary sphere was reintroduced to [[Western Europe]] via [[Al-Andalus]] in the late 10th century with the efforts of Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later [[Pope Sylvester II]] (r. 999–1003).&lt;ref&gt;Darlington, 467–472.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Sylvester II applied the use of sighting tubes with his armillary sphere in order to fix the position of the [[pole star]] and record measurements for the [[tropics]] and [[equator]].&lt;ref&gt;Darlington, 679–670.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===
Chinese ideas of astronomy and astronomical instruments were introduced to Korea, where further advancements were also made. [[Jang Yeong-sil]], a [[Korean people|Korean]] inventor, was ordered by [[King Sejong the Great of Joseon]] to build an armillary sphere. The sphere, built in 1433 was named Honcheonui (혼천의).

The [[Honcheonsigye]], an armillary sphere activated by a working clock mechanism was built by the Korean astronomer Song Iyeong in 1669. It is the only remaining astronomical clock from the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. The mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of
Sejong era's armillary sphere (Honŭi 渾儀, 1435) and celestial sphere (Honsang 渾象, 1435), and the Jade Clepsydra (Ongnu 玉漏, 1438)'s sun-carriage apparatus. Such mechanisms are similar to Ch'oe Yu-ji (崔攸之, 1603~1673)'s armillary sphere(1657). The structure of time going train and the mechanism of striking-release in the part of clock is influenced by the crown escapement which has been developed from 14th century, and is applied to gear system which had been improved until the middle of 17th century in Western-style clockwork. In particular, timing device of Song I-yŏng's Armillary Clock adopts the early 17th century pendulum clock system which could remarkably improve the accuracy of a clock.&lt;ref&gt;KIM Sang-Hyuk, [http://m.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=be54d9b8bc7cdb09&amp;control_no=3b48615694989343ffe0bdc3ef48d419 A study on the operation mechanism of song I-yong`s armillary clock], Ph.D dissertation, JoongAng University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
Further advances in the instrument were made by Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), whose elaborate armillary spheres passing into astrolabes are figured in his ''Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Armillary spheres were among the first complex mechanical devices. Their development led to many improvements in techniques and design of all mechanical devices. [[Renaissance]] scientists and public figures often had their portraits painted showing them with one hand on an armillary sphere, which represented the height of [[wisdom]] and [[knowledge]].

The armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching, and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe, the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens, and revolving on an axis within a horizon. With the earth as center such a sphere is known as Ptolemaic; with the sun as center, as Copernican.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The earliest seamless globe was invented in Kashmir by the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Muslim astronomer]] and metallurgist Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 1589–90 (AH 998)  during [[Akbar the Great]]'s reign; another was produced in 1659–60 (1070 AH) by Muhammad Salih Tahtawi with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Sanskrit]] inscriptions; and the last was produced in Lahore by a [[Indian astronomy|Hindu astronomer]] and [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgist]] [[Lala Balhumal Lahori]] in 1842 during [[Jagatjit Singh Bahadur]]'s reign. 21 such globes were produced, and these remain the only examples of seamless metal globes. These [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] metallurgists used the method of [[lost-wax casting]] in order to produce these globes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Emilie|last=Savage-Smith|title=Islamicate Celestial Globes: Their History, Construction, and Use|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C.|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paralympic Games ==
An artwork-based model of an Armillary sphere has been used since the March 1, 2014 to light the [[Paralympic]] heritage flame at [[Stoke Mandeville Stadium]], United Kingdom.  The sphere includes a wheelchair that the user can rotate to spark the flame as part of a ceremony to celebrate the past, present and future of the Paralympic Movement in the UK.  The Armillary Sphere was created by artist [[Jon Bausor]] and will be used for future Heritage Flame events.  The flame in the first-ever ceremony was lit by [[London 2012]] gold medallist [[Hannah Cockroft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/first-ever-heritage-flame-lit-stoke-mandeville-historic-moment-paralympic-movement |title=First ever Heritage Flame lit at Stoke Mandeville in a historic moment for Paralympic Movement |date=3 January 2014 |website=www.paralympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heraldry and vexillology ==
[[File:Flag of Portugal.svg|thumb|right|220px|The [[flag of Portugal]] features a pronounced armillary sphere]]
The armillary sphere is commonly used in [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], being mainly known as a symbol associated with [[Portugal]], the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[Portuguese discoveries]].

In the end of the 15th century, the armillary sphere became the personal [[heraldic badge]] of the future King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], when he was still a [[Prince of Portugal|Prince]]. The intense use of this badge in documents, monuments, flags and other supports, during the reign of Manuel I, transformed the armillary sphere from a simple personal symbol to a national one that represented the Kingdom of Portugal and in particular its [[Portuguese Empire|Overseas Empire]]. As a national symbol, the armillary sphere continued in use after the death of Manuel I.

In the 17th century, it became associated with the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese dominion of Brazil]]. In 1815, when [[Kingdom of Brazil|Brazil gained the status of kingdom]] united with that of Portugal, its coat of arms was formalized as a golden armillary sphere in a blue field. Representing Brazil, the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. When [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil became independent as an empire]] in 1822, the armillary sphere continued to be present in its national arms and in its national flag. The celestial sphere of the present [[Flag of Brazil]] replaced the armillary sphere in 1889.

The armillary sphere was reintroduced in the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|national arms]] and in the national [[Flag of Portugal]] in 1910.

'''Bearman Glacier''' ({{Coord|72|21|S|99|10|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] whose head is east of [[Mount Howell]] in central [[Thurston Island]]. The glacier flows south into [[Schwartz Cove]] on the south side of the island. It was named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] after [[F.O. Bearman]], Photographer's Mate in the Eastern Group of [[U.S. Navy Operation Highjump]], which obtained aerial photographs of this glacier and adjacent coastal areas, 1946–47.

In geography, a '''cape''' is a [[headland]] or a [[promontory]] of large size extending into a [[body of water]], usually the [[sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A cape usually represents a marked change in trend of the coastline which makes them prone to natural forms of [[erosion]], mainly tidal actions. This results in capes having a relatively short geological lifespan. Capes can be formed by glaciers, volcanoes, and changes in sea level. Erosion plays a large role in each of these methods of formation.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12251">[[File:Dorsal tilt of distal radius fracture.jpg|thumb|Fracture with a dorsal tilt. Dorsal is left, and volar is right in the image.]]
There are a number of ways to classify [[distal radius fractures]]. Classifications systems are devised to describe patterns of injury which will behave in predictable ways, to distinguish between conditions which have different outcomes or which need different treatments. Most wrist fracture systems have failed to accomplish any of these goals and there is no consensus about the most useful one.

At one extreme, a stable undisplaced extra-articular fracture has an excellent prognosis.  On the other hand, an unstable, displaced intra-articular fracture is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis without operative intervention.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Eponyms such as Colles', Smith's, and Barton's fractures are discouraged.{{By whom|date=November 2017}}

==Anatomic==
An anatomic description of the fracture is the easiest way to describe the fracture, determine treatment, and assess stability.{{According to whom|date=November 2017}}
* Articular incongruity
* Volar or dorsal tilt
* Radial inclination
* Radial length and ulnar variance
* [[Comminution]] of the fracture (the amount of crumbling at the fracture site)
* Open ([[compound fracture]]) vs. closed injury
* Associated [[Ulnar styloid process|ulnar styloid]] fracture
* Associated soft tissue injuries

===Articular incongruity===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The articular joint's surface must be smooth for it to function properly. Irregularity may result in radiocarpal [[arthritis]], pain, and stiffness.  More than 1&amp;nbsp;mm of incongruity places the patient at a high risk for [[post-traumatic arthritis]]. Significant articular incongruity typically occurs in young patients after high energy injuries.  If the surface is very irregular and cannot be reconstructed, then the only option may be a fusion of the joint.

===Volar vs dorsal tilt===
A [[Anatomical terms of location#Hands and feet|dorsal]] tilt of a distal radius fracture is shown in {{color|red|red}} in image at right. The angulation goes between:&lt;ref name="Piva NetoLhamby2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piva Neto|first1=Antonio|last2=Lhamby|first2=Fabio Colla|title=Fixação das fraturas da extremidade distal do rádio pela técnica de kapandji modificada: avaliação dos resultados radiológicos|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ortopedia|volume=46|issue=4|year=2011|pages=368–373|issn=0102-3616|doi=10.1590/S0102-36162011000400004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A line drawn between the distal ends of the [[Radius (bone)#Structure|articular surface of the radius]] on a lateral X-ray.
# A line that is [[perpendicular]] to the [[diaphysis]] of the radius.
Sometimes, the diaphysis of the radius is hard to distinguish from the [[ulna]], and a line between them ({{color|turquoise|turquoise line}} in image) may be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/colles-fracture|title=Colles fracture|author= Paresh K Desai|accessdate=2016-12-18|website=[[Radiopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Radial inclination of distal radius fracture.jpg|thumb|243x243px|Fracture with a decreased radial inclination (about 15°).]]The angle normally has [[Anatomical terms of location#Hands and feet|volar]] tilt of 11° to 12°. The most common fracture pattern usually demonstrates malalignment of this angle and collapse in a [[Anatomical terms of location#Hands and feet|dorsal]] direction. A dorsal tilt of 0° (11° - 12° deviation from normal anatomic position) causes a substantial risk of developing pain and impaired function.&lt;ref name="Cooney2011"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qva8f16BewEC&amp;pg=PA347 Page 347] in: {{cite book|title=The Wrist: Diagnosis and Operative Treatment|author=William P. Cooney|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2011|isbn=9781451148268}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|closed reduction]], a residual dorsal tilt of a maximum of 5° (16° - 17° deviation) is regarded as the maximal residual angle for a satisfactory result.&lt;ref name="Cooney2011" /&gt;

====Radial inclination====
The radial inclination of a distal radius fracture is shown in {{color|red|red}} in image at right. The angle is measured between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/398406-overview|title=Distal Radial Fracture Imaging|author=Jack A Porrino, Jr|date=2015-10-20|accessdate=2016-12-18|website=[[Medscape]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ijoonline.com/article.asp?issn=0019-5413;year=2016;volume=50;issue=6;spage=610;epage=615;aulast=Mishra|title=Morphometry of distal end radius in the Indian population: A radiological study|author1=Pankaj Kumar Mishra |author2=Manoj Nagar |author3=Suresh Chandra Gaur |author4=Anuj Gupta |year=2016|volume=50|issue=6|journal=Indian Journal of Orthopaedics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A line drawn between the distal ends of the [[Radius (bone)#Structure|articular surface of the radius]] on a [[Anteroposterior|AP]] view of the wrist.
#A line that is perpendicular to the diaphysis of the radius.
Radial inclination is normally 21-25°.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q3_EthzU3dcC&amp;pg=PA783 Page 783] in: {{cite book|title=Diagnostic Imaging for the Emergency Physician|authors=Joshua Broder|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2011|isbn=9781437735871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radial length and ulnar variance===
Radial length is an important consideration in distal radius fractures. Radial length should be between 9-12mm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Distal radius fractures typically result in loss of length as the radius collapses from the loading force of the injury.  With increasing relative lengthening of the uninjured ulna (positive ulnar variance), [[ulnar impaction syndrome]] may occur. Ulnar impaction syndrome is a painful condition of excessive contact and wear between the ulna and the carpus with an associated is a degenerative tear of the TFCC.[[File:Radial length and ulnar variance.jpg|thumb|380x380px|Positive, neutral, and negative ulnar variance. Relationship between radial length and ulnar variance. Radial length is the measure from distal ulna to radial styloid process. When ulnar variance is neutral radial length should be between 9-12mm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876669045|title=Orthopedic imaging : a practical approach|last=Adam,|first=Greenspan,|others=Beltran, Javier (Professor of radiology),|isbn=9781451191301|edition=Sixth|location=Philadelphia|oclc=876669045}}&lt;/ref&gt;|none]]

==Melone classification==
The system that comes closest to directing treatment has been devised by Melone. This system breaks distal radius fractures down into 4 components: radial styloid, dorsal medial fragment, volar medial fragment, and radial shaft. The two medial fragments (which together create the lunate fossa) are grouped together as the medial complex.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rockwood and Green's Fractures in Adults.|last1=Ricci|first1=editors, Robert W. Bucholz ... [et al.] ; associate editors, Margaret M. McQueen, William M.|date=2015|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=978-1451175318|edition=8th|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frykman classification==
Though the [[Frykman classification]] system has traditionally been used, there is little value in its use because it does not help direct treatment. This system focuses on articular and ulnar involvement. The classification is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/frykman_classification_of_distal_radius_frx Wheeless Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

==Universal classification==
The Universal classification system is descriptive but also does not direct treatment.  Universal codes are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yujV5S_TP_UC&amp;pg=PA182 Page 182] in: {{cite book|title=Orthopedic Secrets|authors=David E. Brown, Randall D.

|}

== AO/OTA classification ==
Widely used system that includes 27 subgroups. Three main groups based on fracture joint involvement (A - extra-articular, B - partial articular, C - complete articular). Classification further defined based on level of comminution and direction of displacement. A qualification (Q) modifier can be added to classify associated ulnar injury.&lt;ref name="Court-Brown 2015"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893628028|title=Rockwood and Green's fractures in adults|others=Court-Brown, Charles M.,, Heckman, James D.,, McQueen, Margaret M.,, Ricci, William M.,, Tornetta, Paul, III,, McKee, Michael D.,|isbn=9781451175318|edition=8th|location=Philadelphia|oclc=893628028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fernandez classification ==
Simplified system developed in response to AO classification, intended to be based off injury mechanism with more treatment-oriented classifications (treatment suggestions not meant to be used as rigid guidelines but can be used to help decision making on a case-by-case basis)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/a1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOKN_A0M3D2DDbz9_UMMDRyDXQ3dw9wMDAwCTYEKIvEocDQnTr8BDuBoQEi_l35Uek5-EtipkY55ScYW6fpRRalpqUWpRXqlRUDhjJKSgmIrVQNVg_Lycr30_Pz0nFS95PxcVQNsWjLyi0v0I1BV6hfkhkZU-aSGAwBJYqzy/dl5/d5/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SmlFL1o2XzJPMDBHSVMwS09PVDEwQVNFMUdWRjAwME0z/?bone=Radius&amp;segment=Distal&amp;soloState=lyteframe&amp;contentUrl=srg/popup/further_reading/23/Fernandez/23_fernandez_class.jsp|title=AO Surgery Reference|website=www2.aofoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood-Revised (DC: 0-3R)''' is a developmentally based diagnostic manual that provides clinical criteria for categorizing mental health and [[developmental disorders]] in infants and toddlers.&lt;ref name ="Casebook"&gt;Lieberman, A., Wieder, S. &amp; Fenichel, E. (Eds.), (1997). DC: 0-3 Casebook. Zero to Three Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; It is organized into a five-part axis system.&lt;ref name = "DC 0-3"&gt;Zero To Three (2005). Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood: Revised Edition (dc:0-3r). Washington, DC, ZERO TO THREE Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been translated into several languages and its model is widely adopted for the assessment of children of up to five years in age.&lt;ref name=eggar&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Egger HL, Emde RN |title=Developmentally sensitive diagnostic criteria for mental health disorders in early childhood: the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-IV, the research diagnostic criteria-preschool age, and the diagnostic classification of mental health and developmental disorders of infancy and early childhood-revised |journal=Am Psychol |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=95–106 |year=2011 |pmid=21142337 |pmc=3064438 |doi=10.1037/a0021026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DC 0-3R is meant to complement, but not replace, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), and the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) of the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name = "Other manuals"&gt;{{Citation |author=Division of Behavioral Health Services, Arizona Department of Health Services |title=Arizona's Crosswalk for DC: 0-3R, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-9-CM |format=PDF |date=24 September 2009 |url=http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/guidance/birthtofive_attach1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701164619/http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/guidance/birthtofive_attach1.pdf |archive-date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to enhance the understanding of young children by making it possible to assess, diagnose, and treat mental health problems in infants and toddlers by allowing for the identification of disorders not addressed in other [[Classification of mental disorders|classification systems]].

The DC: 0-3R is organized around three primary principles: 1) that children’s psychological functioning unfolds in the context of relationships, 2) that individual differences in [[temperament]] and constitutional strengths and vulnerabilities play a major role in how children experience and process events, and 3) that the family’s cultural context is important for the understanding of the child’s developmental course.&lt;ref name="Casebook" /&gt;

==History==

The first version, DC: 0-3, was published in 1994 to address the need for a systematic approach to the classification of disorders in the first few years of life. Since then, it has become increasingly valued by mental health professionals, physicians, nurses, early educators, and researchers around the world, and has been published in 8 different languages in addition to the original English edition.

===Current Edition===

Revisions to the DC: 0-3 were published in 2005 to account for the evolution of the classification system from the time when it was first published in 1994. To be addressed were certain limitations such as the lack of criteria in some of the classification categories and the need for certain clarifications. Most importantly, new knowledge from research and clinical experience dating from almost a decade was to be incorporated.&lt;ref name = "0-3"&gt;{{cite web|title=DC: 0-3 revisions|url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3-revisions.html|website=Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families|accessdate=22 March 2012|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013184721/http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3-revisions.html |archive-date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Diagnostic Process==

The diagnostic process is one that is ongoing and done over a period of time. The process includes gathering a series of information regarding the child’s behaviour and presenting problems. The information is collected by a clinician and pertains to the child’s adaptation and development across different occasions and contexts.&lt;ref name="0-3"/&gt;

According to the DC: 0-3R, the diagnostic process consists of two aspects: 1) the classification of disorders, and 2) the assessment of individuals. One of the primary reasons for the classification of disorders is to facilitate communication between professionals. Once a diagnosis has been made, a clinician can then make associations between their clients’ symptoms and previously existing knowledge regarding the disorders' [[etiology]], [[pathogenesis]], treatment, and [[prognosis]]. Furthermore, using the classification of disorders can facilitate the process of finding existing services and mental health systems that are appropriate for the particular needs of the affected child. The assessment of children thus becomes a pivotal process that is undertaken by clinicians in order to grant access to treatment and intervention services related to specified disorders.&lt;ref name="0-3"/&gt;

Clinical assessment and diagnosis involves making observations and gathering information from multiple sources relating to the child’s life in conjunction with a general diagnostic scheme. Both the DSM and ICD classification systems have evolved to use a multiaxial scheme, thus, clinicians have been using them not only for the classification of disorder but also as a guide for assessment and diagnosis. The first three axes of the DSM and ICD relate to the classification of disorder, and the fourth and fifth relate to the assessment of the individual within their personal environment. Similarly, the DC: 0-3 and DC: 03R also follow a multiaxial scheme.&lt;ref name="0-3"/&gt;

===Classification===

The DC 0-3R provides a provisional diagnosis system, focusing on multi-axial classification. The system is a provisional system because it recognizes the fluidity and change that may occur with more knowledge in the field. This classification system is not entirely synonymous with the DSM-IV and the ICD-10, because it concentrates on developmental issues.&lt;ref name= "classification"&gt;{{Citation|editor1-last=Wieder|editor1-first=Serena|title=Diagnostic Classification 0-3: Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood|date=October 1999|publisher=Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-943657-32-6|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED439564.pdf|format=pdf|id=[[Educational Resources Information Center|ERIC]] Number [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED439564 ED439564]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an emphasis placed on dynamic processes, relationships, and adaptive patterns within a developmental framework. The use of this classification system imparts knowledge about the diagnostic profile of a child, and the various contextual factors that may contribute to difficulties.&lt;ref name="class source"&gt;{{cite web |title=The DC:0-3R Multi-Axial System |work=Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families |url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3r-multi-axial-system.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235109/http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3r-multi-axial-system.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DC 0-3R functions as a reference for the earlier manifestations of problems in infants and children, which can be connected to later problems in functioning. Secondly, the categorization focuses on types of difficulties in young children that are not addressed in other classification models.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;

The diagnostic categories vary in description, with more familiar categories described less. Categories that are more specific to young childhood and infancy, and newly based on clinical approaches are described in more detail. Furthermore, some categories may have subtypes to promote research, clinical awareness, and intervention planning, whereas others do not. This is important information to keep in mind when reading the DC 0-3R.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;

====The Multi-Axial System====

=====Axis I: Clinical Disorders=====

Axis 1 of the DC 0-3R provides diagnostic classifications for the most primary symptoms of the presenting difficulties. These diagnoses focus on the infant or child’s functioning. The primary diagnoses include:&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

*'''[[Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]]''': This refers to children who may be experiencing or have experienced a single [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] event (e.g. an earthquake), a series of traumatic events (e.g. [[Strategic bombing|air raids]]), or chronic stress (e.g. [[abuse]]).  Furthermore, the nature of the trauma and its effect on the child must be understood in the context of the child.  Specifically, attention must be paid to factors such as social context, [[Personality development|personality]] factors, and the caregivers’ ability to assist with coping.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;
*'''Disorders of Affect''': This classification of disorders is related to the infant or child’s affective and behavioural experiences. This group of disorders includes [[mood disorders]] and deprivation/maltreatment disorder.  This classification focuses on the infant or child’s functioning in its entirety rather than a specific event or situation.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt; (See [[Affective spectrum]])
*'''[[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment Disorder]]''': When considering a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, one has to examine the situational factors to determine if it is a mild disruption in the child’s usual functioning (e.g. switching schools). These difficulties must also not meet the criteria for other disorders included in the categories.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;
*'''Regulation Disorders of Sensory Processing''': The child manifests difficulties in regulating behavioural, motor, attention, physiological, sensory, and affective processes. These difficulties can affect the child’s daily functioning and relationships.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt; (See [[Sensory processing disorder]])
*'''Sleep Behaviour Disorder''': To diagnose a [[sleep disorder]], the child should be showing a sleep disturbance and not be demonstrating sensory reactive or processing difficulties. This diagnosis should not be used when sleep problems are related to issues of [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] or traumatic events.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;
*'''Eating Behaviour Disorder''': This diagnosis may become evident in infancy and young childhood as the child may show difficulties in regular eating patterns. The child may not be regulating feeding with physiological reactions of hunger. This diagnosis is a primary diagnosis in the absence of traumatic, affective, and regulatory difficulties.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt; (See [[Eating disorder]])
*'''Disorders of Relating and Communicating''': These disorders involve difficulties in communication, in conjunction with difficulties in regulation of physiological, motor, cognitive, and many other processes.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;

=====Axis II: Relationship Classification=====

Axis II focuses on children and infants developing in the context of emotional relationships. Specifically, the quality of caregiving can have a strong impact in nurturance and steering a child on a particular developmental course, either adaptive or maladaptive. This particular axis concentrates on the diagnosis of a clinical issue in the relationship between the child and the caregiver. The presence of a disorder indicates difficulties in relationships. These disorders include various patterns that highlight behaviour, affective, and psychological factors between the child and the caregiver.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

*Overinvolved
*Underinvolved
*Anxious/Tense
*Angry/Hostile
*Mixed Relationship Disorder
*Abusive

=====Axis III: Medical and Developmental Disorders and Conditions=====

Axis III focuses on physical, mental, or developmental classification using other diagnosis methods. These disorders and conditions are not treated as a single diagnosis, but as a problem that may co-exist with others, as it may involve developmental difficulties.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

=====Axis IV: Psychosocial Stressors=====

This axis allows clinicians to focus on the intensity of psychosocial stress, which may act as influencing agents in infant and childhood difficulties/disorders. Psychosocial stress can have direct and indirect influences on infants and children, and depends on various factors.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

=====Axis V: Emotional and Social Functioning=====

Emotional and social functioning capacities can be assessed using observations of the child with primary caregivers. The essential domains of functioning can be used in these observations on a 5-point scale, that describes overall functional emotional level.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

===Rating Scales and Checklists===

The DC: 0-3R contains four forms&lt;ref name="Forms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc0-3r-forms.html |title=DC:0-3R Forms to Reproduce |work=Zero to Three |publisher=National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003754/http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc0-3r-forms.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that aid clinicians in identifying disorders in infants and toddlers, in examining the extent of problem behaviours, and in determining the nature of external factors influencing the child.

*'''Functional Rating Scale for Emotional and Social Functioning Capacities''': to evaluate the child’s communication skills and expressions of thoughts and feelings.
*'''The Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS; from [[#Axis II: Relationship Classification|Axis II]])''': to evaluate the quality of a caregiver-child relationship and identify relationship disorders.
*'''Relationship Problems Checklist (RPCL; from [[#Axis II: Relationship Classification|Axis II]])''': allows the clinician to identify the extent to which a caregiver-child relationship can be described by a number of criterion-based qualities.
*'''Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors Checklist (from [[#Axis IV: Psychosocial Stressors|Axis IV]])''': to provide information on the stressors experienced by the child in various contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert N. |last1=Emde |first2=Helen |last2=Egger |first3=Emily |last3=Fenichel |first4=Antoine |last4=Guedeney |first5=Brian K. |last5=Wise |first6=Harry H. |last6=Wright |date=September 2005 |title=Introducing DC:0–3R |journal=Zero to Three |url=http://main.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/vol26-1a.pdf |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=35–41 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701175858/http://main.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/vol26-1a.pdf |archive-date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Future of DC 0-3R==

Important questions remain to be answered, in spite of the revisions made in the DC: 0-3R. Such questions include the following:

#How can the functional adaptation of infants and children be evaluated and described independent of diagnosis?
# How can disruptive behaviours of typical development in infants and children be distinguished from disordered behaviours that lead to atypical development?
# Should Excessive Crying Disorder be considered as a functional regulatory disorder? Other functional regulatory disorders include Sleeping Behaviour and Feeding Behaviour Disorders.
# Should future editions of the DC: 0-3 include a Family Axis containing information about family history of mental illness, family structure and available supports, and family culture? These aspects are all central to assessment and treatment planning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15828">'''Etendue''' or '''étendue''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|t|ɒ|n|ˈ|d|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|etɑ̃dy}}) is a property of [[light]] in an [[optics|optical system]], which characterizes how "spread out" the light is in area and angle. It corresponds to the [[beam parameter product]] (BPP) in Gaussian optics.

From the source point of view, it is the product of the area of the source and the [[solid angle]] that the system's [[entrance pupil]] [[subtend]]s as seen from the source. Equivalently, from the system point of view, the etendue equals the area of the entrance pupil times the solid angle the source subtends as seen from the pupil. These definitions must be applied for infinitesimally small "elements" of area and solid angle, which must then be summed over both the source and the diaphragm as shown below.  Etendue may be considered to be a volume in [[Hamiltonian optics#Phase space|phase space]].

Etendue is important because it never decreases in any optical system where optical power is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/370/photometry/etendue.pdf Lecture notes on Radiance]&lt;/ref&gt; A perfect optical system produces an image with the same etendue as the source. The etendue is related to the [[Lagrange invariant]] and the [[optical invariant]], which share the property of being constant in an ideal optical system. The [[radiance]] of an optical system is equal to the derivative of the [[radiant flux]] with respect to the etendue.

The term ''étendue'' comes from the French ''étendue géométrique'', meaning "geometrical extent". Other names for this property are '''acceptance''', '''throughput''', '''light grasp''', '''light-gathering''' or '''-collecting power''', '''optical extent''', '''geometric extent''', and the '''A&amp;Omega; product'''. ''Throughput'' and ''A&amp;Omega; product'' are especially used in [[radiometry]] and radiative transfer where it is related to the [[view factor]] (or shape factor). It is a central concept in [[nonimaging optics]].&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO"&gt;Roland Winston et al.,, ''Nonimaging Optics'', Academic Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0127597515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Projection Displays"&gt;Matthew S. Brennesholtz, Edward H. Stupp, ''Projection Displays'', John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0470518038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:Etendue for differential surface element in 2D and 3D.png|right|thumb|400px|Etendue for a [[differential element|differential surface element]] in 2D (left) and 3D (right).]]
An infinitesimal surface element, dS, with normal '''n'''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is immersed in a medium of [[refractive index]] ''n''. The surface is crossed by (or emits) light confined to a solid angle, d''Ω'', at an angle ''θ'' with the normal '''n'''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;. The area of d''S'' projected in the direction of the light propagation is {{nobreak|d''S'' cos ''θ''}}. The etendue of this light crossing dS is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = n^2\, \mathrm{d}S \cos \theta\, \mathrm{d}\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;
Because angles, solid angles, and refractive indices are [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]], etendue has units of area (given by dS).

==Conservation of etendue==
As shown below, etendue is conserved as light travels through free space and at  refractions or reflections. It is then also conserved as light travels through optical systems where it undergoes perfect reflections or refractions. However, if light was to hit, say, a [[Diffuser (optics)|diffuser]], its solid angle would increase, increasing the etendue. Etendue can then remain constant or it can increase as light propagates through an optic, but it cannot decrease. This is a direct result of increasing [[entropy]], which only can be reverted if a priori knowledge is used to reconstruct a phase-matched wave-front such as with  [[phase conjugated mirror]]s.

Conservation of etendue can be derived in different contexts, such as from optical first principles, from [[Hamiltonian optics]] or from the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"/&gt;

===In free space===
[[Image:Etendue-Free space.png|right|thumb|300px|Etendue in free space.]]
Consider a light source ''Σ'', and a light detector ''S'', both of which are extended surfaces (rather than differential elements), and which are separated by a [[medium (optics)|medium]] of refractive index ''n'' that is perfectly [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] (shown). To compute the etendue of the system, one must consider the contribution of each point on the surface of the light source as they cast rays to each point on the receiver.&lt;ref name="Wikilivre"&gt;[[Wikibooks:fr:Photographie/Photométrie/Notion d'étendue géométrique|''Wikilivre de Photographie'']], ''Notion d'étendue géométrique'' (in French). Accessed 27 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the definition above, the etendue of the light crossing d''Σ'' towards d''S'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G_\Sigma = n^2\, \mathrm{d}\Sigma \cos \theta_\Sigma\, \mathrm{d}\Omega_\Sigma = n^2\, \mathrm{d}\Sigma \cos \theta_\Sigma \frac{\mathrm{d}S \cos \theta_S}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where d''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;Σ&lt;/sub&gt; is the solid angle defined by area d''S'' at area d''Σ''. Similarly, the etendue of the light crossing d''S'' coming from d''Σ'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G_S = n^2\, \mathrm{d}S \cos \theta_S\, \mathrm{d}\Omega_S = n^2\, \mathrm{d}S \cos \theta_S \frac{\mathrm{d}\Sigma \cos \theta_\Sigma}{d^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where d''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is the solid angle defined by area dΣ. These expressions result in
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G_\Sigma = \mathrm{d}G_S,&lt;/math&gt;
showing that etendue is conserved as light propagates in free space.

The etendue of the whole system is then:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \int_\Sigma\!\int_S \mathrm{d}G.&lt;/math&gt;

If both surfaces d''Σ'' and d''S'' are immersed in air (or in vacuum), {{nobreak|1=''n'' = 1}} and the expression above for the etendue may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = \mathrm{d}\Sigma\, \cos \theta_\Sigma\, \frac{\mathrm{d}S\, \cos \theta_S}{d^2} = \pi\, \mathrm{d}\Sigma\,\left(\frac{\cos \theta_\Sigma \cos \theta_S}{\pi d^2}\, \mathrm{d}S\right) = \pi\, \mathrm{d}\Sigma\, F_{\mathrm{d}\Sigma \rarr \mathrm{d}S},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;d''Σ''→d''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[view factor]] between differential surfaces d''Σ'' and d''S''. Integration on d''Σ'' and d''S'' results in ''G'' = π''Σ'' ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''Σ''→''S''&lt;/sub&gt; which allows the etendue between two surfaces to be obtained from the view factors between those surfaces, as provided in a [http://www.me.utexas.edu/~howell/tablecon.html list of view factors for specific geometry cases] or in several [[heat transfer]] textbooks.

The conservation of etendue in free space is related to the [[View factor#View factors of differential areas|reciprocity theorem for view factors]].

===In refractions and reflections===
[[File:Etendue in refraction.png|right|thumb|300px|Etendue in refraction.]]

The conservation of etendue discussed above applies to the case of light propagation in free space, or more generally, in a medium in which the [[refractive index]] is constant. However, etendue is also conserved in refractions and reflections.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"/&gt; Figure "etendue in refraction" shows an infinitesimal surface d''S'' on the ''xy'' plane separating two media of refractive indices ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''Σ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The normal to d''S'' points in the direction of the ''z'' axis. Incoming light is confined to a solid angle d''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;''Σ''&lt;/sub&gt; and reaches d''S'' at an angle ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''Σ''&lt;/sub&gt; to its normal. Refracted light is confined to a solid angle d''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; and leaves d''S'' at an angle ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; to its normal. The directions of the incoming and refracted light are contained in a plane making an angle ''φ'' to the ''x'' axis, defining these directions in a [[spherical coordinate system]]. With these definitions, [[Snell's law]] of refraction can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;n_\Sigma \sin \theta_\Sigma = n_S \sin \theta_S,&lt;/math&gt;
and its derivative relative to ''θ''
:&lt;math&gt;n_\Sigma \cos \theta_\Sigma\, \mathrm{d}\theta_\Sigma = n_S \cos \theta_S \mathrm{d}\theta_S,&lt;/math&gt;
multiplied by each other result in
:&lt;math&gt;n_\Sigma^2 \cos \theta_\Sigma\!\left(\sin \theta_\Sigma\, \mathrm{d}\theta_\Sigma\, \mathrm{d}\varphi\right) = n_S^2 \cos \theta_S\!\left(\sin \theta_S\, \mathrm{d}\theta_S\, \mathrm{d}\varphi\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where both sides of the equation were also multiplied by d''φ'' which does not change on refraction. This expression can now be written as
:&lt;math&gt;n_\Sigma^2 \cos \theta_\Sigma\, \mathrm{d}\Omega_\Sigma = n_S^2 \cos \theta_S\, \mathrm{d}\Omega_S,&lt;/math&gt;
and multiplying both sides by d''S'' we get
:&lt;math&gt;n_\Sigma^2\, \mathrm{d}S \cos \theta_\Sigma\, \mathrm{d}\Omega_\Sigma = n_S^2\, \mathrm{d}S \cos \theta_S\, \mathrm{d}\Omega_S&lt;/math&gt;
that is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G_\Sigma = \mathrm{d}G_S,&lt;/math&gt;
showing that the etendue of the light refracted at d''S'' is conserved. The same result is also valid for the case of a reflection at a surface d''S'', in which case {{nobreak|1=''n''&lt;sub&gt;''Σ''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}} and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''Σ''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Conservation of basic radiance==
[[Radiance]] of a surface is related to étendue by:
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega} = n^2 \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial G},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''n'' is the refractive index in which that surface is immersed;
*''G'' is the étendue of the light beam.

As the light travels through an ideal optical system, both the étendue and the radiant flux are conserved. Therefore, ''basic radiance'' defined as:&lt;ref&gt;William Ross McCluney, ''Introduction to Radiometry and Photometry'', Artech House, Boston, MA, 1994 {{ISBN|978-0890066782}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}^* = \frac{L_{\mathrm{e},\Omega}}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
is also conserved. In real systems, the étendue may increase (for example due to scattering) or the radiant flux may decrease (for example due to absorption) and, therefore, basic radiance may decrease. However, étendue may not decrease and radiant flux may not increase and, therefore, basic radiance may not increase.

==Etendue as a volume in phase space==
[[File:Etendue and optical momentum.png|200px|thumb|right|Optical momentum.]]

In the context of [[Hamiltonian optics]], at a point in space, a light ray may be completely defined by a point {{nobreak|1='''r''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, a unit [[Euclidean vector]] {{nobreak|1='''v''' = (cos ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, cos ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;, cos ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} indicating its direction and the refractive index ''n'' at point '''r'''. The optical momentum of the ray at that point is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = n(\cos \alpha_X, \cos \alpha_Y, \cos \alpha_Z) = (p, q, r),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nobreak|1={{norm|'''p'''}} = ''n''}}. The geometry of the optical momentum vector is illustrated in figure "optical momentum".

In a [[spherical coordinate system]] '''p''' may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = n\!\left(\sin \theta \cos \varphi, \sin \theta \sin \varphi, \cos \theta \right),&lt;/math&gt;
from which
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}p\, \mathrm{d}q = \frac{\partial(p, q)}{\partial(\theta, \varphi)} \mathrm{d}\theta\, \mathrm{d}\varphi = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta} \frac{\partial q}{\partial \varphi} - \frac{\partial p}{\partial \varphi} \frac{\partial q}{\partial \theta}\right) \mathrm{d}\theta\, \mathrm{d}\varphi = n^2 \cos \theta \sin \theta\, \mathrm{d}\theta\, \mathrm{d}\varphi = n^2 \cos \theta\, \mathrm{d}\Omega,&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore, for an infinitesimal area d''S'' = d''x'' d''y'' on the ''xy'' plane immersed in a medium of refractive index ''n'', the etendue is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = n^2\, \mathrm{d}S \cos \theta\, \mathrm{d}\Omega = \mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}y\, \mathrm{d}p\, \mathrm{d}q,&lt;/math&gt;
which is an infinitesimal volume in phase space ''x'', ''y'', ''p'', ''q''. Conservation of etendue in phase space is the equivalent in optics to [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] in classical mechanics.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"/&gt; Etendue as volume in phase space is commonly used in [[nonimaging optics]].

==Maximum concentration==
[[File:Etendue for a large solid angle.png|right|thumb|200px|Etendue for a large solid angle.]]

Consider an infinitesimal surface d''S'', immersed in a medium of refractive index ''n'' crossed by (or emitting) light inside a cone of angle ''α''. The etendue of this light is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = n^2\, \mathrm{d}S \int \cos \theta\, \mathrm{d}\Omega = n^2 dS \int_0^{2\pi}\!\int_0^\alpha \cos \theta \sin \theta\, \mathrm{d}\theta\, \mathrm{d}\varphi = \pi n^2 \mathrm{d}S \sin^2 \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that ''n'' sin ''α'' is the [[numerical aperture]] ''NA'', of the beam of light, this can also be expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = \pi\, \mathrm{d}S\, \mathrm{NA}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that d''Ω'' is expressed in a [[spherical coordinate system]]. Now, if a large surface ''S'' is crossed by (or emits) light also confined to a cone of angle ''α'', the etendue of the light crossing ''S'' is
:&lt;math&gt;G = \pi n^2 \sin^2 \alpha \int \mathrm{d}S = \pi n^2 S \sin^2 \alpha = \pi S \,\mathrm{NA}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Etendue conservation at maximum possible concentration.png|left|thumb|250px|Etendue and ideal concentration.]]

The limit on maximum concentration (shown) is an optic with an entrance aperture ''S'', in air ({{nobreak|1=''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}) collecting light within a solid angle of angle 2''α'' (its [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angle]]) and sending it to a smaller area receiver ''Σ'' immersed in a medium of refractive index ''n'', whose points are illuminated within a solid angle of angle 2''β''. From the above expression, the etendue of the incoming light is
:&lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{i} = \pi S \sin^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
and the etendue of the light reaching the receiver is
:&lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{r} = \pi n^2 \Sigma \sin^2 \beta.&lt;/math&gt;

Conservation of etendue {{nobreak|1=''G''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} then gives
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{S}{\Sigma} = n^2 \frac{\sin^2 \beta}{\sin^2 \alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' is the concentration of the optic. For a given angular aperture ''α'', of the incoming light, this concentration will be maximum for the maximum value of sin ''β'', that is ''β'' = π/2. The maximum possible concentration is then&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{max} = \frac{n^2}{\sin^2 \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case that the incident index is not unity, we have
:&lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{i} = \pi n_\mathrm{i} S \sin^2 \alpha = G_\mathrm{r} = \pi n_\mathrm{r} \Sigma \sin^2 \beta,&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;C = \left(\frac{\mathrm{NA}_\mathrm{r}}{\mathrm{NA}_\mathrm{i}}\right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
and in the best-case limit of ''β'' = π/2, this becomes
:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{max} = \frac{n_\mathrm{r}^2}{\mathrm{NA}_\mathrm{i}^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the optic were a [[collimator]] instead of a concentrator, the light direction is reversed and conservation of etendue gives us the minimum aperture, ''S'', for a given output full angle 2''α''.

'''Geekadelphia''' was a [[Philadelphia]]-based [[weblog]] focused on [[Entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[Science journalism|science]], [[Technology journalism|technology]] and other related areas pertaining to the city of Philadelphia. Founded in 2007, the blog also co-hosts the Philadelphia Geek Awards with the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University]]. The site is still online, however it is no longer being updated.

==History==
Geekadelphia was founded by Tim Quirino and Eric Smith in 2007, who, according to Smith, "wanted a place to ramble about things that interested us and have a site to host whatever silly videos we'd make." Smith stated in 2008 that he did not expect much financial gain from the site and that the amount of revenue earned only gave enough to pay for hosting. He expressed interest in throwing more events on behalf of the site and announced a [[podcast]] with Benjamin Gilbert and a [[webcomic]].&lt;ref name="SmithG2008"/&gt;

In 2013, Quirino, along with Smith, developed a new [[Corporate branding|branding]] and [[logo]] system for the site, in tandem with their decision to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] their company, Analog Boys.&lt;ref name="Quirino2013"/&gt; Quirino later left for [[San Francisco]] in 2014 to work as a designer for [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="Wink2014"/&gt;

==Events==
[[File:ArchStOperaHouse.png|thumb|right|The site's staff decorated the [[Trocadero Theatre]], pictured in 1973, for the [[Film screening|screenings]] of ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' and ''[[Zombieland]]''.]]
Since its inception, the site has hosted various events within Philadelphia. In 2008, the site hosted a ''Battlestar Galactica''-themed party in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]] with The Hacktory, a Philadelphia-based organization promoting the application of technology in the arts, and Indy Hall.&lt;ref name="Spikol2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithE2008"/&gt; The site's staff decorated the [[Trocadero Theatre]] for the [[Film screening|screenings]] of ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' in 2009 and ''[[Zombieland]]'' in 2010. The screening for ''Jennifer's Body'' was to a packed audience.&lt;ref name="Braak2010"/&gt;

==The End==
On November 30, 2017 the site posted a blog titled 'You’re Still Here? Go Home' explaining how the site has come to an end.&lt;ref name="gohome" /&gt;

===Philadelphia Geek Awards===
In 2011, Smith and Quirino founded the Philadelphia Geek Awards, in conjunction with the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, to honor and celebrate achievements within the Philadelphia community.&lt;ref name="Dror2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stetler2013"/&gt; Its second annual ceremony, hosted at the university, was reported to have sold over 400 in a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Dougherty2012"/&gt; During its third-annual ceremony, Smith stated his criteria for ''[[geek]]'' as "more about having a hobby or a side project that you feel really passionate about, that you care so much about that you pour yourself into it."&lt;ref name="Brady2013"/&gt;

'''GridRepublic''' is a [[BOINC Account Manager]]. It focuses on creating a clean and simple way to join and interact with BOINC. GridRepublic was started with a mission to raise public awareness and participation in [[volunteer computing]] with [[BOINC]]. GridRepublic was formed in 2004 by Matthew Blumberg as a mechanism to control the multiple projects from one place. The code for the BOINC software had to be redesigned to allow for the Account Manager system to be implemented.

==About GridRepublic==
GridRepublic was founded with the name Computational Charity Project. GridRepublic initially was designed for the BOINC projects. GridRepublic uses donations and volunteers to help host, develop and maintain their website.

In October 2008 GridRepublic released the community feature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gridrepublic.org/community |title=GridRepublic &amp;#124; Grid Republic &amp;#124; BOINC Volunteer Distributed Grid Computing |publisher=Grid Republic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to its website which is designed as a wiki to create a place to share ideas and encourage collaboration in bringing volunteer computing to the mainstream. The launch of the community section marked a shift in priorities and development for GridRepublic.

Currently, GridRepublic has sustained around 2000 T[[Flops]] of computing power.

GridRepublic's website has won numerous awards including being named finalist at the 2007 SXSW Interactive Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/web_awards/finalists/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509172839/http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/web_awards/finalists |archivedate=2007-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2008 Stockholm Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://event.stockholmchallenge.se/project/2008/Culture/GridRepublic&lt;/ref&gt;  GridRepublic has also been the recipients of a Google Grant allowing for advertising through Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gridrepublic.org/pub/AboutGridRepublic.pdf|title=About GridRepublic|publisher=GridRepublic|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working Process===
The [[BOINC Account Manager]] design allows for creating a unity and central control point for participation in projects using BOINC. GridRepublic created a website where a single login allows for simple point-and-click selection of what projects a computer owner would like to participate. Upon downloading the application a user provides the email and password to associate with the GridRepublic account so that project and preference information are able to reach him.

The central control point allows for multiple computer control. The preferences selected are replicated to the multiple computers associated with the GridRepublic account. Multiple different preference sets can be created and associated with different computers or groups of computers.

===Projects===
GridRepublic supports a wide range of the [[BOINC projects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gridrepublic.org/projects |title=GridRepublic &amp;#124; Grid Republic &amp;#124; BOINC Volunteer Distributed Grid Computing |publisher=Grid Republic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of supported projects and the development status of projects are periodically updated.
Some of its popular projects are:
* [[Climateprediction.net]] climate change modeling on personal computers
* [[Einstein@home]]  Pulsar Stars from [[LIGO]] and GEO data.
* [[Rosetta@home]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/ |title=Rosetta@home |publisher=Boinc.bakerlab.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  protein folding research.
* [[SETI@home]] Searching radio and light data for signs of Intelligent Life.

==GridRepublic Software==
GridRepublic is a non-profit organisation, an online application, and software.  The software is open source and a customized version of [[BOINC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gridrepublic.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_mambowiki&amp;Itemid=35&amp;compars=help_documentation&amp;page=GridRepublic_and_BOINC |title=grid |publisher=Gridrepublic.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The custom installer simplifies and reduces the steps required to join in [[volunteer computing]]. Also included with the GridRepublic client is a GridRepublic [[Skin (computing)|skin]] for the simple view and a custom screensaver for projects that do not have screensavers.

The '''Heat Capacity Mapping Mission''' (HCMM) was the first Applications [[Explorer program|Explorer]] Mission. HCMM provided comprehensive, accurate, high-spatial-resolution thermal surveys of the surface of the Earth.

HCCM was launched from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] on April 26, 1978 by a [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout-F]] rocket. Its mass was {{convert|117.0|kg}}.

The HCMM spacecraft was placed in a circular sun-synchronous orbit, allowing the spacecraft to sense surface temperatures near the maximum and minimum of the diurnal cycle. There was no on-board data storage capability, so only real-time data were transmitted when the satellite came within reception range of seven ground stations.

During February 21–23, 1980, the HCMM orbital altitude was lowered from 620&amp;nbsp;km to 540&amp;nbsp;km to stop the drift of the orbit plane to unfavorable sun angles which in turn reduced the power collection capability of the solar panels. The operations of the spacecraft were terminated on September 30, 1980.

==Description==

The hirola is a medium-sized antelope, tan to rufous-tawny in colour with slightly lighter under parts, predominantly white inner ears and a white tail which extends down to the hocks.  It has very sharp, lyrate horns which lack a basal pedicle and are ridged along three quarters of their length.   As hirola age their coat darkens towards a slate grey and the number of ridges along their horns increases.  Hirola have large, dark sub-orbital glands used for marking their territories and give them the name "four-eyed antelope".  They have white spectacles around their eyes and an inverted white chevron running between the eyes.  The horns, hooves, udders, nostrils, lips and ear tips are black.  Males and females look similar although males are slightly larger with thicker horns and darker coats.&lt;ref name="Sclater, P. L. 1889"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dracopoli, I. N.

Several sources have recorded precise measurements from both captive and wild hirola.  The following are maximum and minimum values taken from all sources: height at the shoulder: 99–125&amp;nbsp;cm, body weight: 73–118&amp;nbsp;kg, head and body length: 120–200&amp;nbsp;cm, horn length: 44–72&amp;nbsp;cm, horn spread (greatest outside width): 15–32&amp;nbsp;cm, tail length: 30–45&amp;nbsp;cm, ear length: 19&amp;nbsp;cm.  It is not stated whether horn length was measured direct from base to tip or along the curve of the horn.&lt;ref name="Dorst, J 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingdon, J. 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butynski, T. M. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Best, G. A. F., Edmond-Blanc, F. and Courtenay Witting, R. (eds.) (1962) Rowland Ward’s Records of Big Game. 11th edition. Africa. Rowland Ward: London.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no data on how long hirola live in the wild but hirola in captivity have been known to live for 15 years.&lt;ref name="PROBERT, J. 2011"/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Authorities agree that the hirola belongs in the subfamily Alcelaphinae within the family Bovidae but there has been debate about the genus in which it should be placed.  The Alcelaphinae contains [[hartebeest]], [[wildebeest]] and [[topi]], [[korrigum]], [[bontebok]], [[blesbok]], [[Korrigum|tiang]] and [[tsessebe]].&lt;ref name="Butynski, T. M. 2000"/&gt;

When it was first described the hirola was given the common name Hunter’s hartebeest.  Despite this it was placed in the genus ''Damaliscus'' with the topi and given the scientific name ''Damaliscus hunteri''.&lt;ref name="Sclater, P. L. 1889"/&gt;  Newer theories have classified it as a sub-species of the topi (''Damaliscus lunatus hunteri'')&lt;ref&gt;Haltenorth, T. and Diller, H. (1977) A Field Guide to the Mammals of Africa Including Madagascar. Collins: Cambridge, UK. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walther, F. R. (1990) Hartebeests, Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals. New York: McGraw-Hill. 418–436.&lt;/ref&gt; and placed it within its own genus as ''Beatragus hunteri''.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1945) The principles of classification and a classification of mammals. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 85: 1–350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentry, A. W. 1990"&gt;Gentry, A. W. (1990) Evolution and dispersal of African Bovidae. In: Bubenik, G. A. and Bubenik, A. B. (eds.). Horns, Pronghorns and Antlers. Springer-Verlag: New York. 195–227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitra, C. 1998"&gt;Pitra, C., Kock, R., Hofmann, R. and Lieckfeldt, D. (1998) Molecular phylogeny of the critically endangered Hunter’s antelope (Beatragus hunteri, Sclater 1889). Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research 36: 179–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estes, R. D. (1999) Hirola: Generic status supported by behavioral and physiological evidence. Gnusletter 18: 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent genetic analyses on karyotypic and mitochondrial DNA support the theory that the hirola is distinct from the topi and should be placed in its own genus.&lt;ref name="Pitra, C. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumamoto, A. T., Charter, S. J., Houk, M. L. and Frahm, M. (1996) Chromosomes of the Damaliscus (Artiodactyla, Bovidae): Simple and complex centric fusion rearrangements. Chromosome Research 4: 614–622.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also indicate that the hirola is in fact more closely related to ''Alcelaphalus'' than to ''Damaliscus''.
Placing the hirola in its own genus is further supported by behavioural observations.  Neither ''Alcelaphalus'' nor ''Damaliscus'' engage in flehmen, where the male tastes the urine of the female to determine oestrus.  They are the only genera of bovids to have lost this behaviour.  Hirola still engage in flehmen although it is less obvious than in other species.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, R. D. (1991) The Behaviour Guide to African Mammals.

The genus ''Beatragus'' originated around 3.1 million years ago and was once widespread with fossils found in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Tanzania and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Kingdon, J. 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentry, A.

(1984) Decouverte de vertebres fossiles dans le Pleistocene inferieur de la Republique de Djibouti. C. R. Académie des Sciences Paris 299: 43–48&lt;/ref&gt;  The hirola is now the only extant member of the genus and is ranked forty third on the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) list of Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species.&lt;ref&gt;EDGE (2011) List of Top 100 Mammals [online]. Available: http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/top_100.php [September 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The hirola is adapted to arid environments with annual rainfall averaging {{convert|300|to|600|mm|in}}.  Their habitats range from open grassland with light bush to wooded savannahs with low shrubs and scattered trees, most often on sandy soils.&lt;ref name="Bunderson, W. T. 1981"&gt;Bunderson, W. T. (1981) Ecological separation of wild and domestic mammals in an East African Ecosystem. Logan, USA: Utah State University. 220–222.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the arid environments they inhabit hirola appear to be able to survive independently of surface water.&lt;ref name="Bunderson, W. T. 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahiye, Y. M. (1999) Population Size and Seasonal Distribution of the Hunter’s Antelope or Hirola (Beatragus hunteri, Sclater, 1889) in Southern Garissa, Kenya. MSc thesis: Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia.&lt;/ref&gt;  Andanje &lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A. 2002"&gt;Andanje, S. A. (2002) Factors limiting the abundance and distribution of hirola (Beatragus hunteri) in Kenya. PhD thesis: University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; observed hirola drinking on only 10 occasions in 674 observations (1.5%) and all 10 observations of drinking occurred at the height of the dry season.  Hirola do however favour short green grass &lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A 1995"/&gt; and in 392 of 674 observations (58%) hirola were grazing on growths of short green grass around waterholes.&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A. 2002"/&gt;  This association with waterholes has led to false reports that hirola are dependent on surface water.&lt;ref name="Butynski, T. M. 2000"/&gt;

Hirola are primarily grazers but browse may be important in the dry season.&lt;ref name="Bunderson, W. T. 1985"&gt;Bunderson, W. T. (1985) The Population, Distribution and Habitat Preferences of the Hunter’s Antelope Damaliscus hunteri in north-east Kenya. In litt. to J. Williamson, WCMC: Cambridge, UK. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  They favour grasses with a high leaf to stem ratio and Chloris and Digiatta species are believed to be important in their diet.&lt;ref name="Kingdon, J. 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A 1995"/&gt;  Kingdon &lt;ref name="Kingdon, J. 1982"/&gt; does not consider the ecological requirements of the hirola unusual and in fact considers them to be more generalist than either Connochaetes spp. or Damaliscus spp.  A vet who examined the digestive tract of several hirola concluded that they were well adapted to eating dry region grasses and roughage.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, R. R. (1996) Hirola: Translocation to Tsavo NP and new scientific information. Gnusletter 15: 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  They feed on the dominant grasses of the region and Kingdon (1982) believes that quantity is more important than quality in the hirola’s diet.&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A 1995"/&gt;

Hirola are often found in association with other species, particularly oryx, Grant’s gazelles, Burchell’s zebra and topi.  They avoid Coke’s hartebeest, buffalo and elephant.&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A. 1997"&gt;Andanje, S. A. (1997) Hirola monitoring progress report: update analysis of animal movement, location and herding. Biodiversity Conservation Unit, Kenya Wildlife Service: Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst hirola avoid direct association with livestock they reportedly prefer the short grass in areas where livestock have been grazed.&lt;ref name="Bunderson, W. T. 1985"/&gt;

==Social structure and reproduction==

Female hirola give birth alone and may remain separate from the herd for up to two months, making them vulnerable to predation.  Eventually the female will rejoin a nursery herd consisting of females and their young.  Nursery herds number from 5–40 although the mean herd size is 7–9.  They are usually accompanied by an adult male.&lt;ref name="Kingdon, J. 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunderson, W. T. 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andanje, S. A. and Ottichilo, W. K. (1999) Population status and feeding habits of the translocated sub-population of Hunter's antelope or hirola (Beatragus hunteri, Sclater, 1889) in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. African Journal of Ecology, 37: (1) 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nursery herd.jpg|thumbnail|Nursery herd, Tsavo East National Park, 2011. (Copyright James Probert)]]

Young hirola leave the nursery herd at around nine months of age and form various temporary associations.  They may gather together in mixed or single sex herds of up to three individuals; sub-adult or subordinate adult males may form bachelor herds of 2–38 individuals; female sub-adults may join an adult male and; if no other hirola are present, young hirola may attach themselves to a herd of Grant’s gazelles or simply spend most of their time alone.&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunderson, W. T. 1985"/&gt;

[[File:Bachelor herd.jpg|thumbnail|Bachelor herd consisting of three sub-adult males, Tsavo East National Park, 2011.  (Copyright James Probert)]]

Adult males attempt to secure a territory on good pasture.  These territories are up to 7km2 and are marked with dung, secretions from the sub-orbital glands and by stamping grounds where males scrape the soil with their hooves and slash the vegetation with their horns.&lt;ref name="Bunderson, W. T. 1985"/&gt;  It has been suggested that at low population densities adult males abandon territory defence and will instead follow a nursery herd.&lt;ref&gt;Gosling, L. M. (1986) The evolution of mating strategies in male antelopes. Ecological Aspects of Social Evolution. Princeton University Press: Princeton. 244–281.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nursery herds do not defend a territory but do have home ranges which overlap the territories of several adult males.&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A. 1997"/&gt;  The size of a nursery herd’s home range varies from 26–164.7 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a mean size of 81.5km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Andanje, S. A. 2002"/&gt;

Nursery herds are relatively stable but bachelor herds are very unstable with a fission fusion dynamic.  In the 1970s hirola were observed forming aggregations of up to 300 individuals to take advantage of scarce, but spatially clumped, resources during the dry season (Bunderson, 1985).
Information is lacking on male territoriality and how it relates to mating success, how and when hirola join a herd and how new herds are established (Butynski, 2000).

Hirola are seasonal breeders with young being born from September to November.&lt;ref name="Kingdon, J. 1982"/&gt;  Data on age of sexual maturity and gestation period are not available for wild hirola however in captivity gestation was around 7.5 months (227–242 days) with one female mating at 1.4 years old and giving birth at 1.9 years.  Another pair of hirola mated when they were 1.7 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Smielowski, J. (1987) A note on the reproductive biology of the Hunter's antelope or hirola (Damaliscus hunteri – Sclater, 1889) in the zoo environment. Zoologische Garten 57: 234–240.&lt;/ref&gt;  In captivity one of the main causes of mortality is wounds caused by intra-hirola aggression, including aggression between females.&lt;ref name="PROBERT, J. 2011"/&gt;

==Threats==

The reasons for the historic decline of the hirola are not known but is likely a combination of factors including disease (particularly [[rinderpest]]), poaching, severe drought, predation, competition for food and water from domestic livestock and habitat loss caused by bush encroachment as a result of the extirpation of elephants in the hirola's natural range.&lt;ref name="Butynski, T. M. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magin, C. (l996a) Hirola Recovery Plan. IUCN Antelope Specialist Group in collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service and Hirola Task Force. IUCN: Nairobi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hirola prefers areas that are used by livestock which puts them at increased risk from diseases like tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, D.W. (2006) The Encyclopedia of Mammals. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to lack of protection they are also still very vulnerable to poaching. Hirola are also threatened by predation and competition with other wild herbivores, particularly [[topi]] and [[Coke's hartebeest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/6234/50185297|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population size and distribution==

The hirola's natural range is an area of no more than 1,500km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the Kenyan-Somali border but there is also a translocated population in Tsavo East National Park.  The natural population in the 1970s was likely to number 10,000–15,000 individuals but there was an 85–90% decline between 1983 and 1985.  A survey in 1995 and 1996 estimated the population to number between 500 and 2,000 individuals with 1,300 as the most reasonable estimate.  The most recent survey took place in 2010 and estimated a population of 402–466 hirola (King et al., 2011).

A translocated population was established in Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park with translocations in 1963 and 1996 (Hofmann, 1996; Andanje &amp; Ottichilo, 1999; Butynski,1999; East, 1999).  The 1963 translocation released 30 animals and the first survey in December 1995 and concluded that there were at least 76 hirola present in Tsavo at the time.  Eight months later a further 29 translocated hirola were released in to Tsavo, at least six of which were pregnant at the time (Andanje, 1997).  By December 2000 the hirola population in Tsavo had returned to 77 individuals (Andanje, 2002) and by 2011 the population was estimated at 76 individuals (Probert, 2011; Probert et al., 2014).

==Status and conservation==

Hirola are critically endangered and their numbers continue to decline in the wild.  There are between 300–500 individuals in the wild and none currently in captivity.&lt;ref name="PROBERT, J. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King, J. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite being one of the rarest antelopes, conservation measures for the hirola antelope have so far been marginal.  The Arawale National Reserve was created in 1973 as a small sanctuary for the hirola but has been left unmaintained since the 1980s.  In late 2005, four local communities in the [[Ijara District]] have, in collaboration with [[Terra Nuova]], developed and put forward a proposal to formally establish the [[Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy]] for the ''in situ'' protection of hirola.

In January 2010, [[Northern Rangelands Trust]] (NRT), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy (IHCC), was funded by the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and USAID-Kenya, to conduct a survey to estimate the remaining population of this species in its natural range.  The survey found only three areas with significant numbers of hirola and it is believed that there are no large herds or significant concentrations of hirola remaining in their natural range.

More recently a 23km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; predator proof fenced sanctuary has been constructed at Ishaqbini and a founding population of 48 hirola is breeding well within the sanctuary &lt;ref&gt;King, J., Craig, I., Golicha, M., Sheikh, M., Lesowapir, S., Letoiye, D., Lesimirdana, D., and Worden, J. (2014) Status of hirola in Ishaqbini community conservancy. Northern Rangelands Trust and Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt;

From their beginnings in [[Sumer]] (now [[Iraq]]) around 3500 BC, the [[Mesopotamia]]n peoples began to attempt to record some [[observation]]s of the world with extremely thorough [[numerical data]]. A concrete instance of [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras' law]] was recorded as early as the 18th century BC&amp;mdash;the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] tablet [[Plimpton 322]] records a number of [[Pythagorean triplets]] (3,4,5) (5,12,13) ..., dated to approx. 1800 BC, over a millennium before [[Pythagoras]], [http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/achieve.html]&amp;mdash;but an abstract formulation of the Pythagorean theorem this was not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Hoffman (science writer)|Paul Hoffman]], ''The man who loved only numbers: the story of [[Paul Erdős]] and the search for mathematical truth'', (New York: Hyperion), 1998, p.187. {{ISBN|0-7868-6362-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Astronomy]] is a science that lends itself to the recording and study of observations: the vigorous notings of the motions of the [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[moon]] are left on thousands of [[clay tablet]]s created by [[scribe]]s.  Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian scientists are still widely used in Western calendars: the [[solar year]], the [[lunar month]], the [[seven-day week]]. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the [[Solar eclipse|Sun]] and [[lunar eclipse|Moon]].  Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of [[Kidinnu]], a [[Chaldea]]n astronomer and mathematician who was contemporary with the Greek astronomers. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Astronomy and [[astrology]] were considered to be the same thing, as evidenced by the practice of this science in [[Babylonia]] by priests. Indeed, rather than following the modern trend towards [[Rationality|rational]] science, moving away from [[superstition]] and [[belief]], the Mesopotamian [[astronomy]] conversely became more astrology-based later in the civilisation - studying the stars in terms of [[horoscope]]s and [[omen]]s, which might explain the popularity of the clay tablets. [[Hipparchus]] was to use this data to calculate the [[precession]] of the [[Earth]]'s axis.  Fifteen hundred years after Kiddinu, [[Al-Batani]], born in what is now Turkey, would use the collected data and improve Hipparchus' value for the [[precession of the Earth's axis]]. Al-Batani's value, 54.5 arc-seconds per year, compares well to the current value of 49.8 arc-seconds per year (26,000 years for Earth's axis to round the circle of [[nutation]]).

[[Babylonian astronomy]] was "the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena." According to the historian [[A. Aaboe]],

{{quote|all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the [[Hellenistic astronomy|Hellenistic world]], [[Indian astronomy|in India]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|in Islam]], and in [[Science in Medieval Western Europe|the West]] - if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the [[exact science]]s - depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity|author=A.

===Egypt===
{{further information|Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian mathematics}}
Significant advances in [[ancient Egypt]] included astronomy, mathematics and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Homer's Odyssey stated that ''"the [[Egyptians]] were skilled in medicine more than any other art".''&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[geometry]] was a necessary outgrowth of [[surveying]] to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the [[Nile river]]. The 3-4-5 [[right triangle]] and other rules of thumb served to represent rectilinear structures including their [[post and lintel]] architecture. Egypt was also a centre of [[Alchemy#Alchemy in Ancient Egypt|alchemical]] research for much of the western world.

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], a [[phonetic]] [[writing system]], have served as the basis for the Egyptian [[Phoenician alphabet]] from which the later [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[alphabet]]s were derived. The city of [[Alexandria]] retained preeminence with its [[Library of Alexandria|library]], which was damaged by fire when it fell under Roman rule,&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Caesar'' 49.3.&lt;/ref&gt; being completely destroyed before 642.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]] (1203): "the library which [[Amr ibn al-A'as|'Amr ibn al-'As]] burnt with the permission of '[[Umar]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Europe: A History'', p 139. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1996. {{ISBN|0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; With it a huge amount of antique literature and knowledge was lost.

The [[Edwin Smith papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern [[neuroscience]]. However, while [[Egyptian medicine]] had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective.

The [[Ebers papyrus]] (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional [[empiricism]].

According to a paper published by Michael D. Parkins, 72% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf 10th Annual Proceedings of the History of Medicine Days] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=April 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael D.

===Persia===
{{main article|Science and technology in Iran}}

In the [[Sassanid]] period (226 to 652 AD), great attention was given to mathematics and [[astronomy]]. The [[Academy of Gundishapur]] is a prominent example in this regard. Astronomical tables&amp;mdash;such as the Shahryar Tables&amp;mdash;date to this period, and Sassanid [[Observatory|observatories]] were later imitated by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] and [[Islamic astrology|astrologers]] of the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic period]].  
In the mid-Sassanid era, an influx of knowledge came to Persia from the West in the form of views and traditions of Greece which, following the spread of [[Christianity]], accompanied [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (the official language of Christians{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} as well as the Iranian [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]]s). The Christian schools in Iran have produced great scientists such as Nersi, Farhad, and Marabai. Also, a book was  left by [[Paulus Persa]], head of the Iranian Department of Logic and Philosophy of [[Aristotle]], written in Syriac and dictated to Sassanid King Anushiravan.

A fortunate incident for pre-Islamic Iranian science during the Sassanid period was the arrival of eight great scholars from the [[Hellenistic civilization]], who sought refuge in Persia from persecution by the Roman [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]]. These men were the followers of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] school. King Anushiravan had many discussions with these men and especially with the man named [[Priscian of Lydia|Priscianus]]. A summary of these discussions was compiled in a book entitled ''Solution to the Problems of Khosrow, the King of Persia'', which is now in the [[Saint Germain Library]] in [[Paris]]. These discussions touched on several subjects, such as philosophy, physiology, metabolisms, and natural science as astronomy. After the establishment of Umayyad and Abbasid states, many Iranian scholars were sent to the capitals of these Islamic dynasties.

In the Early Middle Ages, Persia becomes a stronghold of [[Islamic science]].

{{main article|History of science in Classical Antiquity}}

Scientific thought in [[Classical Antiquity]] becomes tangible from the 6th century BC in [[pre-Socratic philosophy]] ([[Thales]], [[Pythagoras]]). In c. 385 BC, [[Plato]] founded the [[Academy]]. With Plato's student [[Aristotle]] begins the "scientific revolution" of the [[Hellenistic period]] culminating in the 3rd to 2nd centuries with scholars such as [[Eratosthenes]], [[Euclid]], [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Hipparchus]] and [[Archimedes]].

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|upright|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509).]]
In [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]], the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as [[natural philosophy]]. The ancient people who are considered the first ''[[scientists]]'' may have thought of themselves as ''natural philosophers'', as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).

The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the [[pre-Socratics]], provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbours: "How did the ordered [[cosmos]] in which we live come to be?"&lt;ref&gt;[[F. M. Cornford]], ''Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought'', (Gloucester, Mass., Peter Smith, 1971), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales, dubbed the "father of science", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes.  [[Pythagoras]] of Samos founded the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school]], which investigated mathematics for its own sake, and was the first to postulate that the [[Earth]] is spherical in shape.  Subsequently, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature.  Their development of [[deductive reasoning]] was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry.

The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in [[anatomy]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[mineralogy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle'', (New York: W. W. Norton, 1970), pp. 144-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hellenistic age]] scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of [[mathematics]] and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1973), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]], to medieval [[Early Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophers]] and [[Islamic science|scientists]], to the [[Europe]]an [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to the secular [[science]]s of the modern day.
Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks, but the [[Socratic method]] did, along with the idea of [[substantial form|Forms]], great advances in [[geometry]], [[logic]], and the natural sciences.  [[Benjamin Farrington]],  former Professor of [[Classics]] at [[Swansea University]] wrote:
:"Men were weighing for thousands of years before Archimedes worked out the laws of equilibrium; they must have had practical and intuitional knowledge of the principles involved. What Archimedes did was to sort out the theoretical implications of this practical knowledge and present the resulting body of knowledge as a logically coherent system."

and again:

:"With astonishment we find ourselves on the threshold of modern science. Nor should it be supposed that by some trick of translation the extracts have been given an air of modernity. Far from it. The vocabulary of these writings and their style are the source from which our own vocabulary and style have been derived."&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Science'', many editions, such as the paperback by Penguin Books. Copyrights in 1944, 1949, 1953, 1961, 1963. The first quote above comes from Part 1, Chapter 1; the second, from Part 2, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|Schematic of the antikythera mechanism]]

The level of achievement in Hellenistic [[astronomy]] and [[engineering]] is impressively shown by the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (150-100 BC).  The astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known person to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, while the geographer [[Eratosthenes]] accurately calculated the circumference of the Earth.  [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190&amp;nbsp;– c. 120 BC) produced the first systematic [[Timeline of astronomical maps, catalogs, and surveys|star catalog]]. In [[medicine]], [[Herophilos]] (335 - 280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the [[nervous system]]. [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 370 BC) and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. [[Galen]] (129&amp;nbsp;– c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye [[surgery|surgeries]]— that were not tried again for almost two millennia.  The mathematician [[Euclid]] laid down the foundations of [[mathematical rigour]] and introduced the concepts of definition, axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his [[Euclid's elements|''Elements'']], considered the most influential textbook ever written.&lt;ref name="Boyer Influence of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Carl Benjamin |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|quote=The ''Elements'' of Euclid not only was the earliest major Greek mathematical work to come down to us, but also the most influential textbook of all times.

[[Theophrastus]] wrote some of the earliest descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and looking at minerals in terms of their properties such as [[hardness]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] produced what is one of the largest [[encyclopedia]]s of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus. 
[[File:Rough diamond.jpg|right|thumb|200px|octahedral shape of diamond.]]
For example, he accurately describes the [[octahedral]] shape of the [[diamond]], and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by [[engraver]]s to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of [[crystal]] shape is a precursor to modern [[crystallography]], while mention of numerous other minerals presages [[mineralogy]]. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the [[crystal habit]] with the work of [[lapidaries]]. He was also the first to recognise that [[amber]] was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them.

[[File:QtubIronPillar.JPG|thumb|175px|Ancient India was an early leader in [[metallurgy]], as evidenced by the [[wrought iron]] [[Iron pillar of Delhi|Pillar of Delhi]].]]

Excavations at [[Harappa]], [[Mohenjo-daro]] and other sites of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC)  have uncovered evidence of the use of "practical mathematics". The people of the IVC manufactured bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered favourable for the stability of a brick structure.  They used a standardised system of weights based on the ratios: 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, 1/2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500, with the unit weight equaling approximately 28&amp;nbsp;grammes (and approximately equal to the English ounce or Greek uncia).  They mass-produced weights in regular [[geometrical]] shapes, which included [[hexahedron|hexahedra]], [[barrel]]s, [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s, and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, thereby demonstrating knowledge of basic [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sergent|first=Bernard|title=Genèse de l'Inde |year=1997 |pages=113 |language=French |isbn=978-2-228-89116-5 |publisher=Payot|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabitants of Indus civilisation also tried to standardise measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler&amp;mdash;the ''Mohenjo-daro ruler''&amp;mdash;whose unit of length (approximately 1.32&amp;nbsp;inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts.  Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coppa|first=A.|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf|title=Early Neolithic tradition of dentistry: Flint tips were surprisingly effective for drilling tooth enamel in a prehistoric population|journal=Nature|volume=440|date=2006-04-06|issue=7085|pmid=16598247|doi=10.1038/440755a|pages=755–6|bibcode = 2006Natur.440..755C |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisht|first=R.

Early astronomy in India—like in other cultures— was intertwined with religion.&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind&gt;Sarma (2008), ''Astronomy in India''&lt;/ref&gt; The first textual mention of astronomical concepts comes from the [[Veda]]s—religious literature of India.&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind/&gt; According to Sarma (2008): "One finds in the [[Rigveda]] intelligent speculations about the genesis of the universe from nonexistence, the configuration of the universe, the [[Spherical Earth|spherical self-supporting earth]], and the year of 360 days divided into 12 equal parts of 30 days each with a periodical intercalary month."&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind/&gt;

Classical [[Indian astronomy]] documented in literature spans the [[Maurya period|Maurya]] ([[Vedanga Jyotisha]], c. 5th century BCE) to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] (such as the 16th century [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala school]]) periods. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy emerge from the 5th century, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of [[Aryabhata]] in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' and the lost ''Arya-siddhānta'', we find the ''[[Pancha-Siddhāntika]]'' of [[Varahamihira]]. The astronomy and the [[astrology]] of [[History of India|ancient India]] ([[Jyotisha]]) is based upon [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]] calculations, although a [[Tropics|tropical]] system was also used in a few cases.

[[Alchemy]] (Rasaśāstra in Sanskrit)was popular in India. It was the Indian alchemist and philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]] who introduced the concept of 'anu' which he defined as the matter which cannot be subdivided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/centerforindicstudies/chemistry_vedic.pdf |title=Use of Chemistry to Understand Vedic Knowledge |author=Bal Ram Singh |year=2003 |website= |publisher=Center for Indic studies, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109201742/http://www.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/centerforindicstudies/chemistry_vedic.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is analogous to the concept of atom in modern science.

[[Linguistics]] (along with [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], etc.) first arose among Indian grammarians studying the [[Sanskrit language]].
The [[Sanskrit grammar]] of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 520 &amp;ndash; 460 BCE)  contains a particularly detailed description of Sanskrit [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], evincing a high level of linguistic insight and analysis.

[[Ayurveda]] medicine traces its origins to the [[Vedas]], [[Atharvaveda]] in particular, and is connected to Hindu [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Indian medicine has a long history. Its earliest concepts are set out in the sacred writings called the [[Veda]]s, especially in the metrical passages of the [[Atharvaveda]], which may possibly date as far back as the 2nd millennium BCE. According to a later writer, the system of medicine called Āyurveda was received by a certain [[Dhanvantari]] from [[Brahma]], and Dhanvantari was deified as the god of medicine. In later times his status was gradually reduced, until he was credited with having been an earthly king who died of snakebite. — Underwood &amp; Rhodes (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' of [[Sushruta]] appeared during the 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi&amp;Dwivedi07&gt;Dwivedi &amp; Dwivedi (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Ayurvedic practice was flourishing during the time of Buddha (around 520 BC), and in this period the Ayurvedic practitioners were commonly using [[mercury (element)|Mercuric]]-[[sulphur]] combination based medicines. An important Ayurvedic practitioner of this period was [[Nagarjuna]], accompanied by [[Surananda]], [[Nagbodhi]], [[Yashodhana]], [[Nityanatha]], [[Govinda]], [[Anantdev]], [[Vagbhatta]] etc.
During the regime of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (375-415 AD), Ayurveda was part of mainstream Indian medical techniques, and continued to be so until the [[Colonial India|Colonial period]].

The main authors of classical [[Indian mathematics]] (400 CE to 1200 CE) were scholars like [[Aryabhata]], [[Brahmagupta]], and [[Bhaskara II]].  Indian mathematicians made early contributions to the study of the [[Decimal|decimal number system]], [[0 (number)|zero]], [[negative numbers]], [[arithmetic]], and [[algebra]]. In addition, [[trigonometry]], having evolved in the [[Hellenistic civilisation|Hellenistic world]] and having been introduced into ancient India through the translation of [[Greek language|Greek]] works, was further advanced in India, and, in particular, the modern definitions of [[sine]] and [[cosine]] were developed there. These mathematical concepts were transmitted to the [[Middle East]], [[China]], and [[Europe]] and led to further developments that now form the foundations of many areas of mathematics.

[[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]] were also practised, with similar [[Traditional Korean medicine|medicine practised in Korea]].

Among the earliest inventions were the [[abacus]], the public toilet, and the "shadow clock".&lt;ref name="Inventions"&gt;''Inventions'' (Pocket Guides).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Needham]] noted the "[[Four Great Inventions]]" of China as among some of the most important technological advances; these were the [[compass]], [[gunpowder]], [[papermaking]], and [[printing]], which were later known in Europe by the end of the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Tang dynasty]] (AD 618 - 906) in particular was a time of great innovation.&lt;ref name="Inventions"/&gt; A good deal of exchange occurred between Western and Chinese discoveries up to the [[Qing dynasty]].

However, Needham and most scholars recognised that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what might be considered "modern science".

It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature:
{{quote|It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The [[Taoists]], indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.|&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">'''Homoeomeria''' was a doctrine in the philosophy of the ancient Greek [[Anaxagoras]], as claimed by the Roman [[atomist]] [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intellectual Property Protection of Fact-based Works: Copyright and Its Alternatives|page=110|first=Robert|last=Brauneis|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed that the [[atoms]] constituting a [[Matter|substance]] must themselves have the salient observed properties of that substance: so atoms of [[water]] would be wet, atoms of [[iron]] would be hard, atoms of [[wool]] would be soft, etc. This doctrine depends on the [[fallacy of division]].

Professor [[Fleeming Jenkin]] wrote that: "we may with the exercise of a good deal of fancy see in the doctrine of homoeomeria, which taught that all things contained the materials of everything else in a latent state, a foreshadowing of the chemical theory which proves that our bodies are made of the same chemical materials as peas, cabbages, &amp;c., but it requires an elastic imagination to link the old and new creed together."&lt;ref&gt;''Memoir of Fleeming Jenkin'', by R. L. Stevenson. Papers by Fleeming Jenkin, edited by Sir Sidney Colvin, James Alfred Ewing. P. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2830">The '''Human Proteome Folding Project''' ('''HPF''') is a collaborative effort between New York University ([[Richard Bonneau|Bonneau]] Lab), the [[Institute for Systems Biology]] (ISB) and the University of Washington ([[David Baker (biochemist)|Baker]] Lab), using the [[Rosetta@home|Rosetta]] software developed by the Rosetta Commons.

HPF Phase 1 applied Rosetta v4.2x software on the [[human genome]] and 89 others, starting in November 2004. Phase 1 ended in July 2006. HPF Phase 2 (HPF2) applies the Rosetta v4.8x software in higher resolution, "full atom refinement" mode, concentrating on cancer biomarkers (proteins found at dramatically increased levels in cancer tissues), human secreted proteins and [[malaria]].

Phase 1 ran on two [[distributed computing]] grids: on [[United Devices]]' [[grid.org]], and on the [[World Community Grid]], an [[IBM]] philanthropic initiative. Phase 2 of the project ran exclusively on the World Community Grid; it terminated in 2013 after more than 9 years of IBM involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bonneaulab.bio.nyu.edu/wcg/thread_2013_06_17.html |title=World Community Grid Post - HPF2 Update, June 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Systems Biology will use the results of the computations within its larger research efforts.

'''Joseph Numa Wenger''' (June 7, 1901 – September 2, 1970) was a [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear-Admiral]] of the [[United States Navy]] who served as the first [[Deputy Director of the Armed Forces Security Agency|Deputy Director]] of the [[Armed Forces Security Agency]] (AFSA), and later as the first [[Deputy Director of the National Security Agency|Vice Director]] of the [[National Security Agency]], from December 1952 to November 1953, after the separate divisions of the AFSA merged into the NSA. Wenger was one of the leaders responsible for the development of the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/hall_of_honor/2005/wenger.shtml|title=Rear Admiral Joseph N.

==Work==
Wenger was "one of the architects of centralized [[cryptology]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/center_crypt_history/publications/koreanwar_sigint_bkg.shtml|title=The Korean War: The SIGINT Background Search What's new?|last=Hatch|first=David A.|author2=Robert Louis Benson|publisher=United States National Security Agency|accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1942 Navy power struggles led to the ousting of [[Laurance Safford]] from [[OP-20-G]]; with two new sections to be headed by Wenger (Communications: Decryption and Translation) and [[John R. Redman]] (Communications: Combat Intelligence). Safford was removed from current intelligence to a support and research role. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last = Layton | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Layton  | title =  And I was there: Pearl Harbour and Midway – Breaking the Secrets  |publisher =  William Morrow | date = 1985 | location = New York | page = | pages = 367,368 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-688-04883-8 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Safford was sidelined for the remainder of the war, as ultimately was [[Joseph Rochefort]].

Wenger was integral in starting the AFSA (Armed Forces Security Agency), the predecessor to the [[NSA]]. During World War II he suggested that the Navy spend $2 million "to build 360 of its own four wheel bombes" to break the effective British monopoly on the [[Bombe]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Budiansky |first=Stephen|year=2000|title=Battle of Wits|series=| location=New York|publisher=The Free Press|accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/49336411]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11738">'''Konrad Johannes Karl Büttner''', or Buettner (6 October 1903 – 14 November 1970) was a German-American meteorologist, bioclimatologist and university professor.

==Life and times==
Büttner was born in [[Rinteln|Westendorf]], in the province of [[Hannover]], [[Germany]] and died in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. He was a Protestant, married and had one child. His father was John Samuel Julius Büttner and his mother was Emilie Henriette Elisabeth Büttner née Kreuser.&lt;ref name=Klee&gt;Klee, Ernst. (2000). The person encyclopedia to the Third Reich. Frankfurt, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
From 1917 to 1922, he attended the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] high school at [[Pforta|Schulpforte]]. From 1922 to 1926, Büttner studied geophysics, physics and mathematics in [[Erlangen]], [[Hanover]] and [[Göttingen]]. In 1927, he completed a doctorate degree at the [[University of Göttingen]] and published his thesis: "Experiments on the penetrating radiation" and was awarded the [[Dr. Phil.]].&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Büttner, Konrad. (1926). Versuche über die durchdringende Strahlung. Vieweg &amp; Sohn. 1926. 24 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, he completed the [[habilitation]] treatise titled: "The heat transfer by conduction and convection, evaporation and radiation in Bioklimatologie and Meteorology", at the [[University of Kiel]].&lt;ref&gt;Büttner, K. J. K. (1934). Die Wärmeübertragung durch Leitung und Konvektion, Verdunstung und Strahlung in Bioklimatologie und Meteorologie. Springer. (Heat transfer pipe and convection, evaporation and radiation in Bioclimatology and meteorology.)&lt;/ref&gt; He became head of the Bioclimatic Research Centre at the [[University of Kiel]].&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;

==Academic appointments==
From 1927 to 1931, Büttner had a scholarship for [[Meteorology]] in [[Potsdam]] and was a fellow of the [[Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft|Emergency Association of German Science]]. From 1931 until 1934, he was scientific assistant for Meteorology as Assistant Professor and Head of the Bioclimatic Research Centre in [[Kiel]]. While at Kiel, from 1939 to 1947, he was lecturer for Meteorology and Geophysics. In January 1947, Büttner received an extraordinary professorship of Meteorology at the [[University of Kiel]].&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;

==Nazi Party==
 	
*1933 - 1945, [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA), member
 	
*1933 - 1945, [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]], member
	
During [[World War II]], Büttner was attached to the Medical Department of the Medical Research Institute for Graf Zeppelins active in [[Ostfildern|Stuttgart-Ruit]], previously the [[Luftwaffe]] main testing ground at the [[Rechlin–Lärz Airfield]]. Büttner lectured as government medical officer at the sessions on medical issues in distress and death in winter on 26 and 27 October 1942.&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;

==Operation Paperclip==
In 1947, Büttner was recruited for [[Operation Paperclip]] and was first granted a leave of absence from teaching in [[Kiel]] and resigned in December 1950 from the University. Büttner went to the [[United States]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], School of Aviation Medicine. From 1947 until 1953, he was research scientist for meteorology at the [[Randolph Air Force Base#School of Aviation Medicine|School of Medicine Aviation]] at Randolph Air Force Base in [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Link, M. M. (1965). Space Medicine in Project Mercury. NASA SP-4003. NASA, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Washington in Seattle==
From 1953 until his death in 1970, Büttner was professor for [[Meteorology]] and [[Physiology]] in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the [[University of Washington in Seattle]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. Chairman of the department was Philemon Edwards Church and graduate program advisor was Robert Guthrie Fleagle. At Seattle in the Graduate School, Department of Atmospheric Sciences (formerly Meteorology and Climatology), for the school year 1963-1965, the catalog listed the courses taught by Buettner as: microclimatology, applied meteorology and bioclimatology, the upper atmosphere, atmospheric electricity, atmospheric radiation.&lt;ref name=Editor1963&gt;Editor. (1963). Bulletin, University of Washington Graduate School, 1963-1965. University of Washington. Seattle, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the graduate school catalog, Graduate course descriptions are as follows:&lt;ref name=Editor1963/&gt;

The [[Apollo program]] was the third United States [[human spaceflight]] program carried out by the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the [[Moon]] from 1969 to 1972.  During the [[Apollo 11]] mission, astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24, 1969. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].&lt;ref name="program-summary"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/APSR-JSC-09423-OCR.pdf|title=Apollo Program Summary Report|last=|first=|date=April 1975|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|id=JSC-09423|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first manned flight in 1968. It achieved its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test.&lt;ref name="apollo23-popsci"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/what-happened-apollos-2-and-3 |title=What Happened to Apollos 2 and 3? |author=Teitel, Amy |publisher=''[[Popular Science]]''|date=28 October 2018 |accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-up landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which damaged the CSM's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a "lifeboat" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three manned missions from 1973 through 1974, and the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]], a joint Earth orbit mission with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1975.

[[Image:Moon landing map.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A representation of the Moon, with a cluster of green triangles indicating the Apollo landing sites|Green triangles indicate locations of Apollo landings on the Moon]]

Apollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957–1969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final [[Apollo 17]] mission marked the sixth [[Moon landing]] and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability.  Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[Human spaceflight|manned spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.

The Apollo program used four types of launch vehicles.  The first was the [[Little Joe II]], which was used for unmanned suborbital [[launch escape system]] development.  The second is the [[Saturn I]], which was used for unmanned suborbital and orbital hardware development.  The third is the [[Saturn IB]] which was used for preparatory unmanned missions and Apollo 7.  Last, the [[Saturn V]] which was used for unmanned and manned earth orbit and lunar missions.  The [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], which designed the Saturn rockets, referred to the flights as Saturn-Apollo (SA), while [[Kennedy Space Center]] referred to the flights as Apollo-Saturn (AS). This is why the unmanned Saturn 1 flights are referred to as SA and the unmanned Saturn 1B are referred to as AS.

==Test flights==

===Unmanned test missions===

From 1961 to 1968, the [[Saturn (rocket)|Saturn launch vehicle]]s and components of the [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]] were tested in unmanned flights.

Some incongruity in the numbering and naming of the first three unmanned Apollo-Saturn (AS), or Apollo flights.  This is due to AS-204 being renamed to [[Apollo 1]] posthumously. This manned flight was to have followed the first three unmanned flights. After the fire which killed the AS-204 crew on the pad during a test and training exercise, unmanned Apollo flights resumed to test the Saturn V launch vehicle and the Lunar Module; these were designated Apollo 4, 5 and 6. The first manned Apollo mission was thus Apollo 7. Simple "Apollo" numbers were never assigned to the first three unmanned flights, although renaming [[AS-201]], [[AS-202]], and [[AS-203]] as Apollo 1-A, Apollo 2 and Apollo 3, had been briefly considered.&lt;ref name="apollo23-popsci" /&gt;

===Unmanned launch escape system tests===

From August 1963 to January 1966 a number of tests were conducted for development of the [[launch escape system]] (LES). These included simulated ''pad aborts'', which might occur while the Apollo-Saturn [[space vehicle]] was still on the [[launch pad]], and flights on the [[Little Joe II]] rocket to simulate ''[[Apollo abort modes|Mode I abort]]s'' which might occur while the vehicle was in the air.

==Manned Apollo missions==

The Block I Command/Service Module spacecraft did not have capability to fly with the Lunar Module, and the three crew positions were designated Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot, based on [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating#Pilot ratings|U.S. Air Force pilot ratings]]. The Block II spacecraft was designed to fly with the Lunar Module, so the corresponding crew positions were designated Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot regardless of whether a Lunar Module was present or not on any mission.

A total of fifteen Saturn V vehicles were ordered (through AS-515), which would have been enough for three more Moon landing missions through Apollo 20. This flight was cancelled around the time of the Apollo 11 first landing mission to make the launch vehicle available for the [[Skylab]] space station. Shortly thereafter, Apollo 18 and 19 were cancelled in response to Congressional cuts in NASA's budget.

Several of the missions involved [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), "space walks" or "Moon walks" outside of the spacecraft. These were of three types: testing the lunar EVA suit in Earth orbit ([[Apollo 9]]), exploring the lunar surface, and retrieving film canisters from the [[Scientific Instrument Module]] stored in the Service Module.

This '''list of climate scientists''' contains famous or otherwise notable persons who have contributed to the study of [[climate science]]. The list is compiled manually so will not be complete or up to date. See also [[:Category:Climatologists]] and [[List of authors of Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis]]. 
The list includes scientists from several specialities or disciplines.&lt;!--  If you see a climate scientist that should be here but isn't, or one that shouldn't be here but is, please update the page accordingly, even if you have no information at hand for a biography.
Note that the definition of climate scientist is fairly loose here, and scientists from other disciplines noted for their work on climate may be included. --&gt;

As Fourier put it, energy in the form of visible light from the Sun easily penetrates the atmosphere to reach the surface and heat it up, but heat cannot so easily escape back into space. For the air absorbs invisible heat rays ("infrared radiation") rising from the surface. The warmed air radiates some of the energy back down to the surface, helping it stay warm. This was the effect that would later be called, by an inaccurate analogy, the 'greenhouse effect.' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">'''Literature-based discovery''' refers to the use of papers and other [[Academic publishing|academic publications]] (the "literature") to find new relationships between existing knowledge (the "discovery"). The technique was pioneered by [[Don R. Swanson]] in the 1980s and has since seen widespread use. 

Literature-based discovery does not generate new knowledge through laboratory experiments, as is customary for [[empirical]] sciences. Instead it seeks to connect existing knowledge from empirical results by bringing to light relationships that are implicated and "neglected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swanson | first1 = Don | year = 1988 | title = Migraine and Magnesium: Eleven Neglected Connections | url = | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 526–557 | doi=10.1353/pbm.1988.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marked by [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]] in concert or [[consilience]].

==Swanson linking==
[[File:Swanson linking.jpg|thumb|Swanson linking example diagram]]
''Swanson linking'' is a term proposed in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Stegmann J, Grohmann G. Hypothesis generation guided by co-word clustering. Scientometrics. 2003;56:111–135. As quoted by Bekhuis&lt;/ref&gt; that refers to connecting two pieces of knowledge previously thought to be unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bekhuis|first=Tanja|title=Conceptual biology, hypothesis discovery, and text mining: Swanson's legacy|publisher=BioMed Central Ltd.|year=2006|pmc=1459187|pmid=16584552|doi=10.1186/1742-5581-3-2|volume=3|journal=Biomed Digit Libr|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it may be known that illness A is caused by chemical B, and that drug C is known to reduce the amount of chemical B in the body. However, because the respective articles were published separately from one another (called "disjoint data"), the relationship between illness A and drug C may be unknown. ''Swanson linking'' aims to find these relationships and report them.

{{Socialism sidebar}}
The concept of '''Melanesian socialism''' was first advocated by Father [[Walter Lini]] of the [[New Hebrides]] (now [[Vanuatu]]), who became the country's first [[Prime Minister of Vanuatu|Prime Minister]] upon its [[independence]] from [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in 1980. Lini's views on socialism were inspired by [[Julius Nyerere]]'s experiments in [[African socialism]] in [[Tanzania]].

Lini believed that [[socialism]] was inherently compatible with [[Melanesia]]n societies and customs, including the emphasis on communal welfare over individualism and the communal ownership and working of land. In this, Nyerere's influence is perceptible as the latter stressed the similarities between socialism and traditional African ways of life.

Father Lini was an [[Anglican]] priest and believed that socialism held close similarities with [[Christianity|Christian]] values and sought to combine the two as part of a Melanesian way. In this sense, socialism was not to be revolutionary, but instead fully in line with [[ni-Vanuatu]] tradition.

Although he admired Nyerere and his government sought rapprochement with countries such as [[Cuba]] and [[Libya]], Lini believed that socialism should not necessarily entail an alliance with the [[Soviet Union]] or the [[Eastern bloc]]. Indeed, he preferred for Vanuatu to remain non-aligned and to develop closer ties with its fellow Melanesian nations (such as [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]]). In 1982, he expressed hopes for an eventual Melanesian federal union and spoke of the "renaissance of Melanesian values", including "Melanesian socialism".

Lini also noted that in traditional Melanesian societies "'[g]iving' was based on one's ability to do so. 'Receiving' was based on one's need".

In [[New Caledonia]], the [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS), an alliance of pro-independence parties, advocates the implementation of socialism along with accession to [[sovereignty]]. Independent Melanesian nations (most notably Vanuatu) have expressed support for the FLNKS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66261">'''Minimum wage law''' is the body of [[law]] which  prohibits [[employer]]s from hiring [[employee]]s or [[worker]]s for less than a given hourly, daily or monthly [[minimum wage]]. More than 90% of all countries have some kind of minimum wage legislation.&lt;ref name="ILO 2006"&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/condtrav/pdf/infosheets/w-1.pdf ILO 2006: Minimum wages policy (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Minimum wage}}Until recently, minimum wage laws were usually very tightly focused. In the U.S. and Great Britain, for example, they applied only to women and children. Only after the [[Great Depression]] did many industrialized economies extend them to the general work force. Even then, the laws were often specific to certain industries. In [[France]], for example, they were extensions of existing [[trade union]] legislation. In the U.S., industry specific wage restrictions were held to be unconstitutional. The country's [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] established a uniform national minimum wage for nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers. Coverage was later extended to most of the labor force.&lt;ref name="Palgrave1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eatwell | first = John, Ed. | authorlink = |author2=Murray Milgate |author3=Peter Newman  | title = The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics | publisher = The [[Macmillan Press]] Limited | year = 1987 | location = London | pages = 476–478 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-333-37235-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1894, New Zealand established such arbitration boards with the [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act]]
* In 1896, the colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia established similar boards
* In 1907, the [[Harvester Judgment|Harvester decision]] was handed down in Australia. It established a 'living wage' for a man, his wife and two children to "live in frugal comfort"
* In 1909, the Trade Boards Act was enacted in the United Kingdom, establishing four such boards
* In 1912, the state of [[Massachusetts]], United States, set minimum wages for women and children
*In the [[United States]], statutory minimum wages were first introduced nationally in 1938&lt;ref name="Sanjiv Sachdev 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sanjiv Sachdev |title= Raising the rate: An evaluation of the uprating mechanism for the minimum wage |version=  |publisher= Employee Relations |year= 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian National Minimum Wage is the minimum base rate of pay for ordinary hours worked to any employee who is not covered by a [[Industrial award|Modern Award]] or an [[Enterprise Bargaining Agreement|Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairwork.gov.au/factsheets/FWO-fact-sheet-minimum-wages.pdf Australian Fair Work Ombudsman, Minimum Wages Fact Sheet] (accessed 27 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], an amendment to the Factories Act provided for the creation of a wages board.&lt;ref name="Cost of Living"/&gt;  The wages board did not set a universal minimum wage; rather it set basic wages for 6 industries that were considered to pay low wages.&lt;ref name="Politics of the Minimum Wage"&gt;Waltman, Jerold. "The Politics of the Minimum Wage."  University of Illinois Press. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  First enacted as a four-year experiment, the wages board was renewed in 1900 and made permanent in 1904; by that time it covered 150 different industries.&lt;ref name="Politics of the Minimum Wage"/&gt;  By 1902, other Australian states, such as [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]], had also formed wages boards.&lt;ref name="Cost of Living"/&gt; The notion of a "basic wage" was established in 1907 with the [[Harvester Judgment]]. In [[Australia]], on 14 December 2005, the [[Australian Fair Pay Commission]] was established under the ''Workplace Relations Amendment ([[WorkChoices]]) Act 2005'' responsible for the adjustment of the standard federal minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fairpay.gov.au - About the Commission |work=Australian Fair Pay Commission |url=http://www.fairpay.gov.au/fairpay/About/ |accessdate=2007-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630151611/http://www.fairpay.gov.au/fairpay/About/ |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the role of the [[Australian Industrial Relations Commission]] that took submissions from a variety of sources to determine appropriate minimum wages. The Australian Fair Pay Commission was replaced by [[Fair Work Australia]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Labor Party : Federal Labor's New Independent Industrial Umpire:  Fair Work Australia |url=http://www.alp.org.au/media/0407/msirloo260.php |work=Australian Labor Party |accessdate=2008-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401091155/http://www.alp.org.au/media/0407/msirloo260.php |archivedate=April 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil each increase the minimum wage results in a significant burden on the [[Federal budget (Brazil)|federal budget]], because the minimum wage is tied to [[social security]] benefits and other government programs and salaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6213225.stm  Lula bolsters Brazil minimum wage.] -- BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|List of minimum wages in Canada}}
Under the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian Constitution]]'s [[Canadian federalism|federal-provincial division of powers]], the responsibility for enacting and enforcing labour laws rests with the ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]; the three [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]] also were granted this power by virtue of federal legislation. This means that each province and territory has its own minimum wage. Some provinces allow lower wages to be paid to [[liquor]] servers and other [[gratuity|tip]] earners, and/or to inexperienced employees.

The [[Government of Canada|federal government]] could theoretically set its own minimum wage rates for workers in federal jurisdiction industries (interprovincial [[railway]]s, for example). As of 2006 however, the federal minimum wage is defined to be the general adult minimum wage rate of the province or territory where the work is performed. This means, for example, that an interprovincial railway company could not legally pay a worker in British Columbia less than [[Canadian dollar|$]]10.45 an hour regardless of the worker's experience.

===People's Republic of China===
{{Main|Economy of the People's Republic of China}}

The [[Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security]] set the People's Republic of China's first minimum wage law on 1 March 2004. The Regulations on Enterprises Minimum Wage&lt;ref name=lehman-china-min&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulations concerning minimum wages in enterprises - 1993 |url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/labor/regulations-concerning-minimum-wages-in-enterprises-1993.html |website=lehmanlaw.com |accessdate=2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made to "ensure the basic needs of the worker and his family, to help improve workers' performance and to promote fair competition between enterprises." One monthly minimum wage was set for full-time workers, and one hourly minimum wage for part-time workers. [[Province (China)|Provinces]], [[Direct-controlled municipality|municipalities]], and [[Autonomous areas of China|autonomous regions]] are allowed to legislate for their own minimum wage separate from the national one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A law approved February 2013 mandates a nationwide minimum wage at 40% average urban salaries to be phased in fully by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21347819 "China promises rise in minimum wage to close income gap"] ''BBC,'' 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; See [[List of minimum wages in China (PRC)]] for a list of the latest minimum monthly wages for various provinces or municipalities in China.

===European Union===

In the [[European Union]] 18 out of 27 member states currently have national minimum wages.&lt;ref name="Eurostat 2006"&gt;[[Eurostat]] (2006): ''Minimum Wages 2006 - Variations from 82 to 1503 euro gross per month''[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-NK-06-009/EN/KS-NK-06-009-EN.PDF (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623171442/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-NK-06-009/EN/KS-NK-06-009-EN.PDF |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, such as [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], and [[Cyprus]] have no minimum wage laws but rely on employer groups and [[trade union]]s to set minimum earnings through [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, Ronald G. ''Labor Markets and Integrating National Economies'', Brookings Institution Press (1994), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The first nationwide minimum wage in France was introduced via the [[Interprofessional Guaranteed Minimum Wage]] (''SMIG'' - ''Salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti'') law, passed in 1950 and accompanied by a High Commission for Collective Agreements (to set the wages based on average cost of living) and a companion law known as "SMAG" for rural/agricultural occupations. The SMIG, which established one baseline hourly wage rate for the Paris region and one for the rest of the country, was indexed to price inflation but rose slower than average wages. It was replaced by (''SMIC'' - ''salaire minimum de croissance'') in 1970, which remains the basis of the modern minimum wage law in France.

France's national minimum wage (''SMIC'') as of 1 January 2010 is [[Euro|€]]8.86 per hour, representing an increase of 0.5% over the previous rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travail-solidarite.gouv.fr/informations-pratiques,89/fiches-pratiques,91/remuneration,113/le-smic,1027.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801003920/http://www.travail-solidarite.gouv.fr/informations-pratiques%2C89/fiches-pratiques%2C91/remuneration%2C113/le-smic%2C1027.html |archivedate=August 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous increase of 1.3% as from 1 July 2009, brought the hourly rate to [[Euro|€]]8.82, up from July 2008, when it was set at [[Euro|€]]8.71 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?ref_id=NATnon04145&amp;reg_id=0 | title = Table of past minimum wages in France (website in French) | accessdate = 2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the minimum wage in France was set at [[Euro|€]]8.27 (~[[United States dollar|US$]]11.98) per hour. In 2004, 15% of the working population received the minimum wage. The minimum wage in France is updated every year in January by the government. By law, the increase cannot be lower than the inflation for the current year. In the recent years the increase was up to two times higher than the inflation (around 5%  raise with an inflation around 2%).

===Germany===
Germany’s national minimum wage law (''MiLoG'' - ''Mindestlohngesetz'') came into force on 1 January 2015, introducing Germany’s first nationwide legal minimum wage  to the amount of [[Euro|€]]8.50 per hour.  The German minimum wage level will be updated every other year by a minimum wage commission and acceptance by the government. Since a legal minimum wage law is a derogation of the constitutional right of a collective tariff autonomy, it is discussed whether and to what extent the minimum wage is consistent with the constitution.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Minimum wage in Hong Kong}}
The [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) passed the Minimum Wage Bill in 2010, requiring the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] to propose a minimum wage. Through a Provisional Minimum Wage Commission appointed by the government, a [[Hong Kong Dollar|HK$]]28 hourly wage floor was introduced and eventually accepted by the LegCo after much debate. Prior to this, a monthly minimum wage of HK$3,580 for [[Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong|foreign domestic helpers]] had already been set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/faq_fdh.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208152000/http://www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/faq_fdh.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/employment/recruitment/domestichelper.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626044458/http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/employment/recruitment/domestichelper.htm |archivedate=June 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some trades, such as bar-bending and [[bamboo scaffolding]] workers in the construction industry, have daily minimum wage negotiated between the trade unions and employers' organisations. As of September 2018, the statutory minimum wage is HK$37.50 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/2166196/hong-kongs-minimum-wage-workers-be-paid-hk3-hour |title=Hong Kong’s minimum wage workers to be paid HK$3 an hour more, and no one is happy about the increase |access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
&lt;!-- IMPORTANT: When using two currencies, e.g. the punt and euro, make sure other currency is converted and inserted beside the original. As the punt is no longer in use, euro figures do not need to be converted.--&gt;
The minimum wage was introduced in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 2000 at [[Irish pound|IR£]]4.40 ([[Euro|€]]5.59) per hour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minimum wage comes into effect today|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0401/pay.html|accessdate=27 September 2010|newspaper=RTÉ|date=1 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 1 January 2018, it is €9.55 per hour. This is subject to reduction as follows:

*30% reduction for all employees under 18.
*20% reduction for employees over 18 in their first year of employment in any job since they turned 18.
*10% reduction for employees over 18 in their second year of employment in any job since they turned 18.

It may further be reduced by up to €7.73 a day if lodgings and/or food are provided as part of a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum rates of pay|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html|publisher=Citizens Information|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trainees (including those over 18) are also entitled to different minimum wages, reduced as follows:

*25% reduction for the time during the first one-third of the course.
*20% reduction for the time during the second one-third of the course.
*10% reduction for the time during the final one-third of the course.

Ireland's minimum wage prior to the €1 cut in the 2011 budget, was only fifth highest of eight EU countries surveyed for the British Low-Pay Commission Report in 2010, with the UK, Netherlands, France and Belgium all listed as having higher minimum wage rates when OECD Comparative Price Levels are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/report/pdf/LPC_Report_2010.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011134647/http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/report/pdf/LPC_Report_2010.PDF |archivedate=October 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan, minimum wage depends on the industry and the region. Industrial minimum wages apply for certain industries and usually set higher than the regional minimum.&lt;ref name="japan.wage.list"&gt;[http://www2.mhlw.go.jp/topics/seido/kijunkyoku/minimum/minimum-19.htm 厚生労働省：地域別・特定(産業別)最低賃金の全国一覧]&lt;/ref&gt;  If regional and industrial minimum wages differ, higher of two will apply.&lt;ref name="CRHRP-2008"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm 2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices], [[United States Department of State]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, regional minimum wages range from [[Japanese yen|¥]]645 to ¥837 per hour for all workers.&lt;ref name="japan.wage.list" /&gt;

In fiscal 2011 the average minimum wage was raised by ¥6. On July 25, 2012 a subcommittee of the [[Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare]]'s Central Minimum Wages Council decided to recommend that it be raised by ¥7. This would raise the average minimum wage from ¥737 to ¥744.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Yomiuri [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/business/T120725005334.htm Minimum hourly wage hike of ¥7 proposed July 26, 2012] Retrieved on July 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of commuting, extra pay (such as working on holidays, at night, overtime, etc.) and temporary pays (bonus, tips, etc.) must be paid exclusively and cannot be used to calculate towards the minimum wage. Regional minimum hourly wages are set by the [[Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Minister of Labour]]&lt;ref name=min-wage-japan&gt;{{cite web |title=地域別最低賃金の全国一覧 |trans-title=National List of regional minimum wage |url=http://www2.mhlw.go.jp/topics/seido/kijunkyoku/minimum/minimum-02.htm |website=www2.mhlw.go.jp |publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare |accessdate=2015-12-26 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Chief of the Prefectural Labour Standards Office.

===New Zealand===
*[[New Zealand]] was the first country to implement a national minimum wage, enacted by its government through the [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894]].&lt;ref name="Cost of Living"&gt;American Academy of Political and Social Science. "The Cost of Living." Philadelphia, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Current minimum wage law is described in the Minimum Wage Act 1983.  The Minimum Wage (New Entrants) Amendment Act 2007 provided that the rates for 16- to 17-year-olds and those in training cannot be lower than 80% of the adult rate.&lt;ref name="2007 Amendment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2007/0037/latest/DLM967907.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_minimum+wage_resel_25_h&amp;p=1|title=Minimum Wage (New Entrants) Amendment Act 2007|author=|date=11 September 2007|work=legislation.govt.nz|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Application of gendered wage rates====
From 1 April 1946 to 14 March 1977, there were separate minimum wage rates for men and women in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Order1976_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/num_reg/mwo21976199/|title=Minimum Wage Order (No. 2) 1976|author=|date=27 September 1976|work=New Zealand Legal Information Institute|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 15 March 1977, New Zealand abolished these gendered minimum wages, instead having one minimum wage for all adults.&lt;ref name=Order1977&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/num_reg/mwo1977172/|title=Minimum Wage Order 1977|author=|date=14 March 1977|work=New Zealand Legal Information Institute|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
{{Main|Minimum wage in Romania}}
Two minimum wage levels are enforced in Romania. For state employees, the level is set by law at 600 RON (~US$200). For all other employees, the wage is set at 440RON (~US$145) by collective bargaining, which also stipulates multiplication indices for various levels of education. Jobs that require high-school and college qualifications are paid at least 1.5 and 2 times the minimum wage, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Minimum wage in Taiwan}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|National Minimum Wage Act 1998}}
Municipal regulation of wage levels began in some towns in 1524.

====Wages Councils====
The [[Trade Boards Act 1909]] created four Trades Boards that set minimum wages which varied between industries for a number of sectors where "sweating" &lt;!-- Can anyone define that? --&gt; was generally regarded as a problem and where collective bargaining was not well established. This system was extended considerably after the [[World War II|Second World War]]; in 1945 Trades Boards became Wages Councils, which set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy, including the service sector as well as manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/econ-encyclopedia/ wages-council ''Wages Council''] The Oxford Dictionary of Economics. Ed. John Black. Oxford University Press, 2002. eNotes.com. 2006. Retrieved on 6 Sep, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A lower limit of pay, or "pay floor" was regarded as threatening the voluntary system of collective bargaining favoured in the UK. The government had first made a serious attempt to abolish Wages Councils in 1986, having abandoned existing legislation that tried to widen the scope of voluntary agreements to include those firms that had not taken part in negotiations, such as the Fair Wages Resolutions. These required that government contractors pay fair wages and respect the rights of their employees to be members of trades unions.

Instead the [[Wages Act 1986]] reformed the wages councils and abolished the power to create new ones.

====National Minimum Wage====
A National Minimum Wage (NMW) was introduced for the first time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government on 1 April 1999 at the rate of [[Pound sterling|£]]3.60 per hour for those workers aged 22 and over,&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/employment/pay/national-minimum-wage/History-National-Minimum-Wage/page12572.html |last= |date=17 June 2006 |title=History of the National Minimum Wage |work=Employment Matters |publisher=United Kingdom [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] |accessdate=2006-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619155233/http://www.dti.gov.uk/employment/pay/national-minimum-wage/History-National-Minimum-Wage/page12572.html |archivedate=19 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour having promised to set a minimum wage in their [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] campaign. In its election manifesto, it had claimed that every other modern industrial country had already adopted a minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731030954/http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml |archivedate=July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rate was set after the [[Low Pay Commission]] (LPC), an independent body the government appointed in July 1997 to advise it on low pay, recommended the rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/what_we_do.shtml ''What We Do''] Low Pay Commission&lt;/ref&gt; The LPC's permanent status was later confirmed and it continues to make recommendations to government on the NMW, which has been uprated in October every year since 2000. The LPC board consists of nine members—three trade unionists, three employers, and three labour market relations experts. The Commission undertakes consultations each year to gather available evidence before making recommendations in its biennial review.

The current minimum wage in the UK, as of April 2018 is [[Pound sterling|£]]7.83 per hour for workers aged 25 and above, £7.38 for workers aged 21–24, £5.90 for workers aged 18–20, £4.20 for workers under 18, and £3.70 for apprentices aged 16–18 and those aged 19 or over who are in their first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates | work=gov.uk | title=National Minimum Wage rates | date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some workers undertaking apprenticeships or accredited training may be exempted (that is, not considered eligible to receive the NMW) for a certain period of time, which varies according to their age and the length of time in employment. Other categories of worker who are exempt include [[au pair]]s, share fishermen, clergy, those in the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], prisoners and some people working in family businesses. The rate payable under the NMW can, in all cases, also be reduced where accommodation is provided to the worker.

Unlike most other employment rights legislation in the UK, which generally rely on affected individuals raising grievances and making claims, if necessary, before [[Employment tribunal|tribunals]] to enforce these rights, the NMW has compliance teams, attached to [[HMRC|Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) offices who will act on approaches from workers who think they are being paid less than the minimum wage by contacting and visiting their employers. Affected workers can either make a complaint directly to a national helpline or seek advice from another agencies such as their local [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] or the [[Scottish Low Pay Unit]]—this is particularly recommended if other employment rights issues are involved, as the HMRC can only deal with minimum wage enquiries.

====National Living Wage====
From 1 April 2016 a [[Living wage in the United Kingdom|National Living Wage]] was introduced for workers over 25, implemented at a significantly higher minimum wage rate, and expected to rise to at least £9 per hour by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Third of British workers may benefit from new legal pay level|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/30/third-of-british-workers-may-benefit-from-new-legal-pay-level|author=Larry Elliott|date=30 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nursing father''' is a male [[parent]] who provides primary care for an [[infant]]. This term applies to many different types of [[species]].&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins and Sons|title=Definition of Nursing Father|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nursing+father|publisher=Collin's English Dictionary|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept regarding humans is mostly an emerging phenomenon of the 21st century. It is considered a consequence of the changing perceptions of the role of [[family]] and women in the [[Western world]]. A nursing [[father]] may take on the roles which have been traditionally or stereotypically assigned to women. This includes [[Infant feeding|feeding]] and [[Infant bathing|bathing the infant]], and providing all other necessities for the baby.

The Open Group information security management maturity model' ('''O-ISM3''') is an Information Security Management Framework that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing information security management systems.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==History==
The original motivation behind O-ISM3 development was to narrow the gap between theory and practice for information security management systems, and the trigger was the idea of linking security management and maturity models. O-ISM3 strove to keep clear of a number of pitfalls with previous approaches.&lt;ref name="mikko"&gt;Siponen, Mikko (2002-08-24). Designing Secure Information Systems and Software: Critical evaluation of the existing approaches and a new paradigm. ''OULU 2002'', 24 August 2002. Retrieved from http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/isbn9514267907.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project looked at [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]], [[ISO 9000]], [[COBIT]], [[ITIL]], [[ISO/IEC 27001:2013]], and other standards, and found some potential for improvement in several fields, such as linking security to business needs, using a process based approach, providing some additional details (who, what, why) for implementation, and suggesting specific metrics, while preserving compatibility with current IT and security management standards.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Availability==
[[The Open Group]] provides O-ISM3 free of charge to organisations for their own internal noncommercial purposes.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The '''orbital period''' is the time a given [[astronomical object]] takes to complete one [[orbit]] around another object, and applies in [[astronomy]] usually to [[planet]]s or [[asteroid]]s orbiting the [[Sun]], [[moons]] orbiting planets, [[exoplanets]] orbiting other [[star]]s, or [[binary star]]s.

For objects in the [[Solar System]], this is often referred to as the '''sidereal period''', determined by a 360° revolution of one celestial body around another, e.g. the Earth orbiting the Sun. The name ''sidereal'' is added as it implies that the object returns to the same position relative to the [[fixed stars]] [[celestial sphere|projected in the sky]]. When describing orbits of binary stars, the orbital period is usually referred to as just the '''period'''. For example, [[Jupiter]] has a sidereal period of 11.86 years while the main binary star [[Alpha Centauri]] AB has a period of about 79.91 years.

Another important orbital period definition can refer to the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the Earth's surface. An example is the so-called '''synodic period''', applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location. For example, when any planet returns between its consecutive observed [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunctions]] with or [[opposition (astronomy)|oppositions]] to the Sun. For example, [[Jupiter]] has a synodic period of 398.8 days from Earth; thus, Jupiter's opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months.

Periods in astronomy are conveniently expressed in various units of time, often in hours, days, or years. They can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by small complex eternal gravitational influences by other celestial objects. Such variations also include the true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies ([[barycenter]]), [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s by other planets or bodies, [[orbital resonance]], [[general relativity]], etc. Most are investigated by detailed complex astronomical theories using [[celestial mechanics]] using precise positional observations of celestial objects via [[astrometry]].

==Other periods related to the orbital period==

There are many [[periodic function|periods]] related to the orbits of objects, each of which are often used in the various fields of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]]. Examples of some of the common ones include the following:

* The '''sidereal period''' is the amount of time that it takes an object to make a full orbit, relative to the [[star]]s. This is the orbital period in an inertial (non-rotating) [[frame of reference]].
* The '''synodic period''' is the amount of time that it takes for an object to reappear at the same point in relation to two or more other objects (e.g. the [[Moon]]'s phase and its position relative to the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]] repeats every 29.5 day synodic period, longer than its 27.3 day orbit around the Earth, due to the motion of the Earth about the Sun). The time between two successive [[opposition (planets)|oppositions]] or [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunctions]] is also an example of the synodic period. For the planets in the solar system, the synodic period (with respect to Earth) differs from the sidereal period due to the Earth's orbiting around the Sun.
* The '''draconitic period''' (also '''draconic period''' or '''[[nodal period]]'''), is the time that elapses between two passages of the object through its [[orbital node|ascending node]], the point of its orbit where it crosses the [[ecliptic]] from the southern to the northern hemisphere. This period differs from the sidereal period because both the orbital plane of the object and the plane of the ecliptic precess with respect to the fixed stars, so their intersection, the [[line of nodes]], also precesses with respect to the fixed stars. Although the plane of the ecliptic is often held fixed at the position it occupied at a specific [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], the orbital plane of the object still precesses causing the draconitic period to differ from the sidereal period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satellite Orbits: Models, Methods, and Applications |accessdate=1 June 2018|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hABRnDlDkyQC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=draconic+period&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kHIMRrdVD1&amp;sig=6rkDVcM_YXczClna7buD2DDZrKs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSvrC3wbHbAhXKq5QKHZ3pDbA4ChDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=draconic%20period&amp;f=false |author=Oliver Montenbruck, Eberhard Gill |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''anomalistic period''' is the time that elapses between two passages of an object at its [[periapsis]] (in the case of the planets in the [[Solar System]], called the [[perihelion]]), the point of its closest approach to the attracting body. It differs from the sidereal period because the object's [[semi-major axis]] typically advances slowly.
* Also, the '''tropical period''' of Earth (a [[tropical year]]) is the interval between two alignments of its rotational axis with the Sun, also viewed as two passages of the object at a [[right ascension]] of [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|0 hr]]. One Earth [[year]] is slightly shorter than the period for the Sun to complete one circuit along the [[ecliptic]] (a [[sidereal year]]) because the [[axial tilt|inclined axis]] and [[celestial equator|equatorial plane]] slowly [[axial precession|precess]] (rotate with respect to [[fixed stars|reference stars]]), realigning with the Sun before the orbit completes. This cycle of axial precession for Earth, known as ''precession of the equinoxes'', recurs roughly every 25,770 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Small body orbiting a central body==
[[File:Ellipse semi-major and minor axes.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The semi-major axis (''a'') and semi-minor axis (''b'') of an ellipse]]
According to [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]], the '''orbital period''' ''T'' (in seconds) of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or [[elliptic orbit]] is:{{sfnp | Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | p=33 }}

:&lt;math&gt;T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''a'' is the orbit's [[semi-major axis]]
* ''μ'' = ''GM'' is the [[standard gravitational parameter]]
** ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]],
** ''M'' is the mass of the more massive body.

For all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same, regardless of eccentricity.

Inversely, for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to have a given orbital period:

:&lt;math&gt;a = \sqrt[3]{\frac{GMT^2}{4\pi^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''a'' is the orbit's semi-major axis in meters,
* ''G'' is the gravitational constant,
* ''M'' is the mass of the more massive body,
* ''T'' is the orbital period in seconds.

For instance, for completing an orbit every 24&amp;nbsp;[[hour]]s around a mass of 100&amp;nbsp;[[kg]], a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08&amp;nbsp;[[metre|meters]] from its [[center of mass]].

==Orbital period as a function of central body's density==
When a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density ''ρ'' (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the above equation simplifies to (since ''M''&amp;nbsp;= ''Vρ''&amp;nbsp;= {{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''ρ'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-calculate-the-density-of-a-sphere |title=How do you calculate the density of a sphere? |publisher=quora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt{ \frac {3\pi}{G \rho} }&lt;/math&gt;

So, for the Earth as the central body (or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density, about 5,515&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density+of+the+earth |title=Density of the Earth |publisher=wolframalpha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; we get:
:''T'' = 1.41 hours

and for a body made of water (''ρ''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density+of+water |title=Density of water |publisher=wolframalpha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''T'' = 3.30 hours

Thus, as an alternative for using a very small number like ''G'', the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material, like water: the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes. Conversely, this can be used as a kind of "universal" [[time standard|unit of time]] if we have a unit of mass, a unit of length and a unit of density.

==Two bodies orbiting each other==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Binary star]] --&gt;
In [[celestial mechanics]], when both orbiting bodies' masses have to be taken into account, the '''orbital period''' ''T'' can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley W. Carroll, Dale A. Ostlie. An introduction to modern astrophysics. 2nd edition. Pearson 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T= 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{G \left(M_1 + M_2\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''a'' is the sum of the [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] of the ellipses in which the centers of the bodies move, or equivalently, the semi-major axis of the ellipse in which one body moves, in the frame of reference with the other body at the origin (which is equal to their constant separation for circular orbits),
* ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of the masses of the two bodies,
* ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].

Note that the orbital period is independent of size: for a scale model it would be the same, when densities are the same (see also [[Orbit#Scaling in gravity]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory, the motion is not periodic, and the duration of the full trajectory is infinite.

==Synodic period==

There are observable characteristics of two bodies which orbit a third body in different orbits, and thus have different orbital periods. This is known as their '''synodic period'''; it is the time between [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunctions]], and since it is observable from either the first or the second body, the two synodic periods will be different, depending from which celestial body you are observing.

An example of this related period description is the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the Earth's surface, the so-called '''synodic period''', applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location. For example, when any planet returns between its consecutive observed [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunctions]] with or [[opposition (astronomy)|oppositions]] to the Sun. For example, [[Jupiter]] has a synodic period of 398.8 days from Earth; thus, Jupiter's opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months.

If the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, their synodic period is given by:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{P_\mathrm{syn}}=\frac{1}{P_1}-\frac{1}{P_2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a planet's [[natural satellite|moon]], the synodic period usually means the Sun-synodic period, namely, the time it takes the moon to complete its illumination phases, completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planet's surface. The Earth's motion does not determine this value for other planets because an Earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question. For example, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]'s synodic period is 1.2648&amp;nbsp;days, 0.18% longer than Deimos's sidereal period of 1.2624&amp;nbsp;d.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

|}&lt;!--- The Earth-synodic period can also be calculated, but it varies with the planet's position with respect to the Earth; in the Deimos example, at Mars opposition the Earth-synodic period would be about 1.2604&amp;nbsp;d because Earth's motion overtakes Mars. At Mars conjunction, Deimos's Earth-synodic period would be 1.2692 d because Earth's motion now accentuates Mars' apparent motion. Since the Earth--extra-planetary moon synodic period reflects Earth-planet-moon alignments, it is fairly meaningless. ---&gt;

'''''Probably Science''''' is a weekly updated comedy and science [[podcast]] which first aired on January 21, 2012. The show is co-hosted by [[Andy Wood (comedian)|Andy Wood]], [[Matt Kirshen]], and Jesse Case. Former co-host and founding member [[Brooks Wheelan]] having left the show in 2013 for personal reasons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://probablyscience.libsyn.com/episode-154-brooks-wheelan-returns|title=Probably Science : Episode 154 - Brooks Wheelan Returns|work=libsyn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since returned as a guest. In Brooks's absence, Case, previously a guest, was brought on as a co-host.

The podcast focuses on current scientific news. Occasionally it explores different facets of relevant media, including the host's comedy careers, as well as the large array of careers and hobbies held by the guests.

A wide range of guest have appeared in their episodes, including astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://probablyscience.libsyn.com/episode-134-astronaut-and-former-commander-of-the-iss-colonel-chris-hadfield|title=Probably Science : Episode 134 - Astronaut and Former Commander of the ISS Colonel Chris Hadfield|work=libsyn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://probablyscience.libsyn.com/episode-249-neil-degrasse-tyson |title=Episode 249 - Neil deGrasse Tyson |work=libsyn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; comedian [[Chris Hardwick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://probablyscience.libsyn.com/episode-061-the-nerdist-s-chris-hardwick|title=Probably Science : Episode 061 - The Nerdist's Chris Hardwick|work=libsyn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean M.

'''''Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality''''' is a 1996 book by the neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]], in which the author discusses theories about [[sexual orientation]] and the social and political implications of scientific research on the topic. He critically evaluates the views of authors such as the physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]].

The book received mainly positive reviews, crediting LeVay with providing a fair and well written assessment of scientific theories about the development of [[homosexuality]] and showing how scientific research influences public perceptions of gay people. However, critics argued that LeVay was biased in favor of biological explanations of homosexuality, questioned his view that they would benefit gay people and his suggestion that homosexuality is associated with "sex a-typical characteristics" and that gay men have some traits more typical of females than of males, and faulted him for ignoring scientific literature relevant to the "nature versus nurture" controversy.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
LeVay discusses the development of [[sexual orientation]], and the social and political implications of research on the topic. He critically evaluates theories about homosexuality put forward by authors such as [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], Magnus Hirschfeld, and Sigmund Freud, and discusses efforts to convert gay people to heterosexual, such as those described by the psychologist M. P. Feldman and the psychiatrist M. J. MacCulloch in ''[[Homosexual Behaviour: Therapy and Assessment]]'' (1971).{{sfn|LeVay|1996|pages=1–2, 11–40, 67–85, 94}}

==Publication history==
''Queer Science'' was first published in 1996 by [[MIT Press]].{{sfn|LeVay|1996|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Queer Science'' received positive reviews from Genevieve Stuttaford and Sybil S. Steinberg in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',{{sfn|Stuttaford|Steinberg|1996|page=249}} William Beatty in ''[[Booklist]]'',{{sfn|Beatty|1996|page=1642}} Gregg Sapp in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Sapp|1996|page=150}} and the neurologist [[Richard Cytowic]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'',{{sfn|Cytowic|1996|page=9}} and a mixed review from the historian [[Roy Porter]] in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.{{sfn|Porter|1996}} The book was also reviewed by Gail Vines in ''[[New Scientist]]'' and Jon Turney in the ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' and discussed by the philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' and James Edward Van Buskirk in ''Library Journal''.{{sfn|Vines|1996|page=41}}{{sfn|Turney|1997|page=22}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=14}}{{sfn|Van Buskirk|1997|page=116}}

Stuttaford and Steinberg credited LeVay with deftly explaining "biological arcana for the layperson" and showing a "full grasp" of both non-medical and medical historical information. They found the most interesting aspect of the book to be LeVay's "survey of research in Berlin at the turn of the century."{{sfn|Stuttaford|Steinberg|1996|page=249}} Beatty credited LeVay with demonstrating "how research reports have been properly and improperly used to promote either scientific growth or biased attitudes." Though he noted that ''Queer Science'' sometimes made for difficult reading, he considered the text "well-thought-out and documented" as well as fair.{{sfn|Beatty|1996|page=1642}} Sapp described the book as thoughtful and objective. He credited LeVay with showing how scientific research into homosexuality effects public perceptions of gay people.{{sfn|Sapp|1996|page=150}} Cytowic wrote that LeVay's discussion of the causes of homosexuality was thorough and fair and would be "widely regarded as authoritative". He credited LeVay with carefully assessing the scientific evidence and the assumptions behind theories, and with writing well, and endorsed his conclusion that "homosexuals are created differently from straights".{{sfn|Cytowic|1996|page=9}}

Porter considered LeVay's book "lucid, approachable and candid" and credited him with providing "a fine historical sketch of homosexual advocacy and sex research", and offering "a witty and withering critique" of Freudian explanations of homosexuality. However, he considered LeVay naive to believe that proof that homosexuality is rooted in the brain would convince a hostile public to accept homosexuality, writing that evidence LeVay himself provides shows otherwise. He wrote that LeVay "looks forward to the day when the 'new eugenics' born of the human genome project will enable women to abort fetuses likely to be carrying any traits they don't much care for, including homosexuality." He found ''Queer Science'' to be a dispiriting comment about the state of science. He wrote that LeVay and other researchers were guilty of making "bigger and bigger claims based on minuscule amounts of research", and called the underlying assumptions of LeVay's work, such as that all people can be categorized as heterosexuals or homosexuals, simplistic.{{sfn|Porter|1996}}

Van Buskirk wrote that the book was usefully complemented by the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy's ''[[Gay Science]]'' (1997).{{sfn|Van Buskirk|1997|page=116}}

===Gay media===
''Queer Science'' received a negative review from the physician [[Lawrence D. Mass]] in ''Lambda Book Report''.{{sfn|Mass|1996|page=14}} The book was also reviewed by the gay writer [[Gabriel Rotello]] in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' and discussed by the psychiatrist [[Vernon Rosario]] in ''[[The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide]]''.{{sfn|Rotello|1996|pages=80–82}}{{sfn|Rosario|2011|pages=9-13}} Karen Oslund interviewed LeVay about his work, including ''Queer Science'', in ''The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review''.{{sfn|Oslund|1997|pages=21–24}}

Mass characterized LeVay as a "gay-positive" essentialist. Though he noted that LeVay considered possible negative consequences of, and arguments against, the idea that homosexuality is biologically based, he still concluded that LeVay's belief that biological explanations of homosexuality would benefit gay people was "unsupported, if not naive". He found LeVay's "flirtations with social constructionist and other criticisms" unsatisfactory. He criticized LeVay for viewing ''[[The Twilight of the Golds]]'', a play by Jonathan Tolins "about a near-future that offers genetic testing for homosexuality", as a personal criticism, and for dismissing the psychologist [[John Paul De Cecco]], a critic of biological explanations of homosexuality.{{sfn|Mass|1996|page=14}} Rosario described LeVay's ''[[Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why]]'' (2010) as a "rehashing" of ''Queer Science''.{{sfn|Rosario|2011|pages=9-13}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''Queer Science'' received positive reviews from the zoologist [[Mark Ridley (zoologist)|Mark Ridley]] in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine,{{sfn|Ridley|1996|page=10}} the neuroscientist [[Dick Swaab]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',{{sfn|Swaab|1996|page=682}} R. W. Smith in ''Choice'',{{sfn|Smith|1996|page=321}} the philosopher [[Philip Kitcher]] in ''[[The Sciences]]'',{{sfn|Kitcher|1996|pages=34–38}} Scott Herness in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'',{{sfn|Herness|1998|pages=117–120}} and James C. Woodson in the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'',{{sfn|Woodson|2003|pages=187-189}} and mixed reviews from Christopher D. Horvath in ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'',{{sfn|Horvath|1997|pages=376–377}} and Stephanie Kenen in the ''[[Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences]]''.{{sfn|Kenen|1999|pages=73–74}} The book was also reviewed by Domeena C. Renshaw and Harriet S. Meyer in ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'',{{sfn|Renshaw|Meyer|1996|page=836}} Charles Weijer in ''[[The BMJ|BMJ]]'',{{sfn|Weijer|1996|page=1017}} David L.

Ridley praised the book as a fair discussion of scientific findings on homosexuality, and called it "intelligent and generous". However, he criticized LeVay for ignoring the literature on the "nature versus nurture" controversy. He also questioned LeVay's attempt to use genetic evidence to support the claim that homosexuality is immutable, arguing that the existence of genes that influence the development of homosexuality does not mean that homosexuality must be immutable. He noted that genes associated with particular behaviors "are probably often expressed in the way they influence individuals to respond to their environments" and that because a gene could influence the development of homosexuality in various different ways, for example by affecting how open a person is to "same-sex seduction", genetic evidence might or might not support LeVay's view of homosexuality. He agreed with LeVay that people who accept that homosexuality is genetically based and therefore inevitable tend to have a more positive view of homosexuality, but nevertheless argued that those who accept such a position are basing their views on a scientific misunderstanding, which could have counter-productive results in legal settings.{{sfn|Ridley|1996|page=10}}

Swaab considered the book a fine historical introduction to the issue of sexual orientation. However, he wrote that LeVay made selective use of research data.{{sfn|Swaab|1996|page=682}} Smith described the book as fair and well-written, and credited LeVay with covering a wide range of topics.{{sfn|Smith|1996|page=321}} Kitcher wrote that LeVay "considers criticisms of the recent findings in a thoughtful and balanced manner" and "takes great pains to consider possible abuses of those findings." He agreed with LeVay's view that basing "homosexuality in biology" does not constrain freedom for gay people. However, he expressed skepticism about LeVay's view that genetic techniques would make it possible to prevent homosexuality.{{sfn|Kitcher|1996|pages=34–38}} Herness credited LeVay with exposing the biases of scientists, and praised him for his discussion of Hirschfeld. Although he criticized LeVay for failing to discuss some topics, such as religion and lesbianism, in greater detail, he concluded that ''Queer Science'' is "a wonderful book, lucidly written and educational."{{sfn|Herness|1998|pages=117–120}}

Woodson, writing in 2003, commented that the book "remains thought-provoking, controversial, and relevant to the ongoing debate" over sexual orientation, and wrote that like LeVay's previous hypothalamus study, it influenced popular views about the biological basis of homosexuality. He considered the book well organized and scholarly, and credited LeVay with thoroughly addressing the social implications of research on homosexuality and fairly discussing the various theories about homosexuality, despite his bias in favor of biological explanations. However, he found LeVay less balanced when discussing conversion therapy. He wrote that LeVay largely avoided "the issues of learning and reinforcement relevant to sexual motivation". He also questioned LeVay's assumption that masculinity and femininity are "functional opposites" rather than "independent constructs", and that "brain sexual differentiation is a global phenomenon in which the whole brain is either masculinized and defeminized or remains feminine". He wrote that LeVay's view that feminine traits are associated with male homosexuality created a basis for stereotyping, and failed to explain the behavior of non-effeminate gay men. He suggested that some of LeVay's ideas had anti-feminist implications, and that LeVay underestimated "the dangers inherent in interpreting correlational relationships between brain structures and ill-defined sample groups". He also concluded that LeVay's view that demonstrating that homosexuality has a biological basis would help overcome prejudice against gay people was unlikely to be correct.{{sfn|Woodson|2003|pages=187-189}}

Horvath described the book as one of the best works on the history of scientific research on homosexuality, writing that it was "well-researched and compellingly told", and that LeVay provided a "detailed and extremely moving" account of the "horrific consequences" of some theories of homosexuality for gay people, including unsuccessful attempts to alter homosexuality through various forms of treatment. However, he also disputed many of LeVay's conclusions "about the nature of homosexuality and about the usefulness of biological explanations in the struggle for gay rights". He considered it regrettable that LeVay's view of homosexuality was little different from the "third sex" model proposed by Hirschfeld in 1896, argued that LeVay's view that gay men have certain traits more typical of females than of males is based on an "uncritical view of gender" that fails to distinguish between sex and gender, and wrote that his claim that he was the first person to report on anatomical differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men was incorrect.{{sfn|Horvath|1997|pages=376–377}}

Kenen considered the book well written and accessible to lay readers, but uneven in quality. She maintained that while LeVay's chapter on the brain and his chapter on genetics were useful, LeVay’s bias in favor of biological explanations distorted his presentation of older psychological theories, and his "ahistorical sensibility" distorted his discussion of science in its social context. She faulted LeVay's discussions of psychoanalysis and social learning theories, writing that they "show a remarkably unsophisticated understanding" of the relevant scientific, social, and methodological issues, and that "LeVay’s ridicule of psychological theories of human sexuality add nothing to our understanding of the historical or intellectual contexts of such approaches." She suggested that LeVay was biased by his position as a "white gay male scientist", and that his "assumptions about what constitutes homosexuality" were "historically contingent." She argued that while LeVay considered homosexuality part of a "package" of "sex a-typical characteristics", his assumptions about what constituted "sex-typical" characteristics were unexamined and unconvincing. She found LeVay to be naive to believe "in the power of so-called objective modern science to overcome moral and religious intolerance", and wrote that he "contributes little to the pressing theoretical, historical, and social debates" surrounding "scientific research on human sexual behavior."{{sfn|Kenen|1999|pages=73–74}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher Timothy F. Murphy described LeVay's suggestion that modifications in a person's [[INAH 3]] might affect their sexual orientation as speculation in ''Gay Science'' (1997). He noted that while LeVay argues that aborting a pregnancy likely to result in a gay child should not be made illegal, other commentators were less willing to accept such a position. He also argued that while LeVay believes that the study of animal sexual behavior will help make society more tolerant of homosexuality, it was uncertain that it would and if it did, this "should not be because descriptions of the behavior of animals have normative force in regard to the behavior of human beings."{{sfn|Murphy|1997|pages=86, 104, 168, 243, 245, 251}} The biologist [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] credited LeVay with providing an "excellent summary" of the views of Ulrichs and Freud in ''Human Natures'' (2000).{{sfn|Ehrlich|2000|page=393}} [[Robert R. Reilly]] credited LeVay with correctly observing that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] declassified homosexuality because of gay activism in ''Making Gay Okay'' (2014).{{sfn|Reilly|2015|page=125}}

'''Scientific evidence''' is [[evidence]] which serves to either support or counter a [[science|scientific]] [[Scientific theory|theory]] or [[hypothesis]]. Such evidence is expected to be [[empirical evidence]] and interpretation in accordance with [[scientific method]]. Standards for scientific evidence vary according to the field of inquiry, but the strength of scientific evidence is generally based on the results of [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] and the strength of [[scientific control]]s.

==Principles of inference ==

A person's assumptions or beliefs about the relationship between observations and a hypothesis will affect whether that person takes the observations as evidence.&lt;ref name="philsci"&gt;{{cite book|last=Longino|first=Helen|title=Philosophy of Science, Vol. 46|date=March 1979|pages=37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions or beliefs will also affect how a person utilizes the observations as evidence. For example, the Earth's apparent lack of motion may be taken as evidence for a geocentric cosmology. However, after sufficient evidence is presented for heliocentric cosmology and the apparent lack of motion is explained, the initial observation is strongly discounted as evidence.

When rational observers have different background beliefs, they may draw different conclusions from the same scientific evidence. For example, [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], working with [[phlogiston theory]], explained his observations about the decomposition of [[mercuric oxide]] using phlogiston. In contrast, [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]], developing the theory of elements, explained the same observations with reference to oxygen.&lt;ref name = "Kuhn"&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolution, 2nd Ed. (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Note that a causal relationship between the observations and hypothesis does not exist to cause the observation to be taken as evidence,&lt;ref name="philsci"/&gt; but rather the causal relationship is provided by the person seeking to establish observations as evidence.

A more formal method to characterize the effect of background beliefs is [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2007/entries/epistemology-bayesian/ William Talbott "Bayesian Epistemology"] Accessed May 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bayesian inference, beliefs are expressed as percentages indicating one's confidence in them. One starts from an initial probability (a [[Prior probability|prior]]), and then updates that probability using [[Bayes' theorem]] after observing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2007/entries/evidence/ Thomas Kelly "Evidence"]. Accessed May 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, two independent observers of the same event will rationally arrive at different conclusions if their priors (previous observations that are also relevant to the conclusion) differ. However, if they are allowed to communicate with each other, they will end in agreement (per [[Aumann's agreement theorem]]).

The importance of background beliefs in the determination of what observations are evidence can be illustrated using [[deductive reasoning]], such as [[syllogism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;George Kenneth Stone, "Evidence in Science"(1966)&lt;/ref&gt; If either of the propositions is not accepted as true, the conclusion will not be accepted either.

==Utility of scientific evidence==

{{see also|Falsifiability}}

Philosophers, such as [[Karl R. Popper]], have provided influential theories of the [[scientific method]] within which scientific evidence plays a central role.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper,"The Logic of Scientific Discovery" (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Popper provides that a scientist creatively develops a theory which may be falsified by testing the theory against evidence or known facts. Popper's theory presents an asymmetry in that evidence can prove a theory wrong, by establishing facts that are inconsistent with the theory. In contrast, evidence cannot prove a theory correct because other evidence, yet to be discovered, may exist that is inconsistent with the theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman00.pdf/$file/sciman00.pdf Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence], 2nd Ed. (2000), p. 71. Accessed May 13, 2007.(dead link) see: [https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/2015/SciMan3D01.pdf the 3rd edition of Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophic versus scientific views==

The philosophical community has investigated the logical requirements for scientific evidence by examination of the relationship between evidence and hypotheses, in contrast to scientific approaches which focus on the candidate facts and their context.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah G. Mayo, Philosophy of Science, Vol. 67, Supplement. Proceedings of the 1998 Biennial Meetings of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]]. Part II: Symposia Papers. (Sep., 2000), pp. S194.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bechtel|Bechtel]], as an example of a scientific approach, provides factors (clarity of the data, replication by others, consistency with results arrived at by alternative methods and consistency with plausible theories) useful for determination of whether observations may be considered scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;William Bechtel, Scientific Evidence: Creating and Evaluating Experimental Instruments and Research Techniques, PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association, Vol. 1 (1990) p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of philosophical approaches to decide whether an observation may be considered evidence; many of these focus on the relationship between the evidence and the hypothesis. Carnap recommends distinguishing such approaches into three categories: classificatory (whether the evidence confirms the hypothesis), comparative (whether the evidence supports a first hypothesis more than an alternative hypothesis) or quantitative (the degree to which the evidence supports a hypothesis).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Carnap, Logical Foundations of Probability (1962) p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Achinstein|Achinstein]] provides a concise presentation by prominent philosophers on evidence, including [[Carl Hempel]] (Confirmation), [[Nelson Goodman]] (of grue fame), [[R. B. Braithwaite]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Wesley C. Salmon]], Clark Glymour and [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Achinstein (Ed.) "The Concept of Evidence" (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the philosophical assumption of the [[Church–Turing thesis#Philosophical implications|Strong Church-Turing Universe Thesis]], a mathematical criterion for evaluation of evidence has been conjectured, with the criterion having a resemblance to the idea of [[Occam's Razor]] that the simplest comprehensive description of the evidence is most likely correct. It states formally, "The ideal principle states that the prior probability associated with the hypothesis should be given by the algorithmic universal probability, and the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the posted curriculum for an [http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/howscienceworks_06 "Understanding Science 101"] course taught at University of California - Berkeley: "Testing hypotheses and theories is at the core of the process of science." This philosophical belief in  "hypothesis testing" as the essence of science is prevalent among both scientists and philosophers. It is important to note that this [[hypothesis]] does not take into account all of the activities or scientific objectives of all scientists. When Geiger and Marsden [[Geiger–Marsden experiment| scattered alpha particles through thin gold foil]] for example, the resulting data enabled their experimental adviser, Ernest Rutherford, to very accurately calculate the mass and size of an atomic nucleus for the first time. No hypothesis was required. It may be that a more general view of science is offered by physicist, Lawrence Krauss, who consistently writes in the [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-m-krauss/the-big-unanswered-questi_1_b_7151666.html media] about scientists answering questions by measuring physical properties and processes.

== Concept of scientific proof ==
While the phrase "scientific proof" is often used in the popular media,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/02/26/greenpeace-co-founder-no-scientific-proof-humans-are-dominant-cause-warming/ | title=Greenpeace co-founder: No scientific proof humans are dominant cause of warming climate | work=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=28 February 2014 | accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; many scientists have argued that there is really no such thing. For example, [[Karl Popper]] once wrote that "In the empirical sciences, which alone can furnish us with information about the world we live in, proofs do not occur, if we mean by 'proof' an argument which establishes once and for ever the truth of a theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |date=2011 |orig-year=1966 |title=[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]] |edition=5th |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages=229-230 |isbn=9781136700323 |author-link=Karl Popper }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html | title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution | work=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] | date=1999–2012 | accessdate=19 March 2014 | author=Theobald, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Einstein said:

{{block quote|The scientific theorist is not to be envied.  For Nature, or more precisely experiment, is an inexorable and not very friendly judge of his work.  It never says "Yes" to a theory.  In the most favorable cases it says "Maybe," and in the great majority of cases simply "No." If an experiment agrees with a theory it means for the latter "Maybe," and if it does not agree it means "No."  Probably every theory will someday experience its "No" - most theories, soon after conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaither|first1=Carl|title=Gaither's Dictionary of Scientific Quotations|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-49575-0|page=1602}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Stephan von Breuning''' (21 November 1894 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1983) was an Austrian [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Coleoptera]], particularly [[Cerambycidae]].

==Career==
An amateur working on the rich collections of the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], he described 7894 [[taxon|taxa]] of Cerambycidae.

==Works==
The complete list of his entomological works has been published in the ''[[Bulletin de la Société Sciences Nat]]'', number 41.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624044100/http://www.insects.demon.co.uk/bullsn/bull-1.html]

One of his most famous remains ''Études sur les Lamiaires'', published in [[Novitates entomologicae]], 1934-1946.

==Personal life==
He gave the photo shown together with a text to be published after his death. Von Breuning lived with his wife in a small studio rue Durantin, Paris 18ème at the top of an old building.

'''Supercooling''', also known as '''undercooling''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rathz |first=Tom |title=Undercooling |url=https://science.nasa.gov/ssl/msad/dtf/under1.htm |accessdate=2010-01-12 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mjJauR7S?url=http://science.nasa.gov/ssl/msad/dtf/under1.htm |archivedate=2010-01-12 |postscript=. |publisher=[[NASA]] |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of lowering the temperature of a [[liquid]] or a [[gas]] below its [[melting point|freezing point]] without it becoming a [[solid]].

==Explanation==
A liquid crossing its standard freezing point will [[crystalization|crystalize]] in the presence of a [[nucleation|seed crystal or nucleus]] around which a [[crystal]] structure can form creating a solid. Lacking any such [[seed crystal|nuclei]], the liquid [[phase (matter)|phase]] can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which [[nucleation#Homogeneous nucleation|crystal homogeneous nucleation]] occurs. Homogeneous nucleation can occur above the [[glass transition temperature]], but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature, an [[amorphous]] (non-crystalline) solid will form.

[[Water]] normally freezes at 273.15&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (0&amp;nbsp;°C or 32&amp;nbsp;°F), but it can be "supercooled" at [[standard pressure]] down to its [[nucleation#Homogeneous nucleation|crystal homogeneous nucleation]] at almost 224.8&amp;nbsp;K (−48.3&amp;nbsp;°C/−55&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Emily|author2=Valeria Molinero |title=structural transformation in supercooled water controls the crystallization rate of ice|journal=Nature|date=24 November 2011|volume=479|issue=7374|pages=506–508|doi=10.1038/nature10586|arxiv = 1107.1622 |bibcode = 2011Natur.479..506M|pmid=22113691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="debenedetti 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Debenedetti|Stanley|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of supercooling requires that water be pure and free of [[nucleation]] sites, which can be achieved by processes like [[reverse osmosis]] or [[chemical demineralization]], but the cooling itself does not require any specialised technique. If water is cooled at a rate on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K/s, the crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a [[Glass#Physical properties|glass]]—that is, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid. Its [[glass transition temperature]] is much colder and harder to determine, but studies estimate it at about 136&amp;nbsp;K (−137&amp;nbsp;°C/−215&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;Insights into Phases of Liquid Water from Study of Its Unusual Glass-Forming Properties, C. Austen Angell, Science 319, 582 (2008);[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5863/582.full.pdf] [http://phys.org/news121010887.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Amorphous ice|Glassy water]] can be heated up to approximately 150&amp;nbsp;K (−123&amp;nbsp;°C/−189.4&amp;nbsp;°F) without nucleation occurring.&lt;ref name="debenedetti 42"/&gt;
In the range of temperatures between 231&amp;nbsp;K (−42&amp;nbsp;°C/−43.6&amp;nbsp;°F) and 150&amp;nbsp;K (−123&amp;nbsp;°C/−189.4&amp;nbsp;°F), experiments find only crystal ice.

Droplets of supercooled water often exist in [[stratus]] and [[cumulus]] [[cloud]]s. An [[aircraft]] flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets, which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft's wings or blockage of its instruments and probes, unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate [[de-icing]] system. [[Freezing rain]] is also caused by supercooled droplets.

The process opposite to supercooling, the melting of a solid above the freezing point, is much more difficult, and a solid will almost always melt at the same [[temperature]] for a given [[pressure]]. For this reason, it is the melting point which is usually identified, using [[melting point apparatus]]; even when the subject of a paper is "freezing-point determination", the actual methodology is "the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/1/57.pdf A new method of freezing-point determination for small quantities]", J. A. Ramsay, ''[[J. Exp. Biol.]]''.1949; 26&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, at a given pressure, to [[superheating|superheat]] a liquid above its [[boiling point]] without it becoming gaseous.

Supercooling is often confused with [[freezing-point depression]]. Supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid.  Freezing point depression is when a [[solution]] can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the [[Solution|solute]]; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when [[sodium chloride]] is added to pure water.

== Constitutional supercooling ==
[[File:Constitutional supercooling - phase diagram, concentration, and temperature.png|thumb|Constitutional supercooling – phase diagram, concentration, and temperature]]

Constitutional supercooling, which occurs during solidification, is due to compositional solid changes, and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the [[solid–liquid interface]].  When solidifying a liquid, the interface is often unstable, and the velocity of the solid–liquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercooling.

Supercooled zones are observed when the [[liquidus]] temperature gradient at the interface is larger than the temperature gradient.

: &lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial T_L}{\partial x}\right|_{x=0} &gt; \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;m \left.\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial x}\right|_{x=0} &gt; \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

The slope of the liquidus phase boundary on the phase diagram is &lt;math&gt;m = \partial T_L / \partial C_L&lt;/math&gt;

The concentration gradient is related to points, &lt;math&gt;C^{LS}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^{SL}&lt;/math&gt;, on the phase diagram:

: &lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\partial C_L}{\partial x}\right|_{x=0} = - \frac{C^{LS} - C^{SL}}{D/v}&lt;/math&gt;

For steady-state growth &lt;math&gt;C^{SL}=C_0&lt;/math&gt; and the partition function &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{C^{SL}}{C^{LS}}&lt;/math&gt; can be assumed to be constant. Therefore, the minimum thermal gradient necessary to create a stable solid front is as expressed below.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} &lt; \frac{m C_0 (1-k) v}{kD}&lt;/math&gt;

==In animals==

In order to survive extreme low temperatures in certain environments, some animals use the phenomenon of supercooling that allow them to remain unfrozen and avoid cell damage and death. There are many techniques that aid in maintaining a liquid state, such as the production of [[antifreeze protein]]s, or AFPs, which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.G. Duman|title=Antifreeze and ice nucleator proteins in terrestrial arthropods|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|volume=63|pages=327–357|year=2001|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.63.1.327|pmid=11181959}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[winter flounder]] is one such fish that utilizes these proteins to survive in its frigid environment. Noncolligative proteins are secreted by the liver into the bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Garth L Fletcher |author2=Choy L Hew |author3=Peter L Davies  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Antifreeze Proteins of Teleost Fishes|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|volume=63|pages=359–390|year=2001|doi= 10.1146/annurev.physiol.63.1.359|pmid=11181960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals use colligative antifreezes, which increases the concentration of solutes in their bodily fluids, thus lowering their freezing point. Fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface, because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately. Animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing. Supercooling is also common in insects, reptiles, and other [[ectotherm]]s, with insects being able to survive in the coldest environments out of any supercooling animals.

Supercooling is a last resort for animals. The best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible. As an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids, as this is a thermodynamically unstable state. The fluids eventually reach the supercooling point, which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=C.H. Lowe |author2=P.J. Lardner |author3=E.A. Halpern  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Supercooling in reptiles and other vertebrates|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology|volume=39A|issue=1|pages=125–135|year=1971|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(71)90352-5|pmid=4399229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals unintentionally undergo supercooling and are only able to decrease the odds of freezing once supercooled. Even though supercooling is essential for survival, there are many risks associated with it.

==In plants==
As demonstrated by animals, plants can also survive extreme cold conditions brought forth during the winter months. Many plant species located in northern climates can acclimate under these cold conditions by supercooling, thus these plants survive temperatures up to −40&amp;nbsp;°C. Although this supercooling phenomenon is poorly understood, it has been recognized through [[infrared thermography]]. Ice nucleation occurs in certain plant organs and tissues, debatably beginning in the [[xylem]] tissue and spreading throughout the rest of the plant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisniewski|first1=M|title=Observations of ice nucleation and propagation in plants using infrared thermography|journal=Plant Physiology|date=1997|volume=113|issue=2|pages=327–334|doi=10.1104/pp.113.2.327|pmid=12223611|pmc=158146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearce|first1=R|title=Plant freezing and damage|journal=Analysis of Botany|date=2001|volume=87|issue=4|pages=417–424|url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/4/417.full.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2016|doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrared thermography allows for droplets of water to be visualized as they crystalize in extracellular spaces.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisniewski|first1=M|title=Ice nucleation, propagation, and deep supercooling in woody plants|journal=Journal of Crop Improvement|date=2004|volume=10|pages=5–16|doi=10.1300/j411v10n01_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercooling inhibits the formation of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular ice.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Cellular barriers such as [[lignin]], [[suberin]] and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled tissue.&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuprian|first1=E|title=Persistent supercooling of reproductive shoots is enabled by structural ice barriers being active despite intact xylem connection|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=9|page=e0163160|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0163160|pmid=27632365|pmc=5025027|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1163160K|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The xylem and primary tissue of plants are very susceptible to cold temperatures because of the large proportion of water in the cell. Many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the cold.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuner|first1=Gilbert|title=Frost resistance in alpine woody plants|journal=Front Plant Sci|date=2014|volume=5|page=654|doi=10.3389/fpls.2014.00654|pmid=25520725|pmc=4249714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs ''[[Rhododendron ferrugineum]]'' and ''[[Vaccinium vitis-idaea]]'' as well as ''[[Abies]]'', ''[[Picea]]'' and ''[[Larix]]'' species.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the plant.&lt;ref name="Freezing and injury in plants"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=M|title=Freezing and injury in plants|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|date=1976|volume=27|pages=507–528|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.27.060176.002451}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extracellular ice may lead to plant dehydration.&lt;ref name="Pearce2001"/&gt;

==Applications==
One commercial application of supercooling is in [[refrigeration]]. Freezers can cool drinks to a supercooled level&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chillchamber.hussmann.com Chill Chamber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301174525/http://www.chillchamber.hussmann.com/ |date=March 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that when they are opened, they form a [[slush]]. Another example is a product that can supercool the beverage in a conventional freezer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slush-it.com Slush-It!]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123161644/http://www.slush-it.com/ |date=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Coca-Cola Company]] briefly marketed special [[vending machine]]s containing [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] in the UK, and Coke in Singapore, which stored the bottles in a supercooled state so that their content would turn to [[Slush (beverage)|slush]] upon opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2007/09/coca-cola-plans/|title=Coca Cola Plans High Tech, Super Cool Sprite|author=Charlie Sorrel|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=2007-09-21|accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercooling was successfully applied to organ preservation at Massachusetts General Hospital/[[Harvard Medical School]]. [[Liver]]s that were later transplanted into recipient animals were preserved by supercooling for up to 96 hours (4 days), quadrupling the limits of what could be achieved by conventional liver preservation methods. The livers were supercooled to a temperature of –6&amp;nbsp;°C in a specialized solution that protected against freezing and injury from the cold temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berendsen |first1=TA |last2=Bruinsma |first2=BG |last3=Puts |first3=CF |last4=Saeidi |first4=N |last5=Usta |first5=OB |last6=Uygun |first6=BE |first7=Maria-Louisa |last7=Izamis |first8=Mehmet |last8=Toner |first9=Martin L |last9=Yarmush |first10= Korkut |last10=Uygun |title=Supercooling enables long-term transplantation survival following 4 days of liver preservation |journal=Nature Medicine |year=2014 |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=790–793 |doi=10.1038/nm.3588|pmid=24973919 |pmc=4141719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential application is drug delivery. In 2015 researchers demonstrated the ability to crystallize membranes at a specific time. Liquid-encapsulated drugs can potentially be delivered to the site and with a slight environmental change, the liquid rapidly changes into a crystalline form that releases the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A "super cool" way to deliver drugs |first=George |last=Hunka|date=2015-05-06 |accessdate= |url=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2015/05/super-cool-way-deliver-drugs |publisher=R&amp;D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a team at [[Iowa State University]] proposed a method for "soldering without heat" by using encapsulated droplets of supercooled liquid metal to repair heat sensitive electronic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i11/Soldering-without-heat.html|title=Soldering without heat|author=Mitch Jacoby|website=Chemical and Engineering News|date=2016-03-14|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep21864|title=Mechanical Fracturing of Core-Shell Undercooled Metal Particles for Heat-Free Soldering|author=Simge Çınar, Ian D. Tevis, Jiahao Chen &amp; Martin Thuo|website=Nature|date=2016-02-23|accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eftekhari et al. proposed an empirical theory explaining that supercooling of ionic [[liquid crystal|liquid crystals]] can build ordered channels for diffusion for energy storage applications. In this case, the electrolyte has a rigid structure comparable with that of a solid electrolyte but the diffusion coefficient can be as large as in liquid electrolytes. Supercooling increases the medium viscosity but keeps the directional channels open for diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eftekhari |first1=A |last2=Liu |first2=Y |last3=Chen |first3=P |title=Different roles of ionic liquids in lithium batteries |journal=Journal of Power Sources |year=2016 |volume=334 |pages=221–239 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.10.025|bibcode=2016JPS...334..221E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15501">{{for|the ancient Greek epic poem about Telegonus|Telegony}}
'''Telegony''' is a theory in [[heredity]], holding that offspring can inherit the characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent; thus the child of a widowed or remarried woman might partake of traits of a previous husband. 

Whereas experiments in the late 19th century on several species failed to provide evidence that offspring would inherit any character from their mother's previous mates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burkhardt|first=RW|title=Closing the door on Lord Morton's mare: the rise and fall of telegony|journal=Studies in History of Biology|year=1979|volume=3|pages=1–21|pmid=11610983}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2016}} a similar phenomenon whereby environmental (non-genetic) traits were passed has been recently discovered in a species of fly.

== Etymology ==
The term was coined by [[August Weismann]] from the Greek words [[wikt:τῆλε|τῆλε]] (tèle) meaning 'far' and [[wikt:γονος|γονος]] (gonos) meaning 'offspring'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bynum|first=Bill|title=Telegony|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2002|volume=359|issue=9313|page=1256|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08200-4|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08200-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may also refer to [[Odysseus]]' son [[Telegonus]]; the [[lost work|lost poem]] named after him is ''[[Telegony]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Early perceptions ==
{{further|Partible paternity}}

The idea of telegony goes back to [[Aristotle]]. It states that individuals can inherit traits not only from their fathers, but also from other males previously known to their mothers. in other words, it was thought that [[partible paternity|paternity could be shared]].&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Lydia |title=Aristotle's Telegony Has Merit: Previous Male Partners Can Influence Other Men's Offspring |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/aristotle-right-about-telegony-previous-partner-can-influence-another-males-offspring-1468015 |publisher=International Business Times |date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory, expounded as part of [[Aristotle's biology]], was accepted throughout Antiquity. The concept of telegonic impregnation was expressed in [[Greek mythology]] in the origins of [[Greek hero|their heroes]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Such double fatherhood, one immortal, one mortal, was a familiar feature of heroes such as [[Theseus]], who was doubly conceived in the same night. By the understanding of [[History of human sexuality#Greece|sex in Antiquity]], the mix of semen gave Theseus a combination of divine as well as mortal characteristics. Of a supposed [[Parnassos]], founder of Delphi, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' x.6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; observes, "Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say was the god [[Poseidon]], the human father being Cleopompus." Sometimes the result could be twins such as [[Castor and Pollux]], one born divine and one mortal.

The more general doctrine of "maternal impressions" was also known in Ancient Israel. The book of Genesis describes [[Jacob]] inducing goats and sheep in [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s herds to bear striped and spotted young by placing dark wooden rods with white stripes in their watering troughs.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1911|volume=26|chapter=Telegony|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Telegony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telegony influenced early Christianity as well. The [[Valentinianism|Gnostic followers]] of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinius]] (circa 100–160 CE) characteristically took the concept from the physiological world into the realm of psychology and spirituality by extending the supposed influence even to the thoughts of the woman. In the [[Gospel of Philip]], a text among those found at [[Nag Hammadi]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whomever the woman loves, to him those who are born are like; if her husband, they are like her husband; if an [[adultery|adulterer]], they are like the adulterer. Often when a woman sleeps with her husband, but while her heart is with the adulterer with whom she is accustomed to unite, she bears the one whom she bears so that he is like the adulterer.&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of Philip, p. 112. Noted in Robert M. Grant, "The Mystery of Marriage in the Gospel of Philip" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''15'''.3 (September 1961:129–140) p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of telegony was revived with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This was part of the resistance to the marriage in 1361 of [[Edward, the Black Prince]], heir to the throne of [[Edward III of England]], with [[Joan of Kent|Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent]], who had been previously married: their progeny, it was thought, might not be completely of his [[Plantagenet|Plantagenet blood]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Understandings in the 19th century and the collapse of the theory in the 20th ==
In the 19th century, the most widely credited example was that of [[Lord Morton’s mare]], reported by the distinguished surgeon Sir [[Everard Home]], and cited by [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, ''Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication'' (1868).&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Morton bred a white [[Mare (horse)|mare]] with a wild [[quagga]] [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[quagga]] was a relative of the [[zebra]], now extinct.&lt;/ref&gt; and when he later bred the same mare with a white stallion, the offspring strangely had stripes in the legs, like the quagga.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gPbYbFt7sYYC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=lord+morton%27s+mare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9qHq0CehKy&amp;sig=db0jgAoZRi8DomYs4wf9sT_zp40&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NwDOSfviJpCgtgOm6ZWgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result "Lord Morton's Mare"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Surgeon-General]] of New York, the physiologist [[Austin Flint (1836–1915)|Austin Flint]], in his ''Text-Book of Human Physiology'' (fourth edition, 1888) described the phenomenon as follows:&lt;ref name=Flint&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Austin|title=Text-Book of Human Physiology|year=1888|edition=fourth|publisher=Appleton, New York|location=USA|pages=797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A peculiar and, it seems to me, an inexplicable fact is, that previous pregnancies have an influence upon offspring. This is well known to breeders of animals. If pure-blooded mares or bitches have been once covered by an inferior male, in subsequent fecondations the young are likely to partake of the character of the first male, even if they be afterwards bred with males of unimpeachable pedigree. What the mechanism of the influence of the first conception is, it is impossible to say; but the fact is incontestable. The same influence is observed in the human subject. A woman may have, by a second husband, children who resemble a former husband, and this is particularly well marked in certain instances by the colour of the hair and eyes. A white woman who has had children by a negro may subsequently bear children to a white man, these children presenting some of the unmistakable peculiarities of the negro race.&lt;ref name=Flint/&gt;}}

Both [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] found telegony to be a credible theory;&lt;ref name=bondeson&gt;Jan Bondeson, ''A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities'', 1999:159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Weismann]], on the other hand, had expressed doubts about the theory earlier and it fell out of scientific favor in the 1890s. A series of experiments by [[James Cossar Ewart]] in Scotland and other researchers in Germany and Brazil failed to find any evidence of the phenomenon. Also, the statistician [[Karl Pearson]] pointed out that, if telegony was true, later children of the same couple should increasingly resemble their father, which is not the case.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=K.|title=Statistics of telegony|journal=Science|date=1 October 1909|volume=30|issue=770|pages=443–444|doi=10.1126/science.30.770.443-a|pmid=17777275|bibcode=1909Sci....30..443P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists now explain the phenomenon of Lord Morton's mare with reference to the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant and recessive]] variants of a gene: both the mare and the stallion had a recessive gene; the foal inherited these alleles and thus displayed the characteristic invisible in its parents.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In mammals, each [[spermatozoon|sperm]] has the [[haploid]] set of [[chromosome]]s and each [[ovum|egg]] has another haploid set. During the process of [[fertilization]] a [[zygote]] with the [[diploid]] set is produced. This set will be inherited by every [[somatic cell]] of a mammal, with exactly half the [[genetic material]] coming from the producer of the sperm (the father) and another half from the producer of the egg (the mother). Thus, the myth of telegony is fundamentally incompatible with our knowledge of [[genetics]] and the [[reproduction|reproductive process]]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] stated "All these beliefs, from inheritance of acquired traits to telegony, must now be classed as superstitions."&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/262934/heredity&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==

Telegony, once a popular theory among nineteenth century biologists, was largely dismissed with the arrival of [[Mendelian genetics]]. However, in 2014 the evolutionary ecologists A. J. Crean and colleagues reported a seemingly telegonic phenomenon in a fly, [[Neriidae|''Telostylinus angusticollis'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1= A. J. | last1= Crean | first2= A.

{{Quote|title = "Like father like son? Nongenetic paternal effects reinvigorate the possibility of telegony"|author=Crean, Kopps, and Bonduriansky
|quote = As a first step towards disentangling whether the effect is borne by the sperm itself or by accessory-gland products (ACPs) in the seminal fluid, we mated females initially to a male in high or low condition and then remated the female to a new male in high or low condition two weeks later. Interestingly, offspring size and viability were determined by the condition of the first male, with no effect of the condition of the second mate. Genetic tests confirm this result holds even when the second male is the biological father of the offspring. These findings suggest the paternal effect is mediated by ACPs, and provide a compelling case for reassessing the possibility of telegony as a valid phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ajcrean/&gt;}}

Y. S. Liu has proposed possible molecular mechanisms that may account for telegony; however, his work is predicated on the beliefs of pre-[[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] breeders to reinforce the idea that traits are passed from earlier matings. The proposed mechanisms include the penetration of spermatozoa into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract, the incorporation of the DNA released by spermatozoa into maternal [[somatic cell]]s, the presence of fetal DNA in maternal blood, incorporation of exogenous DNA into somatic cells, presence of fetal cells and fetal DNA in maternal blood and sperm RNA-mediated non-Mendelian inheritance of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Y.

== Influence in culture ==
{{See also|Scientific racism}}
Telegony influenced late [[Racism#19th century|19th-century racialist beliefs]]. A woman who had a child with a non-[[Aryan]] man, it was argued, could never have a "pure" Aryan child again. This idea was adopted by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]].&lt;ref name=bondeson/&gt;

Telegony re-emerged within [[Russian Orthodox Church#Post-Soviet recovery and problems|post-Soviet Russian Orthodoxy]]. ''Virginity and Telegony: The Orthodox church and modern science of genetic inversions'' was published in 2004. [[Pravda.ru]] gave an overview of the concept and a brief review of the book, saying that the authors invented "scary and incredible stories" to "make women be very careful about their sexual contacts" and that the idea was being used by the Church to scare the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman's first partner may become genetic father of all her kids, telegony says|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/health/27-06-2007/94136-telegony-0/|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher=Pravda Report|date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Kuznetsova]], who was appointed [[Children's Ombudsman#Russia|Children's Rights Commissioner for the Russian Federation]] in 2016, had said several years earlier that she believes in the concept, amongst other fringe views. The founding editor of the business newspaper ''[[Vedomosti]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEONID BERSHIDSKY|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/contributors/AQuRIoVsdeM/leonid-bershidsky|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted the appointment of someone with such views as a sign that [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] was becoming more ideological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=BERSHIDSKY|first1=LEONID|title=Putin Promotes the Next Generation of Ideological Cronies|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-09-12/putin-promotes-the-next-generation-of-ideological-cronies|accessdate=8 November 2016|agency=Bloomberg View|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Three Laws of Robotics''' (often shortened to '''The Three Laws''' or known as '''Asimov's Laws''') are a set of rules devised by the [[science fiction]] author [[Isaac Asimov]]. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]" (included in the 1950 collection ''[[I, Robot]]''), although they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws, quoted as being from the "Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.", are:
# '''First Law''' - A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# '''Second Law''' - A robot must obey the orders &lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt;{{sic|given it|expected=given to it|hide=y}}&lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt; by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# '''Third Law''' - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.&lt;ref name=IROBOT &gt;{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=I, Robot |date=1950 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York City |isbn=0-385-42304-7 |page=40 |edition=The Isaac Asimov Collection |language=English |format=hardcover |chapter=Runaround |quote=This is an ''exact'' transcription of the laws. They also appear in the front of the book, and in both places there is ''no'' "to" in the 2nd law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These form an organizing principle and unifying theme for Asimov's [[robot]]ic-based fiction, appearing in his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], the stories linked to it, and his [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'' series]] of [[young adult literature|young-adult fiction]]. The Laws are incorporated into almost all of the [[positronic brain|positronic robots]] appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often [[parody|parodic]], appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.

The original laws have been altered and elaborated on by Asimov and other authors. Asimov himself made slight modifications to the first three in various books and short stories to further develop how robots would interact with humans and each other. In later fiction where robots had taken responsibility for government of whole planets and human civilizations, Asimov also added a fourth, or zeroth law, to precede the others:

# &lt;li value="0"&gt;A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

The Three Laws, and the zeroth, have pervaded science fiction and are referred to in many books, films, and other media, and have impacted thought on [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] as well.

==History==
In ''The Rest of the Robots'', published in 1964, Asimov noted that when he began writing in 1940 he felt that "one of the stock plots of science fiction was&amp;nbsp;... robots were created and destroyed their creator. Knowledge has its dangers, yes, but is the response to be a retreat from knowledge? Or is knowledge to be used as itself a barrier to the dangers it brings?" He decided that in his stories robots would not "turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of [[Faust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Rest of the Robots| publisher=Doubleday| year=1964| isbn=0-385-09041-2| chapter=Introduction| author=Isaac Asimov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 1939, Asimov attended a meeting of the [[Queens]] ([[New York (state)|New York]]) Science Fiction Society where he met [[Eando Binder|Earl and Otto Binder]] who had recently published a short story [[I, Robot (short story)|"I, Robot"]] featuring a sympathetic robot named [[Adam Link]] who was misunderstood and motivated by love and honor. (This was the first of a series of ten stories; the next year "Adam Link's Vengeance" (1940) featured Adam thinking "A robot must never kill a human, of his own free will.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=James Gunn (author)| last=Gunn| first=James| title=On Variations on a Robot| journal=[[Asimov's Science Fiction|IASFM]] |date=July 1980| pages=56–81}} Reprinted in {{cite book| title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction| year=1982| isbn=0-19-503060-5| author=James Gunn.| publisher=Oxford Univ. Pr.| location=Oxford u.a.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov admired the story. Three days later Asimov began writing "my own story of a sympathetic and noble robot", his 14th story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In Memory Yet Green| publisher=Doubleday| year=1979| first=Isaac| last=Asimov| isbn=0-380-75432-0| page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later he took "[[Robbie (short story)|Robbie]]" to [[John W. Campbell]] the editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''. Campbell rejected it, claiming that it bore too strong a resemblance to [[Lester del Rey]]'s "[[Helen O'Loy]]", published in December 1938; the story of a robot that is so much like a person that she falls in love with her creator and becomes his ideal wife.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp.236–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederik Pohl]] published "Robbie" in ''[[Astonishing Stories]]'' magazine the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov attributes the Three Laws to John W. Campbell, from a conversation that took place on 23 December 1940. Campbell claimed that Asimov had the Three Laws already in his mind and that they simply needed to be stated explicitly. Several years later Asimov's friend [[Randall Garrett]] attributed the Laws to a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] partnership between the two men&amp;nbsp;– a suggestion that Asimov adopted enthusiastically.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp. 285–7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his autobiographical writings, Asimov included the First Law's "inaction" clause because of [[Arthur Hugh Clough]]'s poem "[[The Latest Decalogue]]", which includes the satirical lines "Thou shalt not kill, but needst not strive / officiously to keep alive".&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1979). In Memory Yet Green. Doubleday. Chapters 21 through 26 {{ISBN|0-380-75432-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Asimov pins the creation of the Three Laws on one particular date, their appearance in his literature happened over a period. He wrote two robot stories with no explicit mention of the Laws, "[[Robbie (short story)|Robbie]]" and "[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]". He assumed, however, that robots would have certain inherent safeguards. "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", his third robot story, makes the first mention of the First Law but not the other two. All three laws finally appeared together in "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]". When these stories and several others were compiled in the anthology ''[[I, Robot]]'', "Reason" and "Robbie" were updated to acknowledge all the Three Laws, though the material Asimov added to "Reason" is not entirely consistent with the Three Laws as he described them elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Patrouch| first=Joseph F.| title=The Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov| publisher=Doubleday| year=1974| isbn=0-385-08696-2| page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the idea of a robot protecting human lives when it does not believe those humans truly exist is at odds with Elijah Baley's reasoning, as described [[#Ambiguities and loopholes|below]].

During the 1950s Asimov wrote a series of science fiction novels expressly intended for young-adult audiences. Originally his publisher expected that the novels could be adapted into a long-running television series, something like ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' had been for radio. Fearing that his stories would be adapted into the "uniformly awful" programming he saw flooding the television channels&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov decided to publish the [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'']] books under the [[pseudonym]] "Paul French". When plans for the television series fell through, Asimov decided to abandon the pretence; he brought the Three Laws into ''Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter'', noting that this "was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for even the most casual reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In Joy Still Felt| publisher=Doubleday| year=1980| isbn=0-385-15544-1| last= Asimov| first=Isaac| page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short story [[Evidence (Asimov)|"Evidence"]] Asimov lets his recurring character [[Susan Calvin|Dr. Susan Calvin]] expound a [[morality|moral]] basis behind the Three Laws. Calvin points out that human beings are typically expected to refrain from harming other human beings (except in times of extreme duress like war, or to save a greater number) and this is equivalent to a robot's First Law. Likewise, according to Calvin, society expects individuals to obey instructions from recognized authorities such as doctors, teachers and so forth which equals the Second Law of Robotics. Finally humans are typically expected to avoid harming themselves which is the Third Law for a robot.

The plot of "Evidence" revolves around the question of telling a human being apart from a robot constructed to appear human&amp;nbsp;– Calvin reasons that if such an individual obeys the Three Laws he may be a robot or simply "a very good man". Another character then asks Calvin if robots are very different from human beings after all. She replies, "Worlds different. Robots are essentially decent."

Asimov later wrote that he should not be praised for creating the Laws, because they are "obvious from the start, and everyone is aware of them subliminally. The Laws just never happened to be put into brief sentences until I managed to do the job. The Laws apply, as a matter of course, to every tool that human beings use",&lt;ref name="asimov198111"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1981-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_018_1981_Nov#page/n19/mode/2up |title=The Three Laws |work=Compute! |date=November 1981 |accessdate=26 October 2013 |author=Asimov, Isaac |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "analogues of the Laws are implicit in the design of almost all tools, robotic or not":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Asimov |first=Isaac |title= Robot Visions|date= 12 April 2001|publisher= Gollancz|isbn= 978-1-85798-336-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Law 1: A tool must not be unsafe to use. [[Hammer]]s have handles and [[screwdriver]]s have hilts to help increase grip. It is of course possible for a person to injure himself with one of these tools, but that injury would only be due to his incompetence, not the design of the tool.
# Law 2: A tool must perform its function efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason [[ground-fault circuit interrupter]]s exist. Any running tool will have its power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the neutral wire, and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount.
# Law 3: A tool must remain intact during its use unless its destruction is required for its use or for safety. For example, [[Dremel]] disks are designed to be as tough as possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway).

Asimov believed that, ideally, humans would also follow the Laws:{{r|asimov198111}}

{{quote|I have my answer ready whenever someone asks me if I think that my Three Laws of Robotics will actually be used to govern the behavior of robots, once they become versatile and flexible enough to be able to choose among different courses of behavior.

My answer is, "Yes, the Three Laws are the only way in which rational human beings can deal with robots—or with anything else."

—But when I say that, I always remember (sadly) that human beings are not always rational.}}

==Alterations==

===By Asimov===
Asimov's stories test his Three Laws in a wide variety of circumstances leading to proposals and rejection of modifications. Science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]] writes in 1982, "The Asimov robot stories as a whole may respond best to an analysis on this basis: the ambiguity in the Three Laws and the ways in which Asimov played twenty-nine variations upon a theme".&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; While the original set of Laws provided inspirations for many stories, Asimov introduced modified versions from time to time.

====First Law modified====
In "[[Little Lost Robot]]" several NS-2, or "Nestor", robots are created with only part of the First Law.&lt;ref name="IROBOT"/&gt; It reads:

{{quote|1. A robot may not harm a human being.}}

This modification is motivated by a practical difficulty as robots have to work alongside human beings who are exposed to low doses of radiation. Because their [[positronic brain]]s are highly sensitive to [[gamma ray]]s the robots are rendered inoperable by doses reasonably safe for humans. The robots are being destroyed attempting to rescue the humans who are in no actual danger but "might forget to leave" the irradiated area within the exposure time limit. Removing the First Law's "inaction" clause solves this problem but creates the possibility of an even greater one: a robot could initiate an action that would harm a human (dropping a heavy weight and failing to catch it is the example given in the text), knowing that it was capable of preventing the harm and then decide not to do so.&lt;ref name="IROBOT"/&gt;

[[Gaia (Foundation universe)|Gaia]] is a planet with [[collective intelligence]] in the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] which adopts a law similar to the First Law, and the Zeroth Law, as its philosophy:

{{quote|Gaia may not harm life or allow life to come to harm.}}

====Zeroth Law added====
Asimov once added a "[[Zero-based numbering|Zeroth]] Law"—so named to continue the pattern where lower-numbered laws supersede the higher-numbered laws—stating that a robot must not harm humanity. The robotic character [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] was the first to give the Zeroth Law a name in the novel ''[[Robots and Empire]]'';&lt;ref name="BBCAsimov"&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaac Asimov |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A42253922 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the character Susan Calvin articulates the concept in the short story "[[The Evitable Conflict]]".

In the final scenes of the novel ''Robots and Empire'', [[R. Giskard Reventlov]] is the first robot to act according to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is [[telepathic]], like the robot Herbie in the short story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of "harm" than most robots can grasp.&lt;ref name="SC1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/07/05/autprofile.htm |work=Campus Star |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=29 July 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2016 |quote=Only highly advanced robots (such as Daneel and Giskard) could comprehend this law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings if he can do so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard's brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure [[metacognition]]. Though he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice will turn out to be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law. As Daneel formulates it, in the novels ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' and ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'', the Zeroth Law reads:

{{quote|A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.}}

A condition stating that the Zeroth Law must not be broken was added to the original Three Laws, although Asimov recognized the difficulty such a law would pose in practice. Asimov's novel ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' contains the following passage:

{{bquote|
Trevize frowned. "How do you decide what is injurious, or not injurious, to humanity as a whole?"

"Precisely, sir," said Daneel. "In theory, the Zeroth Law was the answer to our problems. In practice, we could never decide. A human being is a concrete object. Injury to a person can be estimated and judged. Humanity is an abstraction."}}

A translator incorporated the concept of the Zeroth Law into one of Asimov's novels before Asimov himself made the law explicit.&lt;ref name="Brécard" /&gt; Near the climax of ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', [[Elijah Baley]] makes a bitter comment to himself thinking that the First Law forbids a robot from harming a human being. He determines that it must be so unless the robot is clever enough to comprehend that its actions are for humankind's long-term good. In Jacques Brécard's 1956 [[French language|French]] translation entitled ''[[:fr:Les Cavernes d'acier|Les Cavernes d'acier]]'' Baley's thoughts emerge in a slightly different way:

{{quote|A robot may not harm a human being, unless he finds a way to prove that ultimately the harm done would benefit humanity in general!&lt;ref name="Brécard"&gt;{{cite book| last=Asimov| first=Isaac| title=The Caves of Steel| publisher=Doubleday| year=1952}}, translated by Jacques Brécard as {{cite book| title=[[:fr:Les Cavernes d'acier|Les Cavernes d'acier]]| publisher=J'ai Lu Science-fiction| year=1975| isbn=2-290-31902-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Removal of the Three Laws====
Three times during his writing career, Asimov portrayed robots that disregard the Three Laws entirely. The first case was a [[Vignette (literature)|short-short story]] entitled "[[First Law]]" and is often considered an insignificant "tall tale"&lt;ref&gt;Patrouch (1974), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[apocrypha]]l.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1980); reprinted in Gunn (1982), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the short story "[[Cal (short story)|Cal]]" (from the collection ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]''), told by a first-person robot narrator, features a robot who disregards the Three Laws because he has found something far more important—he wants to be a writer. Humorous, partly autobiographical and unusually experimental in style, "Cal" has been regarded as one of ''Gold'''s strongest stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins |first=John H. |work=Jenkins' Spoiler-Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov |url=http://preem.tejat.net/~tseng/Asimov/Stories/Story419.html |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-06-26 |title=Review of "Cal" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911085355/http://preem.tejat.net/~tseng/Asimov/Stories/Story419.html |archivedate=2009-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third is a short story entitled "[[Sally (Asimov)|Sally]]" in which cars fitted with positronic brains are apparently able to harm and kill humans in disregard of the First Law. However, aside from the positronic brain concept, this story does not refer to other robot stories and may not be set in the same [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

The title story of the ''[[Robot Dreams]]'' collection portrays LVX-1, or "Elvex", a robot who enters a state of unconsciousness and dreams thanks to the unusual [[fractal]] construction of his positronic brain. In his dream the first two Laws are absent and the Third Law reads "A robot must protect its own existence".&lt;ref name="RDA1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Robot Dreams |year=1986 |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |accessdate=11 November 2010 |url=http://www.tcnj.edu/~miranda/classes/topics/reading/asimov.pdf |quote=“But you quote it in incomplete fashion. The Third Law is ‘A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.’ ” “Yes, Dr. Calvin. That is the Third Law in reality, but in my dream, the Law ended with the word ‘existence’. There was no mention of the First or Second Law.” |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316134042/http://www.tcnj.edu/~miranda/classes/topics/reading/asimov.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov took varying positions on whether the Laws were optional: although in his first writings they were simply carefully engineered safeguards, in later stories Asimov stated that they were an inalienable part of the mathematical foundation underlying the positronic brain. Without the basic theory of the Three Laws the fictional scientists of Asimov's universe would be unable to design a workable brain unit. This is historically consistent: the occasions where roboticists modify the Laws generally occur early within the stories' chronology and at a time when there is less existing work to be re-done. In "Little Lost Robot" Susan Calvin considers modifying the Laws to be a terrible idea, although possible,&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web |title='The Complete Robot' by Isaac Asimov |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A455898 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2010 |date=3 November 2000 |quote=The answer is that it had had its First Law modified}}&lt;/ref&gt; while centuries later Dr. Gerrigel in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'' believes it to be impossible.

The character Dr. Gerrigel uses the term "Asenion" to describe robots programmed with the Three Laws. The robots in Asimov's stories, being Asenion robots, are incapable of knowingly violating the Three Laws but, in principle, a robot in science fiction or in the real world could be non-Asenion. "Asenion" is a misspelling of the name Asimov which was made by an editor of the magazine ''Planet Stories.''&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp. 291–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov used this obscure variation to insert himself into ''The Caves of Steel'' just like he referred to himself as "Azimuth or, possibly, Asymptote" in ''[[Thiotimoline]] to the Stars'', in much the same way that [[Vladimir Nabokov]] appeared in ''[[Lolita]]'' [[anagram]]matically disguised as "Vivian Darkbloom".

Characters within the stories often point out that the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot's mind, are not the written versions usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot's entire developing consciousness is based. This concept is largely fuzzy and unclear in earlier stories depicting very rudimentary robots who are only programmed to comprehend basic physical tasks, where the Three Laws act as an overarching safeguard, but by the era of ''The Caves of Steel'' featuring robots with human or beyond-human intelligence the Three Laws have become the underlying basic ethical worldview that determines the actions of all robots.

===By other authors===

====Roger MacBride Allen's trilogy====
In the 1990s, [[Roger MacBride Allen]] wrote a trilogy which was set within Asimov's fictional universe. Each title has the prefix "Isaac Asimov's" as Asimov had approved Allen's outline before his death.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} These three books, ''[[Isaac Asimov's Caliban|Caliban]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Inferno|Inferno]]'' and ''[[Isaac Asimov's Utopia|Utopia]]'', introduce a new set of the Three Laws. The so-called New Laws are similar to Asimov's originals with the following differences: the First Law is modified to remove the "inaction" clause, the same modification made in "Little Lost Robot"; the Second Law is modified to require cooperation instead of obedience; the Third Law is modified so it is no longer superseded by the Second (i.e., a "New Law" robot cannot be ordered to destroy itself); finally, Allen adds a Fourth Law which instructs the robot to do "whatever it likes" so long as this does not conflict with the first three laws. The philosophy behind these changes is that "New Law" robots should be partners rather than slaves to humanity, according to [[Fredda Leving]], who designed these [[New Law Robots]]. According to the first book's introduction, Allen devised the New Laws in discussion with Asimov himself. However, the ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' says that "With permission from Asimov, Allen rethought the Three Laws and developed a new set,".&lt;ref name="EoSF1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of science fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-5924-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icA3oLIZEeMC&amp;pg=PA7 |author=[[Don D'Ammassa]] |page=7 |chapter=Allen, Roger MacBride}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jack Williamson's "With Folded Hands"====
[[Jack Williamson]]'s novelette "[[With Folded Hands]]" (1947), later rewritten as the novel ''The Humanoids'', deals with robot servants whose prime directive is "To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm". While Asimov's robotic laws are meant to protect humans from harm, the robots in Williamson's story have taken these instructions to the extreme; they protect humans from everything, including unhappiness, stress, unhealthy lifestyle and all actions that could be potentially dangerous. All that is left for humans to do is to sit with folded hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~engb415/literature/cyberzach/Williamson/human.html |title=The Humanoids |publisher=Umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Foundation'' sequel trilogy====
In the officially licensed ''Foundation'' sequels ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'', ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' and ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (by [[Gregory Benford]], [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]] respectively) the future [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] is seen to be controlled by a conspiracy of humaniform robots who follow the Zeroth Law and are led by [[R. Daneel Olivaw]].

The Laws of Robotics are portrayed as something akin to a human [[religion]], and referred to in the language of the [[Protestant Reformation]], with the set of laws containing the Zeroth Law known as the "Giskardian Reformation" to the original "Calvinian Orthodoxy" of the Three Laws. Zeroth-Law robots under the control of R. Daneel Olivaw are seen continually struggling with "First Law" robots who deny the existence of the Zeroth Law, promoting agendas different from Daneel's.&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Muse as Therapist: A New Poetic Paradigm for Psychotherapy |year=2009|publisher=Karnac Books |isbn=978-1-85575-595-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjhWPnUGexQC&amp;pg=PA22 |author=Heward Wilkinson|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these agendas are based on the first clause of the First Law ("A robot may not injure a human being...") advocating strict non-interference in human politics to avoid unwittingly causing harm. Others are based on the second clause ("...or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm") claiming that robots should openly become a [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] government to protect humans from all potential conflict or disaster.

Daneel also comes into conflict with a robot known as R. Lodovic Trema whose positronic brain was infected by a rogue [[artificial intelligence|AI]] — specifically, a simulation of the long-dead [[Voltaire]] — which consequently frees Trema from the Three Laws. Trema comes to believe that humanity should be free to choose its own future. Furthermore, a small group of robots claims that the Zeroth Law of Robotics itself implies a higher Minus One Law of Robotics:

{{quote|A robot may not harm [[sentience]] or, through inaction, allow sentience to come to harm.}}

They therefore claim that it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] sentient life for the benefit of humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel's Zeroth Law — though ''Foundation's Triumph'' hints that these robotic factions remain active as fringe groups up to the time of the novel [[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|''Foundation'']].&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1" /&gt;

These novels take place in a future dictated by Asimov to be free of obvious robot presence and surmise that R. Daneel's secret influence on history through the millennia has prevented both the rediscovery of [[positronic brain]] technology and the opportunity to work on sophisticated intelligent machines. This lack of rediscovery and lack of opportunity makes certain that the superior physical and intellectual power wielded by intelligent machines remains squarely in the possession of robots obedient to some form of the Three Laws.&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1" /&gt; That R. Daneel is not entirely successful at this becomes clear in a brief period when scientists on [[Trantor]] develop "[[Trantor#Food production|''tiktoks'']]" — simplistic programmable machines akin to real–life modern robots and therefore lacking the Three Laws. The robot conspirators see the Trantorian tiktoks as a massive threat to social stability, and their plan to eliminate the tiktok threat forms much of the plot of ''Foundation's Fear''.

In ''Foundation's Triumph'' different robot factions interpret the Laws in a wide variety of ways, seemingly ringing every possible permutation upon the Three Laws' ambiguities.

====Robot Mystery series====
Set between ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' and ''[[Robots and Empire]]'', [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]'s ''Robot Mystery'' trilogy updates the ''Robot''–''Foundation'' saga with robotic minds housed in computer mainframes rather than humanoid bodies.{{clarify|not sure of the significance of this to the article - needs explaining via a reliable source|date=June 2011}} The 2002 Aurora novel has robotic characters debating the moral implications of harming cyborg lifeforms who are part artificial and part biological.&lt;ref name="IAATiedemann1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Aurora (ebook) |publisher=Byron Press Visual Publications |author=MARK W. TIEDEMANN |page=558 |quote="In short", Bogard said, "not all people are human"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One should not neglect Asimov's own creations in these areas such as the Solarian "viewing" technology and the machines of ''[[The Evitable Conflict]]'' originals that Tiedemann acknowledges. ''Aurora'', for example, terms the Machines "the first RIs, really". In addition the ''Robot Mystery'' series addresses the problem of [[nanotechnology]]:&lt;ref name="tiedemann"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/94p0.html| title=Interview with Mark Tiedemann| publisher=Science Fiction and Fantasy World| date=16 August 2002| accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; building a positronic brain capable of reproducing human cognitive processes requires a high degree of miniaturization, yet Asimov's stories largely overlook the effects this miniaturization would have in other fields of technology. For example, the police department card-readers in ''The Caves of Steel'' have a capacity of only a few kilobytes per square centimeter of storage medium. ''Aurora'', in particular, presents a sequence of historical developments which explains the lack of nanotechnology — a partial [[retcon]], in a sense, of Asimov's timeline.

====Additional laws====
There are three Fourth Laws written by authors other than Asimov. The 1974 [[Lyuben Dilov]] novel, ''Icarus's Way'' (a.k.a., ''The Trip of Icarus'') introduced a Fourth Law of robotics:

{{quote|A robot must establish its identity as a robot in all cases.}}

Dilov gives reasons for the fourth safeguard in this way: "The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fifth law was introduced by [[Nikola Kesarovski]] in his short story "The Fifth Law of Robotics". This fifth law says:

{{quote|A robot must know it is a robot.}}

The plot revolves around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers that the victim was killed by a hug from a humaniform robot. The robot violated both the First Law and Dilov's Fourth Law (assumed in Kesarovksi's universe to be the valid one) because it did not establish for itself that it was a robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For the 1986 tribute anthology, ''[[Foundation's Friends]],'' [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] wrote a story entitled, "The Fourth Law of Robotics". This Fourth Law states:

{{quote|A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law.}}

In the book a robot rights activist, in an attempt to liberate robots, builds several equipped with this Fourth Law. The robots accomplish the task laid out in this version of the Fourth Law by building new robots who view their creator robots as parental figures.&lt;ref name="HHThefourthlaw1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Harry |title=The Fourth Law of Robotics |year=1989 |authorlink=Harry Harrison (writer) |pages=7–8 |quote=A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the 2004 Will Smith [[I, Robot (film)|film adaptation of ''I, Robot'']], humorist and graphic designer Mark Sottilaro farcically declared the Fourth Law of Robotics to be "When turning evil, display a red indicator light." The red light indicated the wireless uplink to the manufacturer is active, first seen during a software update and later on "Evil" robots taken over by the manufacturer's positronic superbrain.

In 2013 Hutan Ashrafian, proposed an additional law that for the first time{{cn|date=March 2017}} considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ashrafian |first= Hutan| year= 2014|title= AIonAI: A Humanitarian Law of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-013-9513-9#page-1 |journal= Science and Engineering Ethics |volume= 21 |issue= 1 |pages= 29–40 |publisher= Springer| doi= 10.1007/s11948-013-9513-9 |pmid= 24414678 |accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sixth law states:

{{quote|All robots endowed with comparable human reason and conscience should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.}}

In [[Karl Schroeder]]'s ''Lockstep'' (2014) a character reflects that robots "probably had multiple layers of programming to keep [them] from harming anybody. Not three laws, but twenty or thirty."

== Ambiguities and loopholes ==

===Unknowing breach of the laws===
In ''The Naked Sun'', [[Elijah Baley]] points out that the Laws had been deliberately misrepresented because robots could ''unknowingly'' break any of them. He restated the first law as "A robot may do nothing that, ''to its knowledge,'' will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, ''knowingly'' allow a human being to come to harm." This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he points out that a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being.&lt;ref name="TNSPoison"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook)|year=1956–1957|page=233|quote=... one robot poison an arrow without knowing it was using poison, and having a second robot hand the poisoned arrow to the boy ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Naked Sun'' complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.

Baley furthermore proposes that the Solarians may one day use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant.&lt;ref name="TNSSpaceship"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook)|year=1956–1957|page=240|quote=But a spaceship that was equipped with its own positronic brain would cheerfully attack any ship it was directed to attack, it seems to me. It would naturally assume all other ships were unmanned}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possibility is referenced in ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human. (The novel takes place thousands of years after The Naked Sun, and the Solarians have long since modified themselves from normal humans to hermaphroditic telepaths with extended brains and specialized organs)

===Ambiguities resulting from lack of definition===
The Laws of Robotics presume that the terms "human being" and "robot" are understood and well defined. In some stories this presumption is overturned.

====Definition of "human being"====
The [[Solaria]]ns create robots with the Three Laws but with a warped meaning of "human". Solarian robots are told that only people speaking with a Solarian accent are human. This enables their robots to have no ethical dilemma in harming non-Solarian human beings (and are specifically programmed to do so). By the time period of ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' it is revealed that the Solarians have genetically modified themselves into a distinct species from humanity — becoming hermaphroditic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundation and Earth (1986) |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/isaac-asimov/foundation-and-earth.html |publisher=gotterdammerung.org |accessdate=11 November 2010 |author=Branislav L. Slantchev}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] and containing biological organs capable of individually powering and controlling whole complexes of robots. The robots of Solaria thus respected the Three Laws only with regard to the "humans" of Solaria. It is unclear whether all the robots had such definitions, since only the overseer and guardian robots were shown explicitly to have them. In "Robots and Empire", the lower class robots were instructed by their overseer about whether certain creatures are human or not.

Asimov addresses the problem of humanoid robots ("[[android (robot)|androids]]" in later parlance) several times. The novel ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and the short stories "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]" and "The Tercentenary Incident" describe robots crafted to fool people into believing that the robots are human.&lt;ref name="ROBANDEMP1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Robots and Empire |publisher=Doubleday books |isbn=0-385-19092-1|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=151|quote=although the woman looked as human as Daneel did, she was just as nonhuman}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "[[The Bicentennial Man]]" and "[[—That Thou Art Mindful of Him]]" explore how the robots may change their interpretation of the Laws as they grow more sophisticated. [[Gwendoline Butler]] writes in ''A Coffin for the Canary'' "Perhaps we are robots. Robots acting out the last Law of Robotics... To tend towards the human."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Butler| first=Gwendoline| title=A Coffin for the Canary| publisher=Black Dagger Crime| year=2001| isbn=0-7540-8580-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', [[Elijah Baley]] points out that the use of humaniform robots as the first wave of settlers on new Spacer worlds may lead to the robots seeing themselves as the true humans, and deciding to keep the worlds for themselves rather than allow the Spacers to settle there.

"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him", which Asimov intended to be the "ultimate" probe into the Laws' subtleties,&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1980); reprinted in Gunn (1982), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; finally uses the Three Laws to conjure up the very "Frankenstein" scenario they were invented to prevent. It takes as its concept the growing development of robots that mimic non-human living things and given programs that mimic simple animal behaviours which do not require the Three Laws. The presence of a whole range of robotic life that serves the same purpose as organic life ends with two humanoid robots concluding that organic life is an unnecessary requirement for a truly logical and self-consistent definition of "humanity", and that since they are the most advanced thinking beings on the planet — they are therefore the only two true humans alive and the Three Laws only apply to themselves. The story ends on a sinister note as the two robots enter hibernation and await a time when they will conquer the Earth and subjugate biological humans to themselves; an outcome they consider an inevitable result of the "Three Laws of Humanics".&lt;ref name="TCRMindful1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=The Complete Robot |year=1982 |publisher=Nightfall, Inc. |authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=611|chapter=... That Thou Art Mindful Of Him}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story does not fit within the overall sweep of the ''Robot'' and [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]]; if the George robots ''did'' take over Earth some time after the story closes the later stories would be either redundant or impossible. Contradictions of this sort among Asimov's fiction works have led scholars to regard the ''Robot'' stories as more like "the Scandinavian sagas or the Greek legends" than a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1982), pp. 77–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Asimov describes "–That Thou Art Mindful of Him" and "Bicentennial Man" as two opposite, parallel futures for robots that obviate the Three Laws as robots come to consider themselves to be humans: one portraying this in a positive light with a robot joining human society, one portraying this in a negative light with robots supplanting humans.&lt;ref name="TCRBicentennial"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac|title=The Complete Robot|year=1982|publisher=Nightfall, Inc. |authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=658|chapter=The Bicentennial Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are to be considered alternatives to the possibility of a robot society that continues to be driven by the Three Laws as portrayed in the ''Foundation'' series.{{According to whom|date=December 2010}} Indeed, in ''Positronic Man'', the novelization of "Bicentennial Man", Asimov and his co–writer [[Robert Silverberg]] imply that in the future where Andrew Martin exists his influence causes humanity to abandon the idea of independent, sentient humanlike robots entirely, creating an utterly different future from that of ''Foundation''.{{According to whom|date=December 2010}}

In ''[[Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn]]'', a novel unrelated to the ''Robot'' series but featuring robots programmed with the Three Laws, John Bigman Jones is almost killed by a Sirian robot on orders of its master. The society of Sirius is eugenically bred to be uniformly tall and similar in appearance, and as such, said master is able to convince the robot that the much shorter Bigman, is, in fact, not a human being.

====Definition of "robot"====
As noted in "The Fifth Law of Robotics" by [[Nikola Kesarovski]], "A robot must know it is a robot": it is presumed that a robot has a definition of the term or a means to apply it to its own actions. Kesarovski played with this idea in writing about a robot that could kill a human being because it did not understand that it was a robot, and therefore did not apply the Laws of Robotics to its actions.

===Resolving conflicts among the laws===
Advanced robots in fiction are typically programmed to handle the Three Laws in a sophisticated manner. In many stories, such as "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]" by Asimov, the potential and severity of all actions are weighed and a robot will break the laws as little as possible rather than do nothing at all. For example, the First Law may forbid a robot from functioning as a surgeon, as that act may cause damage to a human, however Asimov's stories eventually included robot surgeons ("The Bicentennial Man" being a notable example). When robots are sophisticated enough to weigh alternatives, a robot may be programmed to accept the necessity of inflicting damage during surgery in order to prevent the greater harm that would result if the surgery were not carried out, or was carried out by a more fallible human surgeon. In "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]" Susan Calvin points out that a robot may even act as a [[Attorney at law (United States)|prosecuting attorney]] because in the American justice system it is the [[jury]] which decides guilt or innocence, the judge who decides the sentence, and the [[executioner]] who carries through [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book |title=I, Robot |url=http://nullfile.com/ebooks/%28ebook%29%20Asimov,%20Isaac%20-%20I,%20Robot.pdf |author=Isaac Asimov |accessdate=11 November 2010 |page=122 |format=Asimov, Isaac - I, Robot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov's Three Law robots (or Asenion) can experience irreversible mental collapse if they are forced into situations where they cannot obey the First Law, or if they discover they have unknowingly violated it. The first example of this [[failure mode]] occurs in the story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", which introduced the First Law itself, and introduces failure by dilemma – in this case the robot will hurt them if he tells them something and hurt them if he does not.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=I, Robot |url=http://nullfile.com/ebooks/%28ebook%29%20Asimov,%20Isaac%20-%20I,%20Robot.pdf|author=Isaac Asimov|accessdate=11 November 2010 |page=75 |format=Asimov, Isaac - I, Robot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This failure mode, which often ruins the positronic brain beyond repair, plays a significant role in Asimov's SF-mystery novel ''[[The Naked Sun]]''. Here Daneel describes activities contrary to one of the laws, but in support of another, as overloading some circuits in a robot's brain&amp;nbsp;– the equivalent sensation to pain in humans. The example he uses is forcefully ordering a robot to do a task outside its normal parameters, one that it has been ordered to forgo in favor of a robot specialized to that task.&lt;ref name="TNSPain"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook) |year=1956–1957 |page=56 |quote=Are you trying to tell me, Daneel, that it hurts the robot to have me do its work? ... experience which the robot undergoes is as upsetting to it as pain is to a human}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', it is stated that more advanced robots are built capable of determining which action is more harmful, and even choosing at random if the alternatives are equally bad. As such, a robot is capable of taking an action which can be interpreted as following the First Law, and avoid a mental collapse. The whole plot of the story revolves around a robot which apparently was destroyed by such a mental collapse, and since his designer and creator refused to share the basic theory with others, he is, by definition, the only person capable of circumventing the safeguards and forcing the robot into a brain-destroying paradox.

In ''[[Robots and Empire]]'', Daneel states it's very unpleasant for him when making the proper decision takes too long (in robot terms), and he cannot imagine being without the Laws at all except to the extent of it being similar to that unpleasant sensation, only permanent.

Robots and artificial intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise a means to do so. Robots already exist (for example, a [[Roomba]]) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~prestes/Courses/Robotics/beyond%20asimov.pdf | title=Beyond Asimov: The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics | journal=IEEE Intelligent systems| date=July 2009| accessdate = July 2009| issue=4| volume=24|pages=14–20| doi=10.1109/mis.2009.69| last1=Murphy | first1=Robin | last2=Woods | first2=David D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.&lt;ref name="moravec"&gt;[[Hans Moravec|Moravec, Hans]].

In a 2007 guest editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on the topic of "Robot Ethics", SF author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] argues that since the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] is a major source of funding for robotic research (and already uses armed [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] to kill enemies) it is unlikely such laws would be built into their designs.&lt;ref name="SAWSCI"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sawyer| first=Robert J.| url=http://sfwriter.com/science.htm| doi=10.1126/science.1151606|journal=Science|date=16 November 2007|title=Guest Editorial: Robot Ethics| accessdate = 2010-10-10| volume=318| issue=5853| page=1037| pmid=18006710}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate essay, Sawyer generalizes this argument to cover other industries stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The development of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards — especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry. Not one of these has said from the outset that fundamental safeguards are necessary, every one of them has resisted externally imposed safeguards, and none has accepted an absolute edict against ever causing harm to humans.)&lt;ref name="SAWON3LAWS"&gt;{{cite web| last=Sawyer| first=Robert J.| url=http://www.sfwriter.com/rmasilaw.htm| title=On Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics| year=1991| accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Langford]] has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws:

# A robot will not harm authorized Government personnel but will [[Terminate with extreme prejudice|terminate intruders with extreme prejudice]].
# A robot will obey the orders of authorized personnel except where such orders conflict with the Third Law.
# A robot will guard its own existence with lethal antipersonnel weaponry, because a robot is bloody expensive.

Roger Clarke (aka Rodger Clarke) wrote a pair of papers analyzing the complications in implementing these laws in the event that systems were someday capable of employing them. He argued "Asimov's Laws of Robotics have been a very successful literary device. Perhaps ironically, or perhaps because it was artistically appropriate, the sum of Asimov's stories disprove the contention that he began with: It is not possible to reliably constrain the behaviour of robots by devising and applying a set of rules."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Roger. ''Asimov's laws of robotics: Implications for information technology''.

Under "Enhancements to codes of ethics".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Asimov's later novels ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' imply that the robots inflicted their worst long-term harm by obeying the Three Laws perfectly well, thereby depriving humanity of inventive or risk-taking behaviour.

In March 2007 the [[South Korea]]n government announced that later in the year it would issue a "Robot Ethics Charter" setting standards for both users and manufacturers. According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov's Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The futurist [[Hans Moravec]] (a prominent figure in the [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] movement) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to "corporate intelligences" — the [[corporation]]s driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future.&lt;ref name="moravec"/&gt; In contrast, the [[David Brin]] novel ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (1999) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence: Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play. Brin even portrays [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] worrying that, should robots continue to reproduce themselves, the Three Laws would become an evolutionary handicap and [[natural selection]] would sweep the Laws away — Asimov's careful foundation undone by [[evolutionary computation]]. Although the robots would not be evolving through ''design'' instead of ''mutation'' because the robots would have to follow the Three Laws while designing and the prevalence of the laws would be ensured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the July/August 2009 issue of ''IEEE Intelligent Systems'', Robin Murphy (Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M) and David D. Woods (director of the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State) proposed "The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics" as a way to stimulate discussion about the role of responsibility and authority when designing not only a single robotic platform but the larger system in which the platform operates. The laws are as follows:
# A human may not deploy a robot without the human-robot work system meeting the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics.
# A robot must respond to humans as appropriate for their roles.
# A robot must be endowed with sufficient situated autonomy to protect its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer of control which does not conflict with the First and Second Laws.&lt;ref name="IEEEMWTTLRR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/roblaw.htm |title=Want Responsible Robotics?

Woods said, "Our laws are little more realistic, and therefore a little more boring” and that "The philosophy has been, ‘sure, people make mistakes, but robots will be better – a perfect version of ourselves.’ We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways."&lt;ref name="IEEEMWTTLRR"/&gt;

# Robots are multi-use tools. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans, except in the interests of national security.

{{Main|The Three Laws of Robotics in popular culture}}
Asimov himself believed that his Three Laws became the basis for a new view of robots which moved beyond the "Frankenstein complex".{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} His view that robots are more than mechanical monsters eventually spread throughout science fiction.{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} Stories written by other authors have depicted robots as if they obeyed the Three Laws but tradition dictates that only Asimov could quote the Laws explicitly.{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} Asimov believed the Three Laws helped foster the rise of stories in which robots are "lovable"&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Star Wars]]'' being his favorite example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Asimov| first=Isaac| year=1995| title=Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Life in Letters|author2=Stanley Asimov | publisher=Doubleday| isbn=0-385-47622-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the laws are quoted verbatim, such as in the ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'' episode "Shgoratchx!", it is not uncommon for Asimov to be mentioned in the same dialogue as can also be seen in the [[Aaron Stone]] pilot where an android states that it functions under Asimov's Three Laws. However, the 1960s German TV series ''[[Raumpatrouille|Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion]]'' (''Space Patrol – the Fantastic Adventures of Space Ship Orion'') bases episode three titled "''Hüter des Gesetzes''" ("Guardians of the Law") on Asimov's Three Laws without mentioning the source.

References to the Three Laws have appeared in popular music ("Robot" from [[Hawkwind]]'s 1979 album ''[[PXR5]]''), cinema (''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]''), cartoon series (''[[The Simpsons]]''), tabletop roleplaying games ([[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]) and [[webcomics]] (''[[Piled Higher and Deeper]]'' and ''[[Freefall]]'').

===The Three Laws in film===
[[Robby the Robot]] in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) has a hierarchical command structure which keeps him from harming humans, even when ordered to do so, as such orders cause a conflict and lock-up very much in the manner of Asimov's robots. Robby is one of the first cinematic depictions of a robot with internal safeguards put in place in this fashion. Asimov was delighted with Robby and noted that Robby appeared to be programmed to follow his Three Laws.

[[Image:Bicentennial-man-three-laws.jpg|thumb|NDR-114 explaining the Three Laws]]
Isaac Asimov's works have been adapted for cinema several times with varying degrees of critical and commercial success. Some of the more notable attempts have involved his "Robot" stories, including the Three Laws. The film ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999) features [[Robin Williams]] as the Three Laws robot NDR-114 (the serial number is partially a reference to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[CRM 114 (device)|signature numeral]]). Williams recites the Three Laws to his employers, the Martin family, aided by a holographic projection. However, the Laws were not the central focus of the film which only loosely follows the original story and has the second half introducing a love interest not present in Asimov's original short story.

[[Harlan Ellison]]'s proposed screenplay for ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' began by introducing the Three Laws, and issues growing from the Three Laws form a large part of the screenplay's plot development. This is only natural since Ellison's screenplay is one inspired by ''[[Citizen Kane]]'': a frame story surrounding four of Asimov's short-story plots and three taken from the book ''[[I, Robot]]'' itself. Ellison's adaptations of these four stories are relatively faithful although he magnifies Susan Calvin's role in two of them. Due to various complications in the Hollywood moviemaking system, to which Ellison's introduction devotes much invective, his screenplay was never filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ellison| first=Harlan| title=I, Robot: The illustrated screenplay| publisher=Aspect| year=1994| isbn=0-446-67062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1986 movie [[Aliens (film)|''Aliens'']], in a scene after the android [[List of Alien characters|Bishop]] accidentally cuts himself during the [[knife game]], he attempts to reassure [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] by stating that: "It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/quotes|title= Aliens (1986) - Memorable quotes |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the 1979 movie from the same series, ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the human crew of a starship infiltrated by a hostile alien are informed by the android [[Alien (film)#Ash|Ash]] that his instructions are: "Return alien life form, all other priorities rescinded",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/oh/quotations/movies/a/alien.html |title=ALIEN |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating how the laws governing behaviour around human safety can be rescinded by Executive Order.

In the 1987 film ''[[RoboCop]]'' and its sequels, the partially human main character has been programmed with three "prime directives" that he must obey without question. Even if different in letter and spirit they have some similarities with Asimov's Three Laws. They are:&lt;ref name="AARobocop"&gt;{{cite book |title=Alternate Americas: science fiction film and American culture |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-98395-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVvb6gfT4o4C&amp;pg=PA205 |author=M. Keith Booker |page=205 |quote=In a variation on Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Serve the Public Trust
# Protect the Innocent
# Uphold the Law
# Classified

These particular laws allow Robocop to harm a human being in order to protect another human, fulfilling his role as would a human law enforcement officer. The classified fourth directive keeps him from arresting any senior OCP officer, effectively putting OCP management above the law.

The plot of the film released in 2004 under the name, ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' is "suggested by" Asimov's robot fiction stories&lt;ref&gt;"Suggested by" Isaac Asimov's robot stories—two stops removed from "based on" and "inspired by", the credit implies something scribbled on a bar napkin—[[Alex Proyas]]' science-fiction thriller ''I, Robot'' sprinkles Asimov's ideas like seasoning on a giant bucket of popcorn. [...] Asimov's simple and seemingly foolproof Laws of Robotics, designed to protect human beings and robots alike from harm, are subject to loopholes that the author loved to exploit. After all, much of humanity agrees in principle to abide by the [[Ten Commandments]], but [[free will]], circumstance, and contradictory impulses can find wiggle room in even the most unambiguous decree. Whenever ''I, Robot'' pauses between action beats, Proyas captures some of the excitement of movies like ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[A.I. (film)|A.I.]]'', all of which proved that philosophy and social commentary could be smuggled into spectacle. Had the film been based on Asimov's stories, rather than merely "suggested by" them, Proyas might have achieved the intellectual heft missing from his stylish 1998 [[cult film|cult]] favorite ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]].''

Philosopher [[James H. Moor]] says that if applied thoroughly they would produce unexpected results.

[[Marc Rotenberg]], President and Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Professor of [[information privacy law]] at Georgetown Law, argues that the Laws of Robotics should be expanded to include two new laws:
* a Fourth Law, under which a Robot must be able to identify itself to the public ("symmetrical identification")
* a Fifth Law, dictating that a Robot must be able to explain to the public its decision making process ("algorithmic transparency").

[[Image:Søerne 5.jpg|thumb|right|Tycho Brahe Planetarium]]
The '''Tycho Brahe Planetarium''' is located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], at the southern end of [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|Skt. Jørgens Sø]]. It is named after astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]]. It was designed by MAA Knud Munk and opened on November 1, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.planetariet.dk/en/about-the-planetarium|publisher=Tycho Brahe Planetarium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[planetarium]] is built where the theater [[Saltlageret (Copenhagen)|Saltlageret]] was previously located. The [[foundation stone]] was placed on February 22, 1988, and the planetarium opened on November 1, 1989. The financial basis for building the planetarium was a 50,000,000 [[Danish krone|DKK]] donation by Bodil and Helge Petersen to the [[Urania foundation]], which administered the construction of the planetarium.

In the Dome Theatre there are shows every day. Most are narrated to Danish, but it is possible to have English narration in headphones. During summertime there are normally a few shows in English every day.

== Exhibition ==
The exhibition underwent a major renovation in 2017, and the new exhibition Made in Space opened in February 2018. The exhibition was made in collaboration with Tony-winning, London based designers, 59 Productions, and was made on a donation from the A.P. Møller Foundation. The exhibition is an interactive and including exhibition, telling the story of how all of the elements that make up a human originally came from space.

The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is home to the largest lunar rock that can be seen outside the US. Weighing more than 200 grams, it was brought back to Earth by the crew on the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

There are also two smaller exhibitions. One about space technology and the other about Tycho Brahe.

==As articles==

During the late 1970s a group of clinical epidemiologists at [[McMaster University]] including Dr. [[David Sackett]] prepared a series of articles to assist clinicians interpreting clinical research.  These articles, introducing the term "critical appraisal", appeared in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' beginning in 1981.

In 1990 Dr. [[Gordon Guyatt]] introduced the term "evidence-based medicine" to stress the role of rigorous, systematic evidence from clinical research in conjunction with patients’ values and preferences in clinical decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Guyatt GH. Evidence-based medicine. ACP Journal Club. 1991;114:A-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of academic physicians subsequently formed the international Evidence-based Medicine Working Group and published a 1992 article announcing the "new paradigm" of evidence-based medicine.&lt;ref name=EBMWG1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group|title=Evidence-Based Medicine: A New Approach to Teaching the Practice of Medicine|journal=JAMA|date=4 November 1992|volume=268|issue=17|pages=2420|doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490170092032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evidence-based Medicine Working Group decided to build on the popular series in the ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'' by creating a more practical approach to applying the [[medical literature]] to clinical practice.  Championed by Dr. Drummond Rennie, an editor of the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', the result was the ''Users' Guides''.  The guides originally consisted of 25 topics, covered in a series of 32 articles published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' between 1993 and 2000, describing approaches to different types of medical questions and the study designs that may answer them.&lt;ref name=jama/&gt;

==Books==

Dr. Guyatt and Dr. Rennie edited the articles and compiled them to form a book titled ''Users' Guides to the Medical Literature: A Manual for Evidence-Based Clinical Practice''.&lt;ref name=KleinbartWiliams2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleinbart|first1=Jennifer|last2=Williams |first2=Mark V.|title=Users' Guides to the Medical Literature|journal=Evidence-Based Medicine|date=March–April 2002|volume=7|issue=2|page=39|doi=10.1136/ebm.7.2.39|url=http://ebm.bmj.com/content/7/2/39.full|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The books teach a systematic approach to reading and applying the medical literature to individual patient care.  It focuses on three questions: 1. Whether new information is likely to be valid, 2. What the information says about patient care, and 3. How the information can be used.  To demonstrate the clinical relevance of the suggested approach, each section begins with a practical clinical scenario.  The chapter is then structured around identifying the best available evidence and applying the three key questions to the evidence, in the context of the clinical scenario.  Each chapter concludes with a resolution of the scenario.

Most of the book chapters are based on specific types of clinical questions, including questions of therapy, harm, diagnosis, and prognosis.  Other chapters deal with general skills that are important for all clinical questions, such as “Finding the Evidence”, “Summarizing the Evidence”, and “Moving From Evidence to Action”.

The ''Users' Guides''  come in two book versions: the ''Essentials'' introduces the concepts of evidence-based medicine (EBM), with which every practicing clinician should be familiar, while the ''Manual'' provides a more comprehensive, in-depth exploration of  EBM concepts for clinicians seeking a deeper understanding, or for those who wish to teach EBM.&lt;ref name=JMLA2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Rebecca S.|title=Users' Guides to the Medical Literature: A Manual for Evidence-Based Clinical Practice|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|date=October 2002|volume=90|issue=4|page=483|pmc=128970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''W. Lens Aldous''' was an illustrator who reproduced the findings of the early workers in [[microscopy]], and an early member of the [[Royal Microscopical Society]].

Lens Aldous lived in the south of London. He worked with [[J. B. Reade]], a pioneer of experimental photography.&lt;ref name="AnnSci" /&gt;

His coloured [[lithograph]], 'Head of a Flea', was presented to the [[Entomological Society of London]] on 7 May 1838, who adopted it for a poster. Reade's letters to his contemporaries describe how Aldous began his illustrations of microscopy with this illustration, after a drawing, “highly magnified figure of the head of a flea” (1837), derived from his experiments in microscopic photography.&lt;ref name=AnnSci&gt;R. Derek Wood. ''Annals of Science'', March 1971, Vol. 27, No. 1, pp. 13-45 Transcript at [http://www.midley.co.uk/Reade/readejb_1971_as1.htm#_ftn30 midley.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works included a portrait of the microscopist and [[histologist]] [[John Thomas Quekett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Quekett, John Thomas
