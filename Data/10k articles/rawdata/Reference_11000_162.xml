The first of the clips published was dated to 31 January 2008, when [[Janez Janša]] was the Prime Minister. The second and the third clip was dated to 23 April 2009, respectively 23 April and 30 April 2009, when Borut Pahor was the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="SGInv" /&gt; The original recordings were produced in [[sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]].&lt;ref name="Delo2x"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/neuradno-vladne-seje-so-bile-dvakrat-posnete.html |title=Neuradno: vladne seje so bile posnete dvakrat |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Unofficially: Government Sessions Have Been Recorded Twice |publisher=Delo.si |date=14 December 2011 |issn=1854-6544}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were stored on [[DVD]]s and locked in a [[safe]] available only to authorised personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/objektiv/vec_vsebin/1042496067 |title=Podtalna politična vojna |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Underground Political War |publisher=Dnevnik.si |date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also available at home to three people via the [[Spectiva]] remote viewing software,&lt;ref name="Siol27-1-2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2012/01/dostop_do_spective_so_imele_po_informacijah_kamnarjeve_tri_osebe.aspx |title=Dostop do Spective naj bi imele tri osebe |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Three Persons are Supposed to Had Access to Spectiva |newspaper=Planet Siol.net |publisher=TSmedia, medijske vsebine in storitve, d.o.o. |date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to their low quality, the probability of Spectiva being the source of the leaked data has been estimated as low, and it was not used during the term of Pahor's government.&lt;ref name="Mladina2012-02-08" &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mladina.si/109007/helena-kamnar-jezna-sem/ |title=Helena Kamnar: jezna sem |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Helena Kamnar: I'm Angry |date=8 February 2012 |newspaper=Mladina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectiva could be misused until July 2009.&lt;ref name="Delo2012-09-02" /&gt; It seems most probable that the recordings originated from the recording room or were transferred with additional equipment from the press room of the government; till 2009, sessions were broadcast live there so that extracts of resolutions could be made by the authorised personnel.&lt;ref name="Mladina2012-02-08" /&gt;

Marjan Miklavčič, an expert in [[intelligence agency|intelligence services]] and a lecturer at the [[University of Maribor]], compared the publication to [[WikiLeaks]]. He particularly stressed that it was not known which data had been stolen and whether they could be used for extortion.&lt;ref name="Afera"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/afera-youtube-pahor-je-objektivno-odgovoren-in-bi-moral-se-enkrat-odstopiti/272476 |title=Afera YouTube: Pahor je objektivno odgovoren in bi moral še enkrat odstopiti |language=Slovenian |trans-title=YouTube Affair: Pahor is Objectively Responsible and Should Step Down |date=9 November 2011 |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iztok Prezelj, who lectures on [[military intelligence|intelligence]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]], stated that the publication showed a parallel [[state (polity)|state]] to exist in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/pri-posnetkih-gre-za-nezaupnico-varnosti-v-vladnih-krogih.html |title=Pri posnetkih gre za nezaupnico varnosti v vladnih krogih |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Recordings Are About A Motion of No Confidence To Security in Government Circles |date=15 December 2011 |author=Dejan Karba |publisher=Delo.si |issn=1854-6544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miklavčič confirmed that all the data publicly available indicate the thesis about a parallel state to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/pustimo-da-organi-pregona-opravijo-svoje-delo.html |title=Pustimo, da organi pregona opravijo svoje delo |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Let The Enforcement Agencies Do Their Job |publisher=Delo.si |author=Dejan Karba |date=16 December 2011 |issn=1854-6544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The ministers of Janša's government, [[Andrej Vizjak]] and [[Mojca Kucler Dolinar]], were discussing the wages of judges. The recordings of Pahor's sessions showed the Foreign Minister [[Samuel Žbogar]] reporting about the pressures from the [[European Union]] on Slovenia regarding the [[Croatia–Slovenia border disputes#EU accession blockade|Slovenian blockade of Croatian entry to the Union]] and the Interior Minister [[Katarina Kresal]] discussing the acquisition of [[water cannons]] for the [[Slovenian Police]].&lt;ref name="Delo2012-09-02"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/zgodbe/ozadja/kontrolna-tocka_38.html |title=Kontrolna točka |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Control Point |date=2 September 2012 |first=Rok |last=Kajzer |newspaper=Delo.si |issn=1854-6544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
On 9 December, it was reported that the [[Slovenian Police]] had started investigation about the clips.&lt;ref name="Afera" /&gt; On 14 December, the Government spokesperson Darijan Košir explained that in 2006, government areas were renovated.&lt;ref name="Delo2x"/&gt; He said that the recorded sessions were held at [[Government and Presidential Palace|Gregorčič Street 20]] ({{lang|sl|Gregorčičeva ulica 20}}; Government and Presidential Palace) and the recording room was at Gregorčič Street 25. The buildings were connected with {{convert|200|m|abbr=off}} of cable. The system could be abused at several points. The works at Gregorčič Street 25 were carried out by the construction company [[Slovenija ceste Tehnika|SCT]], and the computer infrastructure was set up by the companies ADM and TSE. Košir told that all the people with access to the data were thoroughly [[background check|checked]]. On 12 December, after the Secretariat filed a criminal complaint, the Police requested an internal report from the Secretary-General Kamnar.&lt;ref name="STA2012-12-19"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?id=1707729 |title=Delo Hints at Delay in YouTube Leak Inquiry, Govt Disagrees |date=19 December 2012 |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December, TSE denied having spotted any anomalies in the computer system since it had been installed. They told that all their employees were checked and that they never received any instruction that would allow for an illegal access. They also pointed out that the Government was responsible for the security of the system after it had been taken over. The telephone number of ADM was unavailable.&lt;ref name="24urD15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montažerji"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2011/12/montazerji_vladnih_kamer.aspx |title=Montažerji vladnih kamer o zlorabah ne vedo nič |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Fitters of Government Cameras Don't Know Anything About Misuses |publisher=Planet Siol.net |date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors about a slow investigation due to long preparation of report by the Secretary-General appeared. Both the minister of interior and the Secretary-General denied this.&lt;ref name="STA2012-12-19" /&gt;

On 11 January 2012, an inspectional surveillance, ordered by the [[Information Commissioner]] [[Nataša Pirc Musar]], was carried out by the [[Inspectorate for Protection of Personal Data]] at the Secretary–General. As of 27 January 2012, the findings were not available yet. The results will influence the decision of the Government about the destruction of the original session recordings.&lt;ref name="Siol27-1-2012" /&gt;

On 26 January 2012, the [[Secretariat–General of the Government of Slovenia|Secretariat-General of the Government]] issued a report about an internal investigation that failed to find the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/vladi-se-ne-sanja-kdo-je-objavil-posnetke/275571 |title=Vladi se ne sanja, kdo je objavil posnetek |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Government has no Idea Who Published the Recording |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia |date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was found out that the clips were carefully chosen and taken out of context, giving them a different meaning than they would have in the whole.&lt;ref name="Delo27-1-2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/na-sledi-tatovom-ki-so-izmaknili-posnetke-vladnih-sej.html |title=Na sledi tatovom, ki so izmaknili posnetke vladnih sej |language=Slovenian |trans-title=On the Scent of the Thieves who Snatched the Recordings of Government Sessions |newspaper=Delo.si |publisher=Delo, d. d. |first=Dejan |last=Karba |date=27 January 2012 |issn=1854-6544}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were alienated after they had been processed in the recording room.

On 27 January 2012, [[Helena Kamnar]], the Secretary-General of the Government, unofficially told for media that three people had access to the [[Spectiva]] remote viewing software, and could also watch the sessions from their home.&lt;ref name="Siol27-1-2012" /&gt; Kamnar also explained that it was possible to find out who had access in which period but had no information due to the Police having confiscated one of the computers.&lt;ref name="Siol27-1-2012" /&gt; On 28 January 2012, she told that according to the information she had received from the person who allocated the right to use the system, the three people were Janez Janša, the former Secretary-General [[Božo Predalič]], and the former Secretary-General [[Milan M. Cvikl]].&lt;ref name="Dnevnik2012-01-28"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://narocanje.dnevnik.si/novice/aktualne_zgodbe/1042505803 |title=Kamnarjeva o posnetkih sej: Dostop do Spective naj bi imeli Janša, Predalič in Cvikl |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Kamnar About the Recordings of Sessions: The Access is Presumed to have been Available to Janša, Predalič and Cvikl |date=28 January 2012 |newspaper=Dnevnik.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; They only had the possibility to use it in their respective terms.&lt;ref name="Dnevnik2012-01-28" /&gt; Predalič told that he used it perhaps twice, because he was present at Janša's sessions and did not have the option to use it during Pahor's sessions.&lt;ref name="Dnevnik2012-01-28" /&gt; Cvikl told that he refused to use it as it seemed redundant to him and due to security reasons even demanded it to be uninstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/cvikl-o-posnetkih-vladnih-sej-opozarjal-sem-na-ne-varnost/275800 |title=Cvikl o posnetkih vladnih sej: Opozarjal sem na (ne)varnost |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Cvikl About the Recordings of Government Sessions: I Was Warning About the Danger |date=31 January 2012 |newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confiscated computers were returned to the Secretary-General on 31 January 2012. The next morning, Kamnar found the doors of the secretary open and reasoned that someone had broken in. Nothing was stolen. The Government officially denied any evidence that a criminal act had happened. There were guesses whether the two events could be related, but Kamnar decided there would be no investigation, as the possibility of it being successful was slim and she was to be replaced by the new government.&lt;ref name="Mladina2012-02-08" /&gt; Since February 2012, the government is again led by Janša, and the Secretary-General is again Predalič.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://radio.ognjisce.si/sl/127/slovenija/6874/ |title=Vlada na prvi seji o javnih financah; opravljene že prve menjave |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Government First Session About Public Finances; First Replacements Done |date=11 February 2012 |newspaper=Radio Ognjišče}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2012, the [[information commissioner]] reported that the measures for the safeguarding of the recordings were inadequate. Although the places where the recording device was situated and the recordings were kept were guarded, there were no revision marks on them, which would enable the tracing of their production, usage, viewing and processing. The law on the protection of personal data was not broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/1042519624 |title=Informacijska pooblaščenka: Neustrezno zavarovani posnetki vladnih sej |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Information Commissioner: Inadequately Protected Recordings of Government Sessions |date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the [[pre-trial procedure]] had not been completed yet by the Police.&lt;ref name="Delo2012-09-02" /&gt;

==Response by the Government==
On 7 December, the Secretary-General of the Government filed a [[criminal complaint]] against the unknown perpetrator and notified about the incident the [[Criminal Police Directorate (Slovenia)|Criminal Police Directorate]] and the [[Office for the Protection of Classified Information (Slovenia)|Office for the Protection of Classified Information]].&lt;ref name="vlade"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2012/01/posnetki_sej_vlade.aspx |title=Posnetki sej so bili montirani in objavljeni izven prostorov vlade |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Recordings of Sessions Were Edited and Published Outside the Government Areas |publisher=Siol.net |date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December, the Slovenian government demanded the removal of the clips from YouTube. On 9 December in the evening, when the publication was reported for the first time by media, there were three clips remaining of the allegedly original five although none had been removed by the host.&lt;ref name="Žurnal" /&gt;  YouTube had removed the clips on 15 December 2011, after a copyright-related demand by the [[Slovenian Computer Emergency Response Team]] (SI–CERT).&lt;ref name="SN15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="24ur27-01-2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/neuradno-le-trije-bi-lahko-odtujili-posneteke-vlade.html |title=Neuradno: Le trije bi lahko odtujili posnetke vlade |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Unofficially: Only Three People Could Alienate the Government Recordings |newspaper=24ur.com |publisher=Pro Plus, d. o. o. |date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the same day they appeared again, albeit shorter.&lt;ref name="24urD15"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/vlada-dosegla-umik-posnetkov.html |title=Vlada dosegla umik posnetkov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Government Achieved The Removal of the Recordings |publisher=24ur.com |date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were removed again in less than 24 hours.

The '''AgMES''' (Agricultural Metadata Element set) initiative was developed by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]] and aims to encompass issues of semantic standards in the domain of agriculture with respect to description, resource discovery, interoperability and data exchange for different types of information resources.

There are numerous other metadata schemas for different types of information resources. The following list contains a list of a few examples:

* Document-like Information Objects (DLIOs): [[Dublin Core]], Agricultural Metadata Element Set (AgMES)
* Events: [[VCalendar]]
* Geographic and Regional Information: Geographic information—Metadata ISO/IEC 11179 Standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm |title=Freely Available Standards |publisher=Isotc.iso.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Persons: [[FOAF (software)|Friend-of-a-friend]] (FOAF), [[vCard]]
* Plant Production and Protection: Darwin Core (1.0 and 2.0) (DwC)

AgMES as a namespace is designed to include agriculture specific extensions for terms and refinements from established standard metadata namespaces like [[Dublin Core]], AGLS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naa.gov.au/recordkeeping/gov_online/agls/summary.html&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Thus to be used for Document-like Information Objects, for example like publications, articles, books, web sites, papers, etc., it will have to be used in conjunction with the standard namespaces mentioned before.  The AgMES initiative strives to achieve improved interoperability between information resources in agricultural domain by enabling means for exchange of information.

Describing a DLIO with AgMES means exposing its major characteristics and contents in a standard way that can be reused easily in any information system. The more institutions and organizations in the agricultural domain that use AgMES to describe their DLIOs, the easier it will be to interchange data in between information systems like digital libraries and other repositories of agricultural information.

== Use of AgMES ==
Metadata on agricultural Document-like Information Objects (DLIOs) can be created and stored in various formats:
* embedded in a web site (in the manor as with the HTML meta tag)
* in a separate metadata database
* in an XML file
* in an RDF file

AgMES defines elements that can be used to describe a DLIO that can be used together with other metadata standards such as the Dublin Core, the Australian Government Locator Service. A complete list of all elements, refinements and schemes endorsed by AgMES is available from the AgMES website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aims.fao.org/standards/agmes/namespace-specification |title=AgMES 1.1 Namespace Specification &amp;#124; Agricultural Information Management Standards (AIMS) |publisher=Aims.fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creating application profiles ===
[[Application profile]]s are defined as schemas which consist of data elements drawn from one or more namespaces, combined by implementers, and optimized for a particular local application. Application profiles share the following four characteristics:
* They draw upon existing pool of metadata definition standards to extract suitable application- or requirement oriented elements.
* An application profile cannot create new elements.
* Application profiles specify the application specific details such as the schemes or controlled vocabularies. An application profile also contains information such as the format for the element value, cardinality or [[data type]].
* Lastly, an application profile can refine standardized definitions as long as it is "semantically narrower or more specific". This capability of application profiles caters to situations where a domain specific terminology is needed to replace a more general one.

=== Sample application profiles using AgMES ===
* The AGRIS Application Profile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/ae909e/ae909e00.htm |title=The AGRIS Application Profile for the International Information System on Agricultural Sciences and Technology |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard created specifically to enhance the description, exchange and subsequent retrieval of agricultural Document-like Information Objects (DLIOs). It is a format that allows sharing of information across dispersed bibliographic systems and is based on well-known and accepted metadata standards.
* The Event Application Profile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/aims/ap_applied.jsp |title=Agricultural Information Management Standards (AIMS) &amp;#124; Interoperability, reusability and cooperation |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard created to allow members of the Agricultural community to 'know' about an upcoming event and guide them to the event Web site where they can find further information. The information communicated is thus minimum yet interoperable across domains and organizations.

== AgMES and the semantic web ==

One of the advantages of the AgMES metadata schema is the ability to link between the [[Data element|metadata element]] and [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]]. The use of controlled vocabulary provides a "known" set of options to the indexer (and the search programmer) as to how the field can be filled out. Often the values may come from a specific thesaurus (e.g. [[AGROVOC]]) or classification schemes (e.g. the AGRIS/CARIS classification scheme) etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/aims/index_en.jsp?callingPage=ag_classifschemes.jsp |title=Agricultural Information Management Standards (AIMS) &amp;#124; Interoperability, reusability and cooperation |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the possibility to use controlled vocabularies for metadata elements, the user is provided with the most precise information. In this context, work is also being carried out on exploiting the power of controlled vocabularies expressed as using URIs and machine-understandable semantics.  In this context, FAO is promoting the [[Agricultural Ontology Service]] (AOS) initiative with the objective of expressing more semantics within the traditional thesaurus AGROVOC and build a Concept Server&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/aims/cs.htm |title=Agricultural Information Management Standards (AIMS) &amp;#124; Interoperability, reusability and cooperation |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a repository from which it will be always possible to extract traditional KOS.

'''Alex Segura Vendrell''' (born in 1986, [[Barcelona]]) is a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] multiple World Champion [[Freediving|freediver]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/otros-deportes/20160625/402742481785/aleix-segura-campeon-sin-respiracion.html|title=Aleix Segura, el campeón que se queda sin respiración|website=Lavanguardia.com|accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; both under [[AIDA International|AIDA]] and [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|CMAS]] official structures. Through [[spearfishing]] he developed his [[apnea]] skills and started competing in apnea (freediving) in 2011, reaching in competition during his debut year breath holds over eight minutes, and over ten minutes in the following seasons so far,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/els-matins/aleix-segura-doble-campio-del-mon-dapnea-estatica-aguanta-10-minuts-i-set-segons-sense-respirar/video/5563858/ |title=Aleix Segura, doble campió del món d'apnea estàtica, aguanta 10 minuts i set segons sense respirar |website=Ccma.cat |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fedas.es/aleix-segura-medalla-de-oro-en-apnea-estatica/|title=Apnea - FEDAS|website=Fedas.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving three World Champion titles in [[static apnea]] until now.
He competes in both swimming pool and depth disciplines in the sea but is currently specialized in static apnea, which aims to hold the breath underwater for the longest time.

In 2016 he achieved also the official [[Guinness World Record]]. "Longest time breath held voluntarily (male)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-time-breath-held-voluntarily-(male) |title=Longest time breath held voluntarily (male) |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |date=2016-02-28 |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in static apnea with previous pure oxygen breathe up reaching 24 minutes and 3.45 seconds in an event broadcast on TV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.eus/es/deportes/videos/detalle/3876738/video-aleix-segura-ha-logrado-record-guinness-apnea/|title=Aleix Segura ha logrado el Récord Guinness de apnea|website=Eitb.eus}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Mediterranean Dive Show 2016,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/cornella/salon-inmersion-cierra-record-guinness-apnea-cornella-4937047|title=El salón de la inmersión cierra con un record Guinness de apnea en Cornellà|date=29 February 2016|website=Elperiodico.com|accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the longest official breath hold ever at the moment. He is the only person ever to have simultaneously held the AIDA, CMAS, and Guinness World Record static apnea titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deeperblue.com/incredible-new-guinness-world-record-24-minute-o2-assisted-breath-hold/|title=Incredible New Guinness World Record – 24 Minute O2 Assisted Breath-Hold|first=Stephan|last=Whelan|date=3 March 2016|website=Deeperblue.com|accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently combines his freediving career with his professional activity as an architect in Barcelona.

== Early life ==
He was born in 1986 in Barcelona. As a kid he learned to freedive in the sea during his family vacations in [[Costa Brava]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ara.cat/esports/apnea-Aleix-Segura-entrenament-arribar-adormir-me-aigua_0_1822017790.html&lt;/ref&gt;, the northern coast of [[Catalonia]]. He practiced several sports prior to competitively develop his aquatic skills, football, taekwondo, judo and basketball until high school&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/otros-deportes/20160625/402742481785/aleix-segura-campeon-sin-respiracion.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Simultaneously he started spearfishing which became the reason for him to further develop his apnea capacity, leading later on to the competitive purpose in 2011, after finishing his Architecture studies in the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, which is his current job combined with his freediving career.

The '''Ara Pacis Augustae''' ([[Latin]], "Altar of Augustan Peace"; commonly shortened to '''Ara Pacis''') is an [[altar]] in [[Rome]] dedicated to [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]], the [[List of Roman deities|Roman goddess]] of [[Peace]]. The monument was commissioned by the [[Roman Senate]] on July 4, 13 BC to honor the return of [[Augustus]] to Rome after three years in [[Hispania]] and [[Gaul]],&lt;ref name="Ara Pacis Augustae"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://class.coursera.org/romanarchitecture-001/lecture/105 | title=Ara Pacis Augustae | publisher=Yale University | people=Diana E. E. Kleiner | medium=Multimedia presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[#refResGestae|Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', 8.5, 12.2&lt;/ref&gt; and consecrated on January 30, 9 BC.&lt;ref name="crow"&gt;{{harvnb|Crow|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally located on the northern outskirts of Rome, a [[Roman mile]] from the boundary of the ''[[pomerium]]'' on the west side of the [[Via Flaminia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torelli|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; it stood in the northeastern corner of the [[Campus Martius]], the former flood plain of the [[Tiber River]] and gradually became buried under {{convert|4|m|ft}} of silt deposits. It was reassembled in its current location, now the [[Museum of the Ara Pacis]], in 1938.

==Significance==
The altar reflects the Augustan vision of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman civil religion]]. The lower register of its frieze depicts vegetal work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the Roman Peace ({{lang-la|[[Pax Augusta]]}}), while the monument as a whole serves a civic ritual function whilst simultaneously operating as propaganda for Augustus and his regime, easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional Roman culture.

==Structure==
[[File:Plan Ara Pacis Augustae.svg|250px|thumb|right|Plan of the Ara Pacis. North is at the left]]
The monument consists of a traditional open-air altar at its center surrounded by precinct walls which are pierced on the eastern and western ends (so called today because of the modern layout) by openings and elaborately and finely sculpted entirely in Luna marble.

===The Altar===
Within the enclosing precinct walls, the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the ''lex aria'', the law governing the ritual performed at the altar.  The sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a Republican style similar to the so-called "[[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]]," in sharp contrast with the style on the exterior of the precinct walls.  What remains of the altar is otherwise fragmentary, but it appears to have been largely functional with less emphasis on art and decoration.

The interior of the precinct walls are carved with [[Bucranium|bucrania]], ox skulls, from which carved garlands hang.  The garlands bear fruits from various types of plants, all displayed on a single garland as allegorical representations of plenty and abundance.  The bucrania in turn evoke the idea of sacrificial piety, appropriate motifs for the interior of the altar precinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zanker|1990|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts, which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in Rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city's ''pomerium.''&lt;ref&gt;Torelli, 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exterior wall decoration===

[[File:Ara Pacis relieve 11.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Relief showing a sacrifice performed by [[Aeneas]] or [[Numa Pompilius]].]]

The exterior walls of the Ara Pacis are divided between allegorical and pseudo-historical relief panels on the upper register while the lower register is compared of scenes of nature: harmonic, intertwined vines that contain wildlife and connote nature under control.  The upper register of the northern and southern walls depict scenes of the emperor, his family, and members of the regime in the act of processing to or performing a sacrifice.  Various [[toga]]te figures are shown with their heads covered (''capite velato''), signifying their role as both priests and sacrificiants.  Other figures wear [[Bay laurel|laurel]] [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]s, traditional Roman symbols of victory.  Members of individual [[flamen|priestly colleges]] are depicted in traditional garb appropriate to their office,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zanker|1990|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[lictor]]s can be identified by their iconographic ''[[fasces]]''.  Women and children are also included among the procession; the depiction of children in Roman sculpture would have been novel at the time of the Altar's construction, evoking themes of moral and familial piety, as well as easing concerns over dynastic intentions while simultaneously introducing potential heirs to the public eye.

The western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar, although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side.  The entryways were flanked by panels depicting allegorical or mythological scenes evocative of peace, piety and tradition.  On the eastern wall, panels depicted the seated figures of [[Roma (god)|Roma]] and [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]], while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as [[Aeneas]], but increasingly believed to be Rome's second king, [[Numa Pompilius]]. The identity of these various figures has been a point of some controversy over the years, relying heavily on interpretation of fragmentary remains, discussed below.

The sculpture of the Ara Pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative, and its [[iconography]] has several levels of significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Galinsky|1966|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the Ara Pacis and similar public Roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs, and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda. The Ara Pacis is seen to embody without conscious effort the deep-rooted ideological connections among cosmic sovereignty, military force, and fertility that were first outlined by [[Georges Dumézil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dumézil|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dumézil|1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; connections which are attested in early Roman culture and more broadly in the substructure of [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] culture at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freibergs|1986|pp=3–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Holliday&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holliday|1990|p=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Altar's imagery of the [[Golden Age]], usually discussed as mere poetic allusion, appealed to a significant component of the Roman populace. The program of the Ara Pacis addressed this group's very real fears of cyclical history, and promised that the rule of Augustus would avert the cataclysmic destruction of the world predicted by contemporary models of historical thought.

===The east and west walls===
[[File:Ara Pacis relieve 19.JPG|thumb|left|Female Warrior.]]
[[File:Arapacis.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Ara Pacis: the so-called  "[[Tellus (goddess)|Tellus]]" panel.]]

The East and West walls each contain two panels, one well preserved and one represented only in fragments.

The East Wall contains a badly preserved scene of a female warrior (''bellatrix''), possibly [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], apparently sitting on a [[War trophy|pile of weapons confiscated from the enemy]], thus forcing peace upon them by rendering them unable to make war.&lt;ref name="Ara Pacis Augustae"/&gt; This scene has been reconstructed, based on coins that depict such a seated Roma. When the monument was being reconstructed at its present site,  Edmund Buchner and other scholars sketched what the panel may have looked like. This interpretation, although widely accepted, can not be proved correct, as so little of the original panel survives.

The other panel is more controversial in its subject, but far better preserved. A goddess sits amid a scene of fertility and prosperity with twins on her lap. Scholars have variously suggested that the goddess is Italia, Tellus (Earth), Venus, and Peace, although other views also circulate. Due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace, and because the Altar is named for "peace", the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is Pax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Grummond|1990|pp=663–677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Wall also contains two panels. The fragmentary "[[Lupercal]] Panel" apparently preserves the moment when [[Romulus and Remus]] were discovered by [[Faustulus]] the shepherd, while Mars looks on.&lt;ref name="Ara Pacis Augustae"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Grummond|1990|pp=664, 668}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again this panel is a modern drawing without much evidence.  Marble fragments of the tree and the head and shoulder of Mars (if it is Mars) and part of a second individual (thought to be Faustulus) survive, but the addition of the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]], Romulus, and Remus is entirely speculative.

The better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig (the standard sacrifice when Romans made a peace treaty) by an old priest and two attendants.  In 1907, this scene was identified by Johannes Sieveking&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sieveking|1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the moment when [[Aeneas]], newly arrived in Italy, sacrificed a sow and her 30 piglets to Juno, as told by [[Virgil]] and others, even though the scene differs greatly from Vergil's description. In the 1960s, Stephan Weinstock challenged this identification (and the very identity of the entire monument), citing numerous discrepancies that Sieveking and his followers had failed to notice between Vergil's version and the panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinstock|1960|pp=44–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the suggestion was made that the scene shows [[Numa Pompilius]], the Roman king associated with Peace and the [[Gates of Janus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rehak|2001|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Rehak later published an article with this proposal, confirmed in a chapter of his posthumous book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rehak|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory has won over many scholars, despite considerable initial resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Buxton, Hallett, ''et al''.  Laurence Richardson credits students in his seminar at Princeton with its inception.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The figures===

The long friezes of the Ara Pacis (the North and South Walls) contain figures advancing towards the West, who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the Peace created by Augustus.  These figures fall into four categories: [[lictor]]s (men carrying [[fasces]], bodyguards of magistrates); priests (three of the four major ''[[Collegium|collegia]]''&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Pontifices]]'', ''[[Epulones|Septemviri]]'', and ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|Quindecimviri]]''): women and children (generally from the imperial family, represented in portraiture); and attendants (a few anonymous figures necessary for religious purposes).

In addition there are two or three non-Roman children, who may be guests (or hostages) in Rome.&lt;ref name="Ara Pacis Augustae"/&gt; Their identification by their non-Roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that Rome is the centre of the world, and that other nations send their young to Rome to learn Roman ways, so great is Rome's reputation. The ceremony took place in the summer of 13 BC, but not necessarily on 4 July, when the Senate voted to build the Ara Pacis.

====North wall====
The north wall has about 46 extant or partially extant figures. The first two foreground figures are [[lictor]]s, carrying [[fasces]] (bundles of rods symbolizing Roman authority).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|2007|loc=line 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next set of figures consists of priests from the college of the [[Epulones|Septemviri epulones]], so identified by an incense box they carry with special symbols. One member of this college is missing in a gap.

After them follows the ''collegium'' of the ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]'', also identified by the incense box carried by a public slave among them.  Although the name suggests this college has exactly fifteen members, the size of the college has grown to 23, including Augustus and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]], who appear on the South Frieze.  The other twenty-one members are present here.  Two very badly damaged figures in the middle are split by a gap.  From photos, the gap appears to affect a single figure, but as Koeppel, Conlin, and Stern have proven, in-site examination reveals that one is a foreground and the other a background figure.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Koeppel, “Die historischen Reliefs der römischen Kaiserzeit V: ''Ara Pacis Augustae''," Teil 1. ''Bonner Jahrbücher'' 187 (1987), 101–157., Diane Atnally Conlin, The Artists of the Ara Pacis (Chapel Hill 1997), Gaius Stern, "Women Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae" Berk. diss. 2006, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last portion of the North Frieze consists of members of the imperial family.  Many scholars used to identify the veiled, leading figure as [[Julia the Elder|Julia, daughter of Augustus]],  but since Julia appears on the South Frieze, it is more likely that this figure is [[Octavia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Stern, "Women Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae" Berk. diss. 2006, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other figures in the entourage might include Marcella (a daughter of Octavia), Iullus Antonius (a son of Mark Antony), and two boys and a girl of the imperial family.

In 1894, and again in 1902 and 1903, Eugen Petersen suggested that [[Lucius Caesar]] appears with Agrippa, dressed in a "Trojan" costume for the [[Lusus Troiae|Troy Game]] held in 13 BC (see below).&lt;ref name="online"&gt;I.M. Le M. Du Quesnay, ''Horace, ''Odes 4.5: ''Pro Reditu Imperatoris Caesaris Divi Filii Augusti''," in ''Homage to Horace: A Bimillenary Celebration'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), p. 143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bby6t3zOq9oC&amp;pg=PA142 online]; Mario Torelli, ''Typology and Structure of Roman Historical Reliefs'' (University of Michigan Press, 1992), pp. 48–49, 60 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4012VYCWYqwC&amp;pg=PA60 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many scholars, realizing by 1935 that Lucius was too young to be the boy beside Agrippa, preferred to identify him as [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]].  They named the smallest child on the North Frieze "Lucius," even though he is a mere toddler (Lucius was four in 13 BC).  Some scholars assumed this boy also was a participant in the Troy Games, although he is certainly too young (six or seven was the minimum age).  If this toddler were Lucius, he would be too young and in the wrong costume for the Troy Games.  The best guess is that he is a Germanic tribal prince, but he is certainly not a dressed as a Trojan.  As Charles Brian Rose has noted, "The variable value of the Eastern costume and the uneasy interaction of Trojan and Parthian iconography can make it difficult to determine whether one is viewing the founders of the Romans or their fiercest opponents."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brian Rose, "The Parthians in Augustan Rome," in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 109 (2005), p. 44, discussed pp. 36–44. Rose points out that only Gaius would have been of an age to participate in the Troy Game in 13 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The youth wearing Hellenistic Greek clothing suited to a Hellenistic prince has been identified as Gaius in the guise of a ''[[Camillus (cognomen)|camillus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, The Portraiture of Gaius and Lucius Caesar, (1987), 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; an adolescent attendant of the [[Flamen Dialis]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Numa Pomilius'' Numa 7.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaius identification is best supported by his size, however an additional boy in Roman dress who has a ''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'' (but has lost his head!) is also the right size, and therefore a better guess.  For Gaius to appear in public without his ''bulla'' would invite the evil eye.  This same figure in Hellenistic dress has also been interpreted as [[Ptolemy of Mauretania]] representing [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], along with the German boy (Europe) and the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] prince ([[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Stern, "Women Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae" Berk. diss. 2006, chapter 8; Bridget Buxton also employed these identifications (on Stern's advice) in an earlier study "Rome at the Crossroads" (Berk. diss. 2003).  See also Kleiner and Buxton, "Pledges of Empire:  The Ara Pacis and the Donations of Rome," AJA (2008), 57–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  A foreign prince would not wear a ''bulla''.

====South wall====
[[File:RomaAraPacis ProcessioneSudParticolare.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Ara Pacis: processional frieze showing members of the Imperial household (south face).]]
The South Wall has seen a great deal of scholarship and the greatest number of academic debates.  Unlike the North Wall, where most of the heads are new (not authentic ancient heads, but modern creations), the heads of the figures on the South Wall are mostly original.  Some half dozen figures are recognizable from looking at other surviving statues of members of the imperial family.  Nevertheless, much debate has taken place over many of these figures, including Augustus, Agrippa, Tiberius, Julia, and Antonia.

The figure of Augustus was not discovered until the 1903 excavation, and his head was damaged by the cornerstone of the Renaissance palazzo built on top of the original Ara Pacis site.&lt;ref name="Ara Pacis Augustae"/&gt; Although he was identified correctly in 1903, Petersen, Strong, and Stuart-Jones initially saw the figure as the ''rex sacrorum''.  Today Augustus is better recognized by his hair style than his face.

In the absence of Augustus from the panel, early scholars debated whether this figure was Augustus or Agrippa or [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]]. In 1907, Sieveking proposed that this figure was Lepidus, the ''Pontifex Maximus'' at the time. Sieveking later reversed his position with a series of peculiar suggestions. In 1926, Loewy compared the Louvre Agrippa of the Agrippa in Copenhagen (and elsewhere) to the Ara Pacis in order to demonstrate iconographical similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loewy | first1 = E. | year = 1926 | title = Bemerkungen zur Ara Pacis | url = | journal = JöAr | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 53–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from a very small minority of scholars (most vehemently defensive of Lepidus in ''Rom. Mitt'' in the 1930s was [[Ludwig Curtius]]), the rest of the academy concluded that this figure is Agrippa. Ryberg's 1949 article gave further weight to that conclusion.

Many scholars continue to see the Julia figure as Livia, having reasoned that Livia has to be on the Ara Pacis. Indeed, Livia does appear somewhere (her exclusion is unlikely), but by 13 BC Julia had politically eclipsed Livia, as has been understood and explained by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, "Livia Augusta on the Ara Pacis," CAMWS-SS, Winston-Salem, NC, Oct. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Du Rocher, ''Histoire de la Rome Antique'' (Paris 1997), 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boschung "Die Bildistypen der iulisch-claudischen Kaiserfamilien," JRA 6 (1993), 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inez Scott Ryberg "The Procession of the Ara Pacis," ''MAAR'' 19 (1949), 77-101&lt;/ref&gt; The identification dates back to Milani in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milani |first=Luigi Adriano |year=1891 |title=Le Recente scoperte d'antichitá in Verona |location=Verona |publisher=G. Franchini |at=pag. 19 n. 5 |language=it |url=https://archive.org/details/lerecentiscopert00mila }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Livia has no bond to Agrippa, whereas Julia was his wife and expected to be the unofficial empress of Rome for decades, during and beyond Augustus' lifetime.  Julia also better personified Augustus' new pro-natalism program, having already given birth to four surviving children.  Nevertheless, a majority of scholars in 2000 preferred to see this figure as Livia.

The Tiberius figure was identified as such by Milani, an identification that was rarely questioned until the 1940s. Moretti, in making the glass museum for the Ara Pacis at Mussolini's command, guessed that the two consuls (Tiberius and Varus) of 13 flank Augustus, so he saw this figure as M. Valerius Messalla.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti ''Ara Pacis'' (1937), 37-44, ''Ara pacis Augustae''(1948), 220, figs. 166-67, pl. 26, (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; V.H. von Poulsen and Toynbee proposed Iullus Antonius.&lt;ref&gt;von Poulsen (1946), ''Acta archaeologica'' 17, 32 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee (1953), 85; J. Benario (1960), 348; Polacco (1960-61), 620-21&lt;/ref&gt;  But as has been well established, Augustus is flanked by priests, and this figure is Tiberius.  Boschung and Bonanno have both matched the face to early period Tiberius statuary.

In relation to Antonia, Drusus, and Germanicus, H. Dütschke proposed in 1880 the correct identity for Antonia and Drusus, but incorrectly saw the toddler as Claudius.&lt;ref&gt;H. Dütschke, "Ueber ein römisches Relief mit Darstellung der Familie des Augustus," ''Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums zu Hamburg''(1880)&lt;/ref&gt; A. von Domaszewski amended this family identification and correctly saw the child as Germanicus.  He also suggested that the Ara Pacis is arranged in family groups.&lt;ref name="Domaszewski 1903"&gt;A. von Domaszewski, "Die Familie des Augustus auf der Ara Pacis ''JoAI'' 6 (1903) 57 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also correctly determined that the two-year-old child could be only Germancius, whose exact birth on 24 May 15 BC is known.  This helps prove that the ceremony is an event in 13, although a few scholars continued to argue the ceremony was that of 9 BC (until definitive proof in favor of 13 came out in 1939).&lt;ref&gt;E. Welin, "Die beiden Festtagge der Ara Pacis Augustae,"  ''ΔΡΑΓΜΑ M.P. Nilsson dedicatum'' (1939), 500 ff.  Welin's article did not circulate widely, but a summary in English appears as an appendix in Arnoldo Momigliano, "The Peace of the Ara Pacis," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 5 (1942), 228-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the Domitii Ahenobarbi, von Domaszewski also proposed in the same 1903 article that the last family on the South Wall is that of the father of the emperor Nero (born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus).&lt;ref name="Domaszewski 1903"/&gt;  This identification remains widespread today. Pollini provides the best summary of this viewpoint in his article, ''Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis'', where he points out that the writer Suetonius specifically mentions that Nero's father went "to the East on the staff of the young Gaius Caesar".&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Nero'' 5.1&lt;/ref&gt; As this campaign is known to have begun in 2 BC,&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis", ''AJArch'' 90 (1986), p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; it means that Gnaeus must have been of mature age by that time, therefore requiring a birth year of at least 17 BC, which would, in turn, make him sufficiently old to be the boy on the Ara Pacis.  Pollini also reasons that the delay in Gnaeus' career (only reaching the consulship in 32 AD) resulted from his documented unpleasant character and points out that the careers of other members of the family with undesirable traits also suffered similar delays, notably [[Augustus]]' youngest grandson, [[Agrippa Postumus]], who had no career, and [[Germanicus]]' brother, the later emperor, [[Claudius]], whose career started late.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis", ''AJArch'' 90 (1986), pp. 455-6&lt;/ref&gt;   However, there are some dissenters from this theory.  Stern claims that these figures cannot possibly be the Domitii Ahenobarbi, on the basis of the belief that [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]], whom von Domaszewski saw as the boy of the family, was born after the monument's completion.&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Stern, "Nero’s Father and Other Romantic Figures on the Ara Pacis Augustae," CAMWS, St. Louis, MO, Apr. 2004, "Women, Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae," (Berk diss. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Syme had also argued that Gnaeus was born after the monument's completion, but accepted the identification of the Ahenobarbus family, preferring to identify the boy as an otherwise unknown elder brother and the girl figure as an otherwise unknown elder sister of Gnaeus—both of whom died young.  Syme also proved somewhat unintentionally, based on the inscription ''ILS'' 6095 that Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was governor of Africa in 13 BC and could not be in Rome for the Ara Pacis ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Ronald Syme, "Neglected Children on the Ara Pacis," in ''AJArch'' 88 (1984), pp. 583-589, on Lucius as governor of Africa, see ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (1987), 62, especially 153, 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1894, Eugen Petersen suggested that [[Lucius Caesar]] appears with Agrippa, dressed in a "Trojan" costume for the equestrian event called the [[Lusus Troiae|Troy Game]], which was held in 13 BC for the dedication of the [[Theater of Marcellus]].&lt;ref name="online"/&gt; This theory won universal acceptance for many decades, even though the evidence is overwhelmingly against.  The only early challenge was slight:  Several scholars, noting the size and age of the boy beside Agrippa, preferred to identify him as [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]], an opinion that prevailed by 1935.  The boy is clearly not a Roman, given his clothing, lack of ''bulla'', and hair.  So ingrained was Petersen's theory, however, that when the distinguished scholar Erika Simon (1968, 18) suggested the boy is a barbarian, she was subjected to intense criticism until she retreated (''e.g''. Mario Torelli (1982, 60 n. 72), once called her opinion "perfect nonsense").  Subsequently, led by Charles Brian Rose, scholars have realized Petersen was wrong:  the boy is a foreign prince.  Stern adds the costume is wrong for a Trojan (no Phrygian hat) and no ''bulla'' – worn by all Roman boys as protection from the evil eye.  Many others have contributed to disprove Petersen's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brian Rose wrote The variable value of the Eastern costume and the uneasy interaction of Trojan and Parthian iconography can make it difficult to determine whether one is viewing the founders of the Romans or their fiercest opponents," in "The Parthians in Augustan Rome," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 109 (2005), p. 44, discussed pp. 36–44. Rose points out that only Gaius would have been of an age to participate in the Troy Game in 13 BC.  See also Stern "Women, Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae," (Berk diss. 2006), chapters 5 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1568 first fragmentary sculptures were rediscovered beneath [[Palazzo Peretti]] in Lucina  (a.k.a. [[Palazzo Fano-Almagià]]), right next to the basilica [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]], close to "Via del Corso", and have found their way to the [[Villa Medici]], the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]], the [[Uffizi]] and the [[Louvre]].
* In 1859 further sculptural fragments were found in the same area under [[Cinema Nuovo Olimpia|Teatro Olimpia]], part of the Peretti Palace in via in Lucina, close to the Italian Parliament Building, and the sculptures were recognized as having belonged to the same monument.
* In 1903, well after [[Friedrich von Duhn]] had recognized that the reliefs belonged to the Ara Pacis (1879–81), known from Augustus' memoir, a request was sent to the Ministry of Public Education to continue the excavations. Their success was made possible by the generosity of Edoardo Almagià, who, as well as giving his permission for the exploration, donated in advance whatever should be discovered underneath the palace and made an ongoing financial contribution to the expenses of the excavation; by July of that year, it became clear that the conditions were extremely difficult and that the stability of [[Cinema Nuovo Olimpia|Teatro Olimpia]] might well be compromised; when about half the monument had been examined and 53 fragments recovered, the excavation was called to a halt.
* In 1909 it was decided that several buildings closely surrounding [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] were to be destroyed to bring the mausoleum back to view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cittasostenibili.it/industriale/industriale_Scheda_7.htm|title=Scheda 6 FORMAZIONE DELLA CITTA' INDUSTRIALE XIX secolo|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 1918 and 1921 the President of the ''Piedmontese Society of Archaeology and Fine Arts'', Oreste Mattirolo, for the first time suggested that all fragments were to be collected and joined to rebuild the altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Third Rome, 1922-43: The Making of the Fascist Capital|last=Kallis|first=Aristotele|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1932 demolition of buildings surrounding the mausoleum, decided in 1909, started, together with may other demolitions carried on in those years in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Il mondo classico nell'immaginario contemporaneo|last=Coccia|first=Benedetto|publisher=Apes|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 1937, the Italian Cabinet decreed that for the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Augustus, the excavations should recommence, using the most advanced technology. Seventy cubic metres of ground under what was by then the [[Cinema Nuovo Olimpia]] were frozen, whilst the altar was extracted.
* The fragments, although not complete, were collected and joined together to rebuild the Ara; due to short time available (job had to be completed before 23 September 1938, last day of Augustean 2000th anniversary), few fragments available and poor historical sources to refer to for restoration (basically a couple of ancient Roman coins), the reconstruction had to be performed with the help of the Italian artist [[Odoardo Ferretti]].

=== The first protective building housing the monument by [[Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo|Morpurgo]] architect ===

In 1938 the finally reconstructed Ara was placed near the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], and a big pavilion was built around it by architect [[Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo]] as part of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s attempt to create an ancient Roman "theme park" to glorify [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]].&lt;ref name="crow" /&gt; Several dozens of the buildings surrounding the Mausoleum were leveled to free up space around the monument. This led to a great number of complaints from the locals and the surrounding city, starting a long series of arguments and criticisms of the Ara Pacis project. These arguments are ongoing despite having the original pavilion replaced by a new one in 2006, known as "[[Museum of the Ara Pacis|Ara Pacis museum]]".

=== The new protective building housing the monument by [[Richard Meier|Meier]] architect ===
The historic Fascist style building around the Altar, locally known as "teca del [[Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo|Morpurgo]]",  was pulled down in 2006, and replaced by a glass and steel structure in modern style, designed by architect [[Richard Meier]]. The new cover building, which has been named "[[Museum of the Ara Pacis|Ara Pacis museum]]", now stands on the same site as Mussolini's structure.&lt;ref name="crow" /&gt; This new structure is much bigger than previous one and it is divided in multiple rooms and sections besides the main one containing the altar.

Meier's building construction caused new arguments and criticism, after the ones which accompanied the first building construction, both from Rome inhabitants and stranger observers, probably due both to political memory tied to the pre-existent pavilion and to visual impact of the new pavilion, which in opinion of many is in great contrast with surrounding historical buildings.

[[Nicolai Ouroussoff]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the building “a contemporary expression of what can happen when an architect fetishizes his own style out of a sense of self-aggrandizement. Absurdly overscale, it seems indifferent to the naked beauty of the dense and richly textured city around it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Ouroussoff | first =Nicolai |authorlink=Nicolai Ouroussoff | title =An Oracle of Modernism in Ancient Rome | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/25/arts/design/25paci.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | date =2006-09-25 | accessdate =2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding right-wing mayor [[Gianni Alemanno]], backed since July 2008 by culture undersecretary Francesco Maria Giro said he would tear down the new structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/13/architecture.art|title=I just don't get modern art, says Italy's culture minister|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-08-13|first=Tom|last=Kington|date=13 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Sanderson | first =Rachel |author2=Mills, Don | title =Modern building stirs Roman passions | pages =A.19 | publisher =[[National Post]] | date =2006-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Rome mayor vows to remove museum  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7379564.stm |quote=The city of Rome's newly elected right-wing mayor has caused waves by vowing to rip down a controversial museum created by a US architect.

The city plans to build a wide pedestrian area along the river and run the road underneath it. "It's an improvement," says Meier, adding that "the reason that wall was there has to do with traffic and noise. Once that is eliminated, the idea of opening the piazza to the river is a good one." The mayor’s office said Alemanno hopes to complete the project before the end of his term in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100408/world/modern-scar-housing-roman-altar-to-be-modified.301780 Times of Malta, press release] (accessed July 6, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1765">John Bateman (1839–1910) published in 1883 the fourth edition of his 1876 '''''The Acre-Ocracy of England''''' retitled '''''The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, A list of all owners of Three thousand acres and upwards, worth £3,000 a year; Also, one thousand three hundred owners of Two thousand acres and upwards, in England, Scotland, Ireland, &amp; Wales, their acreage and income from Land, Culled from 'THE MODERN DOMESDAY BOOK''''', under the Harrison imprint. His source for the data was the government produced survey [[Return of Owners of Land, 1873]], often known as the ''Modern Domesday Book'', the many errors in which he revised and corrected. The preface to his work sets out many of the criticisms of the original 1873 Return and identifies some of the commonest errors contained in it.

This was republished in 1971 by the Leicester University Press, New York. It used text from the 1883 edition (the fourth and last), and had an introduction by David Spring.

==Family==
Bateman, of [[Brightlingsea]] Hall, Essex, was a JP and DL, for Essex and Staffordshire. He married in 1865, the Hon. Jessy Caroline Bootle-Wilbraham,
sister of [[Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom]]. He left one daughter.

The '''bibcode''' (also known as the '''refcode''') is a compact identifier used by several [[astronomy|astronomical]] data systems to uniquely specify literature references.

== Adoption ==
The Bibliographic Reference Code (refcode) was originally developed to be used in [[SIMBAD]] and the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database]] (NED), but it became a de facto standard and is now used more widely, for example, by the NASA [[Astrophysics Data System]] who coined and prefer the term "bibcode".&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{ cite book| url=http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/refcode/refcode-paper.html| chapter= NED and SIMBAD Conventions for Bibliographic Reference Coding| title=Information &amp; On-Line Data in Astronomy|editor= Daniel Egret|editor2= Miguel A.

== Format ==
The code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form
&lt;center&gt;&lt;tt&gt;YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;tt&gt;YYYY&lt;/tt&gt; is the four-digit year of the reference and &lt;tt&gt;JJJJJ&lt;/tt&gt; is a code indicating where the reference was published. In the case of a journal reference, &lt;tt&gt;VVVV&lt;/tt&gt; is the volume number, &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt; indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt; for a letters section), &lt;tt&gt;PPPP&lt;/tt&gt; gives the starting page number, and &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; is the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods (&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;&lt;ref name=b /&gt; Page numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt; column. The 6-digit article ID numbers (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a etc.) and inserted into column &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt;. The remaining four digits are used in the page field.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

[[File:Ryan Valentine scores.jpg|thumb|A player scoring in an association football game.]]
[[Futsal]] began in the 1930s South America as a version of [[association football]], taking elements of its parent game into an indoor format so players could still play during inclement weather.
Over the years, both sports have developed, creating a situation where the two sports share common traits while also hosting various differences.

The Laws of the Game for each sport both have 17 laws, all of which cover the same topics, although with some variations in certain areas.

== Similarities ==
===Area of play===
*'''Playing Area Markings''': Both sports are played on a rectangular field marked with lines with a center circle midway between two goals. The two longer lines are called touch lines and the two shorter lines are called goal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laws of the Game 2015/2016|last=|first=|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|year=|isbn=|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=6|chapter=Law 1 - The Field of Play|ref=S1-p6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Futsal Laws of the Game 2012/2013|last=|first=|last2=|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|year=|isbn=|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=6|chapter=Law 1 - The Pitch|ref=F1-p6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Corners''': At the confluence of the goal line and the touch line, also known as the corner, there is a quarter circle called the corner arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laws of the Game 2015/2016|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=8|chapter=Law 1 - The Field of Play|ref=S1-p8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Futsal Laws of the Game 2012/2013|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|year=|isbn=|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=8|chapter=Law 1 - The Pitch|ref=F1-p8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Penalty Area''': both sports have a penalty area extending from the outside of each goal post along the goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Futsal Laws of the Game 2012/2013|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|year=|isbn=|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=7|chapter=Law 1 - The Pitch|ref=F1-p7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laws of the Game 2015/2016|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=8|chapter=Law 1 - The Field of Play|ref=S1-p8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Goals''': Goals are placed at the center of each goal line, with two posts equidistant from the corners. The two posts are connected by a crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Futsal Laws of the Game 2012/2013|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|year=|isbn=|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=8|chapter=Law 1 - The Pitch|ref=F1-p8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laws of the Game 2015/2016|publisher=FIFA/IFAB|location=Zurich, Switzerland|pages=9|chapter=Law 1 - The Field of Play|ref=S1-p9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Starts and stoppages ===

*'''Scoring''': Scoring takes place when the entire ball passes over the goal line in between the goal posts.
*'''Boundary Stoppages''': The ball is also considered out of play in both sports when it completely passes over the goal line or the touch line and the attacking team kicks the ball back into play in a [[Corner kick]] when the defending team kicks the ball over the goal line. During restarts from the touch line, futsal and association football require at least part of the ball to be behind the touch line until the ball is back in play.
*'''Kick-offs''': [[Kick-off (association football)|Kick-offs]] also take place in each sport at the beginning of each half or after the scoring of a goal and [[dropped-ball]]s occur when play is interrupted for any reason not otherwise specified within the laws of the game.

===  Fouls ===
* '''Direct Free Kick Fouls''': There are ten identical fouls that result in direct free kicks and if any one of these fouls occur in the penalty area, a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] is awarded.
* '''The Advantage Rule''' Referees are also allowed to let play continue if the stoppage of play would reward the team committing the foul, better known as the "Advantage Rule."
* ''' Yellow cards and Red Cards''': [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|Cautions and sending-off offenses]] are also identical, and the procedure regarding free kicks is the same, although in association football all opponents must stay at least 9.15 metres from the ball until it is back in play where in futsal, all opponents must stay at least 5 metres from the ball until it is back in play.

=== Miscellaneous ===
*'''[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]: '''As of 2016, the primary governing body for both association football and futsal is [[FIFA]], with the laws of each game determined by [[International Football Association Board]], a body consisting of FIFA, [[The Football Association]], the [[Scottish Football Association]], the [[Football Association of Wales]] and the [[Irish Football Association]].

== Differences ==

=== Scope, Speed and Field Surface ===
[[File:FutsalPitchsvg.svg|left|thumb|A futsal pitch]]
[[File:Football pitch metric.png|thumb|Association football pitch]]

*'''Size of Field''': [[Futsal#The field|A futsal pitch]] is approximately a third of the size of an association football pitch and a futsal ball is also about six centimetres smaller on average, and has about 30 percent less bounce. Understandably, there are fewer players on the pitch in futsal (five, including a goalkeeper) than in association football (eleven, including a goalkeeper).
*'''Field Markings:''' While there are similarities, there are key differences, most notably regarding the penalty area. A football field's penalty area is rectangular and approximately the minimum allowable size for an entire futsal pitch. In futsal, a semi-circle radiating 6 metres from the goalposts and heading into the field in an arc.
*'''More Goal Scoring''' Due to this more concentrated focus, the speed of play and the number of goals is higher in futsal than association football. For example, the [[2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup]] had an average of 6.77 goals per match while the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] had an average of 2.67 goals per match.
*'''Pitch Colour and Surface''' The pitch in association football must be either a green-coloured natural grass or a green-coloured artificial turf substitute while the pitch in futsal is played on flat, smooth and non-abrasive surfaces, preferably wood or artificial material. Artificial turf is permitted only in exceptional cases, and never at the international level.

=== Referees ===

*'''Number of Referees''': In a regulation match, association football will generally have one referee and two assistant referees while futsal will have one referee and one "second" referee. The three-referee system in association football holds much clearer distinctions among the officiating team than the two-referee futsal system. 
[[File:Diagonal System of Control.svg|left|thumb|The diagonal system of control in association football.]]"Official" assistant Referees exist in higher level futsal matches, serving as replacement referees  and either third referees (generally overseeing substitutions and time-outs) or as timekeepers (keeping a record of the time and goals scored at the discretion of the referee.)

*'''Difference in Leadership Structure on Referee Teams''': In association football, determinations made within the duties of the assistant referees are subject the final decision of the referee. This is technically not the case in futsal, as the two referees are equal in everything outside of timekeeping and the decision to suspend or abandon a match. However, in practice, the second referee is considered subordinate to the "primary" referee and is expected to defer to their decisions whenever there is any conflict, comparable to the assistant referee/referee dynamic, although this is far more rare than in association football.
[[File:Assistant referee 15abr2007.jpg|thumb|An assistant referee in association football]]

*'''Referee Positioning''': In the three-referee system, the assistant referees are located along the right touch line of each team's attacking half, keeping in line with the second-to-last defender, the ball or the half line. Per what is known as the "Diagonal Control System," the referee's optimal position is in a location approximately equal to the two assistant referees and the ball that allows the referee to watch play so calls may be made if needed. Futsal referees move along the touch line up and down the width of the court, with one "leading" referee situated ahead of play and one "trailing" referee situated behind play, comparable to [[Basketball]]. Their positioning is also similar to that of assistant referees in association football, as they try to stay in line with the second to last defender or the ball, although unlike in association football, they are not set to stay with one half of the pitch.
*'''Referee Signals''': Association football assistant referees also hold flags to indicate calls. Futsal referees do not have flags, but make motions comparable to assistant referees to indicate when the ball is out of play.

=== Match duration ===
The duration of the match can vary depending on league variations. However, at the highest levels of play, both sports are separated into two standardized halves of equal time, allowing for extra time to be played at the referee's discretion to make up for any time wasted.

In futsal, that standardized time for each half is 20 minutes and in association football, the standardized time for each half is 45 minutes.

Also in futsal, teams are allowed to stop the clock once per half, something not allowed in association football.

=== Accumulated fouls ===
Unlike in association football, futsal keeps track of fouls that award a [[direct free kick]], also known as "accumulated foul."

Upon the sixth accumulated foul in a half and every accumulated foul after the sixth, the free kick is generally taken from what is known as the "second penalty mark,"

After the sixth accumulated foul, the [[Comparison of association football and futsal#Advantage.2FDisciplinary Sanctions.2FFouls.2FFree Kicks|advantage rule]] generally no longer applies, with referees granting an immediate free kick outside of very clear goal scoring opportunities.

If the infringement takes place in the attacking half of the pitch, the fouled player may take the free kick from the spot of the infringement or from the second penalty mark, which on a regulation futsal pitch is 10 metres from the goal (the penalty mark is six metres from the goal.)

Unlike a penalty kick, the goalkeeper is required only to stay 5 metres from the spot of the free kick and does not have to stay on the goal line until the ball is kicked. The player kicking the ball must also shoot at the goal and all other players must stay behind the ball until the ball is kicked.

=== Offside ===

In association football, a player is an offside position is they are beyond the half-line, beyond the second to last defender or beyond the ball at the moment when their teammate touches the ball, excluding when the teammate is engaged in a goal kick, throw-in, or corner kick.

They are committing an infringement if they are in an offside position and are interfering with an opponent, interfering with play or gaining an advantage from being in an offside position.

In futsal, there is no comparable offside rule, although a portion of the Laws of the Game is dedicated to indicating that there is no offside rule.

=== Restarts ===

*'''Defensive Goal Line Restarts/Touch Line Restarts''': The use of the foot on a [[Goal kick]] and the hands on [[Throw-in]] is reversed in futsal with the goal clearance and a kick-in.

:During play in futsal, if the attacking team sends the ball over the goal line, the goalkeeper restarts the ball through a goal clearance, where they throw the ball to another player outside of the penalty area. When either team sends the ball over the touch line in futsal, the other team kicks rather than throws the ball back into play in what is known as a kick-in.

*'''Speed of Restart''':With goal clearances, kick-ins, corner kicks, the ball must be put back into play within four seconds. Whenever the goalkeeper otherwise has possession of the ball in their own half, they also must give up possession of the ball within four seconds once they are ready to release the ball.

:Goalkeepers must release the ball within six seconds in association football, but this rule is often ignored as long as the goalkeeper is seen to be making "a sincere attempt to release" the ball.

===[[Substitute (association football)|Substitutions]]===
Although in both sports, the referee has discretion over which players can or cannot come into the pitch, but in futsal substitutions can happen during play provided that players come on and off the pitch simultaneously and through a designated area.

In association football, players must wait until a stoppage in play to enter the pitch, and then only after the referee has been advised of the substitution. Although there are many variations, at the highest levels of competition, generally three substitutions are allowed per side during a match.

===Penalty kick===
In football, the penalty kick is taken at a spot inside the center of the Penalty Area 12 yards from the goal, called the penalty mark.

In futsal, the first penalty mark is analogous to the penalty mark in football and is 6 metres  from the midpoint of the goalposts.

A '''cosmic ocean''' or '''celestial river''' is a [[mythology|mythological motif]] found in the mythology of many cultures and civilizations, representing the [[world]] or [[cosmos]] as enveloped by primordial waters.

In [[creation myths]], the primordial waters are often represented as originally having filled the entire universe, being the first source of the [[Pantheon (religion)|gods]] cosmos with the act of creation corresponding to the establishment of an inhabitable space separate from the enveloping waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lena |last=Stiessel |title=Skapelsemyter från hela världen |year=1995 |publisher=Almquist &amp; Wiksell |isbn=91-21-14467-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Frāxkard'' ({{lang-pal|plʾhwklt}}, [[Avestan]]: ''Vourukaša''; also called ''Warkaš'' in Middle Persian) is the name of the cosmic ocean.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fraxkard-&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Biblical creation|first creation story in the Bible]], there is only earth and water in a disorganized state: "''Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.''" (...). ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:2|HE}}.) The world is also created as a space inside of the water, and is hence surrounded of it, "''And God saith, `Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.' ''" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:6|HE}}).

[[File:Critica Botanica 1737.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|Title page of [[Carl Linnaeus]]'s ''Critica Botanica'' of 1737.]]
'''''Critica Botanica''''' ("Critique of botany", Leiden, July, 1737) was written by Swedish [[botanist]], [[physician]], [[zoologist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778). The book was published in Germany when Linnaeus was twenty-nine with a discursus by the botanist [[Johannes Browallius]] (1707–1755), bishop of Åbo. The first and only edition was published in July 1737 under the full title ''Critica botanica in qua nomina plantarum generica, specifica &amp; variantia examini subjiciuntur, selectoria confirmantur, indigna rejiciuntur; simulque doctrina circa denominationem plantarum traditur. Seu Fundamentorum botanicorum pars IV Accedit Johannis Browallii De necessitate historiae naturalis discursus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JHsZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT55&amp;dq=Critica+botanica&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=crlrTIa1EY-iuQPW1pDaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Full view and pdf download]&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus’s principles of botanical nomenclature were first expounded in ''[[Fundamenta Botanica]]'' ("Foundations of botany") of 1736 chapters VII to X which contained the aphorisms (principles) 210 to 324 that outlined the rules for the acceptance and formation of names. These were later elaborated, with numerous examples, in his ''Critica Botanica'' of 1737.  The practical application of these rules was soon seen in subsequent publications such as ''[[Flora Lapponica]]'' ("Flora of Lapland", 1737), ''[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]'' ("In honour of Clifford's garden", 1738),  and ''[[Flora Svecica]]'' ("Flora of Sweden", 1746). Together the ''Fundamenta'' and ''Critica'' summarised Linnaeus's thoughts on plant [[nomenclature]] and [[plant classification|classification]] which he later revised and elaborated in his ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'' of 1751.

In the ''Critica'' Linnaeus presented a series of rules which guided him in his own publications, established standards of procedure for his followers, and led him to discard on a grand scale the names used by his predecessors. Many of his canons have long since been disregarded, but they ensured that modern botanical nomenclature at least began with a series of well-formed, euphonious and convenient names.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1983, pp. 283–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Binomial nomenclature==
{{Main article|Binomial nomenclature}}
To understand the objectives of the ''Critica'' it is first necessary to appreciate the state of botanical nomenclature at the time of Linnaeus. In accordance with the provisions of the present-day [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] the starting point for the scientific names of plants effectively dates back to the list of species enumerated in Linnaeus’s ''Species Plantarum'', ed. 1, published 1 May 1753.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"&gt;Sprague, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Species Plantarum'' was, for European scientists, a comprehensive global [[Flora]] for its day, and by the 10th edition had reached over 3000 species.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"/&gt; Linnaeus had learned plant names as short descriptive phrases (polynomials) known as ''nomina specifica''.  Each time a new species was described the diagnostic phrase-names had to be adjusted, and lists of names, especially those including synonyms (alternative names for the same plant) became extremely unwieldy. Linnaeus’s solution was to associate with the generic name an additional single word, what he termed the ''nomen triviale'', to designate a species. Linnaeus emphasized that this was simply a matter of convenience, it was not to replace the diagnostic ''nomen specificum''. But over time the ''nomen triviale'' became the “real” name and the ''nomen specificum'' became the Latin “diagnosis” that must, according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, accompany the description of all new plant species: it was that part of the plant description distinguishing that particular species from all others.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"/&gt; Linnaeus did not invent the binomial system but he was the person who provided the theoretical framework that lead to its universal acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1217341 | author = Svenson, Henry K. | year = 1953 | title = Linnaeus and the Species Problem | jstor = 1217341| journal = Taxon | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 55–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second word of the binomial, the ''nomen triviale'' as Linnaeus called it, is now known as the ''specific epithet'' and the two words, the ''generic name'' and ''specific epithet'' together make up the ''species name''.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, George H.M. 1951. ''Taxonomy of Vascular Plants''. New York: Macmillan. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context of Linnaean publications==
{{Main article| Carl Linnaeus}}
[[File:Carl von Linné.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Carl Linnaeus]]  (1707–1778) who established the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system]] of [[plant nomenclature]].]]
''[[Systema Naturæ]]'' was Linnaeus’s early attempt to organise nature.&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1735. ''Systema naturae.'' Leiden: Theodor Haak.&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was published in 1735 and in it he outlines his ideas for the hierarchical classification of the natural world (the “system of nature”) by dividing it into the [[Animal|animal kingdom]] (''Regnum animale''), the [[Plantae|plant kingdom]] (''Regnum vegetabile'') and the "[[mineral|mineral kingdom]]" (''Regnum lapideum'') each of which he further divided into classes, orders, genera and species, with [generic] characters, [specific] differences, synonyms, and places of occurrence. The tenth edition of this book in 1758 has been adopted as the starting point for [[zoological nomenclature]].&lt;ref name="Linn1758"&gt;{{cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema Naturae. |publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii) |year=1758 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |accessdate=2008-09-22 |language=Latin |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of 1735 was just eleven pages long, but this expanded with further editions until the final thirteenth edition of 1767 had reached over 3000 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1758. ''Systema naturae.'' Ed. 10. 2 vols. Stockholm: L. Salvius.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early eighteenth century colonial expansion and exploration created a demand for the description of thousands of new organisms. This highlighted difficulties in communication about plants, the replication of descriptions, and the importance of an agreed way of presenting, publishing and applying plant names. From about 1730 when Linnaeus was in his early twenties and still in Uppsala, Sweden, he planned a listing all the genera and species of plants known to western science in his day.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsell, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this could be achieved he needed to establish the principles of classification and nomenclature on which these works were to be based.&lt;ref&gt;Uggla, Arvid H. 1953. "The Preparation of the Species Plantarum." ''Taxon'' '''2'''(3): 60-62. p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''We can never hope for a lasting peace and better times till Botanists come to an agreement among themselves about the fixed laws in accordance with which judgment can be pronounced on names.''&lt;ref&gt;Hort, p. xxiii. (Preface)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Dutch period===
From 1735 to 1738 Linnaeus worked in the Netherlands where he was personal physician to [[George Clifford III|George Clifford]] (1685–1760) a wealthy Anglo-Dutch merchant–banker with the [[Dutch East India Company]] who had an impressive garden containing four large glasshouses that were filled with tropical and sub-tropical plants collected overseas. Linnaeus was enthralled by these collections and prepared a detailed systematic catalogue of the plants in the garden, which he published in 1738 as ''Hortus Cliffortianus''. It was during this exceptionally productive period of his life that he published the works that were to lay the foundations for biological nomenclature. These were ''Fundamenta Botanica'' (1736) ("Foundations of botany"),&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1736. ''Fundamenta botanica.'' Amsterdam: Solomon Schouten.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]'' ("Botanical bibliography", 1736), and ''Critica Botanica'' (1737)&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1737. ''Critica botanica.'' Leiden: Conrad Wishoff.&lt;/ref&gt; He soon put his theoretical ideas into practice in his ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' ("Genera of plants", 1737),&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1737. ''Genera plantarum.'' Leiden: Conrad Wishoff.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Flora Lapponica]]'' (1737), ''[[Classes Plantarum]]'' ("Plant classes", 1738),&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1738. ''Classes plantarum.'' Leiden: Conrad Wishoff.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hortus Cliffortianus'' (1738). The ideas he explored in these works were revised until, in 1751, his mature thinking was finally published as ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]''&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1751. ''Philosophia botanica.'' Stockholm: R. Kiesewetter; Amsterdam: Z. Chatelain.&lt;/ref&gt; ("Science of botany") released simultaneously in Stockholm and Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species plantarum===
{{Main article|Species Plantarum}}
With the foundations of plant nomenclature and classification now in place Linnaeus then set about the monumental task of describing all the plants known in his day and, with the publication of ''[[Species Plantarum]]''&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Carl. 1753. ''Species plantarum.'' 2 vols. Stockholm: L. Salvius.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1753, his ambitions of the 1730s were finally accomplished. ''Species Plantarum'' was his most acclaimed work and a summary of all his botanical knowledge. Here was a global Flora that codified the usage of morphological terminology and acted as a bibliography of all the pre-Linnaean botanical literature of scientific importance. It presented his new 'sexual system' of plant classification and became the starting point for scientific botanical nomenclature for 6000 of the 10,000 species he estimated made up the world’s flora. Here too, for the first time, the species, rather than the genus, becomes the fundamental taxonomic unit. Linnaeus defined species as " ... ''all structures in nature that do not owe their shape to the conditions of the growth place and other occasional features''.”  There was also the innovation of the now familiar ''nomen triviale'' (pl. ''nomina trivialia'') of the binary name although Linnaeus still regarded the real names as the ''differentiae specificae'' or “phrase names” which embodied the diagnosis for the species – although be was eventually to regard the trivial name (specific epithet) as one of his great inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Sketches of the book are known from 1733 and the final effort resulted in his temporary collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Jørgensen, pp. 81–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamenta, Critica and Philosophia===
{{Main article|Philosophia Botanica}}
The ''Fundamenta Botanica'' (“The Foundations of Botany”) of 1736 consisted of 365 aphorisms (principles) with principles 210–324 devoted to nomenclature. He followed this form of presentation in his other work on nomenclature. Linnaeus apparently regarded these as  a “grammar and a syntax” for the study of botany.&lt;ref&gt;Ekedahl, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapters VII to X comprised principles 210 to 324 to do with the nomenclature of genera, species and varieties and how to treat synonyms. The ''Critica Botanica'' was an extension of these nomenclatural chapters of the ''Fundamenta''. ''Critica Botanica'' which was published a year later in July 1737, the principles of the ''Fundamenta'' are repeated essentially unchanged but with extensive additions in smaller print.&lt;ref&gt;Morton p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this work, with its dogmatic, often amusing and provocative statements, that was to spread his ideas and enthrall intellects of the stature of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, dismissive of botanical work other than taxonomy and presented his principles as dogma rather than reasoned argument.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

These works established ground rules in a field which, at this time, had only “gentlemen's agreements”. Conventions such as: no two genera should have the same name; no universally agreed mechanisms. ''Genera Plantarum'' ran to five editions, the first in 1737 containing short descriptions of the 935 plant genera known at that time. Observing his own principle to keep generic names as short, euphonious, distinctive and memorable as possible he rejected many names that had gone before, including those of his fellow botanists which was not popular. In their place he used names that commemorated patrons, friends and fellow botanists as well as many names taken from Greek and Roman mythology.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1971, p. 246"&gt;Stearn 1971, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English translation of some principles==
By far the most important section of the ''Critica'' is that dealing with generic names – here we clearly see the forces shaping the present-day provisions of the ''Botanical Code''.&lt;ref name="Sprague, p. 41"/&gt; In the ''Philosophia Botanica'' § 159 Linnaeus had stated that a genus of plants was a group of species possessing similarly constructed organs of fructification, i.e. flowers and fruits, and hence distinguishable by these from other genera.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1971, p. 246"/&gt;
Some examples of the aphorisms (principles) concerned with genera are given below:

:§ 213 All those plants which belong to one genus must be designated by the same generic name.
::''Quaecunque plantae genere conveniunt, eodem nomine generico designandae sunt''.
:§ 214 All those plants which belong to different genera must be designated by different generic names.
::''Quaecunque, e contrario, plantae genere differunt, diverso nomine generico designandae sunt.''
:§ 217 If one and the same generic name has been adopted to designate two different genera, it will have to be banished from one of the positions which it occupies.
::''Nominum genericum unum idemque, ad diversa designandum genera assumtum, altero loco excludendum erit.''
:§ 228 Generic names with a similar sound lead to confusion.
::''Nominum Genericorum terminatio &amp; Sonus, quantity fieri possit, facilitanda sunt.''
:§ 238 The pronunciation of the name should be made as easy as possible.
::''Nomina Generica Sesquipedalia, enunciatu difficilia, vel nausepsa, fugienda sunt.''
:§ 247 Greek generic names are to be written in Latin characters.
::''Nomina Generica Greaca Latinis literis pingenda sunt.''

Linnaeus considered that generic names should be apt in meaning, pleasant to hear, easy to say, and not more than 12 letters long.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He advocates the use of commemorative personal names as botanical names, quoting his own name as an example:

{{cquote|''it is commonly believed that the name of a plant which is derived from that of a botanist shows no connection between the two ... ''[but]''  ...  ''Linnaea'' was named by the celebrated ''[[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Gronovius]]'' and is a plant of Lapland, lowly, insignificant, disregarded, flowering but for a brief space — after Linnaeus who resembles it.''&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Stafleu, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And in relation to specific names:
:§ 225 A plant is completely named when it is furnished with a generic and specific name.
:§ 256 The specific name should distinguish the plant from all others of the same genus.
:§ 258 The specific name will identify the plant which bears it at the first glance, since it expresses the differentia which is imprinted on the plant itself.

==Historical assessment==
Linnaeus's system of classification follows the principles of Aristotelian logic by which arranging subjects into classes is classification; distinguishing divisions of classes is logical division. The group to be divided is the genus; the parts into which it is divided are the species. The terms genus and species acquired their specialized biological usage from Linnaeus's predecessors, in particular [[John Ray|Ray]] and [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]].&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the question of whether plants should a) be put together or separated because they conform to a definition ([[essentialism]]) or b) put together with plants having similar characteristics generally, regardless of the definition ([[empiricism]]). Linnaeus was inclined to take the first approach using the Method of Logical Division&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Another example of Aristotelian logic is the ''Law of Excluded Middle'' (everything is either A or not A) used as the basis for dichotomous keys used in plant identification.&lt;/ref&gt; based on definition, what he called in ''Philosophia Botanica'' §152 the ''dispositio theoretica'' – but in practice he employed both methods.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical historian Alan Morton, though praising Linnaeus’s contribution to classification and nomenclature, is less complimentary about the theoretical ideas expressed in the publications discussed above:

{{cquote| ''Linnaeus was the master of the botany of his time, and his influence on the development of botanical science powerful and lasting … his work demonstrated the success of his improved methods of description, diagnosis and nomenclature, and made detailed systematic observation the guide and criterion in taxonomy. ... In his theoretical ideas, on the contrary, Linnaeus was a man of the past who never escaped from the restricting circle of idealist-essentialist thought in which his early high school training had confined him. This was the background to the contradictory statements in the ''Philosophia'', to his narrow view of botany, his blindness to the advances in plant physiology and anatomy, [and] his unquestioning acceptance of special creation.''&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Linnaean historian, chronicler, and analyst [[Frans Stafleu]] points out that Linnaeus's training and background was scholastic. He excelled in logic ..."''which was almost certainly the [[Organon|Aristotelian]] and [[Thomism|Thomistic logic]]  generally taught in secondary schools all over Europe''".:&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Linnaeus's methods were based on philosophical principles and logical a priori assumptions which gradually lost their relevance to the natural sciences during the eighteenth century. Even so, the direct results of his work were salutary: descriptions were standardised, ranks fixed, names given according to precise rules and a classification proposed which permitted rapid and efficient storage and retrieval of taxonomic information. No wonder that much of what Linnaeus proposed stood the test of time. The designation of species by binary names which have the character of code designations is only one element out of many which show the profound practicality underlying Linnaeus's activities and publications''.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Linnaeus's philosophical approach to classification is also noted by botanist David Frodin who observed that applying the ''methodus naturalis'' to books and people as well as plants, animals and minerals, was a mark of Linnaeus's ‘scholastic’ view of the world:

{{cquote| ''Most subsequent [to Linnaeus's ''Bibliotheca Botanica''] classifications of botanical literature, including geographical entities, would be more or less empirically based highlighting a recurrent conflict between essentialism, empiricism, [[nominalism]] and other doctrines in the theory and practice of any kind of classification''.&lt;ref&gt;Frodin, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, Linnaean scholar [[William T. Stearn]] has summarised Linnaeus's contribution to biology as follows:
{{cquote|''By the introduction of his binomial system of nomenclature Linnaeus gave plants and animals an essentially Latin nomenclature like vernacular nomenclature in style but linked to published, and hence relatively stable and verifiable, scientific concepts and thus suitable for international use. This was his most important contribution to biology.''&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1959, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Dallay''' is a French [[Philately|philatelic]] editor established in [[Paris]]. Dallay has published [[stamp catalog]]s since 2001.

The catalogs list [[postage stamp]]s issued by [[France]] and other francophone areas:  [[metropolitan France]], [[French overseas departments and territories|French overseas territories]], French post in [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]]. In late 2005, Dallay published a catalog for the French former colonial empire.

The catalogs provide detailed information about the stamps, such as, stamp designers' names, postal use at the time of issue, etc.

In 2004, Dallay was convicted by a court of justice of [[forgery]] and unfair competition for the use of [[Yvert]] numbering system which was first used in 1895.  In March 2005, after arbitration by the French ''Conseil de la Concurrence'' (Competition Commission), [[Yvert et Tellier]] began to license the right to print an index of Yvert stamp numbers at the back of competitors' catalogs. Dallay began using the index starting with the 2005-2006 edition.

The '''Federal Records Act of 1950''' is a [[United States federal law]] enacted in 1950. It provides the legal framework for federal [[records management]], including record creation, maintenance, and disposition.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;Richard J. Cox, ''Closing an Era: Historical Perspectives on Modern Archives and Records Management'' (Greenwood: 2000), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Federal Records Act came following the recommendations of the [[Hoover Commission]] (1947-49).&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; The act, and its related [[federal regulation|regulations]], require each [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agency]] to establish an ongoing program for records management and to cooperate with the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA).&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; A 1985 NARA pamphlet describes the Federal Records Act as the "basis for the Federal Government's policies and procedures for creating, maintaining, and disposing of Federal records. The act and its related regulations define Federal records, mandate the creation and preservation of those records necessary to document Federal activities, establish Government ownership of records, and provide the exclusive legal procedures for the disposition of records."&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;  The [[Hoover Commission|Second Hoover Commission]] (1953-55) addressed paperwork management and recommended the adoption of program relating to "directives management, reports management, paperwork quality control, and clerical work measurement."  As a result, the first ''Guide to Record Retention Requirements'' was published in 1955; the guide is updated annually and is used by [[archivist]]s and other record managers both in and out of government.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

The Federal Records Act was amended over time. Amendments in 1976 emphasized paperwork reduction and [[information lifecycle management]].&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; The [[Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980]], which followed the issuance of the report of the Commission on Federal Paperwork in 1977, introduced information resources management and gave responsibility to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] for creating federal information policy standards.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

In November 2014, the [[Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014]] was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="NARA2014"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2015/nr15-23.html National Archives Welcomes Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014] (press release), [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (December 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GovExec"&gt;Charles S. Clark, [http://www.govexec.com/technology/2014/12/obama-signs-modernized-federal-records-act/100112/ Obama Signs Modernized Federal Records Act], Government Executive (December 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This bipartisan act, which followed the 2011 President's Memorandum on Managing Government Records, modernizes the Federal Records Act.&lt;ref name="NARA2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GovExec"/&gt; The act expressly expands the definition of federal records to include electronic records (the first change to the definition of "Federal record" since the enactment of the act in 1950).&lt;ref name="NARA2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GovExec"/&gt; The act also grants the [[Archivist of the United States]] the final determination as to what constitutes a Federal record; "authorizes the early transfer of permanent electronic federal and presidential records to the National Archives, while legal custody remains with the agency or the president"; "clarifies the responsibilities of federal government officials when using non-government email systems"; and "empowers the National Archives to safeguard original and classified records from unauthorized removal."&lt;ref name="NARA2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GovExec"/&gt;

Harry Schultz was born in 1923&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Oracle of the right", ''The Times'', 14 October 1968, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Milwaukee]], United States. He served in the United States Army during the Second World War when he was stationed in Shanghai and began to trade shares on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]]. He discovered that he could make money even in a foreign environment: "I bought and sold silk, bank shares, currency and made a small fortune (very small) in a high inflation economy. I also bought and sold gold coins and bars."&lt;ref name=origins&gt;[http://www.geocities.ws/capitolhill/9022/pthist.html The Origins of PT: An Interview With Harry Schultz.] The Libertarian Library. Retrieved 4 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newspaper career==
As a child he had produced a newspaper for his family, neighbours and school using a typewriter and later a [[mimeograph machine]]. In the army, he read voraciously and planned to buy a real newspaper on his discharge with the money he had made from trading. He managed to accumulate enough for a down-payment on a weekly newspaper in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California, which he turned into a daily and sold to ''The Sun''.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybell.com/exclusive-interviews/anthony-wile-harry-schultz-on-the-power-elite-free-markets-the-internet-and-why-gold-is-going-much-higher/ Harry Schultz on the Power Elite, Free Markets, the Internet and Why Gold Is Going Much Higher.]  Anthony Wile, ''The Daily Bell'', 11 July 2010. Retrieved 2 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He owned a further twelve newspapers during his involvement with that business, specialising in buying small papers, improving them and selling them on.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

==Writing==
Schultz published ''The International Harry Schultz Letter'' for 45 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/harry-schultz-last-investment-testament-2011-01-10 Harry Schultz’s last testament.] ''MarketWatch'', 10 January 2011. Retrieved 4 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; starting around 1963.&lt;ref name=futures/&gt; It was known for its somewhat folksy and eccentric tone. Readers were said by ''[[The Times]]'' in 1968 to include [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Richard Nixon]],&lt;ref name=times/&gt; while ''[[New Internationalist]]'' magazine in 1981 named [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Sir Keith Joseph]], South African finance minister [[Owen Horwood]] and Saudi Arabian oil minister [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]] as readers.&lt;ref name=NewInt/&gt; In addition to his newsletter, Schultz is known for his advice on investing in [[bear markets]] which he first wrote about in his 1964 book, ''Bear markets: how to survive and make money in them''. He expanded on his ideas of profiting from adversity in his 1972 book, ''Panics &amp; crashes and how you can make money out of them''. His 1964 book was reprinted and updated in 2002 as ''Bear market investing strategies''.&lt;ref name=futures&gt;"Review: ''Bear Market Investing Strategies''" by Leslie N. Masonson, ''Futures'', 32.1 (January 2003), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470847026.html ''Bear Market Investing Strategies''.] Wiley. Retrieved 2 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the most highly paid investment consultant in the world and, according to Schultz, he was the model for the character of Lewis Dorsey in [[Arthur Hailey]]'s bestselling novel ''[[The Moneychangers]]'', who also writes a financial newsletter.&lt;ref name=hsl/&gt;

==Libertarianism and political views==
Schultz has been associated with the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] movement and has written a guide to using Swiss banks. He is credited with inventing the [[Three Flags Theory]] which proposes that everyone should have a second passport, an address in a [[tax haven]] and that their assets should be kept outside their home country. According to ''[[New Internationalist]]'' magazine, he was one of the trustees of the [[Phoenix Foundation]] which unsuccessfully attempted to establish small libertarian states in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=NewInt&gt;[https://newint.org/features/1981/07/01/phoenix/ Ashes To Ashes.] ''New Internationalist'', July 1981. Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he produced ''On re-making the world: Cut nations down to size'', which argued that there were too many large and inefficiently run nations in the word and that they should be broken up to encourage peace, prosperity and better government.&lt;ref name=hsl&gt;[http://www.hsletter.com/Harry_index.html Who is Harry Schultz?] hsletter.com Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often gloomy about the future, Schultz, has advocated a return to the [[gold standard]] and sound money. In 1982, ''[[The Observer]]'' said that his "record as a prophet of doom is probably second to none" and reported that a group known as the Friends of Harry Schultz had met in Cannes to plan for upcoming trouble by "establishing alternative identities (with appropriate passports), building nuclear shelters, setting up their own bank, learning to fly their own planes, and sail their own boats, locating isolated hide-outs, and assembling survival kits".&lt;ref&gt;"Harry-consultant in apocalypses", Lararna Sullivan, ''The Observer'', 25 April 1982, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1975, it was reported that Schultz was engaged to Princess Sonia Shirinsky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/princess-sonia-shirinsky? Princess Sonia Shirinsky Pictures and Images.] gettyimages Retrieved 3 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scandinavian mythology]], '''Huld''' is only referenced by ''[[völva]]'' or ''seiðkona'', that is a woman who practiced the [[seiðr]]. She is mentioned in the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', ''[[Sturlunga|Sturlunga saga]]'' and a late medieval Icelandic tale.&lt;ref name="huld"&gt;The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfbk/0659.html Huld]'' in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter source, she is [[Odin]]'s mistress and the mother of the demi-goddesses [[Þorgerðr Hölgebrúðr and Irpa|Þorgerðr and Irpa]].&lt;ref name="huld"/&gt; As her name suggests, Huld may be in origin the same being as the [[Huldra]] and the German [[Holda]].&lt;ref name="huld"/&gt;

==Attestations==
In the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' it is related that she was first hired to kill the Swedish king [[Vanlade]], by his wife Drífa. She "[[Mara (folklore)|hag-rode]]" him to death.

Vanlandi hét son Svegðis, er ríki tók eptir hann ok réð fyrir Uppsala auð; hann var hermaðr mikill, ok hann fór víða um lönd. Hann þá vetrvist á Finnlandi með Snjá hinum gamla, ok fékk þar dóttur hans Drífu. En at vári fór hann á brott, en Drífa var eptir, ok hét hann at koma aptr á þriggja vetra fresti; en hann kom eigi á 10 vetrum. Þá sendi Drífa eptir Huld seiðkonu, en sendi Vísbur, son þeirra Vanlanda, til Svíþjóðar. Drífa keypti at Huld seiðkonu, at hon skyldi síða Vanlanda til Finnlands, eða deyða hann at öðrum kosti. En er seiðr var framiðr, þá var Vanlandi at Uppsölum; þá gerði hann fúsan at fara til Finnlands, en vinir hans ok ráðamenn bönnuðu honum, ok sögðu at vera mundi fjölkyngi Finna í farfýsi hans. Þá gerðist honum svefnhöfugt, ok lagðist hann till svefns. En er hann hafði lítt sofnat, kallaði hann ok sagði, at mara trað hann. Menn hans fóru til ok vildu hjálpa honum; en er þeir tóku uppi til höfuðsins, þá trað hon fótleggina, svá at nær brotnuðu; þá tóku þeir til fótanna, þá kafði hon höfuðit, svá at þar dó hann. Svíar tóku lík hans, ok var hann brendr við á þá er Skúta heitir. Þar váru settir bautasteinar hans.&lt;ref name="Yngl"&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20070508153342/http://www.heimskringla.no/original/heimskringla/ynglingasaga.php ''Ynglinga saga'' at ''Norrøne Tekster og Kvad'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanlande, Swegde's son, succeeded his father, and ruled over the
[[Uppsala öd|Upsal domain]]. He was a great warrior, and went far around in
different lands. Once he took up his winter abode in [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]]
with [[Snær|Snae the Old]], and got his daughter Driva in marriage; but in
spring he set out leaving Driva behind, and although he had
promised to return within three years he did not come back for
ten. Then Driva sent a message to the [[völva|witch]] Huld; and sent
[[Visbur]], her son by Vanlande, to [[Sweden]]. Driva bribed the witch-wife Huld, either that she should bewitch Vanlande to return to
Finland, or kill him. When this witch-work was going on Vanlande
was at [[Gamla Uppsala|Upsal]], and a great desire came over him to go to Finland;
but his friends and counsellors advised him against it, and said
the [[seiðr|witchcraft]] of the Finn people showed itself in this desire of
his to go there. He then became very drowsy, and laid himself
down to sleep; but when he had slept but a little while he cried
out, saying that the [[Mara (folklore)|Mara]] was treading upon him. His men
hastened to him to help him; but when they took hold of his head
she trod on his legs, and when they laid hold of his legs she
pressed upon his head; and it was his death. The Swedes took his
body and burnt it at a river called Skytaa, where a [[standing stone]] was raised over him.&lt;ref name="Laing ISTA"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm Laing's translation at the Internet Sacred Text Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laing N3"&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/001_03.php Laing's translation at Northvegr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312204129/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/001_03.php |date=2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later she was hired by Vanlade's grandchildren to kill his son [[Visbur]].

Visbur succeeded his father Vanlande. He married the daughter of
[[Auðr (mythological character)|Aude the Rich]], and gave her as her bride-gift three large farms,
and a gold ornament. They had two sons, Gisle and Ond; but
Visbur left her and took another wife, whereupon she went home to
her father with her two sons. Visbur had a son who was called
Domald, and his stepmother used [[seiðr|witchcraft]] to give him ill-luck.
Now, when Visbur's sons were the one twelve and the other
thirteen years of age, they went to their father's place, and
desired to have their mother's dower; but he would not deliver it
to them. Then they said that the gold ornament should be the
death of the best man in all his clan, and they returned home. 
Then they began again with enchantments and witchcraft, to try if
they could destroy their father. The [[völva|sorceress]] Huld said that by
witchcraft she could bring it about by this means, that a
murderer of his own kin should never be wanting in the Yngling
clan; and they agreed to have it so. Thereafter they collected
men, came unexpectedly in the night on Visbur, and burned him in
his house.&lt;ref name="Laing ISTA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laing N3"/&gt;

It is said in ''[[Sturlunga|Sturlunga saga]]'' that [[Sturla Þórðarson]] entertained King [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnús lagabœtir]] with a story about Huld in 1263, which he told "better and more cleverly than any of those present had heard before" (''betr ok fróðligar en nokkurr þeira hafði fyrr heyrt, er þar váru''). According to Sturlunga saga, the story was about a great [[troll]]-woman and was well received by the king's followers and by the queen; it took a good part of the day to tell.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wPsqAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA304,M1 Sturlunga saga] at Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Baconian method}}
{{primary sources|date=January 2011}}
'''''Idola theatri''''' (singular '''''Idolum theatri''''') is a type of tendency towards logical [[fallacy]] or error, normally translated as "'''Idols of the Theatre'''." The [[Latin]] was coined by Sir [[Francis Bacon]] in his ''[[Novum Organum]]''&amp;mdash;one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of [[modern science]]. Bacon described them as "Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various [[dogma]]s of philosophies, and also from wrong laws of [[demonstration (proof)|demonstration]]." He named them Idols of the Theater "because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage plays, representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion."&lt;ref name=xliv&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Book I, Aphorism XLIV&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is one of four such "idols," that represent "idols and false notions" that are "in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Book I, Aphorism XXXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the Idola theatri is the most avoidable, being caused by particular historical situations, such as when there is a lot of interest in religion, and no strong monarch to repress such discussion.

Besides ''idola theatri'', there are also ''[[idola tribus]]'' (Idols of the Tribe, stemming from [[human nature]] itself), ''[[idola specus]]'', (Idols of the cave, stemming from a person's particular tendencies), and ''[[idola fori]]'' (Idols of the Market Place, coming from the influence of our human language and its usages).

==Bacon's explanation==
According to Howard B. White:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the famous discussion of the four idols, Bacon says that only one kind, the Idols of the Theater, are not innate; nor do they steal "into the understanding secretly." Therefore, they, at least, can be removed.(N.O. I,61) Since, alone among all the idols, they are created by philosophical systems, alone, among all the idols, they may be removed by philosophical systems. Obviously, the principal idol of the theater to Bacon was Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Peace Among the Willows: The Political Philosophy of Francis Bacon| first=Howard B. |last=White| page=18|year=1968| publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQOxaOn1HzIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Aristotle was not the only example for Bacon, who wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor is it only of the systems now in vogue, or only of the ancient sects and philosophies, that I speak; for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth; seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike. Neither again do I mean this only of entire systems, but also of many principles and axioms in science, which by tradition, credulity, and negligence have come to be received.&lt;ref name=xliv/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerning the number of variations of this type, Bacon says furthermore:&lt;blockquote&gt;Idols of the Theater, or of Systems, are many, and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more. For were it not that now for many ages men's minds have been busied with religion and theology; and were it not that civil governments, especially monarchies, have been averse to such novelties, even in matters speculative; so that men labor therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes — not only unrewarded, but exposed also to contempt and envy — doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like those which in great variety flourished once among the Greeks. For as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed, so likewise (and more also) many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy. And in the plays of this philosophical theater you may observe the same thing which is found in the theater of the poets, that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant, and more as one would wish them to be, than true stories out of history.&lt;ref name=LXII&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Book I, Aphorism LXII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, he distinguished three types for special attention:&lt;ref name=LXII/&gt;

*The Rational or Sophistical School of philosophers "snatches from experience a variety of common instances, neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed, and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit." The most conspicuous example of this type, says Bacon, was [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Book I, Aphorism LXIII&lt;/ref&gt;
*A second "Empirical" class of philosophers "who, having bestowed much diligent and careful labor on a few experiments, have thence made bold to educe and construct systems, wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith." As examples, Bacon mentions the chemists or [[alchemists]] of his day and [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s work on magnets.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Book I, Aphorism LXVI&lt;/ref&gt;
*A third class, a Superstitious type, "consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions; among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii." Bacon said that [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]] were striking examples of this problem. From "this unwholsome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Book I, Aphorism LXV&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon said that, in his time, the last type, the superstitious, was most common, and did the most harm.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Novum Organum]]'', Book I, Aphorism LXI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Superstition]] was the subject of one of Bacon's well-known [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]], and as Howard B White points out, Bacon made it clear that he considered [[Catholicism]], for example, to be a form of Christian superstition, and that he felt atheism to be superior to superstition. But "while the classics also regarded superstition as at variance with philosophy" they did not "regard it as necessary or desirable to wage an onslaught against existing superstition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Peace Among the Willows: The Political Philosophy of Francis Bacon| first=Howard B. |last=White|year=1968| publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQOxaOn1HzIC}}, pages, 73, 74, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Igziabeher''' (Amharic: እግዚአብሔር /əgzi'abəher/) means literally "Lord of a nation or tribe", i.e. God, in the Ethiopic or [[Ge'ez language]], as well as modern Ethiosemitic languages including Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AmharicDictionary|title=God|url=http://www.amharicdictionary.com/index.aspx?EnglishText=God&amp;SearchEnglish=Search&amp;AmharicText=|publisher=SelamSoft|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Igziabeher'' in Ge'ez is composed of ''`əgzi'' (Lord or ruler), plus a euphonic -'a added to the vowel to signify the possessive construct (i.e., "ruler ''of''"), followed by ''bihier'' ("nation, tribe (Today, bihier, when directly translated into English, means tribe)"). Another, more generic Ethiopic word meaning "god" (including the deities of any other religion) is አምላክ (''`amlak'').

''Igziabeher'' is also used within the [[Rastafari movement]] as a name of [[Jah]] (God). It may be heard in the [[reggae]] music of prominent artists such as [[Peter Tosh]] (who recorded a song named "Igziabeher (Let Jah Be Praised)" on his album ''[[Legalize It]]''), [[The Abyssinians]], [[Third World (band)|Third World]],[[Midnite]] and many others.

In the fourth century, King Ezana ruled a large part of modern day Ethiopia.  He worshipped several gods called Beher, Meder, and Astar.  Igziabeher is possibly a variant of the name Beher. (2), (3), (4).

'''Jeanne Marie Thérèse Vandier d'Abbadie''' (1899–1977) was a French [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]].

Born in Paris in 1899, Vandier d'Abbadie studied at the [[École du Louvre]] under the Egyptologist and [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] [[Charles Boreaux]]. She then went on to the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] and the [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo Museum of Antiquities]], developing a specialism in [[archaeological illustration]]. Between 1932 and 1936, she and her husband, Egyptologist [[Jacques Vandier]], excavated tombs around the ancient Egyptian village of [[Deir el-Medina|Deir el-Medineh]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]], under the auspices of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale]]. On the basis of this work Vandier d'Abbadie published a volume on the [[TT8|tomb of Kha]], and produced illustrations for several other volumes stemming from the expedition.

Returning to Paris in 1939, Vandier d'Abbadie and her mentor Charles Boreux moved the [[Louvre|Louvre's]] Egyptian collections outside of the city for safekeeping for the duration of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After the war she continued her work in Egyptology, contributing articles to both scholarly journals and art magazines, as well as assisting her husband, who had taken up Boreux's position as conservator at the Louvre. In 1963 she published a biography of Egyptologist and artist [[Nestor L'Hôte]].

Vandier d'Abbadie died in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in 1977. She spent the final years of her life editing and publishing the unfinished work of her husband, who had died four years earlier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7014">[[File:Johannes Cornelis de Jonge (1793-1853).jpg|thumb|250px|Bust of jhr. J.C. de Jonge]]
[[Jonkheer|Jhr]]. '''Johannes Cornelis de Jonge''' (9 May 1793 in [[Zierikzee]]&amp;nbsp;– 12 June 1853 in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ''Rijksarchivaris'' (Chief Archivist of the [[Nationaal Archief|Dutch National Archives]]), historian, and politician. He is best known for his encyclopedic ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Zeewezen'', a naval history of the Netherlands that was based on the Dutch naval archives, a large part of which were destroyed in a fire in the archives of the[[Koninklijke Marine|Dutch Department of the Navy]] in 1844. By default therefore this history had to come in the place of the lost primary documents.

==Personal life==
De Jonge was born in an old "patrician" family of [[Zeeland]] notables (his ancestor [[Bonifacius de Jonge]] had been [[Grand pensionary|''Raadpensionaris'']] of Zeeland from 1615 to 1625&lt;ref&gt;Holtrop, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;), for which reason he and his family received the aristocratic title of [[Jonkheer]], when king [[William I of the Netherlands]] reorganized the Dutch aristocracy in 1814. He was the son of Willem Adriaan de Jonge van Campens Nieuwland and Cornelia Petronella Mogge Pous.&lt;ref&gt;Brugmans, p. 816&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy he was already interested in history, and he was instrumental in saving a number of medieval Zeeland [[charter]]s from being auctioned off in 1810 by the [[First French Empire|French]] authorities in his native city of Zierikzee. This brought him to the attention of [[Hendrik van Wijn]], the first archivist of the [[Batavian Republic]], who became the first ''Rijksarchivaris'' in the new [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1814, and nominated de Jonge as his deputy in that year. Meanwhile, de Jonge was pursuing his studies in jurisprudence and history at [[Leiden University]], and as a member of the ''studentenweerbaarheid'' (student militia) he took part in the [[Waterloo Campaign: Waterloo to Paris (25 June – 1 July)|Waterloo campaign]] with the Dutch army.&lt;ref&gt;Holtrop, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Leiden he received his doctorate in law and history on 27 July 1816 with the doctoral thesis ''Diplomata quaedam Hollandica et Zelandica partim inedita partim emendata animadversionibus illustrata''.

He married Henrietta Philippina Jacoba van Kretschmar on 18 September 1816 with whom he had five children.&lt;ref&gt;Brugmans, p. 818&lt;/ref&gt; He died after suffering a stroke in his mansion ''Huize Zuidhoorn'' near [[Rijswijk]]/The Hague in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Holtrop, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He was appointed ''substituut'' (deputy) ''Rijksarchivaris'' in March 1814. In 1816 he was also appointed superintendent of the ''Koninklijk Kabinet van Munten, Penningen en Gesneden Stenen'' (Royal Dutch [[Numismatics|Numismatic]] Collection). In both offices he promoted the accessibility of the collections of archival sources  and coins by publishing catalogs. He wrote a large number of historical publications and published facsimile publications of historical documents, in which he used his direct access to the archives.&lt;ref&gt;Holtrop, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, after the death of his mentor Van Wijn, he himself was appointed ''Rijksarchivaris''. In this period he wrote his ''magnum opus'' on the history of the Dutch navy: ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Zeewezen'' (6 volumes, between 1833 and 1848). In 1833 he obtained the original copy of the [[Union of Utrecht]] treaty for the National Archives from the [[National Library of the Netherlands|''Koninklijke Bibliotheek'']], and a large collection of original medieval charters that had previously been held in the Charter room of the [[County of Holland|County, later Province, of Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;Holtrop, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

De Jonge was also politically active. He was appointed a member of the [[Municipal council (Netherlands)|Municipal Council]] of The Hague in 1825. In that capacity he became editor of the ''Dagblad voor Zuid-Holland en 's-Gravenhage'' (the official publication of the city) in 1827. In 1844 he was elected ''[[College van burgemeester en wethouders|wethouder]]'' (alderman) of The Hague, which he remained till his death. He was also a member of the [[States-Provincial|''Provinciale Staten'']] of the province of [[South Holland]] between 1840 and 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Brugmans, p. 818&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Json2Ldap''' is a [[JSON]]-to-[[LDAP]] [[gateway (computer program)|gateway]] software, written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and developed by Nimbus Directory Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dzhuvinov.com/?p=791|title=Announcement of Nimbus Directory Services taking over Json2Ldap development}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a [[JSON-RPC]] 2.0 interface for [[web client]]s to access one or more [[LDAP]] v3 - compatible directories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/2010/071910id2.html|title=Network World, Security Identity Management Alert, 2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Json2Ldap [[web API]] supports the standard LDAP directory requests as well as several extended operations and controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connect2id.com/products/json2ldap/web-api|title=Json2Ldap web API}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Json2Ldap was initially conceived as a lightweight [[JSON]] alternative to existing [[Directory Service Markup Language|XML-based]] gateways for providing [[directory service]] access to [[web browser]]s. Its first official release was in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dzhuvinov.com/?p=96|title=Give your LDAP server a JSON front-end}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 development of the software was passed to Nimbus Directory Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dzhuvinov.com/?p=791|title=Announcement of Nimbus Directory Services taking over Json2Ldap development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface specification==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25590">The former colonial power, the [[Netherlands]], left an extensive vocabulary. These [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanwords, and also from other non Italo-Iberian, European languages loanwords which came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the [[schwa]]. For example, Dutch ''schroef'' {{IPA|[ˈsxruf]}} → ''sekrup'' {{IPA|[səˈkrup]}}. Many Indonesian vocabulary ending "-i" (e.g.:administras-i) also are known from the Dutch vocabulary influence "-ie" (e.g.:administrat-ie). All the months from January (Januari) to December (Desember) used in Indonesian are also derived from Dutch. It is estimated that 10,000 words in Indonesian language can be traced to the Dutch language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reference.com/browse/indonesian+language&lt;/ref&gt;

It was widely imitated and influential, affecting [[satire|satirical]] media, as well as the cultural landscape of the 20th century, with editor [[Al Feldstein]] increasing readership to more than two million during its 1974 circulation peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Winn, Marie |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0611F93E5F0C768EDDA80894D9484D81&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=childhood%20innocence&amp;st=cse |title=What Became of Childhood Innocence?|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 25, 1981|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 until 2018, ''Mad'' published 550 regular issues, as well as hundreds of reprint "Specials", original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. The magazine's numbering reverted to 1 with its June 2018 issue, coinciding with the magazine's headquarters move to the West Coast.

The magazine is the last surviving title from the [[EC Comics]] line, offering satire on all aspects of life and popular culture, politics, entertainment, and public figures. Its format is divided into a number of recurring segments such as TV and movie [[parody|parodies]], as well as freeform articles. ''Mad''{{'}}s mascot, [[Alfred E. Neuman]], is typically the focal point of the magazine's cover, with his face often replacing that of a celebrity or character who is lampooned within the issue.

==History==
{{Main|History of Mad|Harvey Kurtzman's editorship of Mad}}
[[File:Madhk1.jpg|thumb|[[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s cover for ''Mad'' #1 (Oct–Nov 1952)]]
[[File:Mad24.JPG|thumb|With issue 24 (July 1955), ''Mad'' switched to a magazine format. The "extremely important message" was "Please buy this magazine!"]]
''Mad'' began as a comic book published by [[EC Comics|EC]], debuting in August 1952 ([[cover date]] October–November), and located in lower Manhattan at 225 Lafayette Street. In the early 1960s, the ''Mad'' office moved to 485 [[Madison Avenue]], a location given in the magazine as "485 MADison Avenue".

The first issue was written almost entirely by [[Harvey Kurtzman]], and featured illustrations by Kurtzman, along with [[Wally Wood]], [[Will Elder]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], and [[John Severin]]. Wood, Elder, and Davis were the three main illustrators throughout the 23-issue run of the comic book.

To retain Kurtzman as its editor, the comic book converted to magazine format as of issue #24 (1955). The switchover only induced Kurtzman to remain for one more year, but crucially, the move had removed ''Mad'' from the strictures of the [[Comics Code Authority]].  After Kurtzman's departure in 1956, new editor Al Feldstein swiftly brought aboard contributors such as [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], [[Frank Jacobs]], and [[Mort Drucker]], and later [[Antonio Prohías]], [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]], and [[Sergio Aragonés]]. The magazine's circulation more than quadrupled during Feldstein's tenure, peaking at 2,132,655 in 1974; it later declined to a third of this figure by the end of his time as editor.&lt;ref name=slau&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ipfw.edu/slaubau/madcirc.htm|author= Slaubaugh, Mike|title=''Mad Magazine'' circulation figures|work=IPFW|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Feldstein retired in 1984, he was replaced by the team of [[Nick Meglin]] and [[John Ficarra]], who co-edited ''Mad'' for the next two decades. Following Meglin's retirement in 2004, Ficarra continued as executive editor for 13 years, until the publishing company announced in June 2017 that ''Mad'' would relocate to [[Burbank, California]]. [[Bill Morrison (comics)|Bill Morrison]] succeeded him in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-june-mad-magazine-names-new-editor-moving-1498488412-htmlstory.html|title='Mad' magazine appoints new editor, plans move to Burbank|date=June 26, 2017|access-date=November 17, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaines sold his company in the early 1960s to the [[Kinney Parking Company]], which also acquired [[DC Comics|National Periodicals]] (a.k.a. [[DC Comics]]) and [[Warner Bros.]] by the end of that decade. Gaines was named a Kinney board member, and was largely permitted to run ''Mad'' as he saw fit without corporate interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mad.htm |title=Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Mad magazine |website=Toonopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toonopedia.com/mad.htm |title=MAD : First appeared 1952 : Created by Harvey Kurtzmann |website=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66C0wdYPo?url=http://toonopedia.com/mad.htm |archivedate=March 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Gaines' death, ''Mad'' became more ingrained within the [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] (now WarnerMedia) corporate structure. Eventually, the magazine was obliged to abandon its long-time home at 485 Madison Avenue, and in the mid-1990s it moved into DC Comics' offices at the same time that DC relocated to 1700 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In 2001, the magazine broke its long-standing taboo and began running paid advertising. The outside revenue allowed the introduction of color printing and improved paper stock. ''Mad'' ended its 65-year run in Manhattan at the end of 2017, when its offices relocated to DC Entertainment headquarters in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tomrichmond.com/2017/12/12/new-york-is-mad-no-more/|title=Richmond Illustration Inc.|website=www.tomrichmond.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its earliest incarnation, new issues of the magazine appeared erratically, between four and seven times a year.  By the end of 1958, ''Mad'' had settled on an unusual eight-times-a-year schedule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=MAD|date=November 1958|volume=1|issue=42|page=1|publisher=E. C.

Gaines felt the atypical timing was necessary to maintain the magazine's level of quality. ''Mad'' then began producing additional issues, until it reached a traditional monthly schedule with the January 1997 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=MAD|date=December 1996|issue=352|page=2|publisher=E.

[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/sad-news-for-mad-fans "Sad News for Mad Fans"].

==Influence==
Though there are antecedents to ''Mad''{{'}}s style of humor in print, radio and film, ''Mad'' became a pioneering example of it. Throughout the 1950s, ''Mad'' featured groundbreaking parodies combining a sentimental fondness for the familiar staples of American culture—such as [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie]] and [[Superman]]—with a keen joy in exposing the fakery behind the image. Its approach was described by [[Dave Kehr]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "[[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]] and [[Ray Goulding]] on the radio, [[Ernie Kovacs]] on television, [[Stan Freberg]] on records, [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in the early issues of ''Mad'': all of those pioneering humorists and many others realized that the real world mattered less to people than the sea of sounds and images that the ever more powerful mass media were pumping into American lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1D7173EF933A1575BC0A9609C8B63 |last=Kehr|first= Dave|title=When Unmanly Men Met Womanly Women |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 20, 2006 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob and Ray]], Kovacs and Freberg all became contributors to ''Mad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madcoversite.com/ugoi-master.html|title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Mad Magazine Contributors - Master List|website=MadCoverSite.com|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Tony Hiss and Jeff Lewis wrote in ''The New York Times'' about the then 25-year-old publication's initial effect:

{{quote|The skeptical generation of kids it shaped in the 1950s is the same generation that, in the 1960s, opposed a war and didn't feel bad when the United States lost for the first time and in the 1970s helped turn out an Administration and didn't feel bad about that either... It was magical, objective proof to kids that they weren't alone, that in New York City on Lafayette Street, if nowhere else, there were people who knew that there was something wrong, phony and funny about a world of bomb shelters, brinkmanship and toothpaste smiles. ''Mad''{{'}}s consciousness of itself, as trash, as comic book, as enemy of parents and teachers, even as money-making enterprise, thrilled kids. In 1955, such consciousness was possibly nowhere else to be found. In a ''Mad'' parody, comic-strip characters knew they were stuck in a strip. "Darnold Duck," for example, begins wondering why he has only three fingers and has to wear white gloves all the time. He ends up wanting to murder every other Disney character. G.I. Schmoe tries to win the sexy Asiatic Red Army broad by telling her, "O.K., baby! You're all mine! I gave you a chance to hit me witta gun butt... But naturally, you have immediately fallen in love with me, since I am a big hero of this story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mikelynchcartoons.blogspot.com/2007/08/1977-ny-times-25-years-of-mad-magazine.html |title=Mike Lynch Cartoons: 1977 NY Times: 25 Years of Mad Magazine UPDATED |publisher=Mikelynchcartoons.blogspot.com |date=August 15, 2007 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Mad'' is often credited with filling a vital gap in political satire from the 1950s to 1970s, when [[Red Scare|Cold War paranoia]] and a general culture of censorship prevailed in the United States, especially in literature for teens. Activist [[Tom Hayden]] said, "My own radical journey began with ''Mad Magazine''."&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Jan (December 5, 2007).  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jan-herman/mad-magazine-tom-h_b_75438.html "MAD Magazine + Tom Hayden = SDS"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. Retrieved December 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of such factors as cable television and the Internet has diminished the influence and impact of ''Mad'', although it remains a widely distributed magazine. In a way, ''Mad''{{'}}s power has been undone by its own success: what was subversive in the 1950s and 1960s is now commonplace.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} However, its impact on three generations of humorists is incalculable, as can be seen in the frequent references to ''Mad'' on the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectmad.com/fbi/data/Other%20References.html |title=''Mad'' Collector Resource Center: On the Lighter Side |publisher=Collectmad.com |date= |access-date=February 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511121530/http://www.collectmad.com/fbi/data/Other%20References.html |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Simpsons'' producer [[Bill Oakley]] said, "The Simpsons has transplanted ''Mad'' magazine. Basically everyone who was young between 1955 and 1975 read ''Mad'', and that's where your sense of humor came from.  And we knew all these people, you know, Dave Berg and Don Martin – all heroes, and unfortunately, now all dead.  And I think ''The Simpsons'' has taken that spot in America's heart."&lt;ref&gt;Ortved, John; The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History; Faber &amp; Faber; 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, ''The New York Times'' wrote, "''Mad'' once defined American satire; now it heckles from the margins as all of culture competes for trickster status."&lt;ref name="Leigh"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leigh |first=Alison |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/mad_magazine/index.html |title=MAD Magazine News |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime contributor [[Al Jaffee]] described the dilemma to an interviewer in 2010: "When ''Mad'' first came out, in 1952, it was the only game in town.  Now, you've got graduates from ''Mad'' who are doing [[The Today Show]] or [[Stephen Colbert]] or [[Saturday Night Live]].  All of these people grew up on ''Mad''.  Now ''Mad'' has to top them.

''Mad''{{'}}s satiric net was cast wide. The magazine often featured parodies of ongoing American culture, including advertising campaigns, the nuclear family, the media, big business, education and publishing. In the 1960s and beyond, it satirized such burgeoning topics as the [[sexual revolution]], [[hippie]]s, the [[generation gap]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[gun politics]], pollution, the [[Vietnam War]] and [[recreational drug use]]. The magazine took a generally negative tone towards [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], but also savaged mainstream drugs such as tobacco and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].  ''Mad'' always satirized [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] as mercilessly as it did [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref&gt;''"MAD About Politics"'', Insight Editions, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Al Feldstein recalled, "We even used to rake the hippies over the coals.  They were protesting the Vietnam War, but we took aspects of their culture and had fun with it.  ''Mad'' was wide open. [[William Gaines|Bill]] loved it, and he was a capitalist Republican.  I loved it, and I was a liberal Democrat.  That went for the writers, too; they all had their own political leanings, and everybody had a voice.  But the voices were mostly critical.  It was social commentary, after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heller |first=Jason |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/al-feldstein,14077/ |title=Al Feldstein &amp;#124; TV &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=March 29, 2007 |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mad'' also ran a good deal of less topical or contentious material on such varied subjects as [[fairy tale]]s, [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[greeting card]]s, sports, [[Conversation|small talk]], poetry, marriage, [[comic strip]]s, [[List of film awards|awards shows]], [[Automobile|cars]] and many other areas of general interest.&lt;ref name=zine&gt;''Absolutely Mad'', Graphic Imaging Technology, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maria/&gt;

In 2007, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} Robert Boyd wrote, "All I really need to know I learned from ''Mad'' magazine", going on to assert:

{{quote|Plenty of it went right over my head, of course, but that's part of what made it attractive and valuable. Things that go over your head can make you raise your head a little higher.

The magazine instilled in me a habit of mind, a way of thinking about a world rife with false fronts, small print, deceptive ads, booby traps, treacherous language, double standards, half truths, subliminal pitches and product placements; it warned me that I was often merely the target of people who claimed to be my friend; it prompted me to mistrust authority, to read between the lines, to take nothing at face value, to see patterns in the often shoddy construction of movies and TV shows; and it got me to think critically in a way that few actual humans charged with my care ever bothered to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buhain |first=Venice |url=http://www.tdn.com/articles/2007/03/25/this_day/news01.txt |title=The Daily News Online &amp;gt; This Day &amp;gt; Born under a Mad sign |publisher=Tdn.com |date=October 14, 2002 |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1988, [[Geoffrey O'Brien]] wrote about the impact ''Mad'' had upon the younger generation of the 1950s:

{{quote|By now they knew the [nuclear survival] pamphlets lied... [[Rod Serling]] knew a lot more than President Eisenhower.  There were even jokes about the atom bomb in ''Mad'', a gallows humor commenting on its own ghastliness: ''"The last example of this nauseating, busted-crutch type humor is to show an atom-bomb explosion! However, this routine, we feel, is giving way to the even more hilarious picture of the hydrogen bomb!"'' The jittery aftertaste of that joke clarified.  It was a splinter driven through the carefully measured prose on the back of some Mentor book about Man and His Destiny... By not fitting in, a joke momentarily interrupted the world. But after the joke you recognized it was a joke and went back to the integral world that the joke broke. But what if it never came back again, and the little gap stayed there and became everything?&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien,
 Geoffrey, Dream Time: Chapters from the Sixties, Viking Press, 1988, pg. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1994, Brian Siano in ''[[The Humanist]]'' discussed the effect of ''Mad'' on that segment of people already disaffected from society:

{{quote|For the smarter kids of two generations, ''Mad'' was a revelation: it was the first to tell us that the toys we were being sold were garbage, our teachers were phonies, our leaders were fools, our religious counselors were hypocrites, and even our parents were lying to us about damn near everything. An entire generation had William Gaines for a godfather: this same generation later went on to give us the sexual revolution, the environmental movement, the peace movement, greater freedom in artistic expression, and a host of other goodies. Coincidence? You be the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_n2_v54/ai_15216386 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014201115/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_n2_v54/ai_15216386 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-14 |work=[[The Humanist]] |title=Tales from the crypt – comic books and censorship – The Skeptical Eye |first=Brian |last=Siano |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning art comics maven [[Art Spiegelman]] said, "The message ''Mad'' had in general is, 'The media is lying to you, and we are part of the media.' It was basically... 'Think for yourselves, kids.'" William Gaines offered his own view: when asked to cite ''Mad''{{'}}s philosophy, his boisterous answer was, "We must never stop reminding the reader what little value they get for their money!"

Comics historian [[Tom Spurgeon]] picked ''Mad'' as the medium's top series of all time, writing, "At the height of its influence, ''Mad'' was ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Onion]]'' combined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/cr_sunday_feature_the_top_ten_all_time_best_comics_series/ |title=The Comics Reporter |publisher=The Comics Reporter |date=April 26, 2009 |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graydon Carter]] chose it as the sixth best magazine of any sort ever, describing ''Mad''{{'}}s mission as being "ever ready to pounce on the illogical, hypocritical, self-serious and ludicrous" before concluding, "Nowadays, it's part of the oxygen we breathe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.good.is/articles/the-51-best-magazines-ever GOOD Magazine | Goodmagazine – The 51 Best* Magazines Ever] – Words By Graydon Carter, GOOD magazine / Introduction By Bigshot Editor Graydon Carter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Carol Oates]] called it "wonderfully inventive, irresistibly irreverent and intermittently ingenious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garner |first=Dwight |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/collateral-damage/ |title= Collateral Damage   |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Dave Gibbons]] said, "When you think of the people who grew up in the ’50s and ’60s, the letters M-A-D were probably as influential as L-S-D, in that it kind of expanded people’s consciousness and showed them an alternative view of society and consumer culture — mocked it, satirized it." Gibbons also noted that ''Mad'' was an overt influence on ''[[Watchmen]]'', the acclaimed 12-issue comic book series created by writer [[Alan Moore]] and himself:
{{quote|When it comes to the kind of storytelling we did in ''Watchmen'', we used many of the tricks [[Harvey Kurtzman]] perfected in ''Mad''. The thing for instance where you have a background that remains constant, and have characters walk around in front of it. Or the inverse of that, where you have characters in the same place and move the background around. We quite mercilessly stole the wonderful techniques Harvey Kurtzman had invented in ''Mad''."&lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/books/2018/09/07/dave-gibbons-harvey-hall-of-fame-watchmen-legacy/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Controversy and lawsuit==
===Court cases and copyright infringement lawsuit===
The magazine has been involved in various legal actions over the decades, some of which have reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]].  The most far-reaching was ''[[Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.]]'' In 1961, a group of music publishers representing songwriters such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Cole Porter]] filed a $25&amp;nbsp;million lawsuit against ''Mad'' for [[copyright infringement]] following "Sing Along With ''Mad''", a collection of parody lyrics which the magazine said could be "sung to the tune of" many popular songs. The publishing group hoped to establish a legal precedent that only a song's composers retained the right to parody that song. Judge Charles Metzner of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled largely in favor of ''Mad'' in 1963, affirming its right to print 23 of the 25 song parodies under dispute.  However, in the case of two parodies, "Always" (sung to the tune of "[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]") and "There's No Business Like No Business" (sung to the tune of "[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]"), Judge Metzner decided that the issue of [[copyright infringement]] was closer, requiring a trial because in each case the parodies relied on the same verbal hooks ("always" and "business") as the originals. The music publishers appealed the ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals not only upheld the pro-''Mad'' decision in regard to the 23 songs, it adopted an approach that was broad enough to strip the publishers of their limited victory regarding the remaining two songs. Writing a unanimous opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Circuit Judge [[Irving Kaufman]] pointedly observed, "We doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in [[iambic pentameter]]."&lt;ref name="mcir_Musi"&gt;{{cite web | title =  Music Copyright Infringement Resource – Sponsored By USC Gould School of Law |work = mcir.usc.edu |accessdate = January 17, 2015 | url = http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/1960-1969/Pages/berlinecpublications.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishers again appealed, but the Supreme Court refused to hear it, thus allowing the decision to stand.&lt;ref name=jac&gt;Jacobs, Frank.

This precedent-setting case established the rights of parodists and satirists to mimic the meter of popular songs. However, the "Sing Along With ''Mad''" songbook was not the magazine's first venture into musical parody. In 1960, ''Mad'' had published "My Fair Ad-Man", a full advertising-based spoof of the hit Broadway musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. In 1959, "If [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] wrote ''[[Dick Tracy]]''" was one of the speculative pairings in "If Famous Authors Wrote the Comics".

In 1966, a series of copyright infringement lawsuits against the magazine regarding ownership of the [[Alfred E. Neuman]] image eventually reached the appellate level. Although Harry Stuff had copyrighted the image in 1914, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that, by allowing many copies of the image to circulate without any copyright notice, the owner of the copyright had allowed the image to pass into the public domain, thus establishing the right of ''Mad '' – or anyone else for that matter – to use the image.  In addition, ''Mad'' established that Stuff was not himself the creator of the image by producing numerous other examples dating back to the late 19th century. This decision was also allowed to stand.&lt;ref name=maria&gt;Reidelbach, Maria. ''Completely Mad'', New York: Little Brown, 1991. {{ISBN|0-316-73890-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other legal disputes were settled more easily.  Following the magazine's parody of the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', a letter from [[George Lucas]]' lawyers arrived in ''Mad'''s offices demanding that the issue be recalled for infringement on copyrighted figures.  The letter further demanded that the printing plates be destroyed, and that [[Lucasfilm]] must receive all revenue from the issue plus additional punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.starwars.com/news/mad-about-star-wars&lt;/ref&gt;  Unbeknownst to Lucas' lawyers, ''Mad'' had received a letter days earlier from Lucas himself, expressing delight over the parody and calling artist [[Mort Drucker]] and writer [[Dick DeBartolo]] "the [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] of comic satire."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=mS-OOULG_IcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=debartolo+lucas+lawyer+star+bores&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V5_--NU6eQ&amp;sig=5F1GUZ2fQeNdsH9yBkq-x76JZqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_7KLv1_rdAhUImuAKHdX1CSgQ6AEwCHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=debartolo%20lucas%20lawyer%20star%20bores&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher Bill Gaines made a copy of Lucas' letter, added the handwritten notation "Gee, your boss George liked it!" across the top, and mailed it to the lawyers.  Said DeBartolo, "We never heard from them again."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-26-9511260063-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mad'' was one of several parties that filed ''[[amicus curiae]]'' briefs with the Supreme Court in support of [[2 Live Crew]] and its disputed song parody, during the 1993 ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamby |first=Barbara |url=http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2008/03/07 |title=Vex Me by Barbara Hamby &amp;#124; The Writer's Almanac with Garrison Keillor |publisher=Writersalmanac.publicradio.org |date=March 7, 2008 |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Advertising==
''Mad'' was long noted for its absence of advertising, enabling it to satirize materialist culture without fear of reprisal. For decades, it was the most successful American magazine to publish ad-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119524101/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |title=Mad Economics: An Analysis of an Adless Magazine |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02984.x |date=February 7, 2006 |accessdate= February 2, 2011 |volume=34 |journal=Journal of Communication |pages=44–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with issue #33 (April 1957) and continuing through issue #402 (February 2001).

As a comic book, ''Mad'' had run the same advertisements as the rest of EC's line.  The magazine later made a deal with [[Moxie]] soda that involved inserting the Moxie logo into various articles. ''Mad'' ran a limited number of ads in its first two years as a magazine, helpfully labeled "real advertisement" to differentiate the real from the parodies. The last authentic ad published under the original ''Mad'' regime was for [[Famous Artists School]]; two issues later, the inside front cover of issue #34 had a parody of the same ad. After this transitional period, the only promotions to appear in ''Mad'' for decades were house ads for ''Mad'''s own books and specials, subscriptions, and promotional items such as ceramic busts, T-shirts, or a line of ''Mad'' jewelry. This rule was bent only a few times to promote outside products directly related to the magazine, such as [[Parker Brothers]] ''Mad Board Game'', the video game based on ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'', and the notorious ''[[Up the Academy]]'' movie (which the magazine later disowned).  ''Mad'' explicitly promised that it would never make its mailing list available.

Both Kurtzman and Feldstein wanted the magazine to solicit advertising, feeling this could be accomplished without compromising ''Mad'''s content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered ''[[Ballyhoo (magazine)|Ballyhoo]]'', a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein went so far as to propose an in-house ''Mad'' ad agency, and produced a "dummy" copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'', "We long ago decided we couldn't take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola." Gaines' motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical:

{{quote|We'd have to improve our package. Most advertisers want to appear in a magazine that's loaded with color and has super-slick paper. So you find yourself being pushed into producing a more expensive package. You get bigger and fancier and attract more advertisers. Then you find you're losing some of your advertisers. Your readers still expect the fancy package, so you keep putting it out, but now you don't have your advertising income, which is why you got fancier in the first place—and now you're sunk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jacobs, Frank. ''The Mad World of William M. Gaines'', Lyle Stuart, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Recurring features==
{{Main|Mad recurring features}}
''Mad'' is known for many regular and semi-regular recurring features in its pages, including "[[Spy vs. Spy]]", the "[[Mad Fold-in]]", "The Lighter Side of..." and its television and movie parodies.&lt;!--Please don't add things to this sentence or it will quickly get out of hand. Edit the "recurring features" article instead.--&gt;  The magazine has also included recurring gags and references, both visual (e.g. the ''Mad'' Zeppelin, or Arthur the potted plant) and linguistic (unusual words such as [[axolotl]], furshlugginer, [[potrzebie]] and veeblefetzer).

==Alfred E. Neuman==
[[File:MAD Magazine (no. 21, front cover).jpg|right|324px|thumb|First cover appearance (issue 21, March 1955) of Alfred E. Neuman in a fake advertisement satirizing the popular mail-order house [[Johnson Smith Company]]]]
{{Main|Alfred E. Neuman}}
The image most closely associated with the magazine is that of [[Alfred E. Neuman]], the boy with misaligned eyes, a [[gap-toothed]] smile, and the perennial motto "[[What, me worry?]]" The original image was a popular humorous graphic for many decades before ''Mad'' adopted it, but the face is now primarily associated with ''Mad''.

''Mad'' initially used the boy's face in November 1954. His first iconic full-cover appearance was as a write-in candidate for President on issue #30 (December 1956), in which he was identified by name and sported his "What, me worry?" motto. He has since appeared in a slew of guises and comic situations. According to ''Mad'' writer Frank Jacobs, a letter was once successfully delivered to the magazine through the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. mail]] bearing only Neuman's face, without any address or other identifying information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Contributors and criticism==
''Mad'' has provided an ongoing showcase for many long-running satirical writers and artists and has fostered an unusual group loyalty. Although several of the contributors earn far more than their ''Mad'' pay in fields such as television and advertising, they have steadily continued to provide material for the publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/jackdavs.htm Jack Davis] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. Retrieved February 2, 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/66C14YyOh?url=http://toonopedia.com/jackdavs.htm Archived] from the original on March 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the notable artists were the aforementioned Davis, Elder and Wood, as well as [[Mort Drucker]], [[George Woodbridge]], Harry North and [[Paul Coker]].  Writers such as [[Dick DeBartolo]], [[Stan Hart]], [[Frank Jacobs]], [[Tom Koch]], and [[Arnie Kogen]] appeared regularly in the magazine's pages. In several cases, only infirmity or death has ended a contributor's run at ''Mad.''

Within the industry, ''Mad'' was known for the uncommonly prompt manner in which its contributors were paid. Publisher Gaines would typically write a personal check and give it to the artist upon receipt of the finished product. Wally Wood said, "I got spoiled... Other publishers don't do that. I started to get upset if I had to wait a whole week for my check." Another lure for contributors was the annual "Mad Trip", an all-expenses-paid tradition that began in 1960. The editorial staff was automatically invited, along with freelancers who had qualified for an invitation by selling a set amount of articles or pages during the previous year. Gaines was strict about enforcing this quota, and one year, longtime writer and frequent traveller Arnie Kogen was bumped off the list. Later that year, Gaines' mother died, and Kogen was asked if he would be attending the funeral. "I can't," said Kogen, "I don't have enough pages." Over the years, the ''Mad'' crew traveled to such locales as France, [[Kenya]], Russia, Hong Kong, England, [[Amsterdam]], [[Tahiti]], [[Morocco]], Italy, Greece, and Germany.&lt;ref name=jac/&gt; The tradition ended with Gaines' death, and a 1993 trip to [[Monte Carlo]].

Although ''Mad'' was an exclusively freelance publication, it achieved a remarkable stability, with numerous contributors remaining prominent for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/bullpen/john_ficarra/backgrounder/ |title=Byline&amp;nbsp;: Published Work " Arthur L.

Many have written that the key factor is when the reader first encountered ''Mad''. According to former Mad Senior Editor [[Joe Raiola]], "Mad is the only place in America where if you mature, you get fired."

Proclaiming the precise moment that purportedly triggered the magazine's irreversible decline is a common pastime. Among the most frequently cited "downward turning points" are: creator-editor Harvey Kurtzman's departure in 1957;&lt;ref name="That Old Feeling: Hail, Harvey!"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,633658,00.html | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title=That Old Feeling: Hail, Harvey! | date=May 5, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine's mainstream success;&lt;ref name="Leigh"/&gt; adoption of recurring features starting in the early 1960s;&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'', October 1971&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine's absorption into a more corporate structure in 1968 (or later, the mid-1990s);&lt;ref name="newsandtech.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=McMeekin |first=Tara |url=http://newsandtech.com/news/article_bc2f82e2-75b6-11e0-bf8c-001cc4c03286.html |title=MAD ready to mark 60th birthday by acting like it's 12 (Did you expect anything different?) - News &amp;amp; Tech: News |website=Newsandtech.com |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; founder Gaines' death in 1992;&lt;ref name="newsandtech.com"/&gt; the magazine's publicized "edgy revamp" in 1997;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/04/06/what-me-worry-the-magazine-of-our-youth-is-steering-a-risky-new-course-its-getting-raunchy-the-editors-say-our-kids-are-ready-for-it-could-be-but-it-might-just-make-you-mad/7d0b873c-fbfc-4a3c-be7b-220f6092caad/|title=WHAT, ME WORRY?

Retrieved November 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; or the magazine's 2018 move to California. ''Mad'' has been criticized{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} for its over-reliance on a core group of aging regulars throughout the 1970s and 1980s and then criticized again{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} for an alleged downturn as those same creators began to leave, die, retire, or contribute less frequently.

It has been proposed that ''Mad'' is more susceptible to this criticism than many media because a sizable percentage of its readership turns over regularly as it ages, as ''Mad'' focuses greatly on current events and a changing popular culture.&lt;ref name="jac"/&gt; In 2010, [[Sergio Aragones]] said, "Mad is written by people who never thought 'Okay, I'm going to write for kids,' or 'I'm going to write for adults.' ... And many people say 'I used to read ''Mad'', but ''Mad'' has changed a lot.' Excuse me—you grew up! You have new interests. ... The change doesn't come from the magazine, it comes from the people who grow or don't grow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Sam |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/sergio-aragones,47745/ |title=Sergio Aragonés &amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=November 16, 2010 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mad'' poked fun at the tendency of readers to accuse the magazine of declining in quality at various points in its history in its "Untold History of ''Mad'' Magazine", a self-referential faux history in the 400th issue which joked: "The second issue of ''Mad'' goes on sale on December 9, 1952. On December 11, the first-ever letter complaining that ''Mad'' 'just isn't as funny and original like it used to be' arrives." The magazine's then art director, [[Sam Viviano]], suggested in 2002 that historically, ''Mad'' was at its best "whenever you first started reading it."&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, Mark. ''Mad Art''. 2002. Watson-Guptill Publications. {{ISBN|0-8230-3080-6}}. p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the loudest of those who insist the magazine is no longer funny are supporters of [[Harvey Kurtzman]], who had the good critical fortune to leave ''Mad'' after just 28 issues, before his own formulaic tendencies might have become obtrusive. This also meant Kurtzman suffered the bad creative and financial timing of departing before the magazine became a runaway success.&lt;ref name="That Old Feeling: Hail, Harvey!"/&gt;

However, just how much of that success was due to the original Kurtzman template that he left for his successor, and how much should be credited to the [[Al Feldstein]] system and the depth of the post-Kurtzman talent pool, can be argued without resolution. In 2009, an interviewer proposed to [[Al Jaffee]], "There's a group of ''Mad'' aficionados who feel that if Harvey Kurtzman had stayed at ''Mad'', the magazine would not only have been different, but better."  Jaffee, a Kurtzman enthusiast, replied, "And then there's a large group who feel that if Harvey had stayed with ''Mad'', he would have upgraded it to the point that only fifteen people would buy it."&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Mike, "And Here's the Kicker", ''Writer's Digest' Books'', 2009, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; During Kurtzman's final two-plus years at EC, ''Mad'' appeared erratically (ten issues appeared in 1954, followed by eight issues in 1955 and four issues in 1956). Feldstein was less well regarded creatively, but kept the magazine on a regular schedule, leading to decades of success. (Kurtzman and [[Will Elder]] returned to ''Mad'' for a short time in the mid-1980s as an illustrating team.)

The magazine's sales peak came with issue #161 which sold 2.4 million copies in 1973.  That period coincided with several other magazines' sales peaks, including ''[[TV Guide]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]''. ''Mad'''s circulation dropped below one million for the first time in 1983.

Many of the magazine's mainstays began retiring or dying by the 1980s. Newer contributors who appeared in the years that followed include [[Joe Raiola]], [[Charlie Kadau]], [[Tony Barbieri]], Scott Bricher, [[Tom Bunk]], [[John Caldwell (cartoonist)|John Caldwell]], [[Desmond Devlin]], [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]], [[Barry Liebmann]], [[Kevin Pope (cartoonist)|Kevin Pope]], Scott Maiko, [[Hermann Mejia]], [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]], Andrew J. Schwartzberg, [[Mike Snider]], [[Greg Theakston]], [[Nadina Simon]], [[Rick Tulka]] and [[Bill Wray]].

On April 1, 1997, the magazine publicized an alleged "revamp", ostensibly designed to reach an older, more sophisticated readership. However, [[Salon.com|Salon]]'s David Futrelle opined that such content was very much a part of ''Mad''{{'}}s past:

{{quote|The October 1971 issue, for example, with its war crimes fold-in and back cover "mini-poster" of "The Four Horsemen of the Metropolis" (Drugs, Graft, Pollution and Slums). With its Mad Pollution Primer. With its "Reality Street" TV satire, taking a poke at the idealized images of interracial harmony on ''[[Sesame Street]]''. ("It's a street of depression,/ Corruption, oppression!/ It's a sadist's dream come true!/ And masochists, too!") With its "This is America" photo feature, contrasting images of heroic astronauts with graphic photos of dead soldiers and junkies shooting up. I remember this issue pretty well; it was one of the ones I picked up at a garage sale and read to death. I seem to remember asking my parents what "graft" was. One of the joys of ''Mad'' for me at the time was that it was always slightly over my head. From "Mad's Up-Dated Modern Day [[Mother Goose]]" I learned about [[Andy Warhol]], [[Spiro Agnew]] and [[Timothy Leary]] ("Wee Timmy Leary/ Soars through the sky/ Upward and Upward/ Till he's, oh, so, high/ Since this rhyme's for kiddies/ How do we explain/ That Wee Timmy Leary/ Isn't in a plane?"). From "Greeting Cards for the Sexual Revolution" I learned about "Gay Liberationists" and leather-clad "Sex Fetishists." I read the ''Mad'' versions of a whole host of films I never in a million years would have been allowed to see: ''[[Easy Rider]]'' ("Sleazy Riders"), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' ("Midnight Wowboy"), ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' ("Five Easy Pages [and two hard ones].") I learned about the [[John Birch Society]] and [[Madison Avenue]].&lt;ref name="Futrelle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1997/04/08/media_109/ |last=Futrelle|first=David|title=Media Circus: Son of Mad |publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=April 8, 1997 |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Mad'' editor [[John Ficarra]] acknowledges that changes in culture have made the task of creating fresh satire more difficult, telling an interviewer, "The editorial mission statement has always been the same: 'Everyone is lying to you, including magazines.  Think for yourself.  Question authority.'  But it's gotten harder, as they've gotten better at lying and getting in on the joke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Karlin |url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/1681754/the-ascent-of-mad-see-60-years-of-comic-subversion#1 |title=The Ascent Of "Mad": See 60 Years Of Comic Subversion &amp;#124; Co.Create &amp;#124; creativity + culture + commerce |website=Fastcocreate.com |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mad'' contributor [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] has responded to critics who say the magazine's decision to accept advertising would make late publisher [[William Gaines]] "turn over in his grave", pointing out this is impossible because Gaines was cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomrichmond.com/blog/?p=2170 |last=Richmond|first= Tom|title= The Mad Blog: Remembering William M.

===Contributors===
''Mad'' is known for the stability and longevity of its talent roster, billed as "The Usual Gang of Idiots", with several creators enjoying 30-, 40- and even 50-year careers in the magazine's pages.

According to the "Mad Magazine Contributor Appearances" website, more than 850 contributors have received bylines in at least one issue of ''Mad'', but only three dozen of those have contributed to 100 issues or more.&lt;ref name="users.ipfw.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ipfw.edu/slaubau/madlist.htm |author=Slaubaugh, Mike |title=''Mad Magazine'' Contributor Appearances |publisher=Users.ipfw.edu |date= |accessdate= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer-artist [[Al Jaffee]] has appeared in the most issues; #550 (April 2018) was the 500th issue with new work by Jaffee.  The other three contributors to have appeared in more than 400 issues of ''Mad'' are [[Sergio Aragonés]], [[Dick DeBartolo]], and [[Mort Drucker]]; [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]], [[Paul Coker]] and [[Frank Jacobs]] have each topped the 300 mark. (The list calculates appearances by issue only, not by individual articles or overall page count; e.g. although Jacobs wrote three separate articles that appeared in issue #172, his total is reckoned to have increased by one.)

Each of the following contributors has created over 100 articles for the magazine:

===Other notable contributors===
{{unreferenced|section, except for one footnote,|date=June 2016}}
Among the irregular contributors with just a single ''Mad'' byline to their credit are [[Charles M. Schulz]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[Will Eisner]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[J. Fred Muggs]], [[Boris Vallejo]], [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]], [[Jean Shepherd]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Jimmy Kimmel]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Walt Kelly]], Rep. [[Barney Frank]], [[Tom Wolfe]], [[Steve Allen]], [[Jim Lee]], [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Richard Nixon]], who remains the only President credited with "writing" a ''Mad'' article.&lt;ref name="users.ipfw.edu"/&gt;  (The entire text was taken from Nixon's speeches.)

Those who have contributed twice apiece&lt;ref name="users.ipfw.edu"/&gt; include [[Tom Lehrer]], [[Wally Cox]], [[Gustave Doré]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Stan Freberg]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].  (Leonardo's check is still waiting in the Mad offices for him to pick it up.) Appearing slightly more frequently were [[Frank Frazetta]] (3 bylines), [[Ernie Kovacs]] (11), [[Bob and Ray]] (12), [[Henry Morgan (humorist)|Henry Morgan]] (3), and [[Sid Caesar]] (4). In its earliest years, before amassing its own staff of regulars, the magazine frequently used outside "name" talent. Often, ''Mad'' would simply illustrate the celebrities' preexisting material while promoting their names on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | author1-last=Cox | author1-first=Wally | author1link=Wally Cox | author2-last=Woodbridge | author2-first=George | author2link=George Woodbridge |date=December 1957 | title=My Frien' Dufo | publisher=''Mad'' | number=36 | url=http://www.madcoversite.com/missing_dufo.html | access-date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | author1-last=Elliott | author1-first=Bob | author1link=Bob Elliott (comedian) | author2-last=Goulding | author2-first=Ray | author2link=Ray Goulding |author3-last=Drucker | author3-first=Mort | author3link=Mort Drucker | date=December 1957 | title=Paul Sturdley's Secret File | publisher=''Mad'' | number=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | author1-last=Morgan | author1-first=Henry | author1link=Henry Morgan (humorist) | author2-last=Wood | author2-first=Wally | author2link=Wally Wood | date=December 1957 | title=Mr. Morgan Tells The Story of The 12 Bottles | publisher=''Mad'' | number=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bob and Ray association was particularly fruitful.  When the magazine learned that [[Tom Koch]] was the writer behind the Bob and Ray radio sketches adapted by ''Mad'', Koch was sought out by the editors and ultimately wrote more than 300 ''Mad'' articles over the next 37 years.

The magazine has occasionally run guest articles in which notables from show business or comic books have participated.  In 1964, an article called "Comic Strips They'd Really Like To Do" featured one-shot proposals by cartoonists including [[Mell Lazarus]] and Charles M. Schulz.  More than once, the magazine has enlisted popular comic book artists such as [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] or [[Jim Lee]] to design and illustrate a series of "Rejected Superheroes." In 2008, the magazine got national coverage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/business/media/04mad.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|work= [[The New York Times]] | title=''Mad Magazine'' Uses Pulitzer Winners to Tweak Bush|date=February 4, 2008|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its article "Why [[George W.

==Reprints and foreign editions==
{{unreferenced|section, except for two footnotes,|date=October 2016}}
In 1955, Gaines began presenting reprints of material for ''Mad'' in black-and-white paperbacks, the first being ''The Mad Reader''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/mad/?action=timeline |title=MAD|publisher=Dccomics|date=April 21, 2010 |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these featured new covers by ''Mad'' cover artist Norman Mingo. This practice continued into the 2000s, with more than 100 ''Mad'' paperbacks published. Gaines made a special effort to keep the entire line of paperbacks in print at all times, and the books were frequently reprinted in new editions with different covers.

''Mad'' also frequently repackaged its material in a long series of "Super Special" format magazines, beginning in 1958 with two concurrent annual series entitled ''The Worst from Mad'' and ''More Trash from Mad''. Various other titles have been used through the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectmad.com/usacoversite/Specials/index.htm |title=US Mad Specials Cover Site |publisher=Collectmad.com |date= |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511121543/http://www.collectmad.com/usacoversite/Specials/index.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reprint issues were sometimes augmented by exclusive features such as posters, stickers and, on a few occasions, recordings on [[Flexi disc|flexi-disc]], or comic book–formatted inserts reprinting material from the 1952–55 era.

One steady form of revenue has come from foreign editions of the magazine. ''Mad'' has been published in local versions in many countries, beginning with the United Kingdom in 1959, and Sweden in 1960. Each new market receives access to the publication's back catalog of articles and is also encouraged to produce its own localized material in the ''Mad'' vein. However, the sensibility of the American ''Mad'' has not always translated to other cultures, and many of the foreign editions have had short lives or interrupted publications. The Swedish, Danish, Italian and Mexican ''Mad''s were each published on three separate occasions; Norway has had four runs cancelled. Brazil also had four runs, but without significant interruptions, spanning five decades. Australia (35 years and counting) United Kingdom (35 years) and Sweden (34 years) have produced the longest uninterrupted ''Mad'' variants.

Conflicts over content have occasionally arisen between the parent magazine and its international franchisees.  When a comic strip satirizing [[House of Windsor|England's royal family]] was reprinted in a ''Mad'' paperback, it was deemed necessary to rip out the page from 25,000 copies by hand before the book could be distributed in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Frank. ''The Mad World of William M. Gaines'', Lyle Stuart, 1972, pg. 191&lt;/ref&gt; But ''Mad'' was also protective of its own editorial standards.  Bill Gaines sent "one of his typically dreadful, blistering letters" to his Dutch editors after they published a bawdy gag about a men's room urinal.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Frank. ''The Mad World of William M. Gaines'', Lyle Stuart, 1972, pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad'' has since relaxed its requirements, and while the U.S. version still eschews overt profanity, the magazine generally poses no objections to more provocative content such as the Swedish edition's 1999 parody of the film ''[[Show Me Love (film)|Fucking Åmål]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectmad.com/swedencoversite/99001.htm|title=Cover of Swedish ''Mad'' #322|work=Collect Mad|accessdate=February 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511121540/http://www.collectmad.com/swedencoversite/99001.htm|archivedate=May 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-off==

===''Mad Kids''===
{{Main|Mad Kids}}
Between 2005 and February 17, 2009, the magazine published 14 issues of ''Mad Kids,'' a spinoff publication aimed at a younger demographic.&lt;ref name=newsa&gt;{{cite news|author = Brady, Matt |title=Worrying a Little Bit? MAD Magazine Goes Quarterly|url=http://www.newsarama.com/2019-worrying-a-little-bit-mad-magazine-goes-quarterly.html|accessdate=August 17, 2015|work=Newsarama|date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reminiscent of [[Nickelodeon]]'s newsstand titles, it emphasized current kids' entertainment (i.e. ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[High School Musical]]''), albeit with an impudent voice.  Much of the content of ''Mad Kids'' had originally appeared in the parent publication; reprinted material was chosen and edited to reflect grade schoolers' interests. But the quarterly magazine also included newly commissioned articles and cartoons, as well as puzzles, bonus inserts, a calendar, and the other activity-related content that is common to kids' magazines.

===Other satiric-comics magazines===

}}
Following the success of ''Mad'', other black-and-white magazines of topical, satiric comics began to be published. Most were short-lived. The three longest-lasting were ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'', ''[[Sick (magazine)|Sick]]'', and ''[[Crazy Magazine]]''. Many featured a cover mascot along the lines of [[Alfred E. Neuman]].

Color comic-book competitors, primarily in the mid-to-late 1950s, were ''Nuts!'', ''Get Lost'', ''Whack'', ''Riot'', ''Flip'', ''Eh!'', ''From Here to Insanity'', and ''Madhouse''; only the last of these lasted as many as eight issues, and some were canceled after an issue or two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreiner |first=Rich |url=http://classic.tcj.com/history/rich-kreiner-reviews-humbug-by-harvey-kurtzman-will-elder-arnold-roth-al-jaffee-jack-davis-and-others/ |title=Rich Kreiner reviews Humbug by Harvey Kurtzman, Will Elder, Arnold Roth, Al Jaffee, Jack Davis and others « The Comics Journal |website=Classic.tcj.com |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later color satiric comic books included ''Wild'', ''Blast'', ''Parody'', ''Grin'' and ''Gag!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-sincerest-form-of-parody-the-best-1950s-mad-inspired-satirical-comics-dec.-2011-8.html | title=The Sincerest Form of Parody: The Best 1950s MAD-Inspired Satirical Comics [Jan. 2012] | accessdate=January 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023053008/http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/the-sincerest-form-of-parody-the-best-1950s-mad-inspired-satirical-comics-dec.-2011-8.html |archivedate=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EC Comics itself offered the color comic ''[[Panic (comics)|Panic]]'', produced by future ''Mad'' editor Al Feldstein. Two years after EC's ''Panic'' had ceased publication in 1956, the title was used by another publisher for a similar comic.

In 1967, [[Marvel Comics]] produced the first of 13 issues of the comic book ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'', which parodied the company's own superhero titles as well as other publishers. From 1973 to 1976, [[DC Comics]] published the comic ''[[Plop!]]'', which featured ''Mad'' stalwart [[Sergio Aragonés]] and frequent cover art by [[Basil Wolverton]]. Another publisher's comic was ''Trash'' (1978){{citation needed|date=December 2013}} featured a blurb on the debut cover reading, "We mess with ''Mad'' (p. 21)" and depicted Alfred E. Neuman with a stubbly beard; the fourth and last issue showed two bodybuilders holding up copies of ''Mud'' and ''Crocked'' with the frowning faces of Neuman and ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' cover mascot Sylvester P. Smythe.

Among other U.S. humor magazines that included some degree of comics art as well as text articles were former ''Mad'' editor Harvey Kurtzman's ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'', ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]'' and ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'', as well as ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.

==In other media==
Over the years, ''Mad'' has branched out from print into other media. During the Gaines years, the publisher had an aversion to exploiting his fan base and expressed the fear that substandard ''Mad'' products would offend them. He was known to personally issue refunds to anyone who wrote to the magazine with a complaint. Among the few outside ''Mad'' items available in its first 40 years were cufflinks, a T-shirt designed like a straitjacket (complete with lock), and a small ceramic Alfred E. Neuman bust.  For decades, the letters page advertised an inexpensive portrait of Neuman ("suitable for framing or for wrapping fish") with misleading slogans such as "Only 1 Left!" (The joke being that the picture was so undesirable that only one had left their office since the last ad.) After Gaines' death came an overt absorption into the Time-Warner publishing umbrella, with the result that ''Mad'' merchandise began to appear more frequently. Items were displayed in the Warner Bros. Studio Stores, and in 1994 ''The Mad Style Guide'' was created for licensing use.

===Recordings===
''Mad'' has sponsored or inspired a number of recordings. In 1959, Bernie Green "with the Stereo Mad-Men" recorded the album ''Musically Mad'' for [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]], featuring music inspired by ''Mad'' and an image of Alfred E. Neuman on the cover;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,403202,00.html |title=That Old Feeling: What, Me Fifty? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 31, 2002 |accessdate=February 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204072200/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,403202,00.html |archive-date=February 4, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been reissued on CD. That same year, ''The Worst from Mad'' #2 included an original recording, "Meet the staff of Mad", on a cardboard 33 rpm record, while a single credited to Alfred E. Neuman &amp; The Furshlugginger Five: "What – Me Worry?" (b/w "Potrzebie"), was issued in late 1959 on the ABC Paramount label. Two additional albums of novelty songs were released by [[Bigtop Records]] in 1962–63: "Mad 'Twists' Rock 'N' Roll" and "Fink Along with Mad".  The latter album featured a song titled "It's a Gas", which punctuated an instrumental track with [[belching|belches]] (along with a saxophone break by an uncredited [[King Curtis]]). [[Dr. Demento]] featured this gaseous performance on his radio show in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. ''Mad'' included some of these tracks as plastic-laminated cardboard inserts and (later) [[flexi disc]]s with their reprinted "Mad Specials". A number of original recordings also were released in this way in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as ''Gall in the Family Fare'' (a [[radio play]] adaptation of their previously illustrated ''[[All in the Family]]'' parody), a single entitled "Makin' Out", the octuple-grooved track "It's a Super Spectacular Day", which had eight possible endings, the spoken word ''Meet the staff'' insert, and a six-track, 30-minute ''Mad Disco'' EP (from the 1980 Special of the same title) that included a [[disco]] version of "It's a Gas". The last turntable-playable recording ''Mad'' packaged with its magazines was "A Mad Look at Graduation", in a 1982 Special. A CD-ROM containing several audio tracks was included with issue #350 (October 1996). [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] compiled a number of ''Mad''-recorded tracks as ''Mad Grooves'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectmad.com/collectibles/FAQ.htm#*%20How%20many%20MAD%20records%20were%20released|title=''Mad'' and Alfred E.

===Stage show===
An [[off Broadway]] production, ''[[The Mad Show]]'', was first staged in 1966.  The show, which lasted for 871 performances during its initial run, featured sketches written by ''Mad'' regulars Stan Hart and Larry Siegel interspersed with comedic songs (one of which was written by an uncredited [[Stephen Sondheim]]).&lt;ref name=maria/&gt; The cast album is available on CD. In September 2017, the show will return with new writers and actors.{{Update inline|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/MADtv-to-Hit-the-Stage-in-THE-MAD-SHOW-in-Developmental-Run-at-Theatre-Aspen-20170822|title=MADtv to Hit the Stage in THE MAD SHOW in Developmental Run at Theatre Aspen|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaming===
In 1979, Mad released a [[board game]]. ''[[The Mad Magazine Game]]'' was an absurdist version of ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' in which the first player to lose all his money and go bankrupt was the winner. Profusely illustrated with artwork by the magazine's contributors, the game included a $1,329,063-bill that could not be won unless one's name was "Alfred E. Neuman". It also featured a deck of cards (called "Card cards") with bizarre instructions, such as "If you can jump up and stay airborne for 37 seconds, you can lose $5,000. If not, jump up and lose $500." In 1980 a second game was released: ''[[The Mad Magazine Card Game]]'' by [[Parker Brothers]]. In it, the player who first [[Card game#Shedding games|loses all their cards]] is declared the winner. The game is fairly similar to ''[[Uno (card game)|Uno]]'' by [[Mattel]]. Questions based on the magazine also appeared in the 1999 ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]: Warner Bros. Edition'' (which featured questions based around Time-Warner properties, including WB films and TV shows, the ''[[Looney Tunes]]''/''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons (and follow-up projects from [[Warner Bros Animation]])), as well as DC Comics, [[Hanna-Barbera]], Cartoon Network and assorted [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] properties owned by [[Turner Entertainment Co.]] that WB had come into possession of following the 1996 Turner/Time-Warner merger.

===Film and television===
Following the success of the ''National Lampoon''–backed ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House|Animal House]]'', ''Mad'' lent its name in 1980 to a similarly risque comedy film, ''[[Up the Academy]]''. It was such a commercial debacle and critical failure that ''Mad'' successfully arranged for all references to the magazine (including a cameo by Alfred E. Neuman) to be removed from future TV and video releases of the film, although those references were eventually restored on the DVD version, which was titled ''Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy''. ''Mad'' also devoted two pages of its magazine to an attack on the movie, titled ''Throw Up the Academy''. The spoof's ending collapsed into a series of interoffice memos between the writer, artist, editor and publisher, all bewailing the fact that they had been forced to satirize such a terrible film.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} On March 2, 2018, ''Mad'' announced via their Twitter page that a sequel to the original film will be written by an A-list film writer.&lt;ref&gt;https://mobile.twitter.com/MADmagazine/status/969718152312451072&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1974 ''Mad'' animated television pilot using selected material from the magazine was commissioned by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] but the network decided to not broadcast it. Dick DeBartolo noted, "Nobody wanted to sponsor a show that made fun of products that were advertised on TV, like car manufacturers." The program was instead created into a TV special, and is available for online viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/the-mad-magazine-tv-special-1974.html |title=The Mad Magazine TV Special (1974) |publisher=Cartoonbrew.com |date=October 19, 2009 |access-date= February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, [[Hanna-Barbera]] developed another potential ''Mad'' animated television series which was never broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/Alfred_E_Neuman_in_animation_P105263/|title=Alfred E. Neuman in animation|work=BCDB|access-date=February 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718001521/http://forum.bcdb.com/forum/Alfred_E_Neuman_in_animation_P105263/|archivedate=July 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s ''[[Mad TV]]'' licensed the use of the magazine's logo and characters. However, aside from short bumpers which animated existing ''Spy vs. Spy'' (1994–1998) and Don Martin (1995–2000) cartoons during the show's first three seasons, there was no editorial or stylistic connection between the TV show and the magazine. Produced by [[Quincy Jones]], the sketch comedy series was in the vein of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and [[Global Television Network|Global]]/[[CBC Television|CBC]]'s ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', and ran for 14 seasons and 321 episodes. On January 12, 2016, [[The CW]] aired an hour-long special celebrating the series' 20th anniversary. A large portion of the original cast returned. An eight-episode revival featuring a brand new cast premiered on July 26, 2016.

Animated ''Spy vs. Spy'' sequences were also seen in TV ads for [[Mountain Dew]] soda in 2004.&lt;ref name=zine/&gt;

In September 2010, [[Cartoon Network]] began airing the animated series ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'', from [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and executive producer Sam Register (''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''). The series aired short animated vignettes about current television shows, films, games and other aspects of popular culture. Much like ''Mad TV's'', this series also features appearances by ''Spy vs. Spy'' and Don Martin cartoons. Produced by [[Kevin Shinick]] (''[[Robot Chicken]]'') and Mark Marek (''[[KaBlam!]]'', ''[[The Andy Milonakis Show]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/17321.html|title=ICv2|work=ICv2|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series ran from September 6, 2010, to December 2, 2013, lasting for four seasons and 103 episodes.

===Computer software===
[[File:Totallymad.jpg|thumb|right]]
In 1984, the ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'' characters were given their own computer game [[Spy vs. Spy (1984 video game)|series]], in which players could set traps for each other. The games were made for various computer systems such as the [[Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. Whereas the original game took place in a nondescript building, the sequels transposed the action to a desert island for ''Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper'' and a polar setting for ''Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics''.

Not to be confused with the later television show, ''[[Mad TV (video game)|Mad TV]]'' is a television station management simulation computer game produced in 1991 by Rainbow Arts for the Mad franchise. It was released on the PC and the Amiga. It is faithful to the magazine's general style of cartoon humor, but does not include any of the original characters except for a brief closeup of Alfred E. Neuman's eyes during the opening screens.

In 1996, ''Mad'' #350 included a CD-ROM featuring ''Mad''-related software as well as three audio files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idido.com/MAD/MAD_CD.html "Mad CD Bytes: Mad Bungles Bundle with Release of First CD-ROM: 27 Megabytes of Dubious Material in PC-Only Format"], ''idio'', September 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Brøderbund]]/[[The Learning Company]] released ''Totally Mad,'' a [[Microsoft Windows]] 95/98 compatible CD-ROM set collecting the magazine's content from #1 through #376 (December 1998), plus over 100 ''Mad Specials'' including most of the recorded audio inserts. Despite the title, it omitted a handful of articles due to problems clearing the rights on some book excerpts and text taken from recordings, such as [[Andy Griffith]]'s "[[What It Was, Was Football]]". In 2006, Graphic Imaging Technology's DVD-ROM ''Absolutely Mad'' updated the original ''Totally Mad'' content through 2005. A single seven-gigabyte disc, it is missing the same deleted material from the 1999 collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madcoversite.com/missing.html |title=Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site - Articles mysteriously missing from the Totally Mad CD ROM |website=Madcoversite.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the earlier release in that it is [[Macintosh]] compatible.

In 2011-2013 he served in the [[Armed Forces of Armenia|Armenian Armed Forces]].
 
== Records ==
Until 18, Manvel also tried himself in [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[freestyle wrestling]]. Manvel set his 11th record in Armenia when he was only 17. His first record was set in Dyutsaznagirk by doing sit up - abdominal exercise for 2 h. 46 min for 3511 reps. For the second time he appeared in Dyutsaznagirk for the most push-ups with one arm using back of the hand in one minute - 89 reps.

=== 2016-2017 ===
On 25 August, 2016 Manvel dedicated his record in memory of the victims of [[2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes|April Four-Day War]] unleashed in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]by [[Azerbaijan]]. In response to the murder of Hayk Torosyan, Hrant Gharibyan and his compatriot [[Kyaram Sloyan]] by Azeris, Manvel Mamoyan set a new record:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/arm/news/219401/|title=Մամոյանը Գինեսի ռեկորդ է սահմանել՝ նվիրելով այն ապրիլյան պատերազմի զոհերին|last=|first=|date=|website=www.panarmenian.net|publisher=|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in August, 2016 he couldn’t exceed the record (84 push-ups) of the Canadian Roy Berger from his first performance in the [[Freedom Square, Yerevan]], by reaching 83 reps. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yerkirmedia.am/sport/manvel-mamoyan-gines-rekord/|title=Մանվել Մամոյանը գետնին բռունցքների վրա հրում-ծալում վարժությունում սահմանեց Գինեսի նոր ռեկորդ|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.armeniasputnik.am/video/20160825/4730406.html|title=В память о погибших во время апрельской войны в Карабахе военнослужащих Мамоян выполнил упражнение отжимание от пола на кулаках в армянской военной форме|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ru.armeniasputnik.am|publisher=|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Guinness World Records’ rules the athlete has a right to perform the exercise for 3 sets. Manvel managed to set the desired record from his second performance, after having a rest. By doing push-ups for 86 reps in a minute, the athlete exceeded the previous record and set a record in the Guinness World Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/watch-guy-set-world-record-knuckle-pushups/|title= Watch This Guy Set the World Record for Knuckle Pushups|website=www.mensjournal.com|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armenpress.am/arm/news/858735|title=Մանվել Մամոյանը վստահ է` կարող է դառնալ Գինեսի ռեկորդների քանակով բացարձակ առաջատար|website=www.armenpress.am|publisher=[[Armenpress]]|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsarmenia.am/news/sport/dostizhenie-ezidskogo-sportsmena-manvela-mamoyana-vnov-pretenduet-na-knigu-rekordov-ginnessa/|title=Достижение спортсмена Манвела Мамояна вновь претендует на Книгу Гиннесса (ВИДЕО)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.newsarmenia.am|publisher=|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentron.tv/news/10977.html|title=Մանվել Մամոյանը նոր ռեկորդը նվիրել է հայ զինվորներին|last=|first=|date=|website=www.www.kentron.tv|publisher=|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one his interviews Manvel told  about his desire to set 10 records in Guinness World Records in a year, particularly by through the Flag exercise, which was set as a record a few years ago by him and was performed for only 20 seconds. It was included in Dyutsaznagirk. He also mentioned he strives to set records more for Guinness World Records. In 2016 Manvel fell behind 5-6 seconds of setting a new world record and the record was 1 min. 5 sec. 71 millisec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armtimes.com/hy/article/80314|title= Մանվել Մամոյան. ցանկանում եմ 1 տարում «Գինեսի» 10 ռեկորդ սահմանել|website=www.armtimes.com|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rusarminfo.ru/2016/05/06/kniga-rekordov-ginnesa-opublikovala-videozapis-rekorda-armyanskogo-atleta|title= Книга рекордов Гиннеса опубликовала видеозапись рекорда армянского атлета|website=www.rusarminfo.ru|accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Musée d'Orsay, North-West view, Paris 7e 140402.jpg|thumb|left|The Musée d'Orsay as seen from the [[Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor]]]]
[[Image:MuseedOrsayParisFrance.jpg|thumb|left|Musée d'Orsay Clock, [[Victor Laloux]], Main Hall]]
[[Image:Paryż orsay.JPG|thumb|left|170px|The interior of the museum.]]
The museum building was originally a railway station, [[Gare d'Orsay]], constructed for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans]] and finished in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Exposition Universelle]] to the design of three architects: [[Lucien Magne]], [[Émile Bénard]] and [[Victor Laloux]]. It was the terminus for the railways of southwestern France until 1939.

By 1939 the station's short platforms had become unsuitable for the longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services. After 1939 it was used for suburban services and part of it became a mailing centre during World War II. It was then used as a set for several films, such as [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'' adapted by [[Orson Welles]], and as a haven for the [[Madeleine Renaud|Renaud]]–[[Jean-Louis Barrault|Barrault]] Theatre Company and for auctioneers, while the [[Hôtel Drouot]] was being rebuilt. 

In 1970, permission was granted to demolish the station but [[Jacques Duhamel]], Minister for Cultural Affairs, ruled against plans to build a new hotel in its stead. The station was put on the supplementary list of Historic Monuments and finally listed in 1978. The suggestion to turn the station into a museum came from the Directorate of the Museums of France. The idea was to build a museum that would bridge the gap between the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]] and the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne|National Museum of Modern Art]] at the [[Centre Pompidou|Georges Pompidou Centre]]. The plan was accepted by [[Georges Pompidou]] and a study was commissioned in 1974. In 1978, a competition was organized to design the new museum.  ACT Architecture, a team of three young architects (Pierre Colboc, Renaud Bardon and Jean-Paul Philippon), were awarded the contract which involved creating {{convert|20,000|m2|sqft}} of new floorspace on four floors. The construction work was carried out by [[Bouygues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bouygues.com/us/groupe/fiches/pop_musee_orsay.html |title=Bouygues website: Musée d'Orsay |publisher=Bouygues.com |date= |accessdate=20 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205220921/http://www.bouygues.com/us/groupe/fiches/pop_musee_orsay.html |archivedate=5 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the Italian architect [[Gae Aulenti]] was chosen to design the interior including the internal arrangement, decoration, furniture and fittings of the museum. Finally in July 1986, the museum was ready to receive its exhibits. It took 6 months to install the 2000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works. The museum officially opened in December 1986 by then-president [[François Mitterrand]].

The '''National Museum of Cinema''' (''Museo Nazionale del Cinema'') located in [[Turin]], is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[motion picture]] [[museum]], fitted out inside the [[Mole Antonelliana]] tower. It is operated by the ''Maria Adriana Prolo Foundation'', and the core of its collection is the result of the work of the historian and collector {{Interlanguage link multi|Maria Adriana Prolo|it}}. It was housed in the ''[[Palazzo Chiablese]]''.

In 2008, with 532,196 visitors, it reached the thirteenth place among the most visited Italian museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.touring.it/store/document/21_file.pdf Touring Club Italiano - Dossier Musei 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AsJDV3Pn?url=http://static.touring.it/store/document/21_file.pdf |date=2012-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition ==
The museum houses pre-cinematographic optical devices such as [[magic lantern]]s, earlier and current film technologies, stage items from early Italian movies and other memorabilia.

Along the exhibition path of about 35.000 square feet (3.200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on five levels, it is possible to visit some areas devoted to the different kinds of [[film crew]], and in the main hall, fitted in the temple hall of the Mole (which was a building originally intended as a [[synagogue]]), a series of [[chapel]]s representing several [[film genres]].

The museum keeps a huge and growing collection of [[film poster]]s, [[film stock|stocks]], and a [[library]]: at present it includes 20,000 devices, paintings and printed artworks, more than 80,000 pictures, over 300,000 film posters, 12,000 movie reels and 26,000 books (as of February 2006). A movie screen located in the ''Massimo'' [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], near to the museum, is reserved to [[retrospective]]s and other museum initiatives. The museum hosts several [[film festival]]s, the major and most prestigious of them being the [[Torino Film Festival]].

Inside the museum there is also a panoramic elevator (opened in 2000) with transparent glass walls, that cover its 75 meters ride in 59 seconds, in the single open space span of the building, without middle floors, up to the "small temple" which gives a 360 degrees panoramic view of the city. It is the museum with the biggest vertical extension of the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1182">[[Image:Pulmonaria officinalis 800.jpg|thumb|[[Lungwort]] (''Pulmonaria officinalis'') - the plant's botanical name suggests its pharmaceutical use]]

'''Officinal''' [[medication|drugs]], [[plant]]s and [[herb]]s are those which are sold in a [[chemist]] or [[druggist]] shop. Officinal medical preparations of such drugs are made in accordance with the [[medical prescription|prescriptions]] authorized by a [[pharmacopoeia]]. ''Officinal'' is not related to the word ''official''. The [[classical Latin]] ''officina'' meant a [[workshop]], manufactory, [[laboratory]], and in [[medieval Latin]] was applied to a general storeroom. It thus became applied to a shop where goods were sold rather than a place where things were made.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=22}} Whereas official descends from officium, meaning office, as in duty or position.

In [[botanical nomenclature]], the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''officinalis'' derives from a plant's historical use in [[pharmacology]].

[[File:Excavations_at_Oxyrhynchus_1_ca_1903_B.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''Oxyrhynchus Papyri''' are a group of [[manuscript]]s discovered during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by [[papyrology|papyrologists]] [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Surridge Hunt]] at an ancient rubbish dump near [[Oxyrhynchus]] in [[Egypt]] ({{coord|28|32|N|30|40|E|}}, modern ''el-Bahnasa'').

The manuscripts date from the time of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] (3rd century BC) and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] periods of Egyptian history (from [[Final War of the Roman Republic|32 BC]] to the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in 640 AD).

Only an estimated 10% are  literary in nature. Most of the papyri found seem to consist mainly of public and private documents: codes, edicts, registers, official correspondence, census-returns, tax-assessments, petitions, court-records, sales, leases, wills, bills, accounts, inventories, horoscopes, and private letters.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Nickolaos Gonis from University College London, in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEJ0hqbu904 a film] from the British Arts and Humanities Research Council on Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the papyri were written in [[Greek language|Greek]], some texts written in Egyptian ([[Egyptian hieroglyphics]], [[Hieratic]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], mostly [[Coptic language|Coptic]]), [[Latin]] and [[Arabic]] were also found. Texts in [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] have so far represented only a small percentage of the total.&lt;ref&gt;World Archaeology [https://www.world-archaeology.com/features/oxyrnchus.htm Issue 36], 7 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1898 academics have puzzled together and transcribed over 5000 documents from what were originally hundreds of boxes of papyrus fragments the size of large cornflakes. This is thought to represent only 1 to 2 percent of what is estimated to be at least half a million papyri still remaining to be conserved, transcribed, deciphered and catalogued.

Oxyrhynchus Papyri are currently housed in institutions all over the world. A substantial number are housed in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]]. There is an on-line table of contents briefly listing the type of contents of each papyrus or fragment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/POxy/papyri/tocframe.htm Search by table of contents]; {{cite web|url=http://163.1.169.40/cgi-bin/library?site=localhost&amp;a=p&amp;p=about&amp;c=POxy&amp;ct=0&amp;l=en&amp;w=utf-8|title=Oxyrhynchus Online Image Database|publisher=Imaging Papyri Project|date=|accessdate=25 May 2007}} A listing of what each fragment contains.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular Texts==
Although most of the texts uncovered at Oxyrhynchus were non-literary in nature, the archaeologists succeeded in recovering a large corpus of literary works that had previously been thought to have been lost. Many of these texts had previously been unknown to modern scholars.

===Greek===
Several fragments can be traced to the work of [[Plato]], for instance the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', or the dialogue ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', dated around 200-300 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/oxyrhynchuspapyr15gren#page/186/mode/2up/search/plato|title=The Oxyrhynchus papyri|authors=Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt|year=1898|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historiography====
Another important discovery was a papyrus codex containing a significant portion of the treatise ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|The Constitution of the Athenians]]'', which was attributed to [[Aristotle]] and had previously been thought to have been lost forever.&lt;ref&gt;F. Blass, in ''Hermes'' '''15''' (1880:366-82); the text was identified as Aristotle's ''Athenaion Politeia'' by T. Bergk in 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second, more extensive papyrus text was purchased in Egypt by an American missionary in 1890. [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] of the [[British Museum]] acquired it later that year, and the first edition of it by British [[Paleography|paleographer]] [[Frederic G. Kenyon]] was published in January, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Peter John Rhodes. ''A Commentary on the Aristotelian Athenaion Politeia'' (Oxford University Press), 1981, 1993: introduction, pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The treatise revealed a massive quantity of reliable information about historical periods that classicists previously had very little knowledge of. Two modern historians even went so far as to state that "the discovery of this treatise constitutes almost a new epoch in Greek historical study."&lt;ref&gt;J. Mitchell and M. Caspari (eds.), p. xxvii,  ''A History of Greece: From the Time of Solon to 403 B.C.", George Grote, Routledge 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, 21–22, 26.2–4, and 39–40 of the work contain factual information not found in any other extant ancient text.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, 1981, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of a historical work known as the ''[[Hellenica Oxyrhynchia]]'' also revealed new information about classical antiquity. The identity of the author of the work is unknown; many early scholars proposed that it may have been written by [[Ephorus]] or [[Theopompus]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal |last=Goligher |first=W. A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1908 |month= |title=The New Greek Historical Fragment Attributed to Theopompus or Cratippus |journal=English Historical Review |volume=23 |issue=90 |pages=277–283 |doi= 10.1093/ehr/xxiii.xc.277|jstor= 550009|quote= |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; but many modern scholars are now convinced that it was written by [[Cratippus of Athens|Cratippus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Harding | first = Philipp | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1987 | month = | title = The Authorship of the Hellenika Oxyrhynchia | journal = The Ancient History Bulletin | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 101&amp;ndash;104 | issn = 0835-3638 | url = | accessdate = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has won praise for its style and accuracy&lt;ref name="Meister2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Classical Dictionary |chapter=Oxyrhynchus, the historian from |last=Meister |first=Klaus |editor=[[Simon Hornblower|Hornblower, Simon]] |editor2=Spawforth Antony (ed.) |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-866172-X |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has even been compared favorably with the works of [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref name="Westlake1960"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Westlake | first = H.

====Mathematics====
[[File:Oxyrhynchus papyrus with Euclid's Elements.jpg|right|thumb|250px|One of the oldest surviving fragments of [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements'', found at Oxyrhynchus and dated to circa AD 100 ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29|P. Oxy. 29]]). The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5.&lt;ref name=Casselman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/Euclid/papyrus/papyrus.html |title=One of the Oldest Extant Diagrams from Euclid |author=[[Bill Casselman (mathematician)|Bill Casselman]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |publisher=University of British Columbia |accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The findings at Oxyrhynchus also turned up the oldest and most complete diagrams from [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref name=Casselman/&gt; Fragments of [[Euclid]] discovered led to a re-evaluation of the accuracy of ancient sources for ''The Elements'', revealing that the version of [[Theon of Alexandria]] has more authority than previously believed, according to [[Thomas Little Heath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofgreekma01heat#page/358/mode/2up/search/358|title=A history of Greek mathematics|author=Thomas Little Heath|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drama====
[[File:P.Oxy. IX 1174 col. iv-v.jpg|thumb|right|Lines 96&amp;ndash;138 of the ''[[Ichneutae]]'' on a fragment of Papyrus Oxyrhynchus IX 1174 col. iv&amp;ndash;v, which provides the majority of the surviving portion of the play]]

The classical author who has most benefited from the finds at Oxyrhynchus is the [[Athens|Athenian]] playwright [[Menander]] (342&amp;ndash;291 BC), whose comedies were very popular in Hellenistic times and whose works are frequently found in papyrus fragments. Menander's plays found in fragments at Oxyrhynchus include ''Misoumenos'', ''Dis Exapaton'', ''Epitrepontes'', ''Karchedonios'', ''[[Dyskolos]]'' and ''Kolax''. The works found at Oxyrhynchus have greatly raised Menander's status among classicists and scholars of [[Greek theatre]].

Another notable text uncovered at Oxyrhynchus was ''[[Ichneutae]]'', a previously unknown play written by [[Sophocles]]. The discovery of ''Ichneutae'' was especially significant since ''Ichneutae'' is a [[satyr play]], making it only one of two extant satyr plays, with the other one being Euripides's ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=M. L.|title=Ancient Greek Music|date=1994|publisher=Clarendon Press at the Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0198149750|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ancient_Greek_Music.html?id=So-Qpz6WDS4C|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles' ''Ichneutae'' was adapted, in 1988, into a play entitled ''[[The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus]]'', by British poet and author [[Tony Harrison]], featuring Grenfell and Hunt as main characters.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive remains of the ''Hypsipyle'' of [[Euripides]] and a life of [[Euripides]] by [[Satyrus the Peripatetic]] were also found at Oxyrhynchus.

====Poetry====
[[File:P. Oxy. 20.jpg|thumb|[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 20|P. Oxy. 20]], verso]]

* Poems of [[Pindar]]. Pindar was the first known Greek poet to reflect on the nature of poetry and on the poet's role.
* Fragments of [[Sappho]], Greek poet from the island of [[Lesbos]] famous for her poems about love. 
* Fragments of [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]],  an older contemporary and an alleged lover of Sappho, with whom he may have exchanged poems.
* Larger pieces of [[Alcman]], [[Ibycus]], and [[Corinna]].
* Passages from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''. See [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 20]] – ''Iliad'' II.730-828 and [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 21]] – ''Iliad'' II.745-764

===Latin===
An ''[[epitome]]'' of seven of the 107 lost books of [[Livy]] was the most important literary find in [[Latin language|Latin]].

==Christian texts==
{{Main|Biblical manuscript}}
Among the Christian texts found at Oxyrhynchus, were fragments of early non-[[Biblical canon|canonical]] Gospels, [[Oxyrhynchus Gospels|''Oxyrhynchus 840'']] (3rd century AD) and ''[[Oxyrhynchus 1224]]'' (4th century AD). Other Oxyrhynchus texts preserve parts of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 1 (3rd century: ''P2'' and ''P401''), 11&amp;ndash;12 and 19 (3rd to 4th century: ''P2384,'' ''2385''); [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10&amp;ndash;11 (5th to 6th century: ''P3''); [[Gospel of John|John]] 1 and ''20'' (3rd century: ''P208''); [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1 (4th century: ''P209''); the [[First Epistle of John]] (4th-5th century: ''P402''); the [[Greek Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]] (chapters 12&amp;ndash;14; 4th or 5th century: ''P403''); the ''[[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]'' (3rd century AD: ''P655''); ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'' (3rd or 4th century: ''P404''), and a work of [[Irenaeus]], (3rd century: ''P405''). There are many parts of other canonical books as well as many early Christian hymns, prayers, and letters also found among them.

All manuscripts classified as "theological" in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri are listed below. A few manuscripts that belong to multiple genres, or genres that are inconsistently treated in the volumes of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, are also included. For example, the quotation from [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 90 (P. Oxy. XVI 1928) associated with an amulet, is classified according to its primary genre as a magic text in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri; however, it is included here among witnesses to the Old Testament text. In each volume that contains theological manuscripts, they are listed first, according to an English tradition of academic precedence (see [[Doctor of Divinity]]).

===Old Testament===
{{Main|Old Testament}}
[[File:UPennE3074.jpg|thumb|right|250px|P. Oxy. VI 846: [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 2 (LXX)]]
The original [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) was translated into Greek between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC. This translation is called the [[Septuagint]] (or LXX, both 70 in Latin), because there is a tradition that seventy [[Jew]]ish scribes compiled it in [[Alexandria]]. It was quoted in the New Testament and is found bound together with the New Testament in the 4th and 5th century Greek [[uncial]] codices [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrinus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]]. The Septuagint included books, called the [[Apocrypha]] or [[Deuterocanonical]] by [[Christian]]s, which were later not accepted into the [[Jew]]ish [[Tanakh|canon]] of sacred writings (see [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri#Apocrypha|next section]]). Portions of Old Testament books of undisputed authority found among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri are listed in this section.
*The first number (Vol) is the volume of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri in which the manuscript is published.
*The second number (Oxy) is the overall publication sequence number in Oxyrhynchus Papyri.
*Standard abbreviated citation of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri is:
::P. Oxy. &lt;volume in [[Roman numerals]]&gt; &lt;publication sequence number&gt;.
*Context will always make clear whether volume 70 of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri or the Septuagint is intended.
*P. Oxy. VIII 1073 is an [[Old Latin]] version of Genesis, other manuscripts are probably copies of the Septuagint.
*Dates are estimated to the nearest 50 year increment.
*Content is given to the nearest verse where known.

====Old Testament Deuterocanon (or, Apocrypha)====
This name designates several, unique writings (e.g., the [[Book of Tobit]]) or different versions of pre-existing writings (e.g., the [[Book of Daniel]]) found in the [[biblical canon|canon]] of the [[Jewish]] scriptures (most notably, in the Septuagint translation of the [[Hebrew]] ''[[Tanakh]]'').  Although those writings were no longer viewed as having a [[Biblical canon|canonical]] status amongst [[Jews]] by the beginning of the second century A.D., they retained that status for much of the [[Christian]] Church.  They were and are accepted as part of the Old Testament canon by the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]].  [[Protestant]] Christians, however, follow the example of the Jews and do not accept these writings as part of the Old Testament canon.

*PP. Oxy. XIII 1594 and LXV 4444 are vellum ("vellum" noted in table).
*Both copies of Tobit are different editions to the known Septuagint text ("not LXX" noted in table).

===New Testament===
[[File:Papyrus1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Papyrus {{Papyrus link|1}}: [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 1]]
{{Main|New Testament}}
The Oxyrhynchus Papyri have provided the most numerous sub-group of the earliest copies of the [[New Testament]]. These are surviving portions of [[Codex|codices]] (books) written in Greek [[uncial]] (capital) letters on [[papyrus]]. The first of these were [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] by [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Hunt|Arthur Surridge Hunt]] in Oxyrhynchus, at the turn of the 20th century. Of the 127 registered [[List of New Testament papyri|New Testament papyri]], 52 (41%) are from Oxyrhynchus. The earliest of the papyri are dated to the middle of the 2nd century, so were copied within about a century of the writing of the original New Testament documents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th edition, (Stuttgart: [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenfell and Hunt discovered the first New Testament papyrus ({{Papyrus link|1}}), on only the second day of excavation, in the winter of 1896–7. This, together with the other early discoveries, was published in 1898, in the first volume of the now 70-volume work, ''The Oxyrhynchus Papyri''.&lt;ref&gt;Philip W Comfort and David P Barrett. ''The Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts''. Wheaton, Illinois: [[Tyndale House|Tyndale House Publishers Incorporated]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The third column (CRG) refers to the now standard sequences of [[Caspar René Gregory]].
*&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt; indicates a papyrus manuscript, a number beginning with zero indicates vellum.
*The CRG number is an adequate abbreviated citation for New Testament manuscripts.
*Content is given to the nearest chapter; verses are sometimes listed.

====New Testament Apocrypha====
The Oxyrhynchus Papyri collection contains around twenty manuscripts of [[New Testament apocrypha]], works from the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] period that presented themselves as biblical books, but were not eventually received as such by the [[orthodoxy]]. These works found at Oxyrhynchus include the gospels of [[Gospel of Thomas|Thomas]], [[Gospel of Mary|Mary]], [[Gospel of Peter|Peter]], [[Gospel of James|James]], ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]],'' and the ''[[Didache]].'' Among this collection are also a few manuscripts of [[Oxyrhynchus Gospels|unknown gospels]]. The three manuscripts of Thomas represent the only known [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of this work; the only other surviving manuscript of Thomas is a nearly complete [[Coptic language|Coptic]] manuscript from the [[Nag Hammadi]] find.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Peter. [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas.html "Gospel of Thomas"] (2001-2006) ''earlychristianwritings.com'' Retrieved June 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; P. Oxy. 4706, a manuscript of ''The Shepherd of Hermas,'' is notable because two sections believed by scholars to have been often circulated independently, ''Visions'' and ''Commandments'', were found on the same roll.&lt;ref&gt;Barbantani, Silvia. "Review: Gonis (N.), Obbink (D.) [et al.] (edd., trans.) ''The Oxyrhynchus Papyri. Volume LXIX. (Graeco-Roman Memoirs 89.)''" (2007) ''The Classical Review,'' 57:1 p.66 [[Cambridge University Press]] {{doi|10.1017/S0009840X06003209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* P. Oxy. V 840 and P. Oxy. XV 1782 are vellum
* 2949?, 3525, 3529? 4705, and 4706 are rolls, the rest codices.

In '''''Phato v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape &amp; Another; Commissioner of the South African Police Services v Attorney-General, Eastern Cape &amp; Others''''', in two applications, which were combined for the purposes of the [[Judgment (law)|judgment]], the issue was the right of an [[Criminal charge|accused]] to access to the [[police docket]] relating to the accused's impending [[trial]] in a [[magistrate's court]] on a charge under the [[Witchcraft Suppression Act 3 of 1957]].

In the first application, the applicant was the accused, who contended that he was entitled to this [[information]] by virtue of the provisions of section 23 and section 25(3) of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]].

In the second application, the applicant was the [[Commissioner]] of [[South African Police Service|SAPS]] who wished for an [[Court order|order]] declaring that the privilege which existed in respect of the contents of police dockets immediately prior to the commencement of the Constitution was not repealed or amended by section 23, but that the accused was entitled before trial only to copies of all medical, hospital and autopsy reports; summaries of other expert evidence to be tendered by the State; and copies of all documents relating to identification parades.

The Commissioner argued that the State was only required to furnish an accused with such information as he required, in the narrow sense, to exercise his [[right to a fair trial]], i.e. a trial in an [[adversarial system]] of [[litigation]] which recognised various privileges from having to disclose certain information to the other side as being paramount to its proper operation. This included the docket privilege of [[South African law]].

The court held that the practices of the past whereby the State retained tight control of almost all available information relevant to a criminal prosecution was inconsistent with modern values of [[openness]] and [[accountability]] in a [[democratically]] oriented administration.

Thus the court held that section 23 gave an accused the right to access to the information contained in the police docket for the exercise and protection of his right to a fair criminal trial.

The Commissioner argued that the judgment in ''[[R v Stinchcombe]]'' permitted [[Non-disclosure of evidence|non-disclosure]] of witness statements on grounds of privilege, and that this privilege included [[South Africa]]n docket privilege.

The court held that, whereas in [[Canada]], the state had a discretion to withhold information which would ordinarily be disclosed, the South African Constitution’s inclusion of section 23 meant that there was a protected right to information.

The court thus ordered that the respondents furnish the applicant with witness statements, and all exhibits, plans and diagrams in the police docket, if any, and give the applicant access to the remaining information in the docket.

'''Roberto Fiore''' (born 15 April 1959 in [[Rome]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] politician and a founding member of the European [[Third Position]] (Terza Posizione) movement which is against both communism and capitalism. He is the leader of the Italian party [[Forza Nuova]]. He self-identified as a [[neofascism|fascist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/06/davidpallister | title=Neo-fascist clear to resume charity role | work=The Guardian | date=August 6, 1999 | accessdate=26 August 2013 | author=Pallister, David |quote=Mr Fiore told the Guardian he was "pleased the Charity Commission has found there has been nothing illegal". He said he was quite happy to be described as a fascist but he denied that Saint George promoted anti-semitic literature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
After the police found a large quantity of explosives and weapons in a local office of the political organization [[Terza Posizione]] in the 1980s, Roberto Fiore  migrated to the [[United Kingdom]] in order to avoid arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Trocino. Fiore e il «contagio fascista»: un passato che non passa nonostante il doppio petto. Corriere della Sera, 21 marzo 2008. URL read the 11.2.2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Merlo.

Fiore denied any connections to British intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fascist Charity Boss Recruited to Spy for MI6 | publisher = Sunday Express | date = 2000-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The allegation that he worked for MI6 was also made in para 2.12.11 of the Report drawn up on behalf of the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia, 1991 (The Ford Report)&lt;ref&gt;http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/report-drawn-up-on-behalf-of-the-committee-of-inquiry-into-racism-and-xenophobia-on-the-findings-of-the-committee-of-inquiry-pbAX5990815/downloads/AX-59-90-815-EN-C/AX5990815ENC_002.pdf;pgid=y8dIS7GUWMdSR0EAlMEUUsWb0000opnPGLPd;sid=Yp8rHMbwZ_0rHYgq3061u6TVwFxXTIuTfO0=?FileName=AX5990815ENC_002.pdf&amp;SKU=AX5990815ENC_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=AX-59-90-815-EN-C&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
Fiore is generally considered to be a [[neofascist]] leader.&lt;ref name="Bar-On2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tamir Bar-On|title=Rethinking the French New Right: Alternatives to Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_H4_3bgFVcC&amp;pg=PT13|accessdate=26 August 2013|date=12 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96633-1|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen E.

Fiore had connections with the traditionalist philosopher [[Julius Evola]] and has written about topics such as traditionalism and the third position.

In 1986, thanks to their friendship with Nick Griffin and other far right activists, Roberto Fiore and [[Massimo Morsello]] managed to found "Meeting Point", which was later renamed "Easy London". Easy London is a society that helps young students and workers live and work in London by providing jobs, beds and contracts. Fiore's association with [[London]] has remained as, in August 2007, he became sole director of CL English Language, a college for overseas students in the west of the city.&lt;ref name=College&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/29/thefarright.italy|title=Language school run by Italian fascist leader |publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 29, 2008 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Cobain | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiore has since returned to Italy and is active in politics as the leader of the nationalist [[Forza Nuova]] party (a group he co-founded with Morsello), one of the constituent parts of [[Alternativa Sociale]], allied in the [[House of Freedoms]] for the 2006 political elections in Italy. The party Forza Nuova, has been defined as "nazi-fascist formation" by two verdicts of Court of Cassation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/01/06/news/fascismo_milano_manifestazione_forza_nuova-155504394/?ref=search|title=Forza Nuova, polemiche sul manifesto per il corteo in centro: "Apologia del fascismo, Sala vieti il raduno" |publisher=[[La Repubblica|Repubblica]]|date=January 6, 2017 | location=Rome | first=PAOLO | last=BERIZZI | accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he joined as a speaker on the [[Identitarian movement|identitarian]] Nordic Festival (Nordiska Festivalen) in Sweden where he spoke about European identity and unity. He participated in [[Budapest]] on 23 October 2008 to the commemorations of the Hungarian Insurrection against control by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1956, at the invitation of the Hungarian [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movement [[Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement|HVIM]]. He also took up the seat in the [[European Parliament]] vacated by [[Alessandra Mussolini]]. In 2009 he gave a speech at the [[British National Party]]'s annual Red White &amp; Blue Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://bnptv.org.uk/2009/08/italian-roberto-fiore-of-the-forza-nuova-party/|title=Italian Roberto Fiore of the 'Forza Nuova |date=August 29, 2009
|first= |last= |publisher=BNP TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 he led demonstrations of [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]] against the recent surge of illegal immigrants to the island of [[Lampedusa]], which had left the islanders outnumbered, stating to a crowd of people that: "Local people are now asking us to help secure the beaches, and if the Government continues to fail in its duty to protect the people, and also the territorial integrity of Italy and Europe, we will take up that challenge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/italian-nationalists-stand-against-african-immigrant-invasion# |title=Italian Nationalists Stand against African Immigrant Invasion |date=August 29, 2009  |first= Jennifer |last=Matthys |publisher=www.bnp.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sanctuary city''' ({{Lang-fr|ville sanctuaire}}, {{Lang-es|ciudad santuario}}) refers to municipal jurisdictions, typically in North America and Western Europe, that limit their cooperation with the national government's effort to enforce immigration law. Leaders of sanctuary cities want to reduce the fear of deportation and possible family break-up among people who are in the country [[Illegal immigration#Legal and political status|illegally]], so that such people will be more willing to report crimes, use health and social services, and enroll their children in school. In the United States, municipal policies include prohibiting police or city employees from questioning people about their immigration status and refusing requests by national immigration authorities to detain people beyond their release date, if they were jailed for breaking local law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2015/10/11/dallas-county-sheriff-eases-immigration-holds-on-minor-offenses|title=Dallas County sheriff eases immigration holds on minor offenses|last=|first=|date=October 11, 2015|publisher=The Dallas Morning News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such policies can be set expressly in law (''[[de jure]]'') or observed in practice (''[[de facto]]''), but the designation "sanctuary city" does not have a precise legal definition. The Federation for American Immigration Reform estimated in 2018 that more than 500 U.S. jurisdictions, including states and municipalities, had adopted sanctuary policies.&lt;ref name="Fair"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/10/half-of-americans-now-live-in-sanctuaries/|title=Half of all Americans now live in ‘sanctuaries’ protecting immigrants|last=Dinan|first=Stephen|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on the relationship between sanctuary status and crime have found that sanctuary policies either have no effect on crime or that sanctuary cities have lower crime rates and stronger economies than comparable non-sanctuary cities.&lt;ref name="Loren Collingwood, Benjamin Gonzalez-O'Brien &amp; Stephen El-Khatib Oct"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/03/sanctuary-cities-do-not-experience-an-increase-in-crime/|title=Sanctuary cities do not experience an increase in crime|author=Loren Collingwood, Benjamin Gonzalez-O'Brien &amp; Stephen El-Khatib Oct|date=October 3, 2016|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/|title=The Effects of Sanctuary Policies on Crime and the Economy|date=January 26, 2017|publisher=Center for American Progress|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez|first=Daniel E.|last2=Martínez-Schuldt|first2=Ricardo D.|last3=Cantor|first3=Guillermo|date=2017|title=Providing Sanctuary or Fostering Crime?

European cities have been inspired by the same political currents of the [[sanctuary movement]] as American cities, but the term "sanctuary city" now has different meanings in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="LippertRehaag2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Randy K.

Such cities are now found in 80 towns, cities and local areas in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="eveningtimes.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13289560.City_offering_sanctuary_to_refugees_from_Syria/ |first=Vivienne |last=Nicoll |title=City offering sanctuary to refugees from Syria |work=Evening Times |date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis is on building bridges of connection and understanding, which is done through raising awareness, befriending schemes and forming cultural connections in the arts, sport, health, education, faith groups and other sectors of society.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/may/10/refugees-sheffield-g4s-serco-asylumseekers-cityofsanctuary |first=Marishka |last=Van Steenbergen |title=City of Sanctuary concern for welfare of asylum seekers as housing contract goes to private security firm |work=The Guardian |date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow]] and [[Swansea]] have become known as noted sanctuary cities.&lt;ref name="eveningtimes.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swansea.cityofsanctuary.org/"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://swansea.cityofsanctuary.org/|title=Swansea City of Sanctuary - Building a culture of hospitality for people seeking sanctuary|work=swansea.cityofsanctuary.org|access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adamtomforrest.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sanctuary City |first=Adam |last=Forrest |work=[[The Big Issue]] |date=14 June 2010|url=https://adamtomforrest.com/2013/09/24/sanctuary-city/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition== 
The concept of a sanctuary city goes back thousands of years. It has been associated with [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Baha'i]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="SCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137480378|title=Sanctuary City – A Suspended State – J. Bagelman – Palgrave Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Western Civilization]], sanctuary cities can be traced back to the [[Old Testament]].  The [[Book of Numbers]] commands the selection of six [[cities of refuge]] in which the perpetrators of accidental [[manslaughter]] could claim the [[right of asylum]].  Outside of these cities, [[blood vengeance]] against such perpetrators was allowed by law.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Bruce M. |editor1-last=Metzger |editor1-link=Bruce M. Metzger |editor2-first=Michael D. |editor2-last=Coogan |editor2-link=Michael Coogan |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-504645-5 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In AD 392, Christian Roman emperor [[Theodosius I]] set up sanctuaries under church control.  In AD 600 in medieval England, churches were given a general right of sanctuary, and some cities were set up as sanctuaries by [[Royal charter]].  The general right of sanctuary for churches in England was abolished in 1621.&lt;ref name="SCS"/&gt;

=== History ===
The movement that established sanctuary cities in the United States&amp;nbsp;began in the early 1980s.The movement&amp;nbsp;traces its roots to religious philosophy, as well as in histories of resistance movements to perceived state injustices.&lt;ref&gt;Paik, Naomi (June 2017). "Abolitionist futures and the US sanctuary movement".&amp;nbsp;''Sage''.&amp;nbsp;'''59''': 3–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The sanctuary city movement took place in the 1980s to challenge the US government’s refusal to grant asylum to certain Central American refugees. These asylum seekers were arriving from countries in Central America like El Salvador and Guatemala that were politically unstable. More than 75,000 Salvadoreans and 200,000 Guatemalans were killed by their governments in hopes to suppress the communist movement in those countries at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bracken, Amy (Dec. 29 2016). "Why You Need To Know About Guatemala's Civil War". ''Public Radio International.''&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Faith based groups in the US Southwest initially drove the movement of the 1980s, with eight churches publicly declaring sanctuary in March 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bauder, Harald(2017-04-01). "Sanctuary Cities: Politics and Practice in International Perspective. International Migration. 55.(2): 174-187. ISSN 1468-2435.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;John Fife, a minister and movement leader famously wrote in a letter to Attorney General William Smith, saying that the "South-side United Presbyterian Church will publicly violate the Immigration and Nationality Act" by allowing sanctuary in its church for those from Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Hilary, God and Caesar at the Rio Grande: sanctuary and the politics of religion (Minneapolis:&amp;nbsp;University of Minnesota Press,&amp;nbsp;1995),&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

A milestone in the U.S. sanctuary city movement occurred in 1985 in San Francisco, which passed the largely symbolic “City of Refuge” resolution.

Several different terms and phrases are used to describe immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The term ''alien'' is "considered insensitive by many" and a [[LexisNexis]] search showed that its use in reports on immigration has declined substantially, making up just 5% of terms used in 2013.&lt;ref name="PewPhasing"&gt;Emily Guskin, [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/17/illegal-undocumented-unauthorized-news-media-shift-language-on-immigration/ 'Illegal,' 'undocumented,' 'unauthorized': News media shift language on immigration"], Pew Research Center (March 17, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the word "illegal" and phrases using the word (e.g., ''illegal alien'', ''illegal immigrant'', ''illegal worker'' and ''illegal migrant'') has declined, accounting for 82% of language used in 1996, 75% in 2002, 60% in 2007, and 57% in 2013.&lt;ref name="PewPhasing"/&gt; Several other phrases are competing for wide acceptance: ''undocumented immigrant'' (usage in news reports increased from 6% in 1996 to 14% in 2013); ''unauthorized immigrant'' (3% usage in 2013 and rarely seen before that time), and ''undocumented person'' or ''undocumented people'' (1% in 2007, increasing to 3% in 2013).&lt;ref name="PewPhasing"/&gt; A recent term is "illegalized immigrant".&lt;ref name="RCIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/rcis/documents/RCIS_RB_Bauder_No_2013_1.pdf|title=Harald Bauder|author=|date=|website=Ryerson.ca|access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media outlets' policies as to use of terms differ, and no consensus has yet emerged in the press.&lt;ref name="Hiltner"&gt;Stephen Hiltner, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/insider/illegal-undocumented-unauthorized-the-terms-of-immigration-reporting.html Illegal, Undocumented, Unauthorized: The Terms of Immigration Reporting], ''New York Times'' (March 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CJR"&gt;Rui Kaneya,

===Electoral politics===
This issue entered presidential politics in the race for the Republican Party Presidential Nomination in 2008. Colorado Congressman[[Tom Tancredo]] ran on an anti-illegal immigration platform and specifically attacked sanctuary cities. Former Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney]] accused Former [[New York City]] Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] of running it as a sanctuary city.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Romney: Giuliani's NYC 'Sanctuary' for undocumented Immigrants |work=ABC News |first=Jake |last=Tapper |author2=Claiborne, Ron  |date=2007-08-08 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3459498&amp;page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Giuliani's campaign responded saying that Governor Romney ran a sanctuary Governor's mansion, and that New York City is not a "haven" for undocumented immigrants.&lt;ref name="ABCNews" /&gt;

==== Trump administration&amp;nbsp;agenda ====
On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Justice Department sued California, Governor [[Jerry Brown]], and the state’s attorney general, [[Xavier Becerra]], over three state laws passed in recent months, saying the laws made it impossible for federal immigration officials to do their jobs and deport criminals who were born outside the United States. The Justice Department called the laws unconstitutional and asked a judge to block them. The lawsuit says the state laws “reflect a deliberate effort by California to obstruct the United States’ enforcement of federal immigration law.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/justice-department-california-sanctuary-cities.html?mtrref=news.url.google.com&amp;gwh=A2D3F7256D04E8139B5CD2F368A87085&amp;gwt=pay "Trump Administration Sues California Over Immigration Laws"] ''New York Times'', March 6, 2018.

The Trump administration previously released a list of immigration principles to Congress.

States and cities have shown varying responses to the executive order. Thirty-three states&amp;nbsp;introduced or enacted legislation requiring local law enforcement to cooperate with [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]]&amp;nbsp;officers&amp;nbsp;and requests to hold&amp;nbsp;non-citizen&amp;nbsp;inmates for deportation.

===Political action===
====State====
[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] banned "sanctuary cities" in 2010, and in 2016 went further by requiring local governments, in order to obtain state funding, to certify that they cooperate with federal immigration officials.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Redmon, [http://www.ajc.com/news/are-there-sanctuary-cities-georgia/HzM8WYxMI2Ckx8FXmdKbEO/ Are there Sanctuary Cities in Georgia?], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' (February 2, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona]], through [[SB 1070]] (enacted in 2010), requires law enforcement officers to notify federal immigration authorities "if they develop reasonable suspicion that a person they’ve detained or arrested is in the country illegally."&lt;ref name="Steller"/&gt;

[[Tennessee]] state law bars "local governments or officials from making policies that stop local entities from complying with federal immigration law."&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;Ariana Maia Sawyer, [http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/08/lawmaker-introduces-tennessee-sanctuary-city-ban/97166104/ Lawmaker introduces Tennessee 'sanctuary city' ban], ''USA Today'' Network (February 8, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, legislation proposed in the [[Tennessee General Assembly]] would go further, withholding funding from local governments deemed insufficiently cooperative with the federal government.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"/&gt;

The [[California]] state senate passed a bill that would largely prohibit local law enforcement agencies from using their money, equipment or personnel to aid federal government action against illegal immigrants.

[[Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g)|Section 287(g)]] makes it possible for state and local law enforcement personnel to enter into agreements with the federal government to be trained in immigration enforcement and, subsequent to such training, to enforce immigration law.

'''Jurisdiction'''

Whether federal or local government has jurisdiction to detain and deport undocumented immigrants is a tricky and unsettled issue, because the [[U.S. Constitution]] does not provide a clear answer. Both federal and local government offer arguments to defend their authority. The issue of jurisdiction has been vigorously debated dating back to the Alien Act of&amp;nbsp;1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=Daniel|date=|title=FEDERALISM ON ICE: STATE AND LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW|url=|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|volume=29|pages=1068|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of local level policing tend to use the [[Naturalization Clause]] and the Migration clause in the Constitution as textual confirmation of federal power. Because the  [[Supremacy Clause]] is generally interpreted to mean that federal law takes priority over state law, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the majority of cases has ruled in favor of the federal government. Certain states have been affected by illegal immigration more than others and have attempted to pass legislation that limits access by undocumented immigrants to public benefits. A notable case was Arizona's SB [[Arizona SB 1070|1070]] law, which was passed in 2010 and struck down in 2012 by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riverstone-Newell|first=Lori|date=|title=The Diffusion of Local Bill of Rights Resolutions to the States|url=|journal=Sage|volume=41|pages=14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States like Arizona, Texas and Nevada justify their aggressive actions as a result of insufficient efforts by the federal government to address issues like use of schools and hospitals by illegal immigrants and changes to the cultural landscape—impacts that are most visible on a local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fandl|first=Kevin|date=|title=Putting States Out of the Immigration Law Enforcement Business|url=|journal=Harvard Law &amp; Policy Review|volume=9|pages=531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambiguity and confusion over jurisdiction is one of the reasons why local and state policies for and against sanctuary cities vary widely depending on location in the country.

=== Effects ===

==== Crime ====
A 2017 review study of the existing literature noted that the existing studies had found that sanctuary cities either have no impact on crime or that they lower the crime rate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A second 2017 study in the journal ''[[Urban Affairs Review]]'' found that sanctuary policy itself has no statistically meaningful effect on crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Benjamin|last2=Collingwood|first2=Loren|last3=El-Khatib|first3=Stephen Omar|date=2017-05-07|title=The Politics of Refuge: Sanctuary Cities, Crime, and Undocumented Immigration|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1078087417704974|journal=Urban Affairs Review|language=en|pages=1078087417704974|doi=10.1177/1078087417704974|issn=1078-0874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loren Collingwood, Benjamin Gonzalez-O'Brien &amp; Stephen El-Khatib Oct"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jan/31/joe-defelice/phillys-sanctuary-city-status-putting-residents-da/|title=Is Philly’s sanctuary city status putting residents in danger?|work=@politifact|access-date=2017-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2017/02/no-evidence-sanctuary-cities-breed-crime/|title=No Evidence Sanctuary Cities 'Breed Crime' - FactCheck.org|date=2017-02-10|work=FactCheck.org|access-date=2017-04-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/02/08/trumps-claim-that-sanctuary-cities-breed-crime/|title=Trump’s claim that sanctuary cities ‘breed crime’|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the study were misinterpreted by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] in a July 2017 speech when he claimed that the study showed that sanctuary cities were more prone to crime than cities without sanctuary policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/14/jeff-sessions-used-our-research-to-claim-that-sanctuary-cities-have-more-crime-hes-wrong/|title=Analysis {{!}} Jeff Sessions used our research to claim that sanctuary cities have more crime.

According to a study by Tom K. Wong, associate professor of political science at the [[University of California, San Diego]], published by the [[Center for American Progress]], a progressive [[think tank]]: "Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties. Moreover, economies are stronger in sanctuary counties – from higher median household income, less poverty, and less reliance on public assistance to higher labor force participation, higher employment-to-population ratios, and lower unemployment."&lt;ref name="Wong"/&gt; The study also concluded that sanctuary cities build trust between local law enforcement and the community, which enhances public safety overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.citylab.com/crime/2017/01/sanctuary-cities-are-safer-and-more-productive/514508/|title=Crime and Poverty Are Lower in Sanctuary Cities|work=CityLab|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study evaluated sanctuary and non-sanctuary cities while [[Controlling for a variable|controlling]] for differences in population, the foreign-born percentage of the population, and the percentage of the population that is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]."&lt;ref name="Wong"/&gt;

==== Economy ====
Advocates of local enforcement of immigration laws argue that more regulatory local immigration policies would cause immigrants to flee those cities and possibly the United States altogether,&lt;ref name="EbscoHost"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kobach|first1=Kris W.|title=ATTRITION THROUGH ENFORCEMENT: A RATIONAL APPROACH TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION|journal=Tulsa Journal of Comparative &amp; International Law|date=April 2008|volume=15|pages=155–163|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=11&amp;sid=41e965f7-5b37-4c56-a698-2a95fbecbe2b%40sessionmgr4007&amp;hid=4202&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#AN=edslex105E624E&amp;db=edslex|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while opponents argue that regulatory policies on immigrants wouldn't affect their presence because immigrants looking for work will relocate towards economic opportunity despite challenges living there.&lt;ref name="Pham"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pham|first1=Huyen|last2=Van|first2=Pham Hoang|title=THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LOCAL IMMIGRATION REGULATION: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS|journal=Cardozo Law Review|date=November 2012|volume=32|pages=485–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undocumented migrants tend to be attracted to states with more economic opportunity and individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nair-Reichert|first1=U.|title=Location decisions of undocumented migrants in the United States|journal=Journal of Regional Analysis and Policy|date=2015|volume=44|issue=2|pages=157–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because there is no reliable data that asks for immigration status, there is no way to tell empirically if regulatory policies do have an effect on immigrant presence. A study comparing restrictive counties with nonrestrictive counties found that local jurisdictions that enacted regulatory immigration policies experienced a 1–2% negative effect in employment.&lt;ref name="Pham" /&gt;

==== Health and well-being ====
A preliminary study's results imply that the number of Sanctuary cities in the U.S. positively affects well-being in the undocumented immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cebula|first1=Richard J.|title=Give me sanctuary!

=== Laws and policies by state and city ===

==== Alabama ====
* In Alabama, state law ([[Alabama HB 56]]) was enacted in 2011, calling for proactive immigration enforcement; however, many provisions are either blocked by the federal courts or subject to ongoing lawsuits.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} On January 31, 2017, [[William A. Bell]], the mayor of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], declared the city a "welcoming city" and said that the police would not be "an enforcement arm of the federal government" with respect to federal immigration law. He also stated that the city would not require proof of citizenship for granting business licenses. The Birmingham City Council subsequently passed a resolution supporting Birmingham being a "sanctuary city".&lt;ref name="BRM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbrc.com/story/34390802/birmingham-city-council-passes-sanctuary-city-resolution|title=Birmingham City Council passes sanctuary city resolution|first=Mia|last=Watkins|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arizona ====
* Following the passage of [[Arizona SB 1070]], a state law, few if any cities in Arizona are "sanctuary cities."  A provision of SB 1070 requires local authorities to "contact federal immigration authorities if they develop [[reasonable suspicion]] that a person they've detained or arrested is in the country illegally."&lt;ref name="Steller"&gt;Tim Steller, [http://tucson.com/news/local/columnists/steller/steller-tucson-a-sanctuary-city-not-so-fast/article_e06cda4e-70f9-56a2-9e86-5b62de2a0933.html Tucson a 'sanctuary city'? Not so fast], ''Arizona Daily Star'' (February 23, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Immigration Studies]], which advocates restrictive immigration policies, labels only one city in the state, [[South Tucson, Arizona|South Tucson]], a "sanctuary city"; the label is because South Tucson does not honor ICE detainers "unless ICE pays for cost of detention".&lt;ref name="Steller" /&gt;

====California====
* According to the [[National Immigration Law Center]], about a dozen California cities have some formal sanctuary policy, and none of the [[List of counties in California|58 California counties]] "complies with detainer requests by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]."&lt;ref name="CarcamoMatherSmith"&gt;Cindy Carcamo, Kate Mather &amp; Dakota Smith, [http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-sanctuary-cities-20161114-story.html Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration leaves a lot unanswered for sanctuary cities like L.A.], ''Los Angeles Times'' (November 15, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Denver]] does not identify as a sanctuary city. The ''Denver Post'' reports: "The city doesn't have an ordinance staking out a claim or barring information-sharing with federal officials about a person's immigration status, unlike some cities.

Said ordinance also prohibits that police from detaining individuals based solely on their immigration status or inquiring as to their immigration status.

====Maine====
* A 2004 executive order prohibited state officials from inquiring about immigration status of individual seeking public assistance, but in 2011, the incoming Maine governor [[Paul LePage]] rescinded this, stating “it is the intent of this administration to promote rather than hinder the enforcement of federal immigration law”. In 2015 Governor LePage accused the city of [[Portland, Maine]] of being a sanctuary city based on the fact that “city employees are prohibited from asking about the immigration status of people seeking city services unless compelled by a court or law”,&lt;ref name=billings&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/2015/09/15/despite-lepages-remark-sanctuary-city-label-doesnt-fit-portland/ Despite LePage remark, 'sanctuary city' label doesn’t fit Portland, officials say], Randy Billings, September 15, 2015, ''Portland Press Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; but Portland city officials did not accept that characterization.&lt;ref name=billings/&gt;

====Maryland====
* In 2008, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]] are sometimes identified as sanctuary cities.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Schwartzman, [http://www.gazette.net/stories/031908/silvnew202316_32355.shtml Legislation would ban Takoma Park sanctuary policies], Capital News Service (March 19, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; However, "[m]ost local governments in Maryland – including Baltimore – still share information with the federal government."&lt;ref&gt;John Fritze, [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-baltimore-sanctuary-20150723-story.html House passes 'sanctuary city' bill, reigniting immigration debate], ''Baltimore Sun'' (July 23, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Baltimore Mayor [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]] said that she did not consider Baltimore to be a "sanctuary city."&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Wenger, [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/politics/bs-md-ci-welcoming-city-20161117-story.html Mayor: Baltimore is a 'welcoming city' for immigrants and refugees], ''Baltimore Sun'' (November 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Massachusetts====
* [[Boston]] has an ordinance, enacted in 2014, that bars the [[Boston Police Department]] "from detaining anyone based on their immigration status unless they have a criminal warrant."&lt;ref name="Clauss"&gt;Kyle Scott Clauss, [http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2016/11/15/boston-sanctuary-city-trust-act/ Boston Already Has Some Sanctuary City Protections: Thanks to the 2014 Trust Act, police can’t detain someone based on their immigration status], ''Boston Magazine'' (November 15, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]],  [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] have similar legislation.&lt;ref name="Clauss" /&gt; In August 2016, Boston Police Commissioner, [[William B. Evans]] re-issued a memo stating “all prisoners who are subject to ICE Detainers must receive equal access to [[Bail in the United States|bail commissioners]], which includes notifying said prisoner of his or her right to seek bail.” Bail commissioners are informed of the person’s status on an ICE detainer list and may set bail accordingly.&lt;ref name="BH1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2017/01/cops_increasingly_denying_requests_to_hold_illegals|title=Cops increasingly denying requests to hold illegals|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Michigan====
* [[Detroit]] and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] are sometimes referred to as "sanctuary cities" because they "have anti-profiling ordinances that generally prohibit local police from asking about the immigration status of people who are not suspected of any crime."&lt;ref name="Oosting"&gt;Jonathan Oosting, [http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/09/immigrant_advocates_blast_bill.html Push to ban 'sanctuary cities' in Michigan faces criticism from immigrant advocates], MLive (September 30, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike San Francisco's ordinance, however, the Detroit and Ann Arbor policies do not bar local authorities from cooperating and assisting [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]], and both cities frequently do so.
*[[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] re-affirmed its status as a sanctuary city in 2017. Vice Mayor Don Cooney stated, "We care about you. We will protect you. We are with you."
*[[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] voted to become a sanctuary city in April 2017, but reversed the decision a week later due to public and business opposition. An order by mayor [[Virg Bernero]] still prohibits Lansing police officers from asking residents about their immigration status, however. &lt;ref&gt;Lauren Gibbons, {{cite news |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/04/lansing_no_longer_a_sanctuary.html|title=Lansing no longer a sanctuary city|}}, MLive (April 12, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minnesota====
* [[Minneapolis]] has an ordinance, adopted in 2003,&lt;ref name="Hirsi"&gt;Ibrahim Hirsi, [https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2016/11/what-conflict-over-sanctuary-cities-could-mean-twin-cities What the conflict over 'sanctuary cities'could mean for the Twin Cities], ''[[Minn Post]]'' (November 23, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; that directs local law enforcement officers "not to 'take any law enforcement action' for the sole purpose of finding undocumented immigrants, or ask an individual about his or her immigration status."&lt;ref&gt;Mike Mullen, [http://www.citypages.com/news/betsy-hodges-minneapolis-will-remain-a-sanctuary-city-despite-trump-threats/401121615 Betsy Hodges: Minneapolis will remain a 'sanctuary city,' despite Trump threats], ''City Pages'' (November 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The Minneapolis ordinance does not bar cooperation with federal authorities: "The city works cooperatively with the Homeland Security, as it does with all state and federal agencies, but the city does not operate its programs for the purpose of enforcing federal immigration laws. The Homeland Security has the legal authority to enforce immigration laws in the United States, in Minnesota and in the city."&lt;ref name="Hirsi" /&gt;

====New York====
* [[Albany, New York|Albany]] - Mayor [[Kathy Sheehan]] stated that the city complies with federal law and cooperates with ICE, but she asserted that comments by national government officials show a failure "to understand what is happening in our cities and why a city like Albany would choose to label itself as a sanctuary city."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-justice-department-is-stepping-up-pressure-on-sanctuary-cities-heres-how-mayors-are-responding "The Justice Department is stepping up pressure on ‘sanctuary cities.’ Here’s how mayors are responding"] PBS Newshour, January 24, 2018.

A bill, under consideration as of March 2017, is entitled Citizens Protection Act of 2017 or HB 63.  Under the new provisions, the state would be able to deny bail to undocumented immigrants for whom Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) has issued a detainer; allow the state to withhold tax revenues from cities who are not in compliance with the statewide immigration regulations; and encourage tipsters to identify municipalities which violate these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/news/nc-house-committee-advances-anti-immigrant-measure|title=N.C.

While [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] is not a sanctuary city, it adopted an "Access to City Services without Fear" policy for residents that are undocumented or have an uncertain immigration status in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Gavin|title=Vancouver approves 'Access Without Fear' policy for undocumented immigrants|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-approves-access-without-fear-policy-for-undocumented-immigrants-1.3523962|accessdate=February 13, 2017|work=CBC News|date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy does not apply to municipal services operated by individual boards, including services provided by the [[Vancouver Police Department]], [[Vancouver Public Library]], or [[Vancouver Park Board]].&lt;ref name="tc refugees feb 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsay|first1=Bethany|last2=Eagland|first2=Nick|title=Fearing U.S. crackdown, refugees run to B.C.|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/fearing-u-s-crackdown-refugees-run-to-b-c-1.9824653|accessdate=February 13, 2017|work=Times Colonist|date=February 11, 2017|location=Victoria, BC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|February 2017}}, the cities of [[Calgary]], [[Ottawa]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatoon]], and [[Winnipeg]] are considering motions to declare themselves sanctuary cities.&lt;ref name="tc refugees feb 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pike|first1=Helen|title=Nenshi looking for more information on implications of becoming a 'sanctuary city'|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2017/02/28/nenshi-not-pitching-calgary-sanctuary-city-without-more-info.html|accessdate=March 30, 2017|work=Metro Calgary|date=February 28, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|9|9|df=US}}, [[Edmonton]] adopted "Access Without Fear" policy for undocumented and vulnerable residents.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], sanctuary cities provide services – such as housing, education, and cultural integration – to [[asylum seekers]] (i.e. persons fleeing one country and seeking protection in another).&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; The movement began in [[Sheffield]] in the north of [[England]] in 2005. It was motivated by a national policy adopted in 1999 to disperse asylum seekers to different towns and cities in the UK.  

===Sheffield===

In 2009, the city council of [[Sheffield, UK]] drew up a manifesto outlining key areas of concern and 100 supporting organizations signed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/urban-displacement/darling-barnet-eldridge.pdf|title=John Darling, Craig Barnett, Sarah Eldridge "City of Sanctuary – a UK initiative for hospitality", Forced Migration Review, 9 October 2016|author=|date=|website=FMReview.org|access-date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A city's status as a place of sanctuary is not necessarily a formal governmental designation.  The organization [[City of Sanctuary (UK)|City of Sanctuary]] encourages local grassroots groups throughout the UK and Ireland to build a culture of hospitality towards asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cityofsanctuary.org/about/|title=About City of Sanctuary|publisher=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glasgow===
[[Glasgow]] is a noted sanctuary city in [[Scotland]].  In 2000 the city council accepted their first asylum seekers relocated by the [[Home Office]]. The Home Office provided funding to support asylum seekers but would also forcibly deport them ("removal seizures") if it was determined they could not stay in the UK. As of 2010 Glasgow had accepted 22,000 asylum seekers from 75 different nations. In 2007, local residents upset by the human impact of removal seizures, organized watches to warn asylum seekers when Home Office vans were in the neighborhood. They also organized protests and vigils which led to the ending of the removal seizures.&lt;ref name="eveningtimes.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adamtomforrest.com"/&gt;

'''Swedish Master Series''' (''Swedish Master-serien'' or ''Mästar-serien'') is a set of [[hockey cards]] produced by a Swedish company between 1969 and 1971. At least two sets were produced and distributed in Europe. The first set was for the 1969-70 hockey season and the second set was for the 1970-71 season. Both sets included players from Swedish teams and national teams from other countries. [[Ken Dryden]] was featured in both sets prior to his debut in the [[National Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cgi.ebay.com/1970-Swedish-Masterserien-26-Ken-Dryden-Canada_W0QQitemZ110445710030QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUS_Hockey_Trading_Cards?hash=item19b713cace&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thacker, Spink &amp; Co.''''' was a well-known [[Kolkata]] publishing company. ''Thacker's Bengal Directory'' was published from 1864 to 1884 and covered the [[Bengal Presidency]] – which included the present day [[Myanmar]] and [[Bangladesh]]. From 1885 the ''Directory'' covered the whole of [[British India]] and was renamed '''''Thacker's Indian Directory'''''.  It was later owned by [[Kameshwar Singh|Maharaja of Darbhanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendices|date=1982|publisher=India. Second Press Commissior Controller of Publications|pages=266, 343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBwuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=darbhanga+Thacker+Spink&amp;dq=darbhanga+Thacker+Spink&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ul0sU5_BH46zrgfjsoCYBw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It continued to be published until 1960.

The directory was essentially an [[almanac]] which listed British and Foreign Merchants and Manufacturers, Commercial Industries, Army, railway and government departments and office holders, European residents, and separately, prominent non-European residents.   Earlier editions of ''Thacker'' had street directories of major cities, such as Kolkata and [[Yangon]], together with the name of the residents of each house.

Similar directories published included:
*''Thacker's Bombay Directory'', city and island (together with a directory of the chief industries of Bombay, etc.);
*Thacker's medical directory of India, Burma and Ceylon;
*''Thacker's Directory of the Chief Industries of India, Burma and Ceylon''.

'''''The Penguin Guide to Jazz''''' is a [[reference work]] containing an [[encyclopedic]] directory of  [[jazz]] recordings on [[compact disc|CD]] which are currently available in Europe or the United States. The first nine editions were compiled by [[Richard Cook (journalist)|Richard Cook]] and [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]], two well known chroniclers of jazz resident in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
The first edition was published in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by [[Penguin Books]] in 1992. Every two years since then, through 2010, a new edition has been published with updated entries. The eighth and ninth editions, published in 2006 and 2008, respectively, each include 2,000 new CD listings.

The title has taken different forms over the lifetime of the work, as audio technology has changed. The seventh edition was known as ''The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD'' while subsequent editions are titled ''The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings.'' The earliest edition had the title ''The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, LP and Cassette''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Penguin guide to jazz on CD, LP and cassette : a comprehensive, critical guide to recorded jazz : from its beginnings until the present | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/penguin-guide-to-jazz-on-cd-lp-and-cassette-a-comprehensive-critical-guide-to-recorded-jazz-from-its-beginnings-until-the-present/oclc/243780266?referer=di&amp;ht=edition | work=[[WorldCat]] | accessdate=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Cook died in 2007, prior to the completion of the 9th edition (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Morton | first=Brian | title=Richard Cook | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/richard-cook-401071.html | newspaper=[[The Independent]] | date=2007-09-01 | accessdate=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theherald"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Kerr | first=Alison | title=

== Content ==
In the first nine editions, artists are listed alphabetically and the entries begin with short (usually one paragraph) [[biographies]] before a comprehensive listing of a musicians' available [[discography|recordings]]. Each disc is given a rating of up to four stars and details of its label and catalogue number, musicians featured on the disc, month and year of the recording or the span of time in which the tracks were recorded and finally a review of varying length. Often a number of discs are reviewed together.

Two extra features, author's picks (crowns) and "core collections", have been added to succeeding editions. The first shows entries flagged as personal favorites while the latter are the "more essential" albums for a jazz CD collection. John Eyles comments in a review that "the implication is that the choices for crowns are subjective, while the Core Collection is somehow more objective," when in fact both lists are decided upon by the same two editors.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=23610|title=The Penguin Guide To Jazz Recordings, 8th Edition|author=John Eyles|accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bootlegs and limited-edition [[Mosaic Records]] releases are excluded. Various-artists compilations were reviewed in the first edition but were dropped in later editions. Due to the increasing numbers of CDs on the market, space limitations and depth of coverage have increasingly become an issue: in the 7th edition, for instance, the index was dropped to save space, but it was restored in the 8th edition (but a number of entries were dropped or shortened to make room for it).

In the tenth edition, titled ''The Penguin Jazz Guide'' (2010), Morton revised his and Cook's entries from previous editions, and pared down the content to 1001 reviews of what Morton had selected as the best jazz recordings.&lt;ref name="penguin2010" /&gt; Morton also presented the reviews in chronological order by recording dates, rather than alphabetically by artist, and included historical context for the recordings as well as biographical details.&lt;ref name="theherald" /&gt; The tenth edition also dispensed with the starred rating system, the Core Collection, and Crown accolades.&lt;ref name="10th ed"&gt;{{cite book|last = Morton|first = Brian|authorlink = Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|author2=Richard Cook |authorlink2=Richard Cook (journalist) |title = The Penguin Jazz Guide: The History of the Music in the 1001 Best Albums |origyear = 1992|edition = 10th | series = The Penguin Guide to Jazz|year = 2010|publisher = Penguin|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-14-104831-4|pages = xxix-xxx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Though the first nine editions did not "spring any great surprises," the book "has a tried and trusted formula that works". It is also praised as being "of equal value to both experienced jazz listeners and novices."&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; Alison Kerr, reviewing the 2010 ''Penguin Jazz Guide'' in ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', noted the lack of an index as a hindrance, but cited the chronological format as one of the book's strengths.&lt;ref name="theherald" /&gt;  Kerr also noted the subjective nature of Morton's selection of the best jazz albums.&lt;ref name="theherald" /&gt;

The '''''Tongdian''''' ({{zh|c=通典|w='''T'ung-tien'''|l=Comprehensive Institutions}}) is a Chinese institutional history and encyclopedia text. It covers a panoply of topics from high antiquity through the year 756, whereas a quarter of the book focuses on the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The book was written by [[Du You]] from 766 to 801. It contains 200 volumes and about 1.7 million words, and is at times regarded as the most representative contemporary texts of the Tang Dynasty. Du You also incorporated many materials from other sources, including a book written by his nephew, [[Du Huan]], who was taken captive in the famous battle at the [[Battle of Talas|Talas River]] between Tang and the Arabs in 751 and did not return to [[China]] until ten years later. It became a model for works by scholar [[Zheng Qiao]] and [[Ma Duanlin]] centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Xiuping et al., ''100 Books That Influenced China'', p.232-237&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert G. Hoyland]] relates that the ''Tongdian'' 's first draft was a "history of human institutions from earliest times down to the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]]", and was subsequently revised as matters continued to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyland, ''Seeing Islam as Others Saw It'', p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates parts of the ''[[Zhengdian (book)|Zhengdian]]'' of [[Liu Zhi (historian)|Liu Zhi]] and the ''Great Tang Ritual Regulations of the Kaiyuan Era'' compiled by Xiao Song, and others in 732.&lt;ref&gt;Twitchett, ''Official History under the T'ang'', 104-7&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tongdian'' was never included in the canon of the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]].'' It was however quoted extensively in several books which were, starting with the ''[[Old Book of Tang]].''
